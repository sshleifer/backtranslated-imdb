It is true that there are many films much worse than this movie. This movie was not Hands: Fate's Hands or Troll 2 (yes, I have seen them both times), but at the same time this movie is No Alien, Predator or even Alien Vs. Predator (yes, even that movie exceeded this) . Movies like this make Battlefield Earth look like a galaxy war, it's so bad. Razzie awards prizes to the observation post, his biggest competition has just arrived in theaters. This movie I'm talking about is, of course, Alone in the Dark. I will try to take you through a step-by-step process about why this movie was so bad. <br /> <br /> Acting. First I will start with what was perhaps the best component of this film (next to The Final Credits, which played in 'Wish I Have An Angel', the performance.) Christian Slater must be proud of himself, he proved that it is possible Acting decently in a movie worse than drinking antifreeze ... Talking, it made me wonder why he had not left the stage halfway, maybe it was because Stephen Dorff was also in the movie (someone he wants to be able to but not Tara Reid is a bad actress, but good looks and that's all that really matters in movies like this ... That does not mean the performance was perfect, it was normal, not good, and maybe the only thing in the movie is not it's good. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack, except for "I wish I had an angel", the soundtrack does not make sense and the heavy and bad medal is pumped into the ears of the spectators, maybe disguise the terrible story (something that I'll be arriving soon.) A long and very expensive 2 CD soundtrack is now on sale for people with music disabilities. <br /> <br /> The Directing- Directed by Hollywood's favorite director, Uwe Ball, who brought us the classic House of the Dead. Saying "Yes, movies can be very bad and that's just the beginning of my mortal saga of horrible movies." At least it is said to be run by Uwe Ball. Unbeknownst to me, I would have guessed that a monkey was kidnapped from the Congo, brought here and forced to make judgments on how to make the film under pain of being in shock. The director of photography was probably a camcorder recorded on a skateboard and pushed forward until he came across a wall. In scenes where the camera must remain motionless, it constantly moves, it does not allow us to stop anywhere and when it should move in action, the camera stops for some reason. <br /> <br /> The producer - Who on earth Is he stupid enough to put money towards this bomb? I feel sorry for the fool ... sometimes. Sometimes I am glad that the person has been taught a lesson so that they do not spend money on garbage worse than dog manure tied in a bag. <br /> <br /> The Writing / Storyboarding- Trying to analyze the story is more painful then place a picket of ice under a big toe and kick a soccer ball as hard as you can with it right after, but I will still try. <br /> <br /> Edward Carnby escapes like a child from an orphanage where 20 Children where to go under scientific experiments. He escapes and hides in a socket where he is electrocuted (this is the point where he got so bad that I started to laugh out loud). Then he advances quickly many years later, where he is a detective of paranoia. He is attacked by a zombie that can not be killed by shots, kills him and remains alive. Later, he is attacked by a crazy-looking monster and discovers secrets that no one else knows. <br /> <br /> Yes, the plot is bad, really very bad. The film begins with the expectation that we read about 10 minutes, which feels like 100, of random text about a fake civilization called Abskani. The film does not have to turn one turn after another, more than the audience can handle, more than the audience wants to handle, more than the audience could worry about. This story is as bad as the rock that even Double Dragon does better. <br /> <br /> In general, lose this movie. I gave it a 1 out of 10, but that's because there is not 0.
