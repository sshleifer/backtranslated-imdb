'Succubus', the edited version of 'Necronomicon Geträumte Sünden', is a struggle to sit down, even in a meager 76 minutes; Once again this tremendous and boring Euro horror tripe and may have fallen into a coma. <br /> <br /> Jess Franco once again delivers a really horrible piece of garbage from the 60s that seems to have been made by a plaster and crew out of their heads in Class A hallucinogens, since not even a second of This mess makes no sense. Apparently, this is one of the best of its more than 180 films. It is hard to believe that there are worse efforts. <br /> <br /> The unfathomable plot deals with Franco's usual themes of sex, violence and lesbianism and presents a bit of S & M to a large extent, and still manages to do so. To remain enthusiastic and tedious. <br /> <br /> Can I leave it for a long time before entering the Euro Horror world? Life is too short to spend seeing the bilge this way.
