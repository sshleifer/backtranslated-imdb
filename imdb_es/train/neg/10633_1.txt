I saw this video at a friend's house. I'm glad I did not lose money buying this one. The cover of the video has a scene from the 1975 film Capricorn One. The film begins with several clips of rocket explosions, most not related to manned flight. Sibrel's smoking gun is a short video of astronauts preparing a video broadcast. Edit in your own voice-over instead of letting us hear what the crew had to say. The video ends curiously with a screening of the Zapruder movie. His claims about radiation, armor, star photography and others lead me to believe that he is extremely ignorant or that he has some kind of ax against NASA, astronauts or Americans in general. His science is bad, and so is this video.
