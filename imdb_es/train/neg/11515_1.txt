and forget this. Completely. If you really need to see Madonna acting, rent "Body of Evidence", at least Willem Defoe is in that. <br /> <br /> In this movie, while the sets are beautiful, you may want to mute the dialogue. . You will not lose anything. Bruce Greenwood is wasted, Jeanne Tripplehorn is a pillar, and Madonna is so horrible that it becomes fun. Why they had to cut the original movie in this mess, I'll never know; I guess they thought it was "fundable". Madonna, as an actress, certainly NO. <br /> <br /> If you rent the original 1979 movie, however, you will enjoy it and the actors will be able to act. 1/10.
