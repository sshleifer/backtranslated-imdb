Deep Shock is presented as a television movie: a whole cast of commercial quality actors, a creature badly designed to be the "bad boy" and a script that is more full of jargon and technical and political importance than what he knows how to do . With. <br /> <br /> I checked the movie because of the creature (I love seeing what the filmmakers have in mind for their designs in these cheap videos), and from the start I was disappointed because the creature in the box It was not the one in the movie. The actors I expected for the kind of movie that is (really quite generic and not thought beyond a certain point). The music was a symphonic music of typical action, not thought. <br /> <br /> I liked the design of the computers and the technical equipment, together with the mini-sub design. The film even flowed very well, with guide screens that let you know in which scenario you are watching the story unfold. But, anyway, there is not much history here. <br /> <br /> This movie has a score of 3/10 stars from the IMO. The boring search and the mission to destroy the North Pole and these creatures that protect it ... a little lame. Even licking is the love relationship marked between two of the characters that you do not see coming. Declare this as a movie that tries to get the careers of the bank actors and put them in a video. Do not bother yourself
