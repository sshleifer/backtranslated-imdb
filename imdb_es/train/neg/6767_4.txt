I can sit through this movie once, but I doubt I can do it a second time. A little entertaining mainly because of the physical presence of Lindsay Lohan. The fun of Matt Dillon (think of Something about Mary) and the resurgence of a more serious actor, Micheal Keaton. This is not the fun of The Love Bug, but you can see it. One of my main drawbacks to the film was the fact that Herbie had evolved into R2D2 antics for the most part. I was bored with the effects of the eyes of the headlights the second time of the 30 or more times they were used and the folded front fender caused the same reaction on my part. Go see this with your little ones, that is, the children of the "single digits bracket" and do not expect much from this movie. <br /> <br /> _X
