This show is amazing in that. . . What it represents and what it focuses on and. . . Words can not describe how crazy ET is. They will report anything. If a celebrity is connected remotely and indirectly to the story, ET will report on it. If a dog poop in Tom Cruise's yard will inform about it. If a celebrity dies. . . They will talk about it for weeks to the point where the public envies that celebrity. If a celebrity is in court. . . ET will report it by MONTHS in the extreme. There is no end to what this program will inform and there is no time frame that dictates how long you will focus on a story. Is it considered legitimate to inform? The reports are very annoying too, with agitated voices and end with an unnecessary pause to convey a sense of importance. I can not see this show without questioning the existence of humanity. ET is one of the big reasons why I avoid night shows in general. I regret that IMDb only allows a minimum of one star rating and not zero or even negative ones. For this show they deserve -10 stars.
