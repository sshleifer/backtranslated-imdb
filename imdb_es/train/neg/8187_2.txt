I entered this movie hoping it was really horrible. And went. I really felt sorry for the cast full of stars, Kathy Bates was a wonderful actress ... before making this movie, Vince Vaughn and Paul Giamatti were disappointing as always, but Miranda Richardson could not do one of the fabulous performances I know. and I love her for her. Fred's father, played by Trevor Peacock (of Vicar of Dibley fame, among others), had approximately one line. <br /> <br /> The plot was predictable and everywhere, and the humor lacked ... (However, there was a part of the movie in which Santa enters the home of a Jewish family ... that made me laugh just because their expressions were classic) Do not watch this movie unless your only alternative is to have a front face. collision with a train (actually, maybe the train is better ...)
