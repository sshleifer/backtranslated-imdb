This is just horrible, really horrible crap. Yes, we have beautiful naked women dancing and having sex. But if this can work in the mechanism of a porn movie? Can it have even been a hit like a porn movie? This is about masquerading as a "movie" with real things to say, with real emotion and struggle. It's not. It's an excuse to strip some girls and have fun. I'm sure all of these women (and men) in this particular movie could have behaved decently in the porn business of the 70s. . but not in the movie business. <br /> <br /> The performance was trite, so bad, I mean really terrible. The writing was even worse. Can not I blame all these actors? They had nothing to work with. The very broad structure or plot of the film could possibly be made with good writers and competent actors. The very broad structure or plot is that of a psychotic man who spends his time shooting people from afar, like a sniper. These shootings were motivated by men who did not respect their women enough. If there were more writing, better writing, better writing and less free sex images, we could have something to work with. <br /> <br /> This movie should have been filmed, made and marketed a hardcore porn movie all the time. ; I would have earned more money. It's practically a hardcore porn movie, and it's still the only non-porn movie I've seen that shows an erect male penis.
