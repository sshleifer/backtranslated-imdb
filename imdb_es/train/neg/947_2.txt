As someone who lived and still vividly remembers that decade, if the 70 reais had been half as funny and (semi) normal, they would have been much more enjoyable. The real children of that time did not act or behave in a similar way as bright and normal as these children did. The youth of the country was still under the influence of the hippies and the culture of drugs, all the rebellion of the 60s that it generated, especially in the behavioral department: petulance, presumption, ego -rightness, childhood, the unreasonableness of them - none of the characters exhibits any of that. <br /> <br /> Someone compared with "Happy Days", and I can see why: both were situation comedies that take place 20 Years before the current time they were broadcast, and both offer only representations of the time , cliché of the current times, not even close to the full scope of it, simply showing the obvious things: fashions, toys, music, gadgets, etc. and that's it. For those too young to remember, or were not born then, trust me, the '70s were not like that, more than "Happy Days" they were like the real 50s, since "M * A * S * H ​​*" accurately described life in a medical base in the US Army. UU Korean War, etc.
