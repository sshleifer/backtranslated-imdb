Fortunately, I saw it for free, and I wish it were better than it was, but in reality they are the same old things that film studios seem to impose on us in the last ten years. <br /> <br /> Ben Stiller and Jennifer Anniston play a couple who are opposite and yet are attracted to each other. <br /> <br /> If that plot does not surprise you and excites you, the film will not either. <Br /> <br /> Lots of visual gags and fart jokes. Halfway through the movie, I started to realize that Ben Stiller really is not that funny, but he tries hard. And Jennifer Anniston really is not that pretty, but her HAIR looks great. And Hank Azaria and Phillip Seymore Hoffman must have been paid a lot of money for being in this kind of average movie, I've come to expect more from them. <br /> <br /> What was interesting was that I saw this after seeing American Splendor, which is a truly fun and original film, and I compared the two in my head, and I found myself wishing that the executives of the film would they were forced to sit in those two films back to back, maybe that would give them some sense and <br /> <br /> they would start to make better films with unknowns instead of these formulas that reproduce better in airplanes.
