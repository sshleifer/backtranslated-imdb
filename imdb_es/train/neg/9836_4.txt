John Scott (John Wayne) and his partner Kansas Charlie (Eddy Chandler) are friends heading to the Rattlesnake Gulch rodeo. Scott is a fairly fair competitor, but he finds that unless he is willing to accept twenty-five cents for the dollar in prizes from a crooked promoter, he will have to collect his winnings at gunpoint. Coincidentally, the bandits Pete (Al Ferguson) and Jim (Paul Fix) decide that they would like the rest of the rodeo; they shoot the promoter Farnsworth (Henry Hall), and make it look like Scott and Kansas Charlie are the killers. <br /> <br /> Wayne and Chandler use a gag in the film where they are about to do it with their fists on various trivialities. Every time Chandler makes a wild swing, Wayne's foot stomps on him and hits him like a fool. <br /> <br /> If you are very attentive, there is a great Lipton's Tea ad in one of the scenes in which Scott's love interests Anne (Mary Kornman) appears. <br /> <br /> Later in the film, the friends are framed once again in a scenario robbery. Changing his heart and seeing the error of his ways, the evil Jim wants to clean himself up and confess to the sheriff, but Pete shoots him. While it is fixed, Jim tells his story to the doctor and his sister Anne. In an incredible scene, Anne gets into the middle of a shootout between the good guys and the villains to face the sheriff. <br /> <br /> "The Path of the Desert" is one of the staunchest westerns of John Wayne of Lone Star. Productions during this era. Notoriously absent are George "Gabby" Hayes and Yakima Canutt, one or both usually seen in these cakes. However, if you are a John Wayne fan, you will have to see it once, but that will probably be enough.
