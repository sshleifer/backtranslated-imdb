There's good There's bad And then there's The Sentinel, a political "thriller" in the background that is among the worst movies I've seen. The plot of a mole in the Secret Service is good, but a film with so much potential has never been massacred so completely. Directed with "enthusiasm" by Clark Johnson, all the actors in this film seem to be working on autopilot. Even the great Michael Douglas looks bored here. I can honestly say that I have NEVER, in all my life, seen another movie with so many dazzling plot holes. The turn is predictable from the start, and the character's motives are so ridiculous that they inspired the laughter of the audience. Avoid this at all costs. This is a catastrophe of a film without redemptive value.
