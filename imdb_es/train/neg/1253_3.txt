I read somewhere that Hollywood should concentrate on remaking bad movies and leaving the classics alone. We can only wait. While this remake was not a total waste, I would still like to have the six dollars to go towards a DVD of the original. A lot of violence and one of the worst endings I've seen. This version does not add anything new. Just reiterate why Hollywood should leave good things alone.
