a boring word. <br /> <br /> the young demi looks good, but she's pregnant (so that's it = D) the movie does not scare at all ... <br /> <br /> the first scenes It seemed a bit horrible, I could make better clouds with my laptop and after the effects. but that was then ... and now it is now. some films do not age well ... this is one of them. <br /> <br /> it's not worth renting or buying them ... getting something better like the exorcist, ... <br /> <br /> next = D <br /> <br /> oh, the part of the drama in the beginning alone and simply suxor = D
