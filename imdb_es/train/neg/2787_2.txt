For the story of the numbers of Kid (Prince), a singer, on the way to becoming a star. Then he falls in love with Apolonia (Appolonia Kotero). But he has to deal with his father who hits his wife (Clarence Williams III!) And his own self-destructive behavior. <br /> <br /> I saw him in a theater in 1984. I was not a big fan of Prince, but I liked the three great songs of this movie: "Purple Rain", "Let's Get Crazy" and "When Doves Cry" " The scenes of the concerts in this movie are great, full of energy and emotion. Unfortunately, that is a VERY small part of the movie. <br /> <br /> The story is pretty obvious and has been done many times before, and much better too. The subplots are, to put them well, poorly managed. The love triangle between The Kid, Appolonia and Morris Day was so predictable and tired that I really felt insulted. His wife and father are necessary for the story, but the scenes are so poorly handled (in acting and directing) that he could not believe it. The script is terrible, terrible dialogue and some "comedy" routines really painful. And there are tons of misogyny here: the mother of The Kid is being beaten; The boy hits Appolonia and (for no reason), Appolonia strips naked and goes topless to swim in a dirty river. Also the characters of Williams and Princes treat women in a horrible way constantly. <br /> <br /> The performance is where this movie REALLY fails. Apollonia is sweet and beautiful, but not an actor. And Prince is (easily) the worst actor I've seen. His face blank and the delivery of wooden dialogues are so bad that he could not believe it. This movie only comes alive during the scenes of the concert, but in reality there are not many. The "dramatic" scenes are so badly performed and managed that they make this film a sitting task. They should have made a concert movie. I give it a 2 - just for the music.
