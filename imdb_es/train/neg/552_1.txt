I sat in almost an episode of this series and I just could not take it anymore. I felt like I had already seen dozens of episodes, and then it hit me ... There's nothing new here! I heard that joke about Seinfeld, I saw someone fall that way about friends, an episode of Happy Days had almost the same story, etc. None of the actors is interesting here either! Some were good at other programs (not here), and others are new to a profession they should never have entered. Avoid this stench!
