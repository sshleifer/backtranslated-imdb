The film starts to go slowly when we get to the cinema, we think it looked pretty good, but after about 5 minutes we went crazy and wondered what kind of movie we had come to see, I do not like this movie. I would not recommend it to anyone, the best part of the night was when the alarm went off and the lights went off because the project broke down because we thought we could all go home. This has to be one of the worst movies I've seen in which we were all bored or in the mind, and most of the people in the movies actually ran out the door at the end because it was nonsense. I'm surprised that nobody left before that. If you go and see it, make sure you stay busy, better yet, do not go see it.
