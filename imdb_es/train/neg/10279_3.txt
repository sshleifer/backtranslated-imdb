This movie was so terrible that it was almost good ... almost. We love musicals, but not this one. Even with the terrible quality of sound, the bad cinematography and many actors who can not sing or dance, Anthony Rapp managed to give a good performance (especially towards the end). The character Marjorie, a drunk lady, was also nice to watch. <br /> <br /> The plot is very unexpected and could have been fun without terrible songs and piano music. Let's face it, some of the (fantastic) songs are pretty catchy (but not in a good way). <br /> <br /> Open House is a fun movie to watch simply because it is horrible! We think it could be a good musical scenario (with excellent actors).
