First I would like to excuse my bad English. <br /> <br /> I'm not a fan of HOSTEL-hardcore, but I liked that movie. Live Feed, however, SUCKED BIG TIME! I have never seen a gore movie with an excellent performance, but hey, who is surprised? The live feed performance was ... well, it's not there! I have seen some comments on this, since it must have been a school project or something like that. Okay, but not by the students in the media or in the acting school. This was not class at all! And what about the story? A really sad scam in the hostel. And what about the gore? What about the scenes of psychopathic torture that are supposed to make your guts twist and leave you sweating cold? That was the most disappointing part of the hole movie! Short, fast and without edge. More like an execution instead of torture. Okay, there where there were buckets of blood, but it did not even seem real. The sacrifice and violence reminded him more of Braindead than of Hostel or any of Saw's movies. And Braindead was fun! Ok, I laughed at Live Feed a couple of times, but it was more disappointment than pure fun! <br /> <br /> So, instead of wasting 80 minutes watching Live Feed, look at EVERYTHING else.
