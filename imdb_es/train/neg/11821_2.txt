Encouraged by the positive comments about this movie here, I was looking forward to seeing this movie. Bad mistake I have seen more than 950 movies and this is really one of the worst of them all. It is horrible in almost every aspect: editing, rhythm, history, 'acting', soundtrack (the only song in the film, a silly country melody, does not play). less than four times). The movie looks cheap and unpleasant and is extremely boring. I have rarely been so happy to see the final credits of a movie. <br /> <br /> The only thing that prevents me from giving him a score of 1 is Harvey Keitel: although this is far from his best performance, at least he seems to be making a small effort. One only for obsessive Keitel.
