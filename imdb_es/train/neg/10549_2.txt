The film industry is a complicated business, because decisions must be made and everyone involved also has a private life. That is the very original thesis of this feeble attempt to make a 'perceptive' movie about the film. And, in fact, there is no better proof of the deceptiveness of the industry than to see Anouk Aim√©e and Maximilian Schell trapped in this madness. The idea is that the talking heads bring out nonsense like "should I make a studio movie that pays a lot or should I do an indie article and be faithful to my artistic self?" "Do the last, please." Or: "our relationship is not only professional, it's also private, it's a very complex situation to handle, is not it?" "Yes, it is, dear." Among the insipid dialogues there are palm trees, hotel lobbies and American movie posters (there are no signs of non-American films on the Croisette). Recurring sleep sessions are inevitable, which makes the 100 minutes of the film look like centuries. Jenny Gabrielle is spectacularly unconvincing to justify her own presence in the frame.
