... at least during its first half. If I had started with the three friends in the navy and concentrated on the naval action scenes, it would have been a much better and stricter movie. The second half of the film is worth it, especially for the action sequences and the close-ups of the ships of the early twentieth century, but it's like a boring toothache getting there. Also, do not watch this movie just because Ginger Rogers is in it. She has an important role, but it is small. <br /> <br /> The film begins by showing three friends from New York City working in the tourist trade and also in good competition by the hand of Sally (Ginger Rogers). , a candy vendor singing along the avenue. The First World War explodes, the three friends seem completely indifferent to the fight, but they enlist in the navy anyway. The one with the least industry as a civilian (Bill Boyd as Baltimore) is the commanding officer of the other two (Robert Armstrong as Dutch and James Gleason as Skeets). To complicate matters further, Sally has fallen in love with one of the three, but she does not have the opportunity to tell him before the three of them go to war. <br /> <br /> The movie is a bit more interesting on board the ship, mainly due to the close plans we have of the ship itself, and also because the chemistry between the three friends is credible. However, James Gleason at the age of 49 looks a bit disoriented to be an expert, especially when the enlistment office sign says you have to be between 17 and 35 years old to be eligible. <br /> <br /> A real one The obvious flaw in the movie that made me believe that everything that was out of the naval scenes was hit with minimal care is the design of the costumes, or, I must say, the lack of the. In the scenes in New York, just before the First World War, everyone is dressed in the fashion of 1931 and all those who drove the 1931 cars; No effort was made to take this film to the period. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, if you see the few scenes with Ginger Rogers in them and the last 45 minutes related to the naval suicide mission, you've seen everything worth seeing here. The rest is stuffed.
