The end of the world is a film without incident, which is strange since it is supposed to be about the total destruction of the earth. The main character is some kind of scientist, I'm not exactly sure what kind. He has two jobs in a government facility (?) Guarded by four security men. His first job is to monitor the transmissions to and from space (although this seems more like a hobby he does when he is not working at work # 2). Work number 2 requires you to put on a protective suit and go to a dark room ... at least that's the best I can imagine. Apparently, the "plant" is not exactly secret, since the scientist takes his wife there. She spends her time (they are on their way to dinner) while he discovers a message from space: the interruption of the Earth, which is repeated again and again. He says something about what is the first message from the space he has been able to decipher; His wife tells him that they will be late for dinner. So they go and go to the party (!?!). Moments later he discovers that China has suffered a great earthquake. From there, the movie goes ... nowhere! Yes, Christopher Lee is in that, but that really does not help much. In addition, Lee gives a mediocre performance in line with his appearance on Howling II. This movie is boring, but it has enough stupid elements that you might want to suffer once if you like Christopher Lee or Z-grade science fiction. In addition, there are many archive images of the earth that is being destroyed.
