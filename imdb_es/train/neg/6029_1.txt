If you are wondering where many of the conspiracy theories and paranoid ideas about the UN, Israel and international affairs come from, look no further. <br /> <br /> This is not a supernatural Hollywood movie based on some aspects. biblical passage. Instead, this movie was made by a company (Cloud Ten Pictures) with a political and religious agenda. As a film, the end result is sometimes more like the clips of a telelangelism program (complete with family prayers and the light that goes through the windows of the church as the harps are played). <br /> <br /> For traditional viewers, it may be hard to believe, but many people believe in these things literally, as presented in the film. And that, perhaps, makes the film important. You probably will not find a more concise exposition of the strange views of a significant number of your fellow citizens. Therefore, if you see it, see it as a social / cultural document. If you have knowledge of the media, you do not need to be warned about subtle attempts at propaganda and manipulation in the film.
