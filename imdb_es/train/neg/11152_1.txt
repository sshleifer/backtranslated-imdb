Why bother watching this movie, if you have great movies to watch. It is a total waste of time and money. The movie is so bad that I felt bad for wanting to see it. Everything in it is BAD. The actors were bad. Script was very bad. The story is stupid. And the worst of the CGI. The only good moments were the first 60 seconds of the movie in the strip club. An interesting thing is that there is a character that we want him to die because he is so stupid that we get tired of him (I do not remember the name, but he was the FRIEND of the "Elegido"). /> <br /> NOTE: If you want to watch a good movie, this movie is not the right choice. 0-Stars of 10
