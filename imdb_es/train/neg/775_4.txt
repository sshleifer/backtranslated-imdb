John Candy Do we need to say more? He is the main reason why you should watch this movie. Most people do not realize how well endowed he was as an actor. Observe it changing from poor vague to horny imbecile. Just a simple facial change (subtle) and we leave. There are many great parts in this movie and many really silly parts. The best moments for me are the scenes of KUNG FU U, as well as the great moment when John (in a trance) takes the stage and talks about how much he loves his girlfriend, which is how much he and his genitals love to his girlfriend. I'm sure that by reading this, you may think that this sequence sounds really raw. It is, but it is also very fun, mainly because it is John Candy who is doing this part. The story in general is pretty boring and Eugene Levy and Joe Flaherty (both SCTV alums with Candy) do not have enough to do in the movie. Levy has her moments, especially filming the wedding at the end (think Rod Serling) and the big scene when she talks to her mother on the phone. In general, it's a good movie if you've had a difficult day and you need to put your brain into something stupid. I give this one 4 out of 10.
