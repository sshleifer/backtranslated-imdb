In general, I LIKE to watch Burt Lancaster movies, especially when you need to go crazy with your awesome screen presence like in Elmer Gantry. However, his greatest strength, his magnetism, was also occasionally his greatest weakness, as he rarely, if ever, underestimated ANYTHING. And it is this lack of subtlety that really hinders The Rainmaker. Now I understand that his character was meant to be a kind of showman, but how Katherine Hepburn could fall under his spell is completely inexplicable. It's supposed to be smart but it does not look like it when the Lancaster blarney is launched on the screen! Besides this, the story is perhaps one of the most eye-catching movies I've seen and it's all too obvious that it's a movie based on a play. It seems that it was filmed mostly in a sound stage rather than in the great open West as it was supposed to be. <br /> <br /> In general, a very overrated movie.
