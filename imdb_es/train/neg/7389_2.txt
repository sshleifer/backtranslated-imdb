I buy or at least I see all the Seagall movies. He came out with a handful of good movies and then came down with bad stories, a bad job with the camera and a passing character, he almost lost me. A few movies ago he remembered how to make a decent movie. Now he has forgotten again. This movie is very dark (at whatever level you want to name). There are a lot of cuts and cuts here for no discernible purpose, unless it is intended as a warning against the military. <br /> <br /> It is possible that Seagall has had a substitute in many of his scenes as it used to be. too dark to say and someone else's voice was used most of the time. Unfortunately, the only interesting character was the bad boy who killed his guard to escape custody and then proceeded to wreak havoc all over the place. Okay, since when do we put an armed guard in the detention room with a prisoner? Anyway, this bad guy was, at least, colorful and very focused. There is a lot of blood if you like that king of things. It seemed to me that the bad guys would tear the same wound every time. I'm glad they did not suck the blood of their hapless victims. I refer you to my summary. It's basically a horror movie disguised as an action movie. Dec 6,2006
