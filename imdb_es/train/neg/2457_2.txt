Some people do not like animation. Personally, I think the animation was quite remarkable given that when this movie was made. There are many old cartoons that I love. My problems with this movie are not the animation, but basically the way it was built. The characters are all ... well, silly. And for this movie, they should not be. Apparently, everyone in LOTR has a problem limping (to begin with). The way they acted in general bothered me. My two sisters and I were laughing for most of this movie. I think if many people had seen this before seeing the new ones, they would not have left. I'm happy to have rented it and not bought it. There are few movies that give me a headache. This was one of them. However, this is not the worst movie I have seen in my life, although it is located there. Or down there, depending on your eyesight.
