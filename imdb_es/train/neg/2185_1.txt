... or a hearing. A quick summary ... <br /> <br /> So you have this doctor who has been experimenting with stolen body parts for some vague reason. He wants to perfect the transplants, but he feels he needs to do this in his basement. WTF ??? And suddenly, unfortunately, and conveniently, his fiancée gets his head cut off in a traffic accident for which he is responsible. Agonized by the pain, she keeps her head in a tray of lasagna (or is it strudel?) And fills it with "adreno-serum" (sic) to keep it alive. And then he wakes up, talking with his head off (so to speak) even though his neck was obviously cut by the vocal cords, and he does not have lungs, so he could not speak even if he had them. It seems that the ungrateful b * tch does not appreciate everything that his fiancé has done for her. Like a woman ... <br /> <br /> Then, her grief turns into a cornea when she sees the possibility of grafting the head of her beloved into the body of the first silly bimbo she can pick up from the street. Meanwhile, the doctor's assistant, a kind of ten-cent Igor store, gets into philosophical discussions with his head, who has struck up a telekinetic friendship with the "monster in the closet" (every mad scientist has one). Finally, the scriptwriter realizes that he can no longer inflict his misogyny and fear of intimacy issues in the audience to infinity, so he kills everyone, then presumably goes to the bank to cash the check before the Financial sponsors of the film have the opportunity to stop the payment. in that. <br /> <br /> Did I mention that I think this is a bad movie? <br /> <br /> Someone should tell Turner Classic Movies to stop showing that edited version without the bloody things. The vision of the assistant with the arm ripped off, doing tricks around the house without leaving much blood anywhere is too precious.
