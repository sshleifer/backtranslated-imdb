I'm a big fan of Jane Austen and I ordered the Amazon.UK movie to see it without waiting forever for it to arrive in the US. UU I really should have saved my money. What's wrong with Anne running after Wentworth? The central point of the character of Anne Elliot is that she was calm and refined. She is not impulsive and vulgar. And Mary, was I having a stroke or something? His speech was not normal, nor was his walk normal. There was no chemistry between the two main characters, which made all their "romance" completely unbelievable. In the final scene, they even have Sally Hawkins in the same dress that Amanda Root wore during the lyrics scene. The same clothes are not made by the same movie. In my opinion, they did not see the 1995 version, which although it had its flaws, it stayed pretty close to the book. The book, I do not even think they read it. This is something like a Cliff's Notes Persuasion movie. Hit at all high points without explaining anything.
