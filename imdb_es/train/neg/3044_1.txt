This is a kind of weird movie, since Santa lives in a cloud in outer space and fights against Satan and his henchmen ... but it's still fun. <br /> <br /> He has some genuine laughs ... However, if all of them were intentional it is certainly debatable. This movie is not good, but I can say that I really liked watching it. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this film to "Santa Claus conquers the Martians", "Santa Claus" with Dudley Moore and John Lithgow, or "Santa Claus" with Tim Allen.
