Yikes This is pretty bad. To begin with, the work is not very good, and the decision to transfer it to the movies does not do her any favors, especially because Peploe does not decide how she wants to deal with the theatrical origins of the material (we get occasional glances from an audience of observing theater, etc.). ) and has decided to go with an outstanding editing style that aims to remind him that he is watching a movie, while in reality it only serves to remind him that he is watching a very bad movie by a director who is overwhelmed by his material. The central performance of Mira Sorvino is impressive: the stage and the plummy, it is as if she were playing the role through the work Merchant Ivory by Helena Bonham-Carter. Only Fiona Shaw offers a remarkable performance, and it may be that her theatrical pedigree means she is the best able to handle the material, but it is difficult to see a movie just for a performance, even if that interpretation is as clear, true and complete as the of Shaw. Ben Kingsley becomes an average and disconnected turn, and Diana Rigg's daughter, Rachel Stirling, plays her secondary role as just that. Unfortunately, none of Bertolucci's magic has infected his wife if this movie is evidence.
