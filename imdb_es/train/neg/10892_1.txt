This movie is horrible! I do not even know where to start, without words, I can not even describe how horrible this is. The blood is fluorescent in the first place, and the acting is horrible! The only good thing was the biker girl who saves the day. This movie was ridiculous, I do not see how I could even get a vote of 1, it's so bad. It looks like it was made by high school students.
