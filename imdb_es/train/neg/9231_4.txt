I entered this movie thinking that they would be the next Clerks, but I felt disappointed. The humor was weak and the characters quite flat. That does not mean that everything was bad, the idea of ​​dating service in the grocery store seemed a pretty fertile material, but the director shifted the focus to cliché "saved the Mom-and-Pop store of the evil corporation guy" . I felt that if he had continued with the plot of the dating service, I would have come out with a much more memorable movie. Now, to do justice to the movie, I'm from the Rochester area and I loved the way he played Webster. In fact, the best tribute of Kevin Smith (of Clerks) here was to support his hometown. Webster, NY is to check what Red Bank, NJ is for employees. The director wisely scheduled an appointment at Nick Tahou's house. Trust me, as for the things to do in Rochester, a garbage can is at the top of the list. I was lucky enough to see this movie at the Little in Rochester so that everyone would know when the odes arrived in town and appreciated them.
