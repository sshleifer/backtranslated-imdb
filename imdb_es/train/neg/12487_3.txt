This movie was a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> I have an opposite opinion to that of the critics. This is not a case of the material not being at the level of the actors; Here the actors (Bette Davis and James Cagney) are simply not up to the level of the material. Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert were as big as Davis and Cagney, and look how it turned out that one night happened: an all-time classic. With a very similar story, Davis shows that she has no talent for comedy (something good for her, that this is the only comedy she tried!) The performance of a Davis note exudes petulance, but none of the nuances of acting of Colbert in It Happened One Night. Cagney, who was a great comedy actor, seems to be out of sync with his partner, Davis. The script provides some decent lines and jokes, but the delivery seems more suitable for drama than for comedy. <br /> <br /> Part of the problem is the soundtrack, which, like the Davis and Cagney rendition, seems more appropriate for a light drama than a comedy. <br /> <br /> Jack Carson, who played similar roles throughout his career, has handled much more similar material skill. In a fairly typical support role, Eugene Palette offers respectable performance. On a slightly different paper as a relic of the old west, Harry Davenport, is very good. But in one of his poorest performances, William Frawley is quite annoying. The constant references of his character to the fictitious cops are a poor effort of irony. <br /> <br /> I really love each of these artists, and it is a pity that, as a whole, they do not achieve more chemistry or better results than The Bride Came C.O.D.
