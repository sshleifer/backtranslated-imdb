Actually, they wrote CEREBRAL in the credits, not BRIAN. <br /> <br /> Well, they did not have the budget for a spell checker. All the money from the production was for big old cars. There are at least two Packards visible here. One is a Darin convertible. A nice yellow Packard convertible. <br /> <br /> The scenes from the movie studio show that some money was spent on costumes and decorations. Old cameras, an exterior of Cyrus, street signs and everything that was needed to make a visually pleasing image was there. Wrong and directed. <br /> <br /> My DVD says it lasts approximately 104 minutes. It was more like 85 minutes. It came to an end without reaching a conclusion. There was a collision but no conclusion. The movie simply crashed against the credits. 99 cents for this. I paid 99 cents for this. I could have bought 3 cans of cat food and see my cat's face while he got more excited. <br /> <br /> For a few seconds in Ciro's scene after Darren McGavin received a phone call, it seemed that, maybe. .. this movie would have a surprise twist that would make an interesting movie. Then he sat there. <br /> <br /> The young Latino actor played by Steven Bauer (Tony Montoya) could have played a much more important role in everything that was happening here. This cast could have made a good movie. <br /> <br /> I think if they cut out Brian's role and use Steven Bauer instead and change the script, they keep the Packards and lose the band and add a Johnny Otis sound alike. band, then they got something. <br /> <br /> Here Kitty, Kitty ... <br /> <br /> Tom Willett
