What is the point of reviewing a movie like this? It's painful and shamefully bad, not even in a way that allows you to mock it. <br /> <br /> Movies like "Little Man" depress me. They represent the cinema in its most disposable form. This movie was made for a group of boys from 18 to 24 years of age that the studio expected to see it the night of the opening before it was known how bad it was, so that the film could quickly recover its investment. <br /> <br /> Another hundred filmmakers with great ideas probably could not make their films because the resources were going to make this pool of vomit. <br /> <br /> Rating: F
