This is a movie about making a movie. Such films can be entertaining, but they need some substance to do it. It did not happen here, I'm afraid. Mr. Coppola did not inherit his father's skills, unfortunately (nor his sister, who can make movies that one can see). <br /> <br /> I wonder how this film came to get such favorable reviews. <br /> <br /> Let's see: the main male actor, supposedly a director, is as expressive as a frozen squid and his voice has the same tone as it says, the main actress has an expression on her face that never changes, the plot is totally segmented into bits with perhaps a single connecting element, the film within the idea of ​​the film must be more rancid than paleolithic rocks ... Would that be enough? <br /> <br /> I regretted every moment I saw this movie. A walk with the dog is a far superior entertainment to this incredibly lame movie. It's as if an argument by François Truffaut was directed by Dick Cheney ... <br /> <br /> Brazil, some other classic SF films? You must be really kidding ...
