Like most people, I was attracted to buy this movie because of the images of the mighty Bolo Yeung plastered all over the box, and the assumption (of the images mentioned above and the title of the film) that this movie is about the Beast The ass of the East kick for 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> However, to my disappointment, the Chinese Hercules is for Bolo Yeung so there is no withdrawal. He did not surrender to Jean Claude Van Damme and Fearless Tiger went to ... erm, Bolo Yeung: maximum exposure in the video box, minimum real screen time! Oh good! <br /> <br /> The story is pretty basic, but it was well done: the peaceful kung fu fighter (played by Chen Hui Min) accidentally kills a man and promises not to fight again. Then he escapes to work as a worker on a pier where he impresses his co-workers with his heavy lifting capacity, which makes them suspect that he is a formidable fighter (I do not know how it works, but it does not matter). Meanwhile, the corrupt chief of the dock makes a deal with the gangsters, giving them the exclusive use of the dock. As a result, the workers are expelled in their ear and forced to live on the beach, where they unite against their boss, the mobster boss and his great minion Bolo Yeung. <br /> <br /> While the film was quite visible (mainly waiting for Bolo's next vision), I had some problems with that, in the first place, the bad dubbing, but of course, that's a fact in the old kung fu movies. But also, the movie tended to crawl between the different fight scenes. And as for the fight scenes themselves, I found them too long, badly choreographed (apparently by Jackie Chan!), Badly shot and, sometimes, made by people who did not seem to have any martial arts skills ... In fact, most of the fights in this movie were not 'fights' at all, only people were beaten without offering any resistance! <br /> <br /> Finally, the hero, played by Chen Hui Min. I have never seen any other film with this guy, but at no time did I support him. Not only did he look weak and on the verge of tears at all times, but he also found his insistence on not fighting anger! I understood his reasoning, but he could have saved a lot of pain for many people if he had done what we all knew he was going to do in time, and fight! A bigger mystery was why this entire community of people was placing their hopes on a guy they had never seen fight before! <br /> <br /> Really, the great salvation in this movie was the presence of Bolo Yeung. Not only is it as immense and brutal as always, but it has great fun lines and gives the rest of the cast a master class on how to fight in a movie. The guy oozes presence on the screen and you can easily see how he became a star. The guy scares me, but I'm sure I was not the only person who saw this movie that supported Bolo throughout the final fight. <br /> <br /> In short, a kung fu movie below the average raised several huge notches due to who-knows-who. I have never met a person who did not think Bolo Yeung was great. Man is a legend!
