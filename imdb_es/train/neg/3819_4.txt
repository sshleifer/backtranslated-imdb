T.Z. Post, a university professor, receives a false letter stating that he inherited $ 750,000. Now, with financial means, he withdraws his life savings of $ 4,000 and finally decides to go out and live. After sending his luggage on a train to Chicago, he meets a traveling vaudeville group and decides he is good enough to present a show on Broadway. The night of the show, poor Professor Post has to hide from his creditors, resolve the relationship problems between the Pansy girlfriend and Eleanor's lazy diva, and still make sure the show goes on. After seeing many of Keaton's silent gems, this is a nuisance to sit on, but I felt it could have been much worse. The cast of cast During, Todd and Selwyn are very annoying at times, but they are still pleasant. A Pre-Charlie Chan Toler is good as the frustrated director of shows. 90% of the script is badly written, as MGM is trying to pass this off as a Marx Bros. movie of a poor man where many of the gags of vision fall from the start. Compiled with Keaton's drinking problems at the time, this movie is a sad time in Buster's life. Score- 3.
