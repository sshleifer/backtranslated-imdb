Wow, I hated this movie. The theme should have resulted in a really good movie, and the lead actor was definitely sensitive and talented enough to handle the issue, but the script, if it * was * a script, is a mess. This is less a movie than a random slide show that is not going anywhere. I would say that it is not going anywhere fast, except that in reality it is the longest 81 minutes that you ever sit down. As I mentioned, the main actor is good. So, is Faruza Baulk (SP?), Like his mother, sometimes harsh, but ultimately, who loves and accepts. The filmmakers have a lot to answer here, because this is a disaster. A real shame, because I really wanted to like this movie, but basically it's a way out of a movie that was never made. Skip this: it was not worth even the $ 6 I paid for pay per view.
