Whichever Guy Ritchie possessor to remake Wertmuller's film is incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> This new movie is a disaster. There was another person in the audience when I saw him, and she left about an hour later. (I hope she has asked for a refund). The only reason I stayed until the end was because I never got out of a movie. <br /> <br /> But I sat through this scrap piece completely amazed that Madonna and Ritchie could really think they made a good movie. The dialogue is laughable, the acting is atrocious and the only good thing in this movie is the stage. Ritchie took the movie from Lina and turned it into another "Blue Lagoon". <br /> <br /> This is a movie that you would not even waste your time watching Cinemax at night. Time is too precious to waste on shit like this.
