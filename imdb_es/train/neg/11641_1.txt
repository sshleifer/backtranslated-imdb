Although in general I am a supporter of the film well done, I do not limit myself to films that escape those limits, and most of the time I enjoy and admire the films that "break the rules". And it is quite true that the director Pasolini breaks the rules of established cinema. But it is also my opinion that it does not break them successfully or at any real point. <br /> <br /> Pasolini's work is visually discordant, but this is less a matter of what is really on the screen than how it is. filmed, and the restlessness of his films seems less a matter of artistic choice than the result of an amateur cinematography. This is true of DECAMERON. Pasolini often preferred to use non-actors, and although many directors have done so with a remarkable result, under Pasolini's direction, his non-actors tend to remain non-actors. This is also true of DECAMERON. Pasolini often includes images designed to surprise, offend or disconcert the audience. Such elements can often be used with a surprising effect, but in Pasolini's hands, these elements rarely seem to really contribute to the film. This also applies to DECAMERON. <br /> <br /> They have given me to understand that there are many people that like, even admire the films of Pasolini. Even so, I have never met any of them, and I have never been able to read anything about Pasolini or his works that made understandable the reason for such taste or admiration. Judging from his work alone, I think he was essentially an amateur director who did not "break the rules" both by choice and lack of skill - and who was initially applauded by the intelligence of his time for "existential audacity", so he simply confirms it with bad habits as a filmmaker. I find his work tedious, unimpressive and pretentious. And this, too, is true of DECAMERON. Unfortunately, it is also true in almost all of Pasolini's films that I have had the misfortune to endure.
