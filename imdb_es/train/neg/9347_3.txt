This film moves from a moment of self-indulgence to a moment of self-indulgence, promising to become something worth waiting for. But it does not. He is flat, self-aware, unimaginative and tedious. <br /> <br /> A series of images and established backgrounds do not make a film, they make a calendar. This type of documentary pseudo socialist pitiful drama ("It is TRUE what happened") not only does not entertain, but does not serve to convince, so it does not even work as social history. The clich√©s mixed with the bad performance makes this a very difficult movie to finish, the fun factor disappears fairly quickly. The characters are one-dimensional, they never develop to the extent that one feels for them. The director's ego is the biggest character in this movie.
