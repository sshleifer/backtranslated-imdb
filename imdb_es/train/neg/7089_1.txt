A sexually obsessed chef leads a duplicate life: one as a man "happily married" to a ten-year-old boy, the other as a sexual demon. Most of the documentary-type film follows him for five consecutive days and is told in flashback with Nastassja Kinski as a clinical sex therapist, listening to his story and testing it intelligently. Nastassja's role is very restrictive and she is the only main adult character who does not take off her clothes. If I had, I would have qualified this movie as a big "F". As it is, it qualifies an F +, which implies that it remains a failure unless one likes to be bored. It's probably much more interesting to spend ninety minutes cleaning the garage. "Diary of a sex addict" falls into the category of movies that once you've seen one, you wish you did not.
