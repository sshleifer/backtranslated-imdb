On Steve Irwin's show, it's hilarious. He does not even try to be funny and he just is, but his movie was not what I would call a movie. I mean, when the guy in his car is trying to kill him he's just saying 'Oh, this is a nasty guy!' and looking directly at the camera. He put his face in the camera too! And then, when the man falls out of the car, would not he expect him to be dead? And Terri had the worst performance I had ever seen! Like when the crocodile almost ate Steve, she just says 'Steve'. She did not seem scared or anything, it was just 'Steve'. I mean, I hate to sound evil, but it was not worth seeing. I love Steve Irwin, but his movie was too stupid.
