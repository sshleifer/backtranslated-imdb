In 1967, a certain director had no idea of ​​a galaxy, far or near. I was trying to complete a film with the title THX, etc., this short is a remanufactured story of a certain George. I'm sorry, he only has tenderness to defend it. This is simply an advertising promotion for the director, the actors, etc. Alabama. It has little intrinsic artistic value. It is a brochure. The protagonist who plays George is very good, as is the character of Leia and the character of Ersatz Darth. Everything else is simple commercial scum. What a waste. Still, he did the job, I suppose. The rest of the movie is just stepping on the water to kill time, I suppose. just a brochure.
