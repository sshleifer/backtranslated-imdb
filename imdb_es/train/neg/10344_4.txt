He saw this movie that ran at dawn on TCM. Several problems with the film were evident from what I saw. First, adults did not age when children did it for 10 years. Several parts of the film had continuity problems and, for some reason, the actor who played the younger son seemed the oldest when they were 10 years old. <br /> <br /> The copy I saw was missing about 20 minutes or so, at least a large space with the black screen appeared. It's a shame, because although the script left something to be desired, Bergman and Russell did well in the movie in their roles. It is a pity that the big piece is missing, but what is here is visible. <br /> <br /> I just wish everything was intact. The script does not make much sense, since the character of Bergman is sent when the children are small, but then they return to take care of them when they are adults. Some of the timelines also do not make sense. There is a collapse in the stock market that resembles 1929, but the children grow up to fight in the First World War. All the performances of the support people in this movie are fine. I just wonder what was in the gap of 20 movies that I could not see since it was missing.
