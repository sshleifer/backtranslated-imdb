In a way, this is the disaster that Fellini has been working on all his life. The line between the absurd masterpiece and the free association shit is very small, and the category that will ultimately fit a movie will often depend on personal feelings. That said, "Casanova" left me with cold admiration for his sets and little else that Bukowski can not summarize more adequately: <br /> <br /> "Casanova died too, just an old guy with a big cock and a Long tongue without guts Saying that he lived well is true, saying that he could spit on his grave without feeling that it is also true Women tend to go for the biggest fool they can find, that's why the human race stands firm. he does it today: we have raised the intelligent and long-lasting Casanovas, all hollow inside, like the Easter bunnies we raise on our poor children ". <br /> <br /> As far as I could see, this is the position that Fellini takes with respect to his subject; granted, with more empathy, but nonetheless disgusted. <br /> <br /> The environment of Casanova is made of decay and incestuous behavior, subjects that Fellini dealt with more concretely in "Satyricon". The succession of the plot is characteristic of the soft porn, but without the coherence; and Donald Sutherland is ugly and viscous to the point of distraction. <br /> <br /> However, there could be a point in portraying Casanova as an unsightly fool. And I challenge anyone to formulate this point without being obvious; Fellini could not. More than ever, he seems like a dirty old man, a teacher, no doubt, but whose impulses satisfy themselves more than any other. I find it hard to imagine an audience that enjoys this movie. It was a story that was not worth telling.
