Documentary about nomadic Persians that make a treacherous crossing of massive mountains to make their herds of grass. Seeing this silent, black-and-white feature, marred in part by a twink-twink-twink oriental music score that could not have been used in the original exhibition, is even more boring than it seems. The spectacular landscape is lost in a small black and white screen, and no type of plot line can be established. I loved Nanook of the North and March of the Penguins, but I despised this movie, despite the similarity of the theme. Physical difficulties alone are not so interesting.
