I can not believe how popular this show is. I consider myself an avid fan of science fiction. I have read countless science fiction novels and have enjoyed many science fiction movies and television shows. I really would not even consider this true science fiction. All the episodes I've sat on are like a boring and diluted version of a Star Trek episode, minus anything I can do that is interesting or exciting. <br /> <br /> It's basically a group of people standing on ARMY fatigues, talking about something boring, who occasionally go through the Stargate and end up on a planet that looks like Earth, with people who look and they sound like human beings. It seemed an extremely low budget. The characters are all forgettable three-dimensional cuts, and the many attempts at humor vanish. It reminds me when you see an ad with a famous athlete, trying to be funny, but it is not. It is simply sad. <br /> <br /> The movie was also terrible. There is so much you can do with a portal through space, however, every place where the people of ARMY go is BORING! This does not show imagination! In fact, I thought that the television series "Alien Nation" a few years ago (based on the movie Alien Nation) was much better. That show actually had good stories and decent characters. I was not crazy about "Alien Nation", but compared to this overrated shit, it was great! <br /> <br /> In addition, unlike the great new series "Battlestar Galactica", "Stargate" copied the appearance of the film too close! They should have updated at least the special effect of "flushing the toilet" cheesy every time someone passes by the Stargate.
