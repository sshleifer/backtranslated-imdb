Stilted, stagy, strange and opaque, although visually stunning ... a wannabe-erotic fantasy. Really boring, too much male nudity (including incest father-son), and just a kind of blatant uselessness. However, I will confess that certain passages of dialogue, taken on their own terms, have a lulling and disturbing quality.
