What I hate about this program is how badly the leads are written. These women do not have self-esteem or dignity. The whole plot is that they are thrown to the boys. The talent of Amanda Bynes is completely lost. She was brilliant in "Everything What" and her own program. Why they would write to her and to Jenny Garth as vapid, hollow, desperate heads, chasing men, aspiring to the "old maid" is beyond me. <br /> <br /> Their arguments and dialogue remind me of "The Simpons", says Homer. every time his cartoon character Poochie is not on the screen, "Everyone should ask, where's Poochie?" All the talk focuses on complaining about one guy, and then complaining about another. Sometimes they change it and the boy complains. Then they are together again or they separate at the end. The 2 women are superficial, stupid or sexual addicts. The only word I can think of is "sucks."
