I read the story of John Everingham years ago in Reader's Digest, and I remember thinking about the great movie he would do. And it probably would have been if Michael Landon had never had it in his hands. As far as I'm concerned, Landon was one of the worst actors on earth, and his artistic license was way over, just as his massacre of the "Little House" book series is a test. Performance, for lack of a better word, is atrocious, the script is careless, and there are more approaches to Landon's puss than it should be allowed. <br /> <br /> This film reflects both the story of Everingham and "Little House On The Prairie" reflects the books on which it was "based". It's just another vehicle to show off the horrendous hair of Landons.
