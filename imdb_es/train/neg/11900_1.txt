How wonderful. Another film about the United States made by someone who has visited here probably half a dozen times, one day per piece, and is considered an "expert" in the country. Sheesh I should take a trip to Germany for a week and then come back and make a film about Germany as the "land of the Nazis" or something like that. Wim IL, boy, you should meet with Lars von Trier and make the last movie about Americans. Of course, we all know that we need a pretentious tendency to the left "we are the world" European to make a "real" movie about the United States. <br /> <br /> Yes, of course. For a continent that started not one, but TWO world wars, Europe has many opinions about the wrong "foreign policy" of the United States. <br /> <br /> P.S. Do not worry, boy from Wim IL, there are many UC-Berkeley Americans who will simply adore your movie. Of course, these are the same people who think that George W. Bush is worse than Hitler, and that a painting of a soup can is "pure genius".
