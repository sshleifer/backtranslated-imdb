Well, I had also heard all the reviews and comments on how this film could deserve the Oscar for Best Film, so today I went to see it. What a disappointment! 1) If you read the other reviews, you will learn from the members of the armed forces of the USA. UU Who served in Iraq how unlikely the events of this film are. They reflected my own thoughts; While the film was playing, I, a complete civilian, I kept thinking: "WHAT I say, there's no way that happens like that". 2) There is very little of what really happens in terms of plot. A new type of bomb disposal appears to replace one that was killed (a death that is not clearly explained). The new boy has an adrenaline rush from his work. His attitude puts others at risk. THAT'S! 3) This movie is not as suspense as claimed. If you want suspense, try one of the Bourne movies. If you want to see a war movie that is emotionally powerful, try renting Go Tell The Spartans, which is about the Vietnam War, and starring Burt Lancaster (who told me PERSONLY in a casual meeting of a supermarket that was a movie of which he was very proud). and one that he saw as one of his best works, and that he was still upset, had been largely ignored in the wake of the exaggerated Apocalypse Now), or an old black and white World War II classic Sink The Bismark, that, especially for an English movie, it's incredibly heartbreaking. DO NOT MISS YOUR TIME AT Hurt Locker.
