I like a movie that has at least a trace of a story. This does not happen in this movie. It is a series of vignettes without cohesion. <br /> <br /> There are scenes of a person collecting pineapple cans. A woman in a blonde wig never takes off her sunglasses. This woman shoots other people at the beginning of the movie and we never find out why. She disappears completely after about 30 minutes. There is another flirtatious woman who incessantly cleans a man's apartment. There are endless scenes in a fast food restaurant in which the "Dream of California" of Mamas & Papas is very overestimated (I liked the song). The dialogue mainly refers to the food (pineapples, chef's salad and order drinks). I assume that most of the actors gained weight during this movie because a lot of fast food was consumed. <br /> <br /> There is no passion in this movie because there is no story. This is supposedly a romance, it is not such a thing. I wonder why I did not hit the Fast Forward. I kept waiting for something significant to happen? he does not. Maybe that's the only consolation of this movie: the scenes changed so quickly that they tricked you into assuming there was going to be a revelation for all the nonsense.
