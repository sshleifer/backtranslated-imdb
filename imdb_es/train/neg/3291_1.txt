First let me say that I'm not a fan of the Dukes, but after this movie, the series looked like Law and Order. The worst was the casting of Roscoe and Boss Hogg. Burt Reynolds is not Boss Hogg, and even worse was M.C. Gainey as Roscoe, if you ever watched the show, Roscoe was not a tough cop. It was more Barney Fife than the role he played in this movie. <br /> <br /> The film is loaded with the usual mistakes, the cars are broken and continues as if nothing had happened. The worst example of this is when the General meets with Billy Prickett, and the General finds himself on a dirt hill that is evidently slowing to a near stop, but continues to win the race.
