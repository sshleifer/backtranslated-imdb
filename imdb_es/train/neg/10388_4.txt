After reading all the comments posted here on IMDb, this movie seems to be getting really bad, but I did not think it was SO bad. Actually, I've seen much worse things. <br /> <br /> "The house where evil lives" is a ghost story about a husband and wife, Ted and Laura Fletcher, and their daughter, Amy, moving into an old house in Japanese. Little know , a Japanese ninja brutally murdered his wife and his lover, and then committed suicide 100 years earlier with a samurai sword. While strange things happen in the house, the ghosts of former residents begin to possess the bodies of the living, and plan to recreate the bloody murder that occurred 100 years ago. <br /> <br /> I saw it Film and I decided to give it a try, from the cover it looked like a decent ghost story. It was routine and corny, but in my days I've seen worse. The sequences of ghosts were a little exaggerated, we could see at random translucent blue figures arising randomly around the family, and seize their bodies. To be honest, the ghosts in this movie reminded me of the ghosts on the Haunted Mansion ride at Disneyland. I may be wrong, but after seeing this, it seemed to me that the Japanese horror movie "Ju-On: The Grudge" and the new American version of that movie took it a bit. The old Japanese home where a brutal murder was committed, ghostly activity, curses in the home, etc. But I can be wrong. <br /> <br /> In summary, this is a pretty ghost story. Do not strain yourself to see it, but if you like this kind of thing and it happens that they come on TV, you can give it a try. 4/10.
