This was one of the most boring movies I've seen? I really do not know why? Only his stories about the guy who is about to get married, and instead, starts to get interested in someone else. The story has been told a thousand times. There is nothing new or innovative about it. <br /> <br /> I really do not know what went wrong in this movie. Most of the time, when these types of actors / actresses come together to make a film that has already been filmed a million times before, it's really entertaining. There is usually a small smart thing in them that is not really in any other. For some reason, this does not catch your attention. You can choose some fun parts, or smart ideas in them, but for some reason they are simply not fun, or smart in any way. I would like to know how to explain it, but no? Just do not waste your time on this?
