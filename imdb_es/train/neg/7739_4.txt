Remember when Harrison Ford was the biggest star in Hollywood because he made great movies? Those days feel like an increasingly distant memory. <br /> <br /> While "Hollywood Homicide" is not at all terrible, it's a routine movie and surprisingly boring of cops. It is a comedy that is not particularly fun, and an action movie that is not particularly exciting. An excess of subplots can not mask the weakest in central history. <br /> <br /> At least, Ford seems to be enjoying more than his latest projects, and is able to take the film most of the time. Hartnett is adequate, but he and Ford are not exactly Newman and Redford when it comes to chemistry. <br /> <br /> In general, "Hollywood Homicide" is a pretty fun distraction, but barely. Get Ford out, and it's not even that.
