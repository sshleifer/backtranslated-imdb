The script then goes on to a more detailed examination of how the Secret Service works, but who cares. Most of this only slows down the movie. All the persecutions that follow are the version of this movie of the annoying car chases of many movies. Then, after a lot of impossible athletics in which our hero overcomes and lashes out at all his teammates, we have a shootout at Toronto City Hall. Canadians are clearly marked with maple leaves, but how did they get there? Finally, everything is solved. But it still does not make sense.
