and a shot in Vancouver with the "mountains" of the low country of South Carolina visible in the background. For God's sake, they should have reset the location. There are no coastal mountains in South Carolina. Period. <br /> <br /> Fuzzy visuals. They should have been beautiful. And the story went limping. <br /> <br /> I really do not understand why it was as successful as a book, although I must admit that it is one that I have not yet read. I usually read the book and miss the movie. There was nothing in this movie that made me want to buy the book, not even borrow it from the library. <br /> <br /> Verdict: The Mermaid Chair seemed shallow enough for moi.
