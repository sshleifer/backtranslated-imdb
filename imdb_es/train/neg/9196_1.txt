This is one of the worst movies I've seen. The only positive thing I can say is that it was so bad that it seems comical. First of all, there is no plot. The actors seem to be reading the cards and doing the dumbest things. How to be persecuted by dead people but wanting to go out and look for their friends. Also, the zombies were terrible, not as fun as any of Romero's works, who connect with the movie. And the most silly of all was that they continued to show the flashes of the video game in the action sequences. As if we did not understand, the video game is about shooting zombies. In addition, all 20-somethings know how to use automatic weapons and hit a target without even aiming the weapon. And the way people die is so stupid. It is as if they had run out of ammunition, so stay waiting for you to get on. And when they're cornered in front of the house, they run out of ammunition instead of opening the door, So silly. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERDICT: If any of these actors appear in another movie, then they have been blessed with a second chance. Definitely the worst movie I've seen in years. A B movie in cinema is better.
