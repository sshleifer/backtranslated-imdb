This film is classified as a classic in feeling, not in any quality of making movies. It moves from the improbable to the incredible, from the unreal to the ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The incredible plot revolves around an attempt by two British soldiers and a Hindu Gofer to rescue a third soldier who has been captured by insurgents. Indians In the later scene we see a complete regiment with drums and bagpipes marching towards an ambush. In the British Army, a sergeant does not order a rescue attempt, and if you surpass it, do not try it with a single soldier and an Indian servant when there is a complete regiment at hand. Indian insurgents are so incredibly inept that it's ridiculous ... there are hundreds of them, but they can not stop their prisoners or kill the two rescuers, of course not. At one point, we see the British soldiers throwing stone blocks from the battlements to the insurgents, who are scattered down the mountainside in an ambush ... one would have to have an eggplant for a brain to think that this would do some hurt. After Cary Grant, while the rescued prisoner is shot, he lies on the ground looking at the water boy ... hardly the actions of someone who was shot in the back. The water boy bravely blows a bugle (which comes from nowhere) to sound the alarm ... this is done by standing on a wall so that the bad guys can see and shoot him, and we shed a tear while still trying to sound more notes while repeatedly receiving shots and the bugle call becomes weak squawks ... instead of blowing the bugle while hiding behind the cover like anyone with half a brain would. This scene has been deservedly parodied in comedy sketches. If they wanted to do a Buster Keaton comedy, they should have hired Keaton and done it better.
