I really did not like this movie. <br /> <br /> I saw him in a camp, and we were not excited, we laughed. Sure, some parts are touching, but the acting is terrible, the effects are terrible and the general idea of ​​the film is terrible (now, I know it was based on a book that I have not read, but I hope the book was better than this , because frankly, I thought that this movie was very bad and boring). As I said, I went with a group of people from a camp, and we were excited to be there, besides drinking a caffeinated drink, but nonetheless, I struggled to stay awake. The only thing that kept me awake (apart from my fear of embarrassing myself once I woke up) were the shots, which were also quite useless. I really did not like it.
