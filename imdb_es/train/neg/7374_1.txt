This is without a doubt the worst movie Steven Seagal has ever done. And that says a lot. Do not be fooled by the qualification, it's too good. This abomination had not even deserved a rating of 0/10, if such a thing existed. <br /> <br /> - Absolutely no plot <br /> <br /> - The worst action scenes in history, and there are not many of them too <br /> <br /> - Seagal does not do any thing, including fighting, talking (a lot of dubbing), and so on. As usual. <br /> <br /> - Seagal is fat, lazy and could not care less about this movie. Something that is very obvious throughout all <br /> <br /> Take all the other DTV junk movies that Seagal has made, multiply them with each other, multiply this by a billion, and all the evil that you will then get will be won ".t even describe 1% of this absolute crapfest.
