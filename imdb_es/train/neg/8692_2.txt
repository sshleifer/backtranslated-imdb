I think Elisabeth Rohm, although she can make an effort, is not very good at all. I think it was because of the budget that she could have been the only one they could get for that price. I mainly saw it to see the performance of Myron Natwick, whose work I know very well. <br /> <br /> He was the most credible and, without a doubt, the most convincing to see. When he was not on the screen, the thing went out. This was filmed in Vancouver. It gave me chills, but rest assured that in real life he is a kind and funny and compassionate man. He even said that playing that role gave him the creeps. <br /> <br /> I'll see anything with him, but Elisabeth Rohm never again. She was as exciting as the fluff of Law and Order. Maybe a very nice person, but not an actress.
