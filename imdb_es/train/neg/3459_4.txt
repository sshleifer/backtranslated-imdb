"Cut" is a film about some film students who make a movie. It is very much in the mold of "Cry", a film of ironic and self-referential horror that, at least for me, falls because, despite all its irony, it is still a bad horror movie, just like the movies what is it <br /> <br /> But it was not without its charms. Well, an amulet anyway. Molly Ringwald was fantastic, as the spoiled and spoiled American actress hated every minute of working with the Australian amateur film crew. She was so convincing that it was tempting to believe that it was not an act, although everyone involved in "Cut" said it was a pleasure to work with her. :-) <br /> <br /> Seriously, every scene of her pouting, sulking or breaking was great. However, everyone else hesitated between being well and being terribly wooden. <br /> <br /> Anyway, "Cut" has some laughs, a few buckets of blood (some of them surprisingly frightening), and ultimately it's ... just another bad horror movie.
