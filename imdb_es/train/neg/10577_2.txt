Some of the filmmakers participating in this series have made some really cool movies, but they are certainly not showing much skill with this series. Particularly the writing. OK, the first season was something better, but these new episodes that are creating just suck. I'm a big fan of horror and, in my opinion, the vast majority of these episodes are total trash. Nothing new or really interesting. Few of them are visually creative. It's just a typical Hollywood garbage, uninteresting, childish, poorly conceived and, in some cases, totally ridiculous. Like Tales from the Crypt, the only good thing this series has been offering is great nudity! Apart from that this series blows strong. Sometimes I have the impression that they hired a group of eighth grade students to write the episodes. Maybe they did it.
