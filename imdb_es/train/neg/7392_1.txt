I look around in the video store still in shock at how Steven Seagal, with his history of bad action movies, can still have 3 movies on the shelves in less than a year. The force of attack is the third, no less promised, the first time they enter the genre of science fiction for our ever wider Seagal. The entertainment visions of bad movies passed before my gullible eyes. Unfortunately, this is not the case at all without entertainment and a film as bad as it comes. <br /> <br /> Seagal bounced a bit with Trashy, but the last time we saw him was Shadow Man. However, Attack Force has to be his worst movie! Do not argue for a Kill, Ticker or even Black Dawn. This is the bottom of the septic tank here. <br /> <br /> Anyone who says that this is the return to the form of Steven Seagal should be forced to write a 100-page essay on the word Taste. <br /> <br /> Seagal is another agent / I'm a big jerk, once again called Lawson who wants revenge for the murder of his team that leads him to an infamous plan to distribute a really bad drug to the unsuspecting public. Not to mention that distributors are not from around here. <br /> <br /> All production, from directing to acting, is bad. Was this movie filmed in the dark? It must be the most poorly lit movie since Howling 2. The action is terrible and very badly done. <br /> <br /> The producers also decided unwisely to do what the fans hate the most: throw double double-double-double and horribly nicknamed Steven Seagal. It shows little enthusiasm here. Can you blame him? <br /> <br /> Although it has been said that Attack Force was not the movie that Stevie signed (originally Harvester) and surely it has to be better than Attack Force. The manipulation of production has not made it more coherent and that Seagal looks worse. I feel bad for director Michael Keusch and writer Joe Hal as they will be judged forever by the ill-advised production re-releases. <br /> <br /> So now This leaves Seagal in the impossible position to find something to atone for this disaster. But after seeing how The bad attack of force has turned out, do we really want it to make another movie?
