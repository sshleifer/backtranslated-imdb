The movie was not a waste except for some boring scenes in between. But the cast of women gave a pretty good show than the men who were ridiculous. <br /> <br /> But Krista Allen really moved in the movie. His voice was so seductive and sexy. The scenes in the bed that involved Krista should have been shortened, but made it more visible and sexier than anyone could do. Krista is really one of the best in those roles. He also acted calmly as the bad guy in the last 5 minutes, which is the interesting part of the movie. <br /> <br /> Burt Reynolds was not so good and this was not his best action star. I could have chosen a better script than this one. I really think he did it for money.
