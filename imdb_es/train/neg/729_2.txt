Before I started watching the show, I heard it was great and aesthetically very interesting. What a disappointment, the scripts are so foolish that I'm pretty sure the authors are the son and grandson of the writers of Scoobidoo. And what about the SFX and the colors? They are so extreme that it is painful to see them, the colors are not saturated, they are too saturated, as the scripts are overwritten and the show is overrated. This show is like a bad cake in which a child would only have put sugar and butter thinking that, since these ingredients are the best, they are enough. Unfortunately for this show, the only two ingredients of this show are finally emptiness and a total lack of credibility.
