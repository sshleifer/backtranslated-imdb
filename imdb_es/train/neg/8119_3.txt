First of all, there really was nothing in this movie that really appealed to me. It was not a bad movie, just another movie where I said "Well, that was nothing special" after having seen it. There was probably drama and those things, but they just did not catch me, but more dizzy. As I said in the headline, it seemed very cheap in some way. The quality of the film itself (the images) was seen as a low quality and reminded me more of some cheap movies made for television than a well-respected English filmmaker. The angles of the camera and the shots were very amateur, in my opinion. I really did not have any close-ups or similar effects to produce interesting scenes. I have not seen many films in English and the ones I've seen really did not impress me more than this, and they seemed similar to the work of the camera, the colors and so on. "Game" tried to be more cool, modern and smart (see my review of "Lola Rennt" on this if you wish), but it was not successful for me either. In general, just a small indifferent movie that was nothing special (at best, I'm afraid) and basically, unfortunately, we lost more than two hours.
