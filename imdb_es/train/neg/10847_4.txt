The cut version of the director, which was the one I saw, was very long for this type of film. Almost two hours is too much time. If you have the option, definitely opt for the cut of non-directors. <br /> <br /> The main plot is almost not occupied, the film consists of the main part of several scenes of murder, which are connected but the feeling is that they only show to fill the film with violence splashed. The connection is not revealed until the last part and the lack of context bores me much before being there. <br /> <br /> Like horror movie, it does not work. You never have the required sensation of the characters due to mediocre performance and general disposition (the character shows up, 15 minutes later the character is dead). This strong side of the images is in the splash part.
