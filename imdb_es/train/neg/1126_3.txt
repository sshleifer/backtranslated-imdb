I rented this thinking it might be interesting, and it could have been an interesting story, except that it was told in such an uninteresting way. Difficult to follow, strange editing, a disconnected plot, the characters murmur, all in a terrible and boring waste of time. I just could not get into that and I did not care what happened to the characters, nor Ian Holm could save this movie. Unless you need a cure for insomnia, I would skip it. 3/10, and that's being generous.
