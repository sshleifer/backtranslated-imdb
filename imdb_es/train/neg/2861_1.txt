I can not believe I wasted my money to rent this movie. I thought it was a porn movie when it started and it never got better. The acting, the music drowning the actors. Horrible. Save your money! You have to read the movie all the time because they knew that music would drown the lines of speech. I never got the role of the slaughterhouse or the need to continue showing cows and pigs being slaughtered. What did that have to do with the "real" killer of BTK? I understand why there were no famous actors / actresses in this movie. The script would have rejected me on the first page of reading. You would be better off seeing the painting dry.
