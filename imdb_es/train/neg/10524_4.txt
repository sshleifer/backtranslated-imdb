Actually I had the intention of seeing this movie in the theater. It was actually sold. In fact, I went to see Solaris, which was actually the worst movie that premiered in 2002. <br /> <br /> Victor Rosa (John Leguizamo), a tough, street pharmacist, goes crazy when he sees A child is shot, so he decides to go clean and invest all his money with Jack (Peter Sarsgaard). Things seem to go pretty well until Jack jumps out of town with his girlfriend Trish (Denise Richards). This happened very late in the movie, so if they had not revealed this in the preview, it could have been an interesting twist. But they did, so it is not. <br /> <br /> In fact, there is not one interesting thing about this movie; Everything is given in the preview. If you saw a single preview, you saw the whole movie, so you may want to think hard to fill in the gaps. Go to the website, download the preview, save $ 3.99. There is not a single surprise or twist in the whole movie, apart from how terrible the soundtrack is. <br /> <br /> I hope that whoever was in charge of writing the soundtrack was fired. Twice. Most of it is what the music would be like if the only songs allowed to be released were the duets of Ricky Martin and Gloria Estefan, and (I can break the fabric of the space-time continuum with such an amazing concept as this one) both had less talent and musical ability <br /> <br /> The performance is, at best, poor, the script is, at best, a crime against humanity, and Denise Richards is, at best, 67% polystyrene foam and 33% ziploc bag. You know things are wrong when John Leguizamo (he was in The Pest!) Eclipses the rest of the cast with his acting skills.
