The Three Stooges in a western musical comedy film? Perhaps "Rockin 'in the Rockies" was destined to combine the short comedy of Stooges with the musical of the west, in a matinee; If so, this was a nice way to break a Saturday afternoon. Jay Kirby (as Rusty) is a young and handsome hero; and, Mary Beth Hughes (as the blonde June) and Gladys Blake (as the brunette Betty) are beautiful women. The Hoosier Hotshots are a harmonious group; his songs are quite melodious; However, this is the 1940s, not the 1950s, so the film is not exactly "rock". There are some laughs; but the mood of the Stooges is more tenuous than usual. The talking horse is also underutilized. <br /> <br /> **** Rockin 'in the Rockies (4/17/45) Vernon Keays ~ Moe Howard, Larry Fine, Curly Howard, Mary Beth Hughes
