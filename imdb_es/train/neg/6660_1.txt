Seriously, the fact that this show is so popular simply stuns the mind. This show is not fun, it's not smart, it's not original, it's just a bunch of shit fumes. Let me start with the characters. The characters are all one-dimensional imbeciles with loud and exaggerated voices that only sound like nails on a blackboard. The voice acting could have been better. Then there is the animation. MY GOD, my eyes hurt just looking at it. Everything is too flat, too pointed, too bright and too sweet. Then there is the humor, or lack of it. He is completely idiotic! They just take these grade B jokes that, in the first place, are not so funny and then they repeat them until death. They also throw a little useless humor that makes me sick. And finally, last and least, music. It is simply annoying. It seems that it was composed on a child's computer and does not generate any emotion. I would like there to be a score lower than 1, I really do it. This show seriously needs to be canceled. It's a show that I try to avoid like the plague. Every time I listen to the song, I turn off the TV immediately. If you have never seen this program, then do not do it. See quality programming like The Simpsons or Futurama.
