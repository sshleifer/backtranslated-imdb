I have never seen any of Spike Lee's previous films, since their trailers never caught my interest. I have seen and admired Denzel Washington and the work of Jodie Foster, and I have several of her DVDs. However, I was completely disappointed with this movie. If this movie is an indication of Spike Lee's ability as a director, my advice would be to "get a job" and stop wasting the time and talent of others. <br /> <br /> I wonder if some of the other IMDb commentators saw the same movie that I had seen. I can only assume, from their lovely comments, that their worship of Spike Lee has blinded them to the banality of this work. I only paid $ 2.50, in a "Second Run" theater, and I still felt that I had wasted my money. <br /> <br /> The IMDb "Trivia" page says it all ....... <br /> <br /> * "39 day shot": how can you expect to shoot a big one " Blockbuster "budget, (as promised by the media hype), in such a short time? It is not surprising that there is such a weak performance by everyone. <br /> <br /> * "Ron Howard was going to direct the film for the first time ...". It is possible that you have done justice to this project, given more time to do it. So of course. Although the writing was atrocious, the premise had some merits. <br /> <br /> OK! maybe not. Sorry! This film was so full of lamentable clich√©s, improbable scenes and terrible characterizations, that maybe even he could not have done it. (Hey Ron, make sure you thank Russell ... Good call!) <br /> <br /> * "Jodie Foster filmed her part in three weeks." - And it showed! His interpretation of a "Arranger", which makes people's problems disappear, was as incredible as the script they gave him. Did he even want to be there? <br /> <br /> Other people: <br /> <br /> * How many bank robbers will bother going to the door and informing a uniformed police officer that they were inside? stealing the bank, and you'd better stay away ... or else? <br /> <br /> * When the "Detective Frazier", (Denzel Washington), enters the bank to verify that there are still no bodies, how many bank robbers, without a weapon, would have "driven" a policeman, ( Let alone "leave" a policeman) go back to the front door, allowing the police officer to walk behind him? <br /> <br /> * Det. Later, Frazier claimed to have given the thief "all the reasons to shoot me." Why, then, in his brief struggle, did he not even try to expose the thief's face? That could have obtained the answer he was looking for ... a thief would have shot him only to avoid further identification. And why did he take "Steve, Stevie, Steve-O" (the accomplice of the thief), so much time to come and help? <br /> <br /> * I understand that these were not your typical bank robbers. They had a different agenda, and they did not want anyone to get hurt. But the cops had no reason to think they would not. For them it was a desperate situation. Why then, when two of the bad guys came out to "pick up the pizzas"? (First, how many thieves would have left without using a hostage as a shield? Is this the Spike Lee version of New York City or the SNL?). Topple them would have reduced the numbers of the villain, ruined his plans, and the remaining thieves would probably have surrendered. If not, at least there would be fewer bad guys inside. (Give SWAT something to do, or send them home!) <br /> <br /> * What the police department in this country would have allowed Madeline White (Jodie Foster) to simply enter the bank, and discuss A matter with the thieves, that she would not reveal to them first? She had no authority, no governmental credentials; And besides, this was, after all, "already" a hostage situation ... add one more? <br /> <br /> * Why did the CEO of the Bank, (Christopher Plummer), simply not destroy the incriminating documents? long ago? Screw sentimentality! The diamonds, could have sold. <br /> <br /> * Who was that "imbecile" (the character, not the actor), with the accent of Jersey, who conveniently volunteered and said he knew the recording. It was "100% Albanian", but he himself could not speak ... SIR! PUT YOUR HAND DOWN! And his ex-wife! What a fool! Both were totally incredible. <br /> <br /> * When questioning suspects, why Det. Frazier, continually harassing people who were obviously not part of the robbery "(that is, telling the old woman that she could go, and then she could not, then she could, then could not she?) Give me a break! <br /> <br /> * Who, after seeing the bank robbers demand that the hostages be placed in the jump suites, could not deduce that their escape plan included leaving the bank pretending to be some of the hostages ? <br /> <br /> * Near the end of the film, it was shown that a fake wall was built in the supply room, behind which Clive Owens hid for "a week" ... where did the materials? since? (the drywall and tacks). They were also supposed to cut the sewer, so that he could relieve himself. Had the bank employees not complained about the smell all week? Hello! <br /> <br /> * After such a debacle; since the documents "had" fallen "into the hands of the thief, what kind of" references "did Mrs. White expect from the bank's president, seeing that now she was going to be the target of blackmail, due to her failure? <br /> <br /> * And last, but not least, what about the "electric glide" that Denzel did? STUPID! Was that supposed to indicate his "resolution" to take these guys to justice? It seemed, rather, like a man jumping in a shopping cart, while trying to avoid a bowel movement. "Cheeee-Zheeee" !!!! <br /> <br /> Apart from the mediocre plot; bad script, bad performance, and in general the sorry address ...... yada, yada, yada. <br /> <br /> We hope this gives you enough information about the movie to help others decide if They waste their money or not! <br /> <br />.
