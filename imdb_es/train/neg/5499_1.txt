I saw this bomb when it hit the theaters. I laughed all the time. Why? Because the stupidity of that seemed to have driven me crazy. I remember it and I realize that there was NOT ONE fun thing in the whole movie. At least nothing intentional. It's very funny that Lizzie chews a piece of Nurplex and becomes a carnivorous and gigantic demon ... however, her tiny dress is perfectly intact, despite the fact that it is now hundreds of times larger than when she was first time. put it on. Or the kind of movie in which a man can be surprised with a shredder and just fall unconscious, and return to consciousness without ANY medical attention. And do not let me start with the ridiculous destiny of the "villain" that they decided they needed to create "conflict". Uh huh. <br /> <br /> For the person who complains that Disney only addresses children. The obscene parts of this movie seem to refute that claim. Do we really need Daryl Hannah to accuse Jeff Bridges of having curly video tapes? Do it if you are Disney and you run out of ideas to make the movie attract the crowd of more than 8 without writing a smarter script! I am completely convinced that Disney pays the scorecard so that their films can commit murders and still get family friendly ratings. <br /> <br /> What a waste of the DVD format.
