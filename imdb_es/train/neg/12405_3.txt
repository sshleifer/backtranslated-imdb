What a shame! There I was, comfortable in the armchair with a beer and a bag of popcorn, hoping for another splendid night of entertainment with Muppet. What did I get? Disappointed! How can the Muppets go from the sublime carol to this? The humor was frightful, the songs were worse than Country and Western (and that's something that said) and the plot was as confused and poor as Blind Pew. I think the main problem was that they bit too much when trying Treasure Island. A short story, like the Christmas Tale, is perfect because you can knit the Muppet jeeps around you ... here the need to drag the plot through all the fun. Where do the Muppets go next? What about the Muppets Wizard of Oz?
