STAR QUALIFICATION: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> James Dial ( Wesley Snipes) is hiding at his ranch in Montana after failing to capture a notorious terrorist. Then, the agency approached him again to travel to London to have another opportunity. His target has been stopped there and he is under heavy police protection, but they do not want him to simply capture his man, they want him to be eliminated. Everything goes well, but then the mission fails and when he kills a police chief, Windsor (Charles Dance), the fault lies with Dial's feet. Hunted like an animal, he takes refuge in a nearby house and befriends a girl named Emily (Eliza Bennett) who is dealing with his own problems and becomes his involuntary partner when he tries to clear his name and find out who betrayed him. <br /> <br /> This latest adventure from Snipes directly to DVD came out of nowhere, with a minimum of publicity, even for such a small time (I do not remember seeing any advertisement or trailers anywhere). With this in mind and after the story of Snipes' DVD attempts on Duff, this might have seemed like one that Snoop Dawg would tell you to leave as if it were hot. But I felt compelled to give it a try anyway. It is not among its worst, but it does not reach higher than the standards of some of its best (The Detonator, 7 Seconds, it says it all, actually), either. <br /> <br /> This is, at best, a bit of suspense, with a minimum of action, without complications, all in the way of fresh dialogue and Snipes is not exactly the best in the main role . Similarly, in a main supporting role, it's pretty clear that Dance has only appeared for the paycheck and, in general, is one of the characters that the cast is not going to scream up the hills in any of their CVs. . <br /> <br /> He says many things that by the end, the only 'contract' that keeps him interested is when Snipes's will end with Sony and with it an end to any other low-level DVD action movie. **
