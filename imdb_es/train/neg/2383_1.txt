This is a candidate for the most disappointing film experience of my life. Good title, excellent director (I saw "To Die For" and "Drugstore Cowboy" before this), and hey - Uma Thurman in the cast. How can you go wrong? Well, that's a question that pulsed in my temples for hours after I saw this turkey. <br /> <br /> Unknown and ungraceful in an attempt to be unconventional, this is a dead zone of a movie that should be avoided at all costs. His criticism was justified. Here is one of those rare movies that does not contain a single exchange quality. Zero out of ****
