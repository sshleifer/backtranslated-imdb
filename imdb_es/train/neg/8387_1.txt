This was the worst movie I've seen in theaters. It was just a compilation of recycled material. People who get hit in the head is not funny. The people who are kicked are not funny. After the third time that a boy was kicked in the balls, not even the youngest member of the audience laughed anymore. He just got tired fast. <br /> <br /> I went with my little sister. She really laughs out loud in King of the Hill, but this cinematic masterpiece bored her. I'm not surprised. The story is pretty boring. A dwarf thief steals a large diamond in what was definitely the easiest robbery in Hollywood history. Then he hides with a family that pretends to be a baby. I know it sounds exciting but that's the whole story. Say those two lines again and again for 1.5 hours and you will get the image. There were predictable jokes in abundance. I really felt cheated after seeing this. I did not expect much and I was still disappointed. I wish Keenan would hire some decent writers to write jokes and / or his next script. This was even worse than the White Chicks, if that is possible. I have seen high school works that were better and cheaper. <br /> <br /> There was nothing positive about this movie. I do not like my entertainment to be entertained.
