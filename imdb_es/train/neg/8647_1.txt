Amateur at the end. The work of the camera, especially overpopulated: documentary camera operators do not have to turn ALL THE TIME. <br /> <br /> The script is truly inane and the acting is even worse. Besides that, the story is disconnected and meandering, with some gaps in logic. At one point, the leader wishes to be thrown into jail to rub shoulders with the alleged Al-Quada agents, and thus obtain an interview with Osama. The story seemed completely incredible to me as a result of so many failures. The "filmmaker" / main role really portrays a reckless and idiotic frat boy. The only element of interest in reality is that the filmmakers actually filmed in the place. It is really a pity that they missed the opportunity to do something interesting. <br /> <br /> Who financed this shit?
