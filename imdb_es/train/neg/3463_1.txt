I watched this movie the other night and I have to honestly say it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The acting is fair, but the plot is totally ridiculous. A murderer is born because of all the "energy used to make the film" and if the film is burned, will the murderer die? How incredible is that? The characters were underdeveloped to say the least ... for example, suddenly the man mentions "Are you not trying to complete the film because your mother could not?" So, are we supposed to agree with this? We had no idea that it was his daughter until the middle of the movie. The movie really did not highlight anyone, we did not know anything about the main people who survived, except that Ringwald's character was a whimsical actress, the guy was on the set when people died and Raffy wanted to be a director like her mother. . Do not really dive to know who they are. It seemed that things were rushing to get to the murders. The whole plot is too weak for my liking and I was very disappointed. Anyone who has enjoyed this piece of junk, obviously needs to learn one or two things about making movies. I can not believe that someone agrees to star in or even work on this image. It's not funny, it was not scary and it was a topic in the whole movie. I found myself predicting what would happen before each scene, which I think was not difficult at all. It is a disgrace and I deeply regret having lost an hour and a half watching the mess. 1/10.
