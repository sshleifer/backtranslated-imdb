Rare? Yes! <br /> <br /> Unusual scene for an American war movie, New Zealand. <br /> <br /> Unusual subject, four sisters and their relationships with American soldiers, from one with the illegitimate son of a senator's dead son, to one who lives with seven marines (one at a time) before of being killed by her New Zealand husband POW who returns. <br /> <br /> Unusual to see Paul Newman offer such a poor performance as soon after his unforgettable role as Rocky Graziano in the brilliant "Somebody Up There Loves Me". <br /> <br /> Unusual for two fine "Stars", Joan Fontaine and Jean Simmons, to leave so little of themselves in a movie. <br /> <br /> It's unusual for me to bother writing a review of such a poor movie, do not see it!
