A black man fights ... and supposedly wins ... yes ... 1/10. Obviously, fiction. <br /> <br /> So they present us with a good title, a good line of etiquette and even a good plot ... That's it, that's where it ends ... We go into fiction after that. <br /> <br /> Michael Jai White, the black guy, so do not get confused about the name ... portray a black guy .. Umm, that's all there in the name .. <br / > <It's so hard to find a decent help, you should have hired the friends of the black guys to help cause the low budget, the little ineptitude of this movie, the shadow of the camera creeps in the first scenes ... Yes , it's an obvious idiotic moment for the average Chico like you and me ... but yes ... <br /> <br /> 10 lines. Review sent. If you paid to see this movie, they fucked up.
