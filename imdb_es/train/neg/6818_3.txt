In this movie, Joe Pesci hits a basketball. joe pesci ... <br /> <br /> and being consistent, the rest of the script is not credible either. <br /> <br /> pesci is a fun guy, which prevents this movie from sinking completely. Behind the warehouse, but the other papers were pretty bad. the father was a greedy businessman who valued money more than people, who was not even well played. Instead of man being an archetypal villain, he looked more like an amoral android programmed to make money at all costs. then there's the piece of token that is assigned to pesci as a girlfriend or something ... I do not even remember ... she was that forgettable. <br /> <br /> anyone who qualifies this film above 5 or 6 is a paid member of some kind of film studio that tries to improve the reputation of this sunken movie, or at least one of those millions of minions of the media that can not criticize efficiently (you know, people who feel bad if they give something to a mark below 6). <br /> <br /> Stay away ... away. And shame in the central comedy, where I saw this movie. Usually, they choose better.
