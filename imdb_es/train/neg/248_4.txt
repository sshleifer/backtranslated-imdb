When will the pain stop? I do not want to see another version of Christmas Carol again. They continue to make movies with the same story, falling one on top of the other to try to improve the movie than the rest, but unfortunately they do not, since this is not a good story. Moralist, antiquated, conservative of happy thoughts. As if people learned. The many different versions of this movie show that we do not.
