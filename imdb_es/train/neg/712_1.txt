When I started watching this movie, I saw Buffy's guy, Xander, and I realized how pretty life is still doing acting in movies. Now I can stand a strange movie, given that it is a good dose of stranger, such as David Lynch's movies, the twin peaks, the lost highway, etc. And you have to be in the mood for one. This one, however, made me mockingly recall the crazy websites about conspiracy theory that do not make any sense. I mean the people of Nazi who conspire with the United States to create an impious trinity of evil powers. I was surprised they did not mention the hollow earth in this movie with the flying saucers of Hitler and the lizard people. Maybe if you had about 60 grams of heroin with this movie, it would make some sense, but I really did not condone the drugs as if I did not approve this movie. He should burn, shred, and forget so well that good Xander could get another acting job. However, it was not his performance, that was fine, but the script just did not make any sense. Sorry.
