Depending entirely on your own personal mood to see this, "Christmas Evil" can become an ambitious and innovative psychological thriller OR one of the most pathetic and exasperated themed holiday slashers ever made. I, personally, am tempted to opt for the latter because I did not bother doing any research and simply anticipated a cheesy slasher undemanding in the early 80's with a nutcase in a suit of Santa Clave killing people. Incorrect! The movie is really about a guy named Harry Stadling; who is obsessed with Christmas, works in a garbage toy factory and considers it his responsibility to determine on Christmas Eve who deserves the gifts and who deserves the punishment. Harry's problems began when he witnessed Santa? your daddy in a disguise obviously ?? caresses the bare legs of his mom at a tender young age. After that, he became a social outcast, to the irritation of his younger brother, who is forced to break a day (holi). I fully understand why certain fans appreciate this somewhat eccentric horror movie, but did it really have to be so boring? There are several parts too long and seemingly endless of the film in which absolutely nothing happens. I can forgive the shortage of blood and the spilling of outrageous blood, but this film does not even benefit from a disturbing atmosphere or unexpected twists of the plot (with the notable exception of the ending, I must admit). Also, I would have taken the concept more seriously if the crazed protagonist focused on lethally punishing naughty children. He does not kill and exclusively kills adults who misbehave. How are you supposed to take seriously the controversial and original Christmas Christmas thriller when Santa does not even commit a miserable child murder? That would have made "Christmas Evil" a classic, whereas now it's just a piece of forgettable and regrettable garbage.
