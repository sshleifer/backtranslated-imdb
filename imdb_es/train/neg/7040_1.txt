I just bought the VHS on this movie for two dollars, did I waste my money? Hey, I dig Adam "Batman" West and Tina "Giligan's Island" Louise, but hello! This third-rate production is a repeat of a dozen other motorcyclist films; A crazed group of motorcyclist psychologists ride in a city of Hick, beat everyone and everything, and are then defeated in man by a galloping hero. Adam West looks like a hero, but he lacks a cape and his Batman uniform. I'm sorry, it's just not the same. Tina L. looks really nervous and scared during the whole show, but at least we know what happened to "Ginger" once she was rescued from the island ... LOL! Cyclists are a diverse group, and it is known that some of them returned to act or, at least, they should not have done it. Hell Riders is a hell to watch!
