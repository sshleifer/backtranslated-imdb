I saw this movie in 1979, I was 17 or 18 years old, when it was released. The theater was maybe 1/4 full when the movie started. Ten minutes into the film, me and the friend who accompanied me to see the movie were the only two people in the theater. The film was really strange and he had no argument or reason for his script and people asked him to give him back his money. We decided to stay for the FULL movie ... why endure that torture? ... here's why. We wanted to be true movie critics ... having a standard on which to base all other films is hard to justify by saying that you have seen the best movie (10) you can always think of something better. But, it is easy to be able to base all the other films on the worst movie that has been made (and this is ... a 1 in the best of cases). There may be other movies out there that really qualify as 1, but I have not seen them yet. Now I base all the films I see on a scale based on the worst ... I AM A REAL CRITICAL MOVIE ... he, he.
