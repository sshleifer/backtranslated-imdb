This must be one of the worst movies I've seen, the graphics are ridiculous, and the pathetic script and the most important question is how this rather sparse script took over the selection process. <br /> <br /> I like all kinds of movies, from deep dramas to the most oriented to men, kill everything you see, kind of movie, so I can not say I'm demanding. I've been struggling to find something to compare it with, but I can not think of anything that matches this, maybe the starship soldiers. 2. In my opinion, the witch makes the movie gods cry and I'm thinking of throw my DVD player, but compared to this its effects are great. The excellent performance and the script must be rewarded. You know when a movie is bad in a funny way, well, friends, this is not one of those that kills your soul minute by minute.
