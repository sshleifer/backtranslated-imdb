The director, dressed in chains and leather, warned the audience at the SF Frameline Film Festival on Friday night that we were about to see an "experiential" movie. Experimental? Leave the video camera in the back seat of the car, let the tape roll and edit everything that does not make sense inside the view. A serpentine pastiche road show manqu√© that does not start anywhere and does not take the audience anywhere. The gratuitous violence that opens the movie led to more than one patron of Castro's theater. I too would have left, but my film partner needed to be taken home and he has this in mind to see even the worst merchandise until the end. By the time the lights came on, the audience had shrunk considerably. A warm applause. Pro forma questions from the director who seemed satisfied with the product. Avoid this movie!
