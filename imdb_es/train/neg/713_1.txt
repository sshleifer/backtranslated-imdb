First of all, can I say that I felt so convinced of this movie that I signed up for IMDb specifically to review it? And my criticism? This is easily the worst movie I've seen. <br /> <br /> The synopsis of the film sounded interesting: Nazis, occultism, time travel, etc., but the plot of the film did not manage to gather all these elements. Remember the South Park episode that showed manatees writing Family Guy using "idea balls"? Did these manatees also write Unholy? It's as if the writer wanted to include all these different ideas, but he had no idea how to tie them all together, and then to make things less meaningful, it included a time travel theme of Donnie Darko-esquire at the end, ruining the chronology. . <br /> <br /> I could tell from the beginning that this was a bad movie. The special effects were a budget too low for anything better than directly on DVD. The acting was not very good, but in justice I have seen worse things. I would praise the Nazi paintings, they were scary, but the evil Nazi butcher was simply funny. <br /> <br /> I do not have a revenge against this movie or anything, but to be honest, I'm not even in the horror genre. But this movie can not be described as a thriller or a drama. If this story had been well told, it would have been a good movie. But it has been exaggerated. Waaaaay about promoted.
