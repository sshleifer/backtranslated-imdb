SPOILERS. Strange people with generous tastes have been reviewing this movie. Allow me to add balance by noting the following: <br /> <br /> Script: Dreadful. When Tom and Dan are "getting to know each other", joking about the movies, the conversation is clearly that of a person, and I suspect it was the director, who worked his words carefully to sound smart. At one point, Dan asks: "Have you heard about the HIV virus?" and it sounds as natural as asking: "Have you communicated with the nine alien races?" <br /> <br /> Acting: White teeth do it and the chiselled face does not make it a sensitive artist. Speedman did it well enough with what was given, I suppose, but Marsden was terrible: not very understanding, incredible, and frankly presumptuous and sympathetic throughout his captivity. There is a gap in their performances (see also Interstate 60). <br /> <br /> Plot: Tell me! The moments of half escape were not exciting but irritating and weak. Remember Marsden pretending to try the keys at the door and then throwing them away: "They do not work, man!" Tee-hee. And beware of semi-black and white flashbacks, which start with a messy sound taken from CSI and other crime dramas. <br /> <br /> The most important of all, the most dangerous, the bad and the offensive, is homophobia (external or internal, you decide) in a film in which HIV is considered a weapon. Tom says that Dan may have removed the condom or not used it at all. Excuse me, where was Tom while they had sex? There is something of villainy in the inserted couple that emerges as evil of the gay man in general. <br /> <br /> In summary: Beware!
