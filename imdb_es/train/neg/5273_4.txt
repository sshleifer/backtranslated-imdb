*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** When I saw a preview of this movie, I thought it was going to be at least a slightly admirable story. But like most of the original superstition films I was disappointed. This gullible family ends up driving through this "deserted" city to stop and find this video camera that shows these people doing everything possible and discovers that all disappear with time, the family goes through all these mysterious stages and never discovers or shows what What the hell is harassing them? There are more voids than I can count on and they do not explain anything that happens, how or what. It ends where the family suffers a car accident and a brainwashing or something is done (which is never explained). The next thing you know is that you expect them to somehow discover how everything happened, but that leaves you completely confused.
