Honestly, I can not bother to spend my time writing about this milestone of cinematic incompetence: life is simply too short. What I will say is that, Alone In The Dark is successful in only three things: 1. It will make you laugh, but for all the wrong reasons. 2. It manages to throw several useless plots in the air but releasing them all. <br /> <br /> and <br /> <br /> 3. It completely disgraces the classic PC game in which it is supposedly based on being a complete failure in all aspects of film making. <br /> <br /> Doctor Boll, if that's what you are (I'm thinking about proctology here), what the hell are you doing in a director's chair?
