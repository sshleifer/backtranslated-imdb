This is a very bad west, mainly because it is historically inaccurate. It looks as if it had been filmed on a lot in California instead of where Jack Slade, Idaho, the Colorado Territories and Montana lived and died. Fictionalizes everything that is known about this mysterious "bad man", "good man". The script is horrible; There is very little direction, and bad acting. Dorothy Malone is completely lost as his wife. Mark Steven never seems to know how to portray this mysterious Jack Slade. In real life, Jack Slade was a very good stage line superintendent. He was feared by the inhabitants of his local city for his great consumption of alcohol. When he was drunk, he started fights and caused other problems in Virginia City, Montana. To ensure that he could never again terrorize them, the guards lynched Jack Slade after he ignored his warning to leave the city immediately. This is a horrible movie. I can not recommend anyone to watch this movie other than to see how Hollywood destroys history at will, even to this day.
