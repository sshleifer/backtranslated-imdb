While working in a video store, I discovered that it was my solemn duty to talk about the worst movies I've seen and warn my friends and co-workers. In the middle of a particularly heated day of debate about which is the worst movie, my friend challenged me to watch B.T.K. Murderer, even claiming that if I could watch the whole movie and still claim that my previous choice was the worst movie in history, then I would see it. I missed. I think I even made better videos than this in high school, and those were not great feats of a young genius. This film not only lacked what appeared to be production value (it seems that it was shot on a defective camcorder, although it is surprisingly clear), but also on performance (wood, hollow and pathetic does not scratch the surface), as well as Generally bad movie feeling. I can remember a scene in which I heard the breaking of a glass, suddenly, I was reminded of some bad plays in high school (I know I mean high school very often here, but this movie seemed very youthful) in terms of the whole, which seemed too false, but also as if people were reading their lines of the script, without being completely sure of what was really happening. My review does not do justice to this movie, because I can not describe how absolutely horrible it was the time I spent watching this. It's almost ironic that he does a pathetic job describing a pathetic excuse for a movie.
