After leaving the popular television show "The Andy Griffith Show", Don Knotts gave the film's stardom a brave attempt with a series of crazy but comic comedy vehicles. Unfortunately, "The Reluctant Astronaut", filmed cheaply (like most Knotts movies), is much worse than his other films. Don plays a small town that is accepted in the astronaut training camp ... but not as a candidate for a space trip. They want him as their new concierge! Some may say that weak satire capitalizes on the then-fresh fever of Americans for the new era of technology, but the movie is actually a weak excuse to keep restless children occupied. It has a good start, with a good configuration and nostalgic locations, but it becomes increasingly spiritless and idiotic. * since ****
