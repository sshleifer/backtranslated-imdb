Inside Man is a disappointment that induces yawns and tells the story of a detective (Denzel Washington) who is under investigation because of his possible involvement in a case of loss of money. When a bank is stolen and the hostages are held against their will by an intellectual thief (Clive Owen) and his team, the detective is assigned to force the thief to surrender. his only chance to prove himself innocent and worthy of his position. Enter a powerful woman (Jodie Foster) with secrets and intentions of her own, send her to retrieve an item from the bank owner's safe deposit box that is stored in the bank, and have the whole three-way dilemma. Unfortunately, everything is configured in the movie, and nothing is worth it in the end. Denzel Washington is at his most disinterested point in an inefficient and unpleasant egocentric performance. The only saving grace for the film is his competent co-star Jodie Foster and Clive Owen, who are much better than the film itself. In fact, Jodie Foster offers the most amazing and high caliber performance when playing against the guy as a ruthless and ruthless villain. Clive Owen does not have much to do besides meditate and pose, but the depth of his presence and his ability to act successfully outweigh his underdeveloped role. It is strange that so much talent is wasted in this film of little impact or interest. You have to ask yourself what director Spike Lee was thinking while he was creating this movie. However, the most disconcerting aspect of Inside Man is the amount of unjustified praise he has received. For a movie that seems to have all the characteristics of a pre-summer blockbuster, it falls horribly flat.
