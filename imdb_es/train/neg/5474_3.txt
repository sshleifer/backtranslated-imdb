To be fair, they did as well as they could with a budget of five shillings and sixpence, but the dialogue was more corny than 9 pounds of emmental and the CGI was a bit old hat now. Maybe if some of the actors were not so well chiseled in granite, they would also have made the movie a little better. To say that it was horrible is to do a bad service to this movie, if you want to see something that is completely execrable, you have to sit down and lose a couple of hours of your life watching 'sickle', that's very dauntingly horrible, it's really good, ( however, many large alcoholic beverages are deriguer.Any way, I enjoyed this movie and I have to take a look if you have not seen it yet, just do not expect anything like "Jurassic park, the lost world" or "apocalypse".
