Yes, MTV there is really a way to market Daria. What began as an intelligent adolescent anguish: "comment on everything that stinks and make the viewer feel better about his dirty teen life" the sitcom now becomes a "how you deal with your problems." I used to see Daria all the time and I loved it. Now, sitting here after seeing the so-called "movie", I can only wonder what this is all about. Daria tells us how to lead life in college? Excuse me? Did Daria not understand in all the episodes that what you like to do is fine, as long as you are well with yourself, no matter what the rest of the sad and sick world thinks? All this reminded me of the scene in "Reality Bites" that the movie channel shows the documents for the first time.
