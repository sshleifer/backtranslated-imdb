I would give it a 2/10. <br /> <br /> I was very, very disappointed. <br /> <br /> The story was poorly developed, for example, the incidents were too short and brief, therefore, the moral was not clearly exposed I thought Brenda Song did a good job, but Shin Koyamada seemed to have difficulties to handle your paper. I could see the need to include Western elements in the show, however, there are certain parts, where Chinese elements were also needed! The villain for example. His physical appearance resembled a robot, rather than something outside of Chinese culture. The last and the worst defect was the incorrect and distorted data that was included in the program. <br /> <br /> Others may point out that it is a "children's show" and, therefore, there is no need for a high level. However, there are other Disney programs, such as Mu Lan, that have been much better in terms of story development and presentation. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I think that Disney films should be better researched and better planned. A good show is not enough with just a series of martial arts moves to depend on.
