To say how horrible The Shield is, you would have to write pages and pages, so suffice it to say that it is a monument to misdirection. <br /> <br /> "When Directors Go Awry" should have been the title of this production. In fact, directors are supposed to infuse their work with a sense of visual style and storytelling that drives the story forward. <br /> <br /> How are you constantly shaking the camera and playing with the zoom lens as a "style"? How are you driving the story forward? Of course there is also the nonsense of "edition by random numbers". Apparently, it has become fashionable to simply cut at random. <br /> <br /> I guess it's too much work to do a good edit. <br /> <br /> Well, that did a lot of work for most people to see. Escudo that languished as one of the most exaggerated and unseen shows of all time.
