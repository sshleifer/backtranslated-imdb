While watching this movie, I came up with a script for a movie, called "The Making of 10 Items or Less": <br /> <br /> Producer: I have good and bad news. The good news is that we can get Morgan Freeman! <br /> <br /> Writer: That's great! But what are the bad news? <br /> <br /> Producer: we can only afford to hire you for one day. I guess we'll have to find someone else. <br /> <br /> Writer: So we hired him for a day. A movie lasts an hour and a half. A day of work lasts eight hours. I do not see a problem. <br /> <br /> Producer: But ... you will have to take time to get into character. <br /> <br /> Writer: So, we ask you to play a character who is essentially himself. <br /> <br /> Producer: But you still need to understand your motivation and all that. He's not saying we have him as a big-name actor who's making a low-budget movie, right? <br /> <br /> Writer: Why not? <br /> <br /> Producer: That's ridiculous! But hey, at least we'll have Morgan Freeman in our movie. And I guess we also have to put the movie in Los Angeles. <br /> <br /> Writer: of course. <br /> <br /> Producer: This script is a lot of garbage. We'd better make money on this. Just in case, get the Morgan Freeman character to connect Wal-Mart or Target or one of those stores, so that at least someone wants to sell the DVDs. <br /> <br /> Writer: Sure! <br /> <br /> Producer: wait a second ... what is this about a small warehouse with an "express of ten items or less"? <br /> <br /> Writer: Oh, I guess that's pretty weird. But we can not change the title now! <br /> <br /> I doubt that my script really looks very close to reality, but neither did "10 elements or less". This is a case of good acting, but bad writing, and I hate to see this happen. When you watch an independent movie, expect it to try to convey some type of message. I think they might have been trying to get the tired old message of "do not let anything hold you back" that has been done to death in much better movies. In any case, with "10 items or less," the only message I received was "Look! Look at Morgan Freeman!"
