Another problem was the sound: all these girls scream and shout at the same time, all talking one on top of the other: it is impossible to hear what they say. <br /> <br /> I had a It is a good idea to try it. In short, they hit a parked car and then left, shortly after they were chased by the car they collided with, driven by a madwoman, who wants to kill them and has many possibilities. to do it! ... and, on the other hand, girls have many opportunities to escape, but no! <br /> <br /> Very frustrating ...
