Drama-crime "blaxploitation" badly done directed directly at the black urban market of the early seventies. Pam Grier stars in the lead role, that of a nurse who becomes a one-woman vigilante after the thugs who traffic drugs make Coffy's little sister a drug addict. Violent nonsense advances heavily, with canned energy and enthusiasm; only Grier's bad temper gives the narrative a shake (it's not a great actress here, but it connects with the audience in a primordial way). Not very different from what Charles Bronson was doing at the moment, the film was marketed and advertised as a gross exploitation, but still managed to find a considerable audience inside the city. Today, however, it is simply a footnote in the history of cinema of the 70s, and it lacks the powerful appeal of other films in this genre. * 1/2 of ****
