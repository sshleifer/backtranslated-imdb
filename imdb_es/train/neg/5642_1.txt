This title seems more like a filming exercise than a movie that should have been released for the public to see. For Dafoe and his wife, it must have been fun to work together in a movie for the first time, regardless of the fact that people could really see it. I felt as if they had lost 90 minutes while I waited anxiously for a plot to develop, or even to start. <br /> <br /> Try to fit this movie into a genre and you will not, because it has no beginning, no half. or ending. I have seen 'artistic' films before and this is not even close to being artistic, abstract or original, it seems to me that it is completely useless. <br /> <br /> I think it speaks for itself when the only people who rated this movie with a 10 were those under 18 years old. No doubt by the constant erotic scenes without meaning that the film insisted on throwing us. That if you can call it erotic. I certainly did not like it.
