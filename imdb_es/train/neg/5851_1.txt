I doubt that Jigsaw was fashionable even at that time, the whole LSD issue related to a murder mystery was a clear attempt to capture a young audience of the time without showing at all the understanding of the counterculture of the sixties. Leaving aside the antiquated aspect, Jigsaw has many problems, among which include the excess of action, the silly and forced dialogue, the flashbacks of LSD that last for a long time even after the point has suffered in the first 60 seconds, a failure in the creation of certain suspense. the real plot is, on paper, a great vehicle to do just that, and an ending that is so trite and predictable (not to mention many bad television shows) that the climax is actually an anti-climax. If it were a better movie, we could suspend disbelief in some things that would help enjoyment, but the weaknesses are so obvious that they only serve to highlight the improbabilities that viewers might overlook. I watched Jigsaw on television and it is definitely the nightly television fare to fill the airspace and spend time to kill someone's insomnia instead of anything that someone should actively seek. In the best of cases, a three out of 10.
