Back (again) in Scotland, Lassie is (again) on trial for her life. Because the faithful dog sleeps in the grave of his master, it must be executed according to the law. Interestingly, it is also explained that Lassie did not have a "legal" owner, which, apparently, is also against an old Scottish law. If, after three days, no owner is found, the dogs must be destroyed. Edmund Gwenn (as John Traill) defends the case of Lassie, which leads to an extended flashback, which shows the adoption of Lassie by Donald Crisp (as John "Jock" Gray). <br /> <br /> Although it is based on an interesting and original story ("Greyfriars Bobby"), "Challenge to Lassie" takes up several of Lassie's previous situations; and, it does not improve over them. Speaking comparatively, this is careless and not very exciting; and it is a disappointing follow-up to "The Sun Comes Up" (1949) *******. Geraldine Brooks (as Susan Brown) and several of the other artists can be charming, but they can not raise this. Little Jimmy Hawkins (from "It's a Wonderful Life") is among the remarkable children who support Lassie; much later, he will grow up to marry the "Dark Shadow" "Sorceress" Angelique "(Lara Parker).
