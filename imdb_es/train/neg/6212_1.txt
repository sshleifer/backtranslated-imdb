I used to think that movies required plots, or some other means to make you care about the story or anything that was happening. This movie has shown me that you really do not have to have any of that. <br /> <br /> I could summarize it like this. But, IMDb wants me to have more lines. It was nice. It does not obligate in the least. The way the characters talk in the movie makes you think that it should have taken place in a matter of days, but there is no passing of time and I am pretty sure that all this happens in an hour. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for entertainment, then buy a gallon of milk and see how quickly you can drink it before you vomit. It would be a better use of your time. Time you will never return. Jurassic Park 3 was better than this movie.
