What the hell is in your minds? This movie sucks! Every minute I got bored more and more. I tried hard to see the end because I hope that at least something finally happens! But instead, I was surprised at how boring the end was ... What is this story about this damn "ghost"? How is it that he does not die? He is a human being with blood for the love of God! A simple boy who killed his silly sister 15 years ago. And that ? Did your stay in a psychiatric hospital make you immortal? This movie is a fascinating stupidity ... It's a duty of nonsense. I'm going to resell right now a silly guy who will understand this silly movie.
