If this movie were worse, it would have been directed by Uwe Boll. This senseless disaster makes Ed Wood look like Hitchcock. It's been a while since I saw this smoking stack, but I remember that I wanted to do serious bodily harm to everyone involved. How can someone give this movie more than 1 star I am surprised by the kindness of all those who saw this gut. I give it a star because there is no lower rating. All copies of this film should be burned, sown with salt and reserved as a sanitary landfill for the most toxic waste. No, a copy must be kept under ultra high security and shown only to filmmakers as an example of how not to do so.
