First, before continuing reading, you must understand that I am not neo-Nazi, I only try to understand Hitler correctly to make sure that no one like him takes power again. <br /> <br /> I've seen this series and found it horrible. I mean, it's okay, it's interesting to see, but is it real? I searched for answers and found one: absolutely no. First, Hitler was not angry all his life, the series shows Hitler angry, even when he is a child. Second, Hitler never wanted to abuse his daughter, in fact, it is very likely that Hitler, in fact, was gay and fought his whole life to quell this secret. Third, people will hate me, but it's true: Hitler was charming. How do you think he managed to get to power if he was so hateful and ugly? Because he was lovely. That is a common point I found in the interviews of people who live near or far away from him (of course, not Jews). <br /> <br /> This series was horrible because if you think that Hitler was just an angry, ugly bastard, and of course, not charming at all, you're wrong. If you think that, you will let people like him take power in the countries and you do not want that. If you really understand how Hitler managed to come to power and stop thinking it was just horrible, you will find dangerous politicians like him (of course, remember he was chosen) and stop the issue before it is too late. <Br /> <br /> Life is important to protect it, this series is just horrible to show us the truth, if we continue to see Hitler in that way, another will take place exactly as the first one did.
