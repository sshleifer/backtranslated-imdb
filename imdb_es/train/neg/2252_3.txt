So some people had told me that this movie had made them cry in the theater. When I first saw him, I expected another romantic movie by Barbra Streisand, who was writhing with tears; Something like the way we were. I was certainly wrong. The chemistry between the two main characters, Esther Hoffman and his John Howard, was non-existent, making it impossible to stick to the characters. There was nothing romantic about it. The character of Streisand fell in love with an alcoholic junkie who could not sing a single note without making me want to press the fast forward button. At one point, her character finds her husband in bed with another woman and she forgives him about five minutes later. There is nothing romantic about an incomprehensible rock star and a woman who does not seem to notice until she dies. Some parts of the movie seemed to lengthen, and I wondered when it would end. <br /> <br /> The death of John Howard was completely predictable. From the beginning of the film, his imprudent behavior was fully evident, and when he died I did not feel any emotion. It was not a tragic accident, he was basically an idiot. Not to mention that throughout the movie I was distracted by his horrible beard. <br /> <br /> The only parts of this movie that are worth seeing are the Streisand songs. The end of the movie when he sings "With one more look at you / Look closely now" was my reason for giving this movie a whopping 3/10. Those 7 minutes were the only part of the movie where I felt a different emotion from irritation and anger.
