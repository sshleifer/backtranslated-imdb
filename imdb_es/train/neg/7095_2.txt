"Diary of Sex Addict" is a pathetic attempt at a serious drama about sexual compulsivity. Probably a movie marketing scam, this movie is a stylish filming with a good cast and little else to the contrary. In short, "Diary ..." would make us believe that our sex-addicted character has the dumbest wife in the world, a stable of babies who have nothing better to do than drop their panties for him at will, and There is no work despite being a restorer. In the best of cases, this movie could have been a good drama. In the worst case, cheap softcore. "Diary ..." is neither and nowhere. This is for the dumpster. (RE-)
