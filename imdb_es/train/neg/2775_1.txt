['This was the worst movie I&#39;ve seen in my life. Not really. I&#39;m not kidding. Leaving aside all the &quot;based on a true story / historical references&quot;, there is no excuse for such bad performance. It&#39;s a shame, because, as others have published, the sets and costumes were great. <br /><br /> The soundtrack was typical &quot;Asian style&quot; music, although I could not find out where the &quot;modern&quot; love song entered when Fernando was lying in his bed thinking about Mar√≠a. I do not know who wrote and sang that beautiful song, but it was as if Norah Jones was suddenly transported to 1500. <br /><br /> The blood of Hershey&#39;s syrup in Phycho was more realistic than the ketchup that sprouted during the battle scenes of Kwik-n-EZ. <br /><br /> But the performance. Oh, so painfully sad. Lines delivered as a bad secondary work. If Gary Stretch had put on a potato costume for the 4H County Fair, he could have been more credible. Towards the end I sounded more like a thug from little Italy. Sometimes I almost expected him to scream &quot;Adrian!&quot; or even &quot;Do you want a piece of me ?!&quot; <br /><br /> Favorite line: When the queen tells her lover (after vomiting on the floor) &quot;I&#39;m going to have a baby&quot;. He answers &quot;A child?&quot; I expected her to respond &quot;No, you idiot, one leg of a chair! Duh.&quot;']
