I was stuck to the screen, nailed, yawning, watching carefully. I waited for the next terrible special effect, or the next element of the ridiculously cliched plot to show all its strength, so I could learn how not to make a movie. <br /> <br /> Looks like when they set out to do this In the movie, the team saw each of the other action / science fiction / shooting / good vs. bad movies that have ever been made, and saw great things and said: "Hey, we can do that." For example, the only car parked less than a mile on what looks like a one-way road with a shoulder not meant for parking, is the only car to which a protagonist, an attractive brunette born of bile, is launched. The car breaks into pieces before she even lands on it. The special effects were obviously my biggest problem with this movie. But what really put it in my bad books was the implausibility and lack of reason for so many elements! For example, the antagonist, a flying demon with the ability to inflict damage in strange ways, encounters a lone military truck carrying an important VIP. No-name security men with guns come out of the truck, you know they're already dead. Then the guy who protects the VIP says: "Under no circumstances do you leave this truck, do you understand me?" He goes out to look for the beast that killed his 3 friends, beat him in an almost comically clich√© way. Then, for no apparent reason, defying logic, convention and common sense, the VIP fool LEAVES THE TRUCK! A lot of what happened throughout the movie made no sense. The transparent performance took me away from the film, as well as the camera's bad work, and the things that just make you go: "Wow, that's incredibly cheesy." Shiri Appleby kept the film as a 1, because it gave the film the element that always makes the viewers enjoy the experience, the sexual attractiveness.
