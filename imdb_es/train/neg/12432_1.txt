This is the worst scam of the Home Alone movies I've seen! Look at part 1 and the second, but do not let anyone say that this is BETTER than the first two! I mean, really, you do not make a movie, then you make a sequel with the same characters and actors, and then you make another sequel with DIFFERENT characters and actors. I mean, it would have been nice if this was not a "Home Alone" movie, but they did make it a Solo at Home movie. Culkin is too old now, so you're supposed to LEAVE sequels! My God, this movie makes me sick! Buy part 1 and 2.
