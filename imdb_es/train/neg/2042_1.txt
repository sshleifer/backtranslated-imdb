Killer of the zodiac. 1 out of 10. Worst action ever. There really is no worse acting ever. David Hess (The last house on the left, not the one in the seventies, renting it is really good) is the worst in the group (competition is rather tough, but it's incredibly scary). to find a participant in a home movie with such an uncomfortable camera presence. The movie actually stops in an amazing and painful way when it's on the screen. <br /> <br /> It's not that the film really has redeeming qualities for Mr. Hess to ruin it. It was filmed with a movie camera at home and, for the appearance of things, a rather old one with boom microphone attached. There is no post production either. Come on, there has to be some shovelware that a five-year-old computer could use to clean up this image. Release the strange footage of autopsy and carrier aircraft takeoff footage and this is a visually fucked image. The images of the autopsy are interposed in the same way that the Italian cannibalistic films intervene in the murders of animals of the terrible real life. And the Navy video is supposed to be a declaration against war (because we know that all bloodthirsty maniacs join the Navy). What the hell is Lion's Gate doing releasing this crap? That would embarrass Troma. The plot is about the zodiac killer (Last seen in Harry the dirty, not the seventies, renting is really good) Is someone shot in the stomach in Los Angeles and the police assume that the zodiac killer is back? UH Huh. What can you expect from a movie that does not know that the DSM IV is a book, not a psychiatric disorder and in which the relationship between the young murderer and the older man resembles that of a page of Congress and a member of Congress locked? Yes, eighty haircuts and production values ​​comply with a sub-plot of Nambla. Sign me up.
