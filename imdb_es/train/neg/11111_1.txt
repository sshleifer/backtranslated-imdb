Do not bother spending your money on this movie. Do not even go to your car and think you might see this movie if others do not attract you. If you must see a movie this weekend, go see Batman again. <br /> <br /> The script was horrible. Perfectly written from the random horror movie format. Given: a place in confined spaces, a madman with several weapons, a curious man who manages to discover all the clues that honest cops can not put together, and an innocent and overly curious woman, but beautiful and strong with whom many in the A audience would love to be able to call his girlfriend. Mix, add a lot of poorly executed gore, and what the hell, let's put some monsters there to give a little "twist" to the plot. <br /> <br /> The acting was horrible, and the characters incredible: Borat was more believable than this. <br /> <br /> *** Spoiler *** and someone can tell me how a butcher's vest can make the person shoot a bullet after being shot without even making the person who was shot shudder ??? I'm in the army. We need that kind of thing for ourselves. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10, and I would place it on the decimals of that round to give you the lowest possible score.
