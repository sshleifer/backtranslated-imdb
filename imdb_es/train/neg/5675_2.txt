Set in the 70s, "Seed" centers around the serial killer Max Seed (Will Sanderson), who killed 666 people in 6 years. He is condemned to death, but in the electric chair he does not die, even after being surprised three times. <br /> <br /> Detective Matt Bishop (Michael Par√©) and other officers conceal this secret by burying Seed alive. . Seed explodes and chases the people who put him in his living coffin. <br /> <br /> Shot by the worst director in the world (Uwe Boll), "Seed" is nothing more than a snuff film about trying to stretch the envelope of decent society and does not fulfill any aspect of a story. And he said that this is based on real events because if a person survives the electric chair after receiving an electric shock three times, he will be released. This is an urban legend, and it would never happen. Like the other abominations of Boll ("Alone in the Dark" for one), "Seed" is absolutely horrible.
