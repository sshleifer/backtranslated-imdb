Yes, I know that I am one of the few people who yearn to trample this film in the dust of oblivion. So let me tell you why I feel that way. In truth, if it had been announced as a Zombie movie or something similar, I could have enjoyed it. But right now, I'm totally speechless. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER ... Although I'm not sure what to spoil * Let's start with the first HUGE flaw. If I did not know that the movie is called "Darkness - The VAMPIRE Version" and I had not seen some sequences where some individuals seem to be sucking blood, I would not have seen the connection with the vampires. I mean, FANGLESS ???? Give me a break! <br /> <br /> Second bad point: what about Metal? It seems that all the young people, but mainly the so-called "vampires", are in various types of Metal, mainly for their shirts! Do not get me wrong, I've been in the most extreme forms of music for almost 15 years, but nobody is going to scare me by showing me some ridiculous teenagers in Iron Maiden (of all the bands !!!) T- Shirts running around, getting go through vampires! "Pathetic" is the only word I can use here. <br /> <br /> Third weakness: the actors. Wait a minute. What actors? You mean the director's wooden friends! The words would be a waste here. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's okay, the movie is very bloody, but what difference does that make? It would have been a strong point and something to enjoy if the "brilliant" director had not chosen to create an ARTIFICIAL vampire theme in this movie. I wanted to see the vampires, but they treated me with some stupid-looking kids that I would have loved to use my baseball bat. The filmmakers should have just publicized the movie by saying "cheap B grade horror without argument, but with a lot of blood"! <br /> <br /> This movie is a blasphemy against the whole concept of vampirism. And it makes me sick.
