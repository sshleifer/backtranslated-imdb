this film tries to be immensely intelligent, and like Tarantino <br /> <br /> before trying that, however, you need solid filmic foundations. These include good sound, editing, scenario design, etc. <br /> <br /> lets talk about the sound in this movie. absolutely atrocious I've never been more distracted by a soundtrack, never <br /> <br /> and before we talk about the low budget, a movie made in Chile, etc., remember that the sound of sound these days is much more feasible of what it is. It has always been anywhere. and more information about the technique is available than ever <br /> <br /> The sound in this movie is just bad. The foley in particular is out of place and is inadequate at all times, the environment is equally terrible. I heard at least four strong clicks during the movie, which are the result of poor sound editing. The sound inside the cars is horrible, the sound of the doors closing is horrible. The sound of the lady singing is wrong. Foley is overboard, or simply is not there, as the sound person got bored and gave up. the spaces are wrong everything is wrong <br /> <br /> and, however, not letting the limitations of creativity get in the way, at the same time the film tries to be bold. For example, the sound of the aquarium is used in the next scene of the street. We hear the sound when we're not supposed to. Sound editions precede visual cuts. All the tricks of the book are used and, however, the basics are simply not there <br /> <br /> Regarding editing, we have scenes that use heavy jump cuts, we have touch-ups with the timeline, etc. ., etc., yawn. All these techniques are imitated to a splendidly low standard <br /> <br /> In general, the mix is ​​crap, the sound is crap. And so, the movie is crap. How can it be considered a film with so many fundamental flaws for awards and high praise? The new cinematographic wave of Chile? The best creative outlet that Chile has to offer? I hope not, and I do not think so. <br /> <br /> My theory is that Chile's most selective and best talent avoided this film like the plague, perhaps due to its high content. equally, it is likely that the film has received so much praise from critics of the so-called "world cinema" enthusiasts for the same and dirty reasons. You are likely to delight in your garbage. Of course, film critics rarely pay attention to technical details and quality. <br /> <br /> This movie is garbage. It's all mouth and no pants and never deserves a grade of 6.8. The film has all the production quality of a cheap Tarantino, a new wave inspired by porn!
