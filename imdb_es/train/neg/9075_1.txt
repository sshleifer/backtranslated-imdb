The Slackers titled in this film are three college friends, Dave, Jeff and Sam (Devon Sawa, Michael Maronna and Jason Segel, respectively), who are about to graduate from college without going through an honest exam but successfully finishing . This continues until the end when it is unpleasant, but the most sympathetic character in the movie Nathan (Schwartzman) realizes what they are doing. Nathan begins to blackmail to recover with the girl of his dreams, since he can not pursue that under normal conditions. The only problem is that when the trio starts working on him, Dave falls in love with the beautiful and kind-hearted Angela (James King). Unfortunately, it is not a brilliant genre film. Schwartzman makes seeing the movie easy, since his acting is brilliant. King's performance is average, I think she was hired just to be with her beautiful appearance. The Slackers remembers American Pie with a different address. The jokes are as superficial as in American Pie. But are not they all used? I think this film is a warning for filmmakers of the genre who are running out of originality. In general, some smiling moments, but a horrible movie in terms of acting (except for Schwartzman) and theme. * outside *****
