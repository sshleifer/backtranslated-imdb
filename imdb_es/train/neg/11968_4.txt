This is simply typical of Bruce Willis, schtick action movie. Look at it with some popcorn and your friends. Rent it, to save money. <br /> <br /> None of that is realistic. The battles are not realistic. The soldiers are not realistic. The victims are not realistic. And why did Tom Skerritt's character talk to Willis from the DECK OF THE CARRIER? What's up with that? Can not he do that from inside the ship? <br /> <br /> Of course, Bruce W. has a machete wound. There are a lot of average explosions. <br /> <br /> If this movie accurately represents the Navy SEALS, then do not stay in Africa waiting for them to come and rescue you. <br /> <br /> The noble attack In the town it bothered me more. "The seats in the first row for an ethnic cleansing" ... while Bruce watches the killing that is happening in the city. So what does he do? He crawls towards the city on his belly. Yes. How many died while they were circling? Oh, well ... I guess a corpse count was needed. <br /> <br /> And if that African man was so important, why did not he get on the helicopter with the elderly and the children? Can you say "Duh"? <br /> <br /> Finally, the movie was very dark. Not only in the plot, but much happens at night that it was difficult to distinguish what was happening. <br /> <br /> Rent it.
