I am a Christian who generally believes in the theology taught in Left Behind. That said, I think Left Behind is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> To have a good movie, you need to have a well-written script. Left Behind was very bad at this. On the one hand, it draws radically from the book. Sometimes this is done to condense a 400-page novel into a two-hour movie, but in this film I saw changes that made no sense. <br /> <br /> Another thing is that there is no character development. When the characters in the story are saved (I will not say who), the book makes it clear that it is a long and soul-searching process. In the film it is fast and artificial. The book is pretty decently written where people like Rayford Steele, Buck Williams and Hattie Durham seem real, but in the movie the scenarios are given a quick treatment without anything important. In another scene in which a character gets angry for being left behind (again, I will not say who), it seems artificial. <br /> <br /> I realize that, as a Christian, I find it uninspiring to say that I did not like this movie. , but I can not, in good conscience, recommend a movie that I think was horribly done. Maybe it would have been better to convert the first book into 2-3 movies. Either way, Christians must realize that to be taken seriously as filmmakers, we must begin by putting together a film in a quality way. I realize that there has probably been a lot of effort in Left Behind, but I see it that way.
