THE CHOKE (also known as AX in the UK) is a slasher supposedly produced as a movie directly on DVD. I say "supposedly" because the title of the film does not have the "V" in parentheses to indicate that it was a movie for DVD (although it has the appearance of one). <br /> <br /> The plot is simple ?? A band is giving a concert in an old meat packing factory and they are killed one by one. <br /> <br /> I think most would agree that the movie was never going to be a masterpiece, but this does not justify the flaws here. Even direct DVD movies, such as BACHELOR PARTY MASSACRE (which has a very low IMDb rating) have many redeeming qualities and are sometimes considered one of the so-called "so bad that they are good" movies. However, THE CHOKE is far from being a serious shooter (like HALLOWEEN) or a movie "so bad that it's good" (like THE NAIL GUN MASSACRE). <br /> <br /> The movie starts good with a character killed using a drill. The effects on the blood were very cheesy but understandable given the very low budget. But, from then on, it's downhill at all times. <br /> <br /> There are so many flaws in THE CHOKE that I could spend all day talking about them. But, a few obvious ones stand out and I'll go into them. <br /> <br /> The concert mentioned above that the band supports seems to start with around 50 people present but after the music stops, it seems that there are only about 8 people left (and yet, all of them they are meant to be locked!). <br /> <br /> The characters in this movie are not pleasant at all. Most of the band members are aggressive or just plain weird idiots. Nobody really cares what happens to them, and even their supposed friends forget about them when they have been sent. The highlight of the film is the presence of a homeless man who seems to consider the meat packing factory as a kind of church (seriously!). He spits out some really funny lines for no apparent reason. But, unfortunately, even his presence can not save the film. <br /> <br /> There are too many scenes of people walking and talking without any characterization. About 65 minutes of the film is spent watching the characters walking talking. The characters disappear for long periods of time without explanation. As in other movies directly on DVD like CROCODILE and GRIM WEEKEND, the characters spend a lot of time swooning aggressively without any provocation. There are a lot of excessive outbursts (mainly of the male characters) and one almost results in a full-fledged fight. In fact, you could say that the format is as follows: the characters walk around - the murder happens, the characters walk around - the murder happens. You have the idea <br /> <br /> The dialogue is terrible and it seems that few lines are spoken without the word f being used. Maybe this was thought to be fun, but it just becomes sad. And more specifically, we've all seen this a thousand times before (usually with a much greater effect). <br /> <br /> The film is totally devoid of suspense. The dead bodies serve to provide the only indication that the characters are in danger. A maniac runs loose, and yet the characters simply behave like total idiots. They make a small attempt to leave the factory or find a weapon to protect themselves with. And most of the time, they do not even pretend to be scared. <br /> <br /> In the same vein as DRIVE-IN MASSACRE, the killer is not seen at the time the murders are committed (with the exception of the final murder when the murderer's identity is revealed). A random weapon appears out of nowhere to kill the victim in question. There is no one seen stalking the characters at any time. In DRIVE-IN MASSACRE, this served to make the movie fun (involuntarily, of course), but here it's not fun at all. <br /> <br /> And, as another critic has pointed out, the soundtrack includes music that is very bad, even for those who like punk rock. The extras seem uncomfortable dancing. The score (in the end, there is no music at the beginning!) Consists of a band of aspiring Sugarbabe who sing a very bad song that has nothing to do with the film. <br /> <br /> Do not misunderstand the points Done in this review. This critic likes bad movies (like THE NAIL GUN MASSACRE and BACHELOR PARTY MASSACRE) as well as the classics (like HALLOWEEN and Friday THE 13TH). But, it seems that THE CHOKE tried too hard to fit into one of those categories without fitting in either. And even in the case of DVD movies, this is a poor effort. <br /> <br /> On a positive note, the film contains some pretty good bloody murder scenes. But when the surviving characters do not take the situation seriously, these scenes lose their importance quickly as the intensity they provide disappears into oblivion. <br /> <br /> Fans of the traditional movie films of the 1980s should take steps to avoid this movie. And fans of classics like HALLOWEEN and Friday THE 13TH should do everything possible to avoid it!
