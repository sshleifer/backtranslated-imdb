Whoever wrote the "good" post about this must have been a friend of these guys. This is bad even for the backyard fight. In fact, this is not a yard fight, actually, it's some guys who hit each other on a trampoline. Each person has approximately 45 lb of moisture and there is not an ounce of entertainment value in this. They are just a few boring kids who even give shipyards a bad name, if that's possible. If you want to see some entertaining fight in the backyard, choose Backyard Wrestling A Pleasure for Pain. It stars the 2 most important names in BYW, MDogg20 and Josh Prohibition. These guys are good. Actually, they have been since they cultivated it and have trained professionally as "real" professional wrestlers. They were legitimate and they have improved. I recommend taking a look at those 2 guys. MDogg is crazy and off the hook. So do not waste your time or your cash on this shitty DVD, there are "best" videos in the backyard.
