This must be one of the worst movies I've seen. Actually I was expecting a bad movie, but I was surprised, even if you did not believe it. The story is the traditional, all clich√©s are included. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is so badly written that you really laugh when the actors, otherwise, of half a descent, try to make it sound real. The picture is not very good, the music is so bad that it really pissed me off, the actors do not even try, although the script makes it almost impossible to expect more from people who have been acting for 30 years and the so-called action Actually, the scenes lack the "action" itself. <br /> <br /> I do not understand why this kind of bad movies keep coming, who finances this shit? Where is the projection? And why on earth do the actors assume this impossible mission script? <br /> <br /> There are a million Hollywood movies in this genre without even aspiring to get to theaters, but even to them, Straight To Video, things really get to be seen. Professional in comparison. <br /> <br /> I can not say anything positive about this, except the title that explains everything, I feel deprived of 2 hours of my life.
