After Mafia boss Vic Moretti (the late great Anthony Franciosa) kills his lady who has been cheating on Derek, his new Vietnamese driver / veterinarian, and blames the poor man, Derek is in the jail where he has to deal with a corrupt director, the prisoner brother of Vic who runs the jail and, oh yes, illegal experiments carried out by a CIA agent (great lead actor and first director John Saxon) to convert several prisoners in invincible superhuman zombies. Of course, things get out of control and it's up to Derek, and the rest of the prisoners who have not changed, to save the day after the infected take prison. <br /> <br /> John Saxon is a great talented actor and as a director, Saxon is a ... great talented actor. To say that this movie (John's only directional output to date) lacks a certain visual style would be a little underestimated. However, the film is not totally without merit. The dialogue, although it is idiotic, is bad enough to be humorous at times. Unfortunately, this is not really enough for the film to slide just for that and it takes forever for the movie to start appearing as its own (which is rather late in the movie). As such, the most I can recommend about this film is to say that if you're a Saxon fan (which I actually am), it's worth seeing, just come in with low expectations and you should be fine. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Dana Lis Mason and Tane McClure stay topless <br /> <br /> My rating: D +
