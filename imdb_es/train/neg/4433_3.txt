I really wanted to like this movie a lot more than me. That's because I love the strange foreign comedies, especially the strange ones that surprise you completely. However, although this often surprised me, these were never pleasant surprises. It reminded me of South Park in the sense that almost EVERY social norm was violated until the only ones left to board were too sick to be funny. For example, after exploring adultery, drug abuse (of almost all types, ranging from pot, heroin, speed to inhaling glue), prostitution, S & M, suicide, murder, etc., the film came to the hilarious topic (?) Of pedophilia Mama encouraged her son (who seemed to be around 12 years old) to sleep with neighboring men. In fact, at one point in the movie, she gives this dentist to the dentist instead of paying for dental work! Funny?! You got to be kidding. This movie simply goes too far and goes into the "black hole of comedy". What should be mocked next, cancers or rectal tumors?
