<br /> <br /> Ok, well, I rented this movie while I was in bed, I jumped on painkillers, and let me tell you that it did not help the movie at all. <br /> <br /> The film is about a man who buys a car while going through a midlife crisis, loves the car more than anything around him, one day his wife decides to borrow it. Since I do not want to spoil (not that there is anything to ruin), I will let your imagination discover the "Zany" antics (and I use that word lightly) that follow. <br /> <br /> I had to fight to stay awake through this snoring for a minute sleeping in a movie, and I would like to say that if you are venturing into the movie store and are thinking of being adventurous, do not do it, It is a waste of the movie. printed. <br /> <br /> Then again I could be wrong ...
