Almost 30 years have passed and I STILL hate everyone involved in this movie. It's still the worst movie I've seen. <br /> <br /> Before seeing this, I never cared much about Rivers, in one way or another. After watching this movie, I have an allergic reaction when I accidentally see it on television. <br /> <br /> I was dragged into this, against my better judgment, by the pressure of my colleagues. However, when leaving the theater, those friends swore that they would never override my choice of film. Almost thirty years later, we still have mental scars from this movie. <br /> <br /> On my deathbed, one of my regrets will be the time I lost waiting for this movie to get better. He never did. <br /> <br /> If you are ever given a choice, you would prefer to put your own eyes on this movie. <br /> <br /> I registered for the IMDb comments right on the I hope you might be able to warn others against watching this movie. If I can prevent only one person from seeing this, then my existence on this earth will have been justified.
