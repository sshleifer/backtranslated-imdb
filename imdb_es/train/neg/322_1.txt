I saw this movie about 5 years ago, and its memory still haunts me until today. I was fully aware of how horrible it was supposed to be, so I'm only to blame for myself. But like most, I did not believe in all the negativity. Being a Sandler fan, it seemed inconceivable that one of his films could really be that bad. I figured they were just Sandler's enemies. I could not have been more wrong. <br /> <br /> What we have here is a comedy that does not contain a second of anything funny. That is really an achievement. One would think that in a 90-minute comedy, they might have accidentally come across something even remotely funny. But no, it's just horrible. It's not "so bad is good", it's just bad. You can not laugh at how bad it is, you can only cry. You patiently wait for a joke that will at least make you laugh, but they never arrive. <br /> <br /> Have you seen the movie The Ring? Where do people watch a videotape and die 7 days later? If this movie appeared on the videotape, people would die instantly, by their own hand, and there would be a smile on their face as they realized that their agony is over, and that would be the first smile since they pressed play. <Br /> <br /> You may be inclined to see him just to see how bad he is, unable to stop his curiosity. Do not do it. Please do not do it. Trust me, I'm doing you a favor. There are 2 types of people in the world, those who think that Going Overboard is the worst movie that has been made and those that have not yet seen it.
