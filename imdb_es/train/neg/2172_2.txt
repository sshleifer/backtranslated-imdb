Bottom of the canyon, unimaginative, and remake practically remade of THE ROAD WARRIOR. This film follows the exact plot as the Philippine film STRYKER and is much worse. Bad performance, dialogue, effects, dubbing, rhythm, sequences of actions ... The list goes on and on. Italy literally did dozens of Road Warrior scams in the early 80s, some good, some bad. This is the worst thing by far, there is no contest. Not only the mood of the film was completely bleak and miserable, but the experience of sitting through it is a bore and a half. There was 1 (one) good chase sequence towards the beginning of the movie, and a great picture of a man holding a hand grenade exploding. But EVERYTHING else about this movie sucks seriously! To have fun after the nuclear weapons, go find a copy of ENDGAME, AFTER THE FALL OF NEW YORK, or ESCAPE OF THE BRONX. They are much nicer than this garbage.
