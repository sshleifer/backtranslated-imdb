As there was nothing wrong with the performance, etc., the writing of the episode is very far from this ghost of the series or any ghost. It was a waste of 42 minutes to see the Martian hunter man. You have to know that in the middle of the sixth series, no matter what happens, it is not true what is happening and does not really contribute anything to the story of the series, except the encounter with the Martian Men's Hunter and losing 30 minutes to Doing this is by far another case of poor writing in the smallville soap opera. I really like the program, but mainly because of the cast and the 3 or more good episodes that are presented each year, but whoever is in the writing cast that works or who used to work on the soap must be canned. This was, by far, one of the worst. With the first 4 minutes, you know that what is happening is false and that everything that happens is a dream based on Clark's imposition, obviously caused by a character in the phantom zone, and when he wakes up, he will win and blah, blah, blah, so the writers will not do it. I have to really create a villain who will progress in the story line this week. He may also have added another villain to die in the last episode in which the Martian Men's Hunter was found and made him fly again or return and tell Clark that he forgot his sunglasses to look more closely at this episode and say it's a day.
