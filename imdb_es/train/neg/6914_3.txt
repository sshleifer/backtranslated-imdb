I saw this movie a while ago (while working on a trailer for the movie producer) and it was TERRIBLE. Hewitt is, at best, mediocre, Hopkins telephones his performance in (but still blows Hewitt in his scenes) and Alec seems bored. Trust me: you should avoid this movie like the plague if it ever premieres. It seems to continue forever as the tired plot develops at a snail's pace. It is implacably ungraceful, the cinematography is horrible and the direction is pedestrian. Alec Baldwin should go to film school if he plans to run again. In terms of his performance, his character is totally unpleasant, which makes it impossible to root him. Dan Ackroyd is quite funny and the surprising composition of the jury near the end of the film is cute, but this movie is just horrible.
