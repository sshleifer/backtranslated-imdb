In a word ... abysmal. I give it a star for the hippie sex scenes and the candy women, otherwise, forget it. The worst effort of Corman, without exception. Ben Vereen should have had his name permanently erased from the cast. I can not believe it's now on DVD (as of 2/15/05) with "Wild In The Streets", another stinky retro. I got up sick in bed this morning with a cold, I decided to watch a movie to cheer me up, I scanned the digital channels ... the premise seemed quite interesting because I like to watch science fiction films, hippie culture and rebels. teen movies. It seemed familiar in some way and with Ben Vereen in the cast, I thought ... why not? What a big mistake ... it was a horrible start to my day. <br /> <br /> Only after seeing it, now I know why familiarity slipped through the recesses of my newly awakened brain. I remembered seeing the next attractions for this film at age 14 (I'm 45), in the early / mid-seventies at the Sombrero, a local art theater that no longer exists ... the whole theater laughed hysterically and even He complained loudly about how bad this movie looked. Acting: terrible, history: horrible, cinematography: almost horrible, music: terrible, sound: horrible, directing: a joke. If you decide to see this after my warning, remember ... "I told you so." <br /> <br /> "Gass-sss" is the perfect title for this movie ... you feel "gassed" after watching this putrid movie, or maybe you should be taken to a "gas" chamber to waste your brain. I've seen Super 8 homemade movies that embarrass this movie. Definitely a new addition to my Top Ten WORST movies of all time ... it's up there (er, down there) with "Tentacles". <br /> <br /> Ted in Gilbert, AZ
