'1408' is the latest combination of cheap scare tactics. The kind that could make movie-themed horror fans sometimes jump in their seats and scream in their ear, but disappoint audiences who are looking for some depth and direction. <br /> <br /> John Cusak plays a writer who has made a career. to write books that describe his experiences of staying in enchanted, rumored hotels. Despite the assurances of sponsors and owners that ghosts roam the halls, there is little to make him a true believer in the paranormal. When he learns the history of room 1408 at the Overlook Hotel, without waiting, I mean Dolphin Hotel in New York City, he decides it would be the perfect final chapter for his latest book. However, Samuel L. Jackson, who plays the hotel's owner, tries to dissuade his guest by narrating the atrocities that have occurred in the room since the hotel opened its doors many years ago. The story is simple and we, as possible skeptics, must sit through Jackson's prolonged prolongation. <br /> <br /> In other words: be afraid! Be very afraid! <br /> <br /> Of course, it would be easy to convince the public that they just paid to see a thriller on the edge of the seat if it did not take so long to build. at this point. And also, if what followed was much more than cheap "boos" that become so frequent and arbitrary that eventually, they are likely to wait. The temperature in the room changes automatically. The walls drip with blood. The intrepid writer can not open the door, etc. And after almost an hour and a half of delivering them to the promised audiences great emotions, you can sit back and hope that at least you will be surprised by the end. With suspicions of sequences of dreams and other losses of time derived, even that fails to calm our doubts that before the film ends, we could finally have something to make the film a little less than completely forgettable. <br /> <br /> Despite Cusak's great performances (as always), which essentially is the full movie, most of the prominent people are wasted (ie, Samuel L. Jackson) in insignificant minor roles. The real mystery here is how this movie received such a high viewer rating. Ghosts stuffed with ballots?
