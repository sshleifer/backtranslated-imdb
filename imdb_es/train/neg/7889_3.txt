I just finished watching this movie. It was not ridiculously bad, but I'm really disappointed with that. I'm not really sure why someone would make a movie like this. It was a little entertaining, but I think the people who did it had a lot of disagreement about what they were doing. On Monday, the writer was in charge; Tuesday, the director; Wednesday, the boy who drinks the coffee; It almost seems like they really wanted to make a couple of different movies, but they only had time and money to make one. <br /> <br /> Someone else commented that the performance was really good, but I would have disagreed. On the other hand, if the actors could maintain a serious face during the filming, they may be better actors than I give them credit for. <br /> <br /> The back of the DVD gives the impression that the film is a mystery ... something like a historical Law and Order or a National Treasure. It starts like this, but then, out of nowhere, it turns around a bad Twilight Zone episode, or ... what was that other show that was not so good ... A bad episode of The Outer Limits? . <br /> <br /> My main complaint about the film is that it is very developed. There's the evil guy with spiked white hair. There's the love interest, which, when it first appears, the wind blows through your hair. Seriously. Once you realize that it is a Christian movie, the ending is also quite easy to see. <br /> <br /> The cinematography was badly done, especially in the initial scenes: a way to put your best foot forward. It was not atrocious for most of the movie, but there was the occasionally ridiculously bad picture of an old woman praying, with her arms raised in a dark room while the lighting is amazing, the kind of things that only make you ashamed a little. be watching the movie
