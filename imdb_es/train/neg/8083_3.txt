Rejected by Richard C. Sarafian, this disaster stunned Japanese theaters before going to the States and immediately went to the video, where it was never seen again until Turner's networks needed more than infomercials to fill their spaces from 3 a.m. to 6 p.m. I found this tape in the bottom of his trash can. It is assumed that Smithee's name should be used when the studio pirates the film in such a way that the director no longer wants his name added. But I'm afraid that Sarafian can not blame the studio completely for this. The actors, mostly fresh graduates of "Overacting 101", deliver one cornball line after another. The plot is convoluted. The special effects are unimpressive. The parts that are not ridiculous are simply boring. The script or the book must have been good. Why, if not, Palance, Matheson, Boyle or Heston accept to appear in this problem? But something went terribly wrong from the page to the screen. Summary: Avoid. Not even bad enough to be so bad, it's good.
