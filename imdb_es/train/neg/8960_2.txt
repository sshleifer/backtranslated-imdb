The only thing that comes to my mind frequently as I write this review is that I will never return to that hour and a half. to indicate that I'm not just blowing air, I'll compare the movie with the other films in the cube trilogy (cube and hypercube). The cube was not very good, but it was original and that compensated some technical failures. Hypercube As a sequel lost the advantage of originality but it came out quite sharp and I even liked it better than the cube (the story was better)! But the zero cube compared to its predecessors really is not worth a complete lack of good fx, a very f * ck * d script and simply the bad performance in the old one does not combine well! Example: all the time during the movie I thought it would be incredibly stupid if ... it happened and then it happened, so it's not very original either! My advice: do not lose that hour and a half that I lost !!!!!!!! Oh, and I hope this movie falls and burns !!!!!!!
