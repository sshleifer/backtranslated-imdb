Two old men sitting on a park bench. I really have no problem with this scene. The only problem is that it's not a scene, it's the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Yup's movies do not have a lower concept than this one. They are also not bored more than this, but it is worse that they come because these two old ones are chalk and cheese. One is Nat Moyer, who is a Yiddish communist, while the other is Midge Carter, a former gold glove champion who is also black. Let me see now, a Jew and a black man sitting on a park bench get along. Well, I suppose it's possible but unlikely, but if this movie has such a harmless scenario, why play with the Jewish stereotype? Why make them noisy taxers who make Hebrew oaths? A bit ironic that the Jews who saw each other at the beginning of the film are exactly the kind of Jews that were seen in the Nazi propaganda films in the 1930s. <br /> <br /> In addition to the stereotypes, the problem with I'M NOT RAPPAPORT is that `Written for a totally different medium from cinema, it is based on a play and shows. Walter Matthau walks at night through his role as Nat, while this commentator almost sleeps the entire movie.
