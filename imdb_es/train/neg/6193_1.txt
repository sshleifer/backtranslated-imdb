I can not believe I just spent an hour and a half watching such a weak movie. If there is only one movie that you should miss, this is the only one. <br /> <br /> Robert is a teenager whose father died recently, so he starts dating some local antisocial teenagers and uses drugs. All this makes him unconsciously more violent and, finally, exploits such a subconscious ... <br /> <br /> The first thing is that I do not think I can find any sense or trace of great ecstasy in this film, not in any character only. If the director considers what I saw in the last minutes as a great ecstasy, I must say that he is not even close. <br /> <br /> The use of cinematography is not mature either. Most of the time I could not see any facial expression from the actors and I did not feel that the body language was enough to make an impact. Maybe the team was so tired that they fixed the camera there to include everything in the configuration. All happy except the public. <br /> <br /> The plot is particularly weak. There are many unrelated scenes and conversations that might be related, but in reality they are so random that you can never unite them all, perhaps unless you are the one who wrote them. <br /> <br /> In the hour and a half you can find less than 5 minutes of real action and the rest of the time there are only people walking, talking and moving. So I really can not comment on the performance here. <br /> <br /> Good music choice in the last minutes. Maybe this is the only good thing. <br /> <br /> I have never given a movie to 1, but this movie certainly deserves it (at least you laugh when you watch scary movies). This is a film about when an unsuccessful attempt to portray troubled teens meets an extremely disturbed audience. I hope you do not fall into any of the groups.
