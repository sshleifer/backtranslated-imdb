I really wanted to see this movie. It's a good family movie; however, if the editing team of Michael Landon Jr. did a better editing job, the film would be much better. Too many scenes out of context. I hope there is another movie in the series, they are all very good. But, if another is done, I beg you to be more careful in editing. This story was everywhere and it did not seem to have a center. Which is unfortunate because the other movies in the series were great. I enjoy the story of Willie and Missy; Both are great role models. In addition, the romantic side of the spectators always enjoys a good love story.
