In standard view, this is a purely horrible movie. However, he scores an almost perfect score on the scale of involuntary comedy. I can think of some real comedies that make me laugh as loud as I did watching this movie. The ghost of Andy Griffith dressed in Native American attire makes me hysterical every time. I would not spend the fuel or the energy driving to the video store to rent it, but if you're lying on the couch at 3 in the morning and it's on TV, take a look.
