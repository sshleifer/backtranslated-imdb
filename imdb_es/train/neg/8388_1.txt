This moving story of hope arrives. I hope you never have to endure something so horrible again. * cough * Razzie Award * cough * <br /> <br /> I did not like this movie because it was not funny, it was predictable and inane. As I watched, I felt like I was in a psychology experiment to determine how low the movie standards could be before people complained. When I asked for the money back at the end of the movie, they informed me that because I had seen everything "I had no right to a refund". The assistant manager told me that several people had already complained and received reimbursements. <br /> <br /> The summary of the movie is pretty basic. The dwarf thief steals a diamond and does it like a baby to elude the police. Underneath this intelligent scheme, however, is a repertoire of original parodies, fresh and hilarious. Or not. <br /> <br /> Ask yourself the following: Do you like to see people being hit by frying pans? Do you like fart jokes? Do you like to see the dwarves posing as babies threatened with a thermometer in the anus? Do you like tired racial jokes? Do you think babies say 'goo goo goo goo goo gaa gaa'? Do you drool? <br /> <br /> If you answered 'yes' to any of the questions above, then this movie is definitely for you. Although it has been announced in some places as "The worst movie of the decade", there is probably a movie or two that is worse ... somewhere. I can not say for sure. I gave this film 2 stars because we all know that a review with only one star would indicate bias on the part of the reviewer and then the review would not be taken seriously. <br /> <br /> This low intensity comedy is aimed at a less intelligent audience and I can not, with good conscience, recommend it to anyone. Save money for something fun. <br /> <br /> Respect
