I love the representation of the 30s and 40s in the cinema. I love Salma Hayek. I was more than ready to love this photo. but . . . <br /> <br /> BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! ! ! !! ! <br /> <br /> No sir, nothing good about this. The only entertaining aspect for me was that the character of Colin Farrell is an insecure writer and this script, despite addressing the juicy issue of racism, approaches the audience as an ABC Afterschool Special. <br /> <br /> The only person who did not seem to be "acting" was Sutherland, and his minutes were few. <br /> <br /> Focus on a weary plot.
