I do not agree with much of what has been written and said about this supposed "masterpiece" of the German New Wave: <br /> <br /> 1) There are major flaws in simple exposure, in basic communication of the critical points of the plot, as related to the abortion of Mary and the secret contract between Oswald and her husband. How many spectators understood that the husband accepted, in exchange for a substantial financial remuneration, not return and claim his wife until Oswald died? <br /> <br /> 2) The ending is highly unsatisfactory because it is arbitrary and accidental. The original script required that Maria commit suicide after reading Oswald's will, upon discovering that her husband had sold his marriage to Oswald. In the final version, however, Maria only runs water from a tap through her wrist in a gesture of suicide. Then Maria is completely exploited, instead of having to face and live with the consequences of her self-deception and moral commitment. <br /> <br /> 3) Fassbinder seeks to superimpose by force the public in the private, the political in the private. the staff. Contrary to what critics and "experts" say, I do not think it works. The simple invasion of historical radio news or the sound of pneumatic hammers of German reconstruction on the soundtrack of the dramatic events of the film does not make these historical events an integral part of the drama. <br /> <br /> The selfish ambition of Maria's rise from poverty to prosperity is destined to parallel the so-called economic miracle of post-war Germany. Mar√≠a, therefore, pretends to be a specific woman for her time and place, but in reality it is not original or specific. Women have been asserting their independence through the use of sex for self-advancement for years. <br /> <br /> 4) Finally, there are several cases of inexcusable carelessness and lack of fondness: Fassbinder's drug addiction and the consequent impatience and lack of attention have had their effect. Unknown people talk off the screen without ever being seen; Music is awkwardly intrusive in some places; and the melodramatic posture sporadically replaces the performance. <br /> <br /> Strangely enough, a film that condemns a country for voluntary collective amnesia of the holocaust never mentions it once.
