This is cataloged as a documentary, it is not, it is filmed as a documentary, but I suspect it was only because they came out with an unstable camera and an unreliable film. This was just released in the UK on DVD as a "American Pie-style comedy". It is not that either. <br /> <br /> Basically, he follows a group of teenagers on spring break when they go to Mexico in search of alcohol. And with the mission to get there, the virgin friend finally arrived. Throw is a pair of dwarves, also in the same type of search and you have a non-hilarious story of drunken teenagers trying to get some girls. <br /> <br /> Considering the rating of 18, this has very little nudity, and Virtually zero sex scenes, mainly I suppose that the rating is to swear of which there are many. <br /> <br /> If you like Jackass's crude behavior without humor, then this may be your thing, if you have brain cells. left then I would probably avoid this!
