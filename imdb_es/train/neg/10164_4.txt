I just saw this at the Venice Film Festival and I can not decide. We were never allowed to get close enough to any of the characters to care about them. Maybe that was the point, that we are all in a "bubble" of our own, but these people did not force me to worry about them or to scandalize their different destinies. In a run time of just over an hour, the characters were not very well developed. A lot of time was devoted to taking factory equipment (forklifts, conveyor belts, shovels); and the slightly spooky-looking baby dolls with surprisingly real eyes, that most of the characters made their living, were somehow more interesting than the living people. An interesting experiment, but somehow never joined.
