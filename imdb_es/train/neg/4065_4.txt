... through Eric Stanze's similar antics. A director not particularly talented has directed a film not particularly good, however, I still found the final credits, if only to see what happens next. <br /> <br /> A rapist escapes from prison and calls his old flame. After capturing her (although she came voluntarily) and threatening to have sex (another event that she was also willing to do), he reveals that he has kidnapped three guys who did it wrong in the past. Then he decides to kill her (huh?), But is frustrated and dies instead. The girl's mind breaks (or something like that) and she gets mad at the unfortunate guys in the basement. <br /> <br /> Okay, the writing sucks: it's long and loaded with ten-cent words. It's too much of that. <br /> <br /> The performance sucks: what minute, what is acting? <br /> <br /> The filming stinks: the home video is bad enough, but 20 minutes of images from the cemetery are just a damn insult. <br /> <br /> And the budget is a joke: get it ... 'budget', that was the key phrase. <br /> <br /> And, however, there was a charm in the thing. In the 70s, these types of films appeared in theaters with real budgets and talents, not in this era. If you want to see this type of violent and sexually exploitative garbage (do not lie, some of us do), then this is all you'll get today. <br /> <br /> Some short scenes about a sex scene, Torture with fecal material, fun with axes, anal rape with a broomstick and a long shot of the crazy girl who masturbates with the same Broomstick are some of the best menu items. <br /> <br /> It's not good and it will not be remembered, but not since the apogee of Joe D'amato, people have made movies like this. <br /> <br /> 4/10
