Well, what was fun ... except for the fun part. <br /> <br /> It's my second favorite, I even thought it was worse than 'Lazarus' and 'Ghost in the Machine'. <Br /> <br /> Let's start with the good. The teaser was incredibly well done and also emotional. Being the great animal lover that I am, it was fun to see so many beautiful animals in this episode. <br /> <br /> But then there's everything wrong, and believe me, there's a lot of that. Little sense, then those animals were kidnapped by aliens and impregnated? qaaa ??? The dialogue was also quite horrible. There were about one or two citable lines. <br /> <br /> And worst of all, having almost all the animals that died was very unpleasant for me. In the end ... what is the point? they all died a lot. We did not learn anything, we did not entertain ourselves, and I could not even find sad Sophia's death ... just very frustrating. <br /> <br /> * star. It's a shame because season 2 was very good.
