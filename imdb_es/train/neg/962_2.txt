Chances are that if I ever saw this again, I could get physically sick, the movie is so annoying ... unless you believe in psychics, reincarnation and the other hocus-pocus that this promotes in a big way. The "recycling of souls", they call it here. Puh-leeze <br /> <br /> This story has been done several times before with movies like "Heaven Can Wait". It has also done much better. Too bad they had to waste the talent of Robert Downey Jr., Cybill Shepherd, Ryan O'Neal and Mary Stuart Masterson. <br /> <br /> At least it is a fairly docile film, in terms of language. That is the only redeeming quality of this movie.
