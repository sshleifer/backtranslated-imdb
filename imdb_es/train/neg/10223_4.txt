I remembered the title so well. For me, it was a Flora Robson movie with Olivier and Vivien Leigh in supporting roles. And I had the voice of Vincent Massey behind mustaches. Well, Flora Robson was great. His next signature, for me, would be "55 days in Beijing." The same paper but with different sumptuous dresses. And the same voice. As for the Navy, it was a subtext. I like black and white movies. Was everything done in Elizbethan sometimes at night? It was talky and hard to understand, sometimes. I could not say what the love interest was. Was it Spanish or was it Vivien Leigh? And I do not think Elizabeth would have been the brilliant strategist to recommend that fire ships be sent against the Navy. Apparently it worked for the Empire, but not for the script. This could have been more accurate, historically, but Bette Davis had more attractive scripts. And I missed the light of day!
