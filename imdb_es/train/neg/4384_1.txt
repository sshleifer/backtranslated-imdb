The fact that someone has spent money on such a bad script, surpasses me. This really should be one of the worst movies, besides "Haunted Highway" I've seen. BAD actors, and a very bad story. There are no normal reactions to any event in this film, and although it is Halloween, normal people would have greater reactions when they witness how they kill their father, not to mention people with tape covering their airways, unable to breathe. (In a room with at least 50 people I might add) and some person dressed as Satan dragging dead people out of their house, even an 8 year old would see the difference between a doll and a person. Not to mention the fact that no one could be so naive and foolish as to believe the reality of Satan and the appearances of Jesus on the same day, as this child does. When I was 8 years old, I had more brains than that. <br /> <br /> But, the really stupid thing is that everyone else seems to be in love with this aspect of silent Satan, without questions. The question throughout the film is, is it really Satan, or is it a crazy person who kills people whenever he wants to? Well, he has human hands, arms, construction and whatever, so I guess he's also supposed to be in the movie, otherwise they did a horrible job hiding it. Then, with this person being human and everything, he was able to kill an old woman, a man and her lover, 5 (ยก? ยก?) Policemen (all with weapons and training, I suppose), and some other people. ... and obviously, everyone was there waiting for him, or what? <br /> <br /> The whole concept and the way of telling the story is absolutely the worst I've seen, and I would never recommend it to anyone who loses 1 hour and 30 minutes of their life to see this total shit.
