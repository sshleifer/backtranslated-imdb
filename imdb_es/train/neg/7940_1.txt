Guy de Maupassant was a novelist who wrote a novel about a man, a poor man, without moral qualities. I just wanted to succeed in a society where all people, politicians, businessmen, journalists, women are corrupt. The only king is money. Maupassant's hero, Charles Forestier, is rising higher and higher on the scale of society thanks to his poser of seduction. He is in love with all the women who could help him in his action to climb the stirrup of society. At the end of the novel, he married the daughter of the owner of a larger newspaper, in the largest church in Paris: "La Madeleine". "Le Tout Paris" is there. He has a fortune and more, he will become a member of Parliament and later a minister. The "useless" women are out of sight, but he is always in touch with beautiful and useful women. The image "THE PRIVATE ISSUES OF BEL AMI" is a story of MORALITY. It's everything, but not a story in Maupassant's idea. Why had they put "BEL AMI" in their title?
