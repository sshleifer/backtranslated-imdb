Only absolute garbage. I'm a big fan of the Cusacks, this being the only reason I saw this movie, but the only reason I can see its presence was the repetition, in full and deep quality, of its exact roles of Grosse Point Blanc. Apart from that, the role of movies as a political satire fails miserably because it is too obvious for even the stupidest to serve any purpose. And to consider it a satirical satire would be simply an insult even for chimpanzees. Imitation is, apparently, the highest form of adulation, but seeing that it's not about anything near Grosse Point Blanc and in the same league as the Spartans (see if you're an imbecile) in terms of political satire, let's One side well enough alone and let this one fade into the darkness that it absolutely deserves.
