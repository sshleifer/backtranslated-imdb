It's not exactly a new story, but this romantic comedy makes the concept work. A young man (John Cusack) and a beautiful dead woman (Kate Beckinsale) continue to meet by chance and wonder if they are made for each other. Although both promise each other ... oddly enough, they still feel that their soul mate is somewhere. A bit sappy in some places, but live the love. Being a romantic I'm almost forced to be fascinated. My favorite scene is where Cusack is on the ground and the snow begins to fall. The ending is almost too sweet, but more deserving. This is not one of Cusack's deepest roles, but who could not be beaten by Beckinsale. The remarkable support is provided by Jeremy Piven and Molly Shannon. John Corbett plays the worst role in which I've seen him. On the other hand, Eugene Levy is peculiar and funny. Look at this with your soul mate.
