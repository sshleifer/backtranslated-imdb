How do I start? This movie is probably one of the worst movies I've seen. It has no exchangeable qualities. I just sat through this movie and it was a fight. He did not even get a single smile on my face. I find it hard to believe that anyone would distribute this horrible movie. I felt that this movie was a failed attempt at unpleasant humor. The only thing that was worth of this movie was the soundtrack, I'm sure that's the reason why I wanted to see this movie in the first place. I'll finish this because I'm going to try to forget the moment I just did it. wasted with this piece of shit. I leave you with this warning. DO NOT LOOK AT THIS MOVIE, ASPIRE.
