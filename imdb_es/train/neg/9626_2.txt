Do not do anything about it. There are many things wrong with this movie. It's a cliché all the way, it's not very funny, predictable and illogical. Let's start at the beginning: the characters. There is the bored and unfortunate man, who gives Stiller another notch in his boring and unfortunate belt, the alleged savage, but in reality it is quite normal, the love interest, to whom Aniston plays well, but really did not need any effort to do what. jovial friend, and then the assortment of clichés: a reckless and annoying Australian man, a confident Spanish boy, etc. The story: the beginning is a bit unusual, but then it goes to the standard style of any movie, with each plot as predictable as your average joke hit and hit The biggest problem was that the "development" of Stiller's character really seemed to come out of nowhere, like the average game in a school, writers knew where it started and where it ended, but did not invest enough to correctly count the midpoint. Finally, the supposed 'jokes' were no more than highly diluted versions of standard humor; there was a scene of regulatory chunder, sweaty fat men, etc. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, the simple fact of this film is that learning the meaning of the word 'shart' was the only good thing. Hamburg really served a dog's dinner here, and the layer of sugar from Stiller and Aniston may have attracted the spectators, but the taste that was left at the end was just as stale. <br /> <br /> Final comment: This film may have been terrible, but Aniston still chose a better film between seasons of friends than the odious 'Marci X' of Kudrow.
