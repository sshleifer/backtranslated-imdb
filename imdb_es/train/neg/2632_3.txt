It saddens me to rate a movie with many of my favorite actors, places and genres, namely, Douglas, Sutherland, Washington, DC and the political thriller, but 'The Sentinel' really gets to its lowest point. It's as if they had a great idea at the front, they signed the right cast and they had some excellent shots in the city and then they took a vacation letting the remaining crew improvise the rest. And I wish I could blame another bland performance of Basinger (not only do I feel she's one of Hollywood's worst actresses, but I'm still taking care of being the only one, and definitely the only one.) Just bad actor in the movie, to win an acting Oscar for 'LA Confidential'). But she was not the only problem. Sutherland, whom I love as Jack Bauer in '24', once again plays? Jack. I miss his old days 'A Time to Kill' or 'A Few Good Men'. Douglas certainly took a break from acting and called this one. Argument: Someone, some traitor of the Secret Service, wants the President to die and Douglas is (at random) being framed. Will someone believe you? Actually, there is no spoiler here: as fast as they came up with that secondary plot halfway, it ends before you know it. And why does someone (s) want the President to die? Will that be revealed in the sequel? Too many holes in the plot, too many doors open and never closed and too predictable is 'The Sentinel'. If you only watch one movie a year, you may not know who the mole is, but anyone familiar with this type of movie or even seen an episode of 'Law and Order' will know it in the first frames. It was terrible? Not really, the cinematography was good and, even though Sutherland plays Jack again, he still has it.
