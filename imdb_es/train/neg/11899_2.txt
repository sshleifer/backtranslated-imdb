Robert Forster, normally a very strong character actor, is lost here at sea as a New York family man who seeks revenge on the thugs who murdered his son and attacked his wife in an invasion of his home. A fearsome affair exploited by cheapjack emotions in the vein of the "Desire of Death". It is not hard to make fun of these soft procedures: the dialogue is full of howlers, the crime statistics are irrevocably dated and the supporting characters are ridiculously overwritten (particularly a despicable judge who allows an accused murderer to leave his house). the court). The low production is negligible in its own justice, especially because the violence in our cities has only increased. * since ****
