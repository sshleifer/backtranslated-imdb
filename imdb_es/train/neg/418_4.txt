One might wish that an idea as good as the "invisible man" works better and is handled more carefully in the era of fantastic special effects, but this is not the case. The story, the characters and, finally, all the last 20 minutes of the film are almost as recent as a movie of mad scientists of the early 50's. There are some great moments, mainly due to the surprising special effects and the idea of ​​a invisible man that lurks the streets. But, alas! We are soon back in the confinement of the underground laboratory, which means that the rest of the film is not only predictable, but also schematic. <br /> <br /> There have been many remakes of old movies or television shows in the last 10 years, and some of them have their charms. But it is increasingly clear for each film that the idea of ​​putting the old classics under the nose of crazy people like Verhoeven (who has his moments) is very bad. It is obvious that money is the key issue here: the time and energy put into the script are not enough, and as a result, "Hollow Man" is seriously undermined with clichés, sappy characters, predictability and lack of depth. . <br /> <br /> However, what really impressed me, besides the special effects, was the oath. In making this type of film, modern producers are very interested in allowing children to see them. Therefore, language (and, sometimes, violence and sex) is greatly attenuated. When the whole world explodes, the good ones say: "Oh, damn!" and "Oh my God." "Hollow Man" gratefully dismisses that kind of hypocrisy and the characters are free to say what is most natural to them. I'm not saying that the most natural response to something that went wrong is to swear, but it makes it more credible if SOMEONE really swears. I think we can thank Verhoeven for that.
