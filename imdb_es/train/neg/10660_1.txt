I am sorry that the people who call kamal hassan 'ulaganaayakan' for them, ulagam be tollywood! comeon boys ... this movie is a thriller without emotion ... <br /> <br /> get out of your ulagam and just watch some high class thrillers like The Usual Suspects or even The Silence of the Lambs. <br /> <technically fine, but the kamal substance style does not look like a police officer, there is no emotion at all and boring until the end, you may be saving 3 valuable hours of your life if you skip to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Kamal at his best is the best in Tollywood
