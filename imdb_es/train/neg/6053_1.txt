absolutely garbage I liked Halloween and since then Johnny has been in a downward spiral. this is about the wells. we got it, john. The pro-life is scary! You do not have to make a fucking movie that bores me so much to 'tell me'. <br /> <br /> The pace is far from here. It feels like John does not have much to work with here. for your credit it seems you did not write this garbage. There are innumerable occasions when the camera simply sits down and waits for the actors to look silly or say something silly. I love the long cut. Too bad the carpenter does not know how to use it. He needs to sleep with Herzog and Fassbinder 30 years ago. Please, John, stop making a fool of yourself and you bore me to death!
