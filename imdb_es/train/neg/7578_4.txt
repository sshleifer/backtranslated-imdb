Suggesting nothing less than a film version of the 1970s television hit "Love, American Style," adorned with flashes of nudity, "Superchick" (1973) is a light-hearted fuzz that somehow still manages to entertain. And the main character here, Tara B. It's true, it's really a kind of superchick. A stewardess (not flight attendant) who is so pretty that even her plane's autopilot has made her a pass (!), And with a handsome boyfriend in each port, this girl with wings and swing really puts the "position" in " scale". With his friend Germaphobe in New York, his playboy with gangster problems in Miami and his rock star in L.A., Tara keeps busy. And when he's not exhausting these guys from all of his manly energies, as the viewer learns, he's likely to take karate classes, discotheques a mile high, dodging fans and rapists, attending wonderful parties and stopping an attempt to Kidnapping on your plane. As I said, it's a joyful fun, and it's probably good for a night when you feel a bit brain dead and just want to get out in front of the tube. The future astrologer Joyce Jillson brings a vacuous charm to her role as Tara, and the film seems attractive enough to please her. Disappointingly, the great friends of the 70s Uschi Digard and Mary Gavin (also known as Candy Samples) are wasted here in very small roles, but still they can do what they do best: show their chesticles! Although the image is never funny and does not have many thoughts in its metaphorical head, it does manage to be consistently fun, and I suppose that is something. However, it is strange that the final credits draw attention to the body of Mrs. Jillson; Do not think I've seen THAT before!
