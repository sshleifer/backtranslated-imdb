This is a propaganda film against the Serbs made for television. <br /> <br /> "Muslims are good, Orthodox Christian Serbs are BAD." <br /> <br /> That is the message. <br /> <br /> The use of "entertainment" to convey a propaganda message is nothing new. <br /> <br /> This movie puts it on thick paper. <br /> <br /> And, apparently, many viewers and reviewers turn around. <br /> <br /> I know better. <br /> <br /> The Serbs, commanded by General Draza Milhalovitch and his Chetniks, saved 500 American flyers shot down from the Germans in World War II. <br /> <br /> Churchill decided to betray Milhalovitch and put the British backing behind the Communist Tito. Roosevelt followed his example and, as a result, after the war ended, Yugoslavia was handed over to Communist Tito. <br /> <br /> And the United States ally, Milhalovitch, has been defamed by the media since then. <br /> <br /> This The film is part of the propaganda campaign against the Serbs designed by George Soros and his International Crisis Group (ICG) that culminated in the "War" of Kosovo, in which Serbia was bombed by NATO due to totally false claims by the ICG of "common graves". "In Kosovo full of" victims "of the unpleasant Serbs The fact that there were no such mass graves and that the Albanians (Muslims) had nothing to do with being in the Kosovo of Serbia are facts that most of the media communication will not print. <br /> <br /> I chose this movie to see it because the description of a sentence on the cover of the video seemed interesting to me. <br /> <br /> Imagine my disgust when I discovered that I had been tricked into rent another branch of the propaganda machine to Serbia. <br /> <br /> In exchange for this propaganda, someone should make a film about the unwillingness of the Clinton Administration to clarify with Congress and with the American people about his complicity in the delivery of arms from Iran to the Muslim government in Sarajevo. <br /> <br /> I will not hold my breath waiting for a movie like that.
