I gave this movie a rating of 1 (horrible). The only reason why he should even get a 1 instead of a big -0- is Ben Kingsley, who always shines, no matter what terrible material gets in his way. <br /> <br /> Mira Sorvino is so out of his element Here, as a spectator, one simply can not forget the fact that he is even in that room. <br /> <br /> Stupid, stupid story and horrible production. DO NOT waste your rental video $.
