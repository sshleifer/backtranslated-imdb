This Italian movie of the 70s is NOT even in the class with Dog Soldiers, The Howling, or even that horrible American werewolf in Paris, BUT ... it's fun to watch. I'm talking about seeing the main actress, an awesome blonde, going crazy with her birthday outfit. We are talking about graphics, full nudes ... it is obvious that she is a real blonde ... humma humma humma !! The story is hilarious, the SFX is childish and the performance (for the most part) stinks. The only redeeming value of this film is everything (and there are a LOT) the scenes of nudity and sex. He met HBO standards, but it's fun to see him when he's without an appointment on Saturday night. OK ... HERE IS THE SPOILER ... THERE IS NO WOLF (except in the opening scene of the ancestor of the heroine (??). The girl simply imagines that he is a werewolf ... in other words, a clinical lycanthrope.
