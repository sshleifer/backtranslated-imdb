This is a western action. James Steart heads a cast of stars in the picturesque Northwest, which was shot with great splendor. The scenery and the costumes are great. There is action and adventure. Stewart plays a rich rancher who opposes a twisted government in the old Northwest. <br /> <br /> The main drawback is the stereotyped cynic that Hollywood has always turned into a hero. Even when this movie was made, the cynic was the stereotyped hero, and the one Stewart portrays really has few saving graces. He is kind to his two partners, and that gives him an extra dimension of credibility and sympathy. <br /> <br /> However, it's so cowardly for everyone else, it's hard to really take care of it, or accept it. It's very much like the Western characters of one-dimensional spaghetti (it's not too bad). <br /> <br /> However, the supporting characters are quite nice. Walter Brennan, Royal Dano, Harry Morgan and others make it worth seeing.
