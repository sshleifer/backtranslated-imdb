Watching this movie is like eating a banquet of nothing but meringue. Initially it looks great, but ultimately it does not provide satisfaction, none. <br /> <br /> The plot is a confusing imbroglio about a toy factory and the forces of evil. So, how is it possible that with this basic plot And Robin Williams that the film continues to turn out so badly? It is because the image is all appearance without any substance, like the terrible image of Popeye that Williams made at the beginning of his cinematographic career. The movie must have cost a fortune, but maybe there was not enough money left to hire writers who graduated from elementary school. <br /> <br /> The movie is a joke without grace that goes on and on and on and on. I'm really not sure why it was done in the first place, it certainly was not done to provide any kind of entertainment.
