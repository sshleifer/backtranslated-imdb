Complete gear. An unfortunate manifestation of the hypocritical and toxic culture of a decade ago. In this film, the repentances of pedestrians for slavery go hand in hand with colonialist subtexts (the annoying redhead who feeds Shaka rice?). Also forget about the historical reality. The majority of Western slaves do not come from West Africa? An American slave who easily catches Shaka with a handful of men? Finally, David Hasslehoff could not have been more unpleasant. One can only reflect, how would it have been in the miniseries? (Punctually impaled). The miniseries was excellent, and it is unfortunate that DH has had something unique in his hands, and made it mundane. (I tend to think that he had a part in creating this fiasco).
