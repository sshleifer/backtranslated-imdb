DEAD HUSBANDS is a somewhat silly comedy about a group of wives who conspire to confront each other's spouses. By no means is it embarrassingly bad as some comedies I could mention, but it never jeopardizes its potential. Imagine how good it could have been if the Farrelly brothers had directed Ben Stiller in the role of Carter Elson. <br /> <br /> Is Carter based on Jerry Springer? Just out of curiosity because the phrase of Dr. Elson's program is "take care of yourself and keep talking"
