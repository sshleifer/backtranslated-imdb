This movie is horrible. The CGI is the very cheap gray gray CGI. The crocodile looks like a big gray spot. The worst thing is that no effort is made to make him walk or look like he is alive. For the most part, it is a CGI purchased with photographs that is placed in scenes and you almost expect to see the hand that moves the CGI across the screen. This is one of the worst examples of CGI effects I've seen, and I've seen many of the very bad Sci-Fi Channel movies. <br /> <br /> Aside from the terrible lack of special effects, the cast is made up of typical low-cost actors who probably work as waiters / waitresses for local diners while waiting for their Big Breaks. Perhaps the most ridiculous scene in this film is when one of the bad guys is trying to sexually assault Kate and the giant crocodile jumps from the water to the second floor of the Villains' headquarters and goes through the balcony and takes out the bad guy. Kate and instead of crashing into the building (and crush Kate), the Croc simply flies back with the same angle in the water. No physics law can apply to this film or special effects. At least there is honor among the crocodiles.
