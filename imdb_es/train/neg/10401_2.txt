Dear dear dear dear dear ... me! I had the strength to see it through ... But why ?! <br /> <br /> The first two films were fun and, in fact, something good. But this is so bad that we had trouble seeing everything. This was a kind of tremors for children. I can not believe that this movie was made at all ... it seems that the accessories were taken from some bad western series of some kind (for children) and they just did what they could with it. <br /> <br /> What for what audience is this movie? I can only think of children 12-14 years old. If you are over 14 years old you will have serious problems with this movie. Not only is it slow, it's very boring. The characters are exaggerated (not just a little) and, therefore, stereotyped is fun for a while ... but not enough so that you do not feel like throwing tomatoes at the screen. You also know everything that is going to happen, because yes ... you've seen it billions of times before in any series of heroes on children's television. I chose all the survivors and all the tremor at the moment the characters were presented. It's so bad ... so bad ... so ... enough. <br /> <br /> But it's okay, we laugh from time to time. Not only in the silly holes of the plot, but in some scenes in which it is worth repeating one or two ... or a scene, two baby tremors that are launched against one of the obvious types of calves of tremors .. It is really a great scene that made us repeat it again and again and laugh with all your heart. It still makes me smile when I think about it. But that only happened one more time, sadly ... and that's when the gunslinger "badass" appears and wonderfully overheads his part ... that and a comment: "They sprout from the ground like something from DEMONIC TROUT!" At this point we almost cried with laughter. But after that ... nothing could beat that ... (?) .. so it's pretty downhill from there. <br /> <br /> So the tips here are demonic trout and overacting. If someone ever tells you that this is a good movie ... it is a "plant", a vegetable or someone very bad. This movie has to be the worst of the tremors from afar. Waiting to see Tremors 3, it's probably a blockbuster compared to this ... this ... * goose bumps * no ... I'll leave it at that.
