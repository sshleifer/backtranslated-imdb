Misleading advertising ... I saw an advertisement for Carlitos Way: Rise to Power that says "From the producer of Scarface and Carlito's Way" WE CAN RECOVER IT ... Michael Bergman did not produce Scarface, in fact, he was the "editing room assistant" " For Scarface. Not to take Bergman's talent ... but in my opinion I should have had a little more class. I think I can speak for the masses when I say ... We hate that they lie to us openly. As for the movie, it was poor at best. I thought Puff Daddy did a good job. Although, Luis Guzm√°n should be ashamed for working on this film. In general, this movie did not do a good job filling in the blanks of Carlito's Way. It is obvious that this project was an attempt to make quick money instead of a good movie.
