I would give a negative rating if I could. I entered this movie without expecting much, but I had an open mind. The whole thing is stupid! Snakes are obviously fake and the first two things that bite are a tit and a boy Johnson. Oh, how original! If I were a 12-year-old boy, I could laugh at that. I have no idea how this movie became so popular. Seriously, the worst I've seen in my life. It did not entertain me, it was not funny, I did not even get bored! I was nothing. It was not even that bad, it was good, it's just bad. Actually ridiculous. Please, do not waste your money on this movie. I do not even rent this movie. I have no idea how you are getting such a high rating.
