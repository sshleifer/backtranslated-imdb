I'll make this short and sweet ... this movie was crap! !!!!!! <br /> <br /> I saw part 1 earlier today and I thought it was one of the best movies in history, I gave it 9 exits. of 10 stars. So I thought maybe parts 2 and 3 would be good sequels, I was wrong. This movie bored me to death and it was very different from the first, it had the continuous plot and that's it. It was like bad shots of part one or something. <br /> <br /> I love Walken, but I felt sorry for him here. I was so happy that Glenn Danzig was in this movie, but do not blink, you'll miss him. There was a full cast full of actors and people that I do not like, like Eric Roberts and Jennifer Beals. However, it was a breath of fresh air to see Ethan Embry, he is one of the funniest people on earth. <br /> <br /> This movie will make you like it the first time, so do not watch it. because you feel that you owe it to yourself, being a fan of part 1. I'll wait a few days before I see part 3 and pray that it's better than this shit. <br /> <br /> The last scene of The movie with lightning was one of the most beautiful things that have been seen in the film. Fast forward or jump to that if you can not bear the first part. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10 stars: it was horrible!
