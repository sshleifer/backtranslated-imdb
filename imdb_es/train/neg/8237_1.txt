How, in the name of all that is sacred, was this film ever distributed? It seems as if it had been filmed on someone's mobile phone and carries the scene of a child victim screaming to new depths. They literally scream during the full 90 minutes of the movie. And that is all they do. There is no plot, there is no tension, there are no characters, and there is not much action. Just screaming and more screaming. <br /> <br /> I gave up after fifteen minutes and hurried to see if something had happened. Not so, except for the screaming, of course. Oddly enough, the fact of going through the fast forward highlights another problem: there is no camera work to talk about. Each shot resembles all other shots: medium distance, an angle, no brightness, no brightness, no brightness. <br /> <br /> It's not so bad, it's good. It is simply bad.
