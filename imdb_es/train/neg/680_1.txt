I finally reached "Starlight" last night on television and all I can say is. . . Woohoo! It's hard to know where to start: the incredibly incredible special effects (check out the laser beams that come out of Willie's eyes!), The atrocious acting, the heavy dialogue, the mismatched use of the footage, or the air of pretentious seriousness that Infuses all the production. This is truly a unique experience, and we should all be grateful for that. I nominate Jonathon Kay as the true heir of Ed Wood!
