It is difficult to praise this movie very much. The CGI for the dragon was well done, but lacked a suitable model for light and shadow. In addition, the same images are used endlessly in the dragon that treads through the corridors, which becomes a bit tedious. <br /> <br /> I was surprised to see "Marco Aurelio" in the acting credits, wondering what a former emperor of the Romans is. The empire was acting in this movie! Like "Whoopie Goldberg," it must be an alias, and you can blame it for using one if it appears in this stinker. <br /> <br /> The story may be interesting, but acting is simple and the direction is tedious. If you MUST see this movie, go to your friend's house and get drunk while you do it, then it will be nice.
