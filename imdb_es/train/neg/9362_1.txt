The plot sounded as if it had been promised. To be honest I did not see the whole movie. After about an hour in the movie I had to make a decision. Is it worth watching this movie until it ends? The answer was clearly NO! It was not the fact that the human body could not receive a transplant of a different species without rejecting it. Nor the premise that he was being persecuted by secret government authorities for a wolf / human transplant. It was because the film was badly written, the performance lacked emotion and did not understand the various dream sequences with wolves and buffalos. When I was running to the zoo with a pack of dogs and leaving them in the front of the zoo door, the saying "If you can not run with the big dogs, do not leave the porch" I kept running through my boring mind. Save your time and skip this movie. I can guarantee you that if you dare to see it, you will stand there with your mouth open, as if asking me why someone loses money, time, energy and effort to make this insulting indignation at American cinema.
