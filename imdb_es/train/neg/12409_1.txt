And that comes from someone who will support almost ANY vision. The acting and the sound is horrible. This could qualify for a point of merit "so bad that it's good" for some. However, I take my horror movies seriously and this is crap, it's so cheap, I think that's my biggest complaint. The dialogue is often very funny, since "you scared me" is often used. The "child" actress is really terrible, so I pray that her acting career ends here. However, it is worthwhile to see the line "DONUTS! I HATE DONUTS".
