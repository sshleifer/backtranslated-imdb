The first was different and fun. This attempt should never have left the studio. This movie does not make you laugh. It is a weak attempt to circumvent humor. The film chooses current and old films to cheat. This time the jokes seem used and exaggerated. The audience I saw him only reacted to Hannibal's dinner scene and, for the rest, he was asleep.
