As always, this is an inaccurate picture of the homeless. Television told many lies about beggars in the early 1990s and made everyone look bad, and said that we all earned more than $ 100 per day, when $ 20-40 per day came much closer to reality. When someone came by where I put a sign offering to work and offered to work, I really went and took the job if I was physically capable. And if they offered me the $ 100,000 ID, I bet they had invested in apt's prepaid service. At least 2 years old, I kept most of it in the bank and I still left $ 10-20000 for NL $ 1-2 and $ 2-5 cash games in the casinos. In general, I always win and could win decent if I only had one bankroll. instead, I earn about $ 1000 a month, everything is playing at always minimal purchases because I do not want to risk losing everything. I was just homeless because I did not want to risk spending all my money and go bankrupt, sometimes I had more than $ 1000-2000 in my sock while I was sleeping outside. anyone who wants to talk to contact sevencard2003 in yahoo messenger. I admit that I was different from most homeless people, since I never drank smoke or took drugs. I'm no longer homeless, now I'm in government housing for $ 177 a month and I get SSI and spend most of my time winning online poker. The diversified mother and sunflower worked hard to get me SSI. I'm glad that my days of hiding under the stage at the casino convention center during the night sleeping, the worry of being trapped by security, finally ended. If this television crew had chosen me, they would have ended much sooner. It is a pity that they do not select better who they choose.
