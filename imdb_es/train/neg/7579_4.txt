The name "cult movie" is often given to films that are still projected, or to sell in home movie format, more than a generation after its first release. Superchick, which was launched for the first time in 1973, now falls into this category. Her cult status is due in large part to the continued interest in him by those women who see it as an early and effective feminist film. <br /> <br /> Despite the connotation of "Superwoman", "Superchick" is not a cartoon character but a character. A very competent young woman who works as a stewardess, a career option that in the 1970s was considered one of the most glamorous and open for any girl, and that also allows her to emulate the traditional matelot that supposedly has a wife in each port . Since he has the status of a black belt in karate, he is able to make it very clear that he is very happy with his bachelor existence, and in no way is he bound to any of his many male admirers. This film is a sitcom that avoids the usually much shorter appeal of the farce. Its appeal to feminists is also increased by a climax in which our heroine uses her karate skills to avoid a hijacking and save all other passengers on her plane from a potentially unpleasant fate. To ensure that this film is attractive to both men and their peers, the Director has wisely assured that it is generously sprinkled with candy. <br /> <br /> Superchick can be enjoyed by those who are not too critical and want a very light and easy to see comedy that they will forget shortly after seeing it. It is so easy to forget that you will probably find it equally pleasurable if you look at them again within a year; Despite his age, therefore, he can maintain his status as a cult movie for some time. However, dialogue and acting would make it difficult to give this film a rating of more than 4/10.
