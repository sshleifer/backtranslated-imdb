I sat through this at GenCon just because I was calm and could nap. What a waste of time. Beverly D'Angelo and William Katt? WTF? Were the lady who played Flo and Abe Vigoda or something like that occupied? <br /> <br /> In truth, a piece of garbage without grace. The characters were unintentionally stereotyped (I think ...) and wooden, most seemed to be on autopilot. The so-called "hilarious" situations described in some of the other critical calls were so hackneyed that I cried for the writers. <br /> <br /> I'm confused as to how someone can find it worth your time. , seriously. I only give it 3 out of 10 because to be a 2 or 1, it would have to last five hours or include more Kelly LeBrock.
