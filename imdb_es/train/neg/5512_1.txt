Place a DVD of this movie in a time capsule, and it will definitely illustrate for future generations a perfect example of one that guarantees the minimum rating on a scale of 1 to 10 stars. <br /> <br /> Bill Cosby and Ray Romano have been at the top - in ratings and with tens of millions in profits annually - with their television series. However, everyone has not been successful in the big screen offers. This has also been true for other television personalities, perhaps because many of the stories presented for approximately two hours seem more appropriate for a 10-minute skit, or at the most, the 22 or 23 minutes of drama for half time . hour program. <br /> <br /> This movie, however, does not have a single element that guarantees two or three minutes of time on MAD TV, SNL, or anywhere else on a screen or stage. <br /> <br /> Its start date appears as 2002, but the release date (DVD only) appears as 2004. It was also filmed shortly before the death of Rodney Dangerfield, so its only value is that he probably provided at least a few hundred thousand dollars more for his heirs. <br /> <br /> I had never heard of that, but I found it when I turned on my set and, frankly, fascinated me. Some movies are so horrible that they rate a higher rating in reverse, so bad that you can move the dial back to a 9 or 10. "Plan 9 from outer space" is the best example, and Bruce Jenner / Village Opus of the people , "I can not stop the music", is another. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie falls short even there. Even if Rodney's previous work (as well as some of his cast members) did not come to "Citizen Kane" or "Casablanca," there were many moments of humor and a story that provided at least a minimum of interest. <Br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this presentation does not seem to have a minute or two of that material.
