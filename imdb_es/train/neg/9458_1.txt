There are already many comments posted that say exactly how I felt about this movie, so I will not. <br /> <br /> "The Grinch" I thought it was wonderful. Jim Carrey is a truly talented physical comedian, as well as being a versatile intelligent actor (in my opinion). Mike Myers, on the other hand, gets his laughs being annoying. I used to like a lot in his days "The world of Waynes" and "So I married an ax murderer", but I have never liked the Austin Powers and the "Cat in the hat" just finished me. <br /> <br /> This movie was horrible - the gags were horrible! Unsuitable for children not only in adult content, but in the fact that some of them were so outdated that they have not amused anyone for 50 years. The plot was messy, messy, messy! It's a shame really because the children were very nice like "mom". They probably could have chosen a better villain than Alec Baldwin, but he could have done it if it was not for Myers. The exaggerated and disgusting portrayal of Cat. <br /> <br /> I mean, did Myers even take a look at a script? Was one written? The other actors seemed to have one, but the Cat seemed to be flying! <br /> <br /> On the other hand, I would like to mention that the sets and accessories were wonderful. But unfortunately they can not save this movie. <br /> <br /> Poor Dr. Seuss: the man was a genius! Do not ruin your reputation by adapting your work in such a lazy and messy way! <br /> <br /> 1/10
