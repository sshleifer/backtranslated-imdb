STAR CLASSIFICATION: ***** The Works **** Just miss the mark *** Little Bit In Between ** Lagged behind * The Pits <br /> <br /> In this debut effort for the beloved man Nick Park and dog, are forced to fly to the moon when old and old Wallace runs out of cheese. <br /> <br /> In addition to being the shortest function in just 22 minutes, this W / G adventure is also the earliest and shows up a bit. The plasticine animation is a bit squeaky and funny here, a sort of reminiscence of Mork's animation about the little man in the box. <br /> <br /> Admirable, although the craftsmanship behind this is, I have never been so interested. Wallace & Gromit (maybe too clean and traditional for someone of my generation). The only one I've really enjoyed is The Wrong Trousers (and that was more of when I was younger and less aware, let's say, I loved actively pursuing this effort early because of the resurgence of popularity as a result of the recent successful film adaptation. < br /> <br /> As technically impressive as the first two (all things considered!) this lacks the emotional angle that their successors should possess.That said, it's quite fun as a first attempt and certainly sets the standard for greater things by come in. Two stars, but two good stars. **
