Okay, obviously, people thought this was a good movie in 1955. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry for the fools who still think that ... It's absolute rubbish. <br /> <br /> The story is fair. .. ridiculous. The characters are absurd caricatures, but this movie does not pretend to satirize, I'm sure it's a serious drama, right? <br /> <br /> Dean and others are too old for their role. People say that Dean is great in this movie, and well, maybe he did his part the best he could. Your character is meant to be 16 or 17 or so. But Dean was a 24-year-old man when he made this movie. Watching him agonize and throw small tantrums like a 4 year old ... it's pathetic. <br /> <br /> Natalie Wood is beautiful, but the first scenes at the police station where she is crying and whining are not very convincing. It sets a bad precedent for the movie ... and, for the rest, you feel like cowering every time one of these emotional scenes is badly performed. <br /> <br /> It may have been good for your time, but, actually, it's nonsense. <br /> <br /> It must have been simply an exaggeration about Dean's death that has inflated the reputation of this movie.
