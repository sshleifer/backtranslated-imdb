When you want the dragon to eat all the cast members, you know that a bad trip awaits you. <br /> <br /> I came in with very, very low expectations, after reading some of the other comments, and I was not disappointed However, unlike other cheap and failed films, this one is not really fun (and not intentionally ) funny. <br /> <br /> - THE SUPPORTS FOLLOW- <br /> <br /> First of all, the plot is very inconsistent. Looking beyond the "small" mistakes, like the dragon that grows in 3 hours, the general idea on which it is based is a disaster. Look, the movie wants us to believe that the dragons came from outer space in the form of meteorites that were really dragon eggs. After explaining this, they show a peasant pricking one with his hairpin and the dragon jumps. Later, the obligatory "mad scientist" kid babbles about how the dragons survived the dinosaurs. So apparently the humans were close to the dinosaurs, or we just have a small plot hole here. The other important thing is that the laboratory is inflated with a force "half as strong" as that used for Hiroshima. Then, two guys later come in to check everything, and he's almost unharmed! There is even another dragon, who came from who knows what. In general, it is very predictable. As soon as the boy mentioned the cloning, I assumed that they would clone a dragon. That means that our kind of Mr. Smarty-pants security is not as intuitive and intelligent as the movie would make you believe, if you ignore that I knew that this movie would be about dragons. <br /> <br /> Leaving that aside, the second worst are the "special effects". Others have mentioned the fake rocks that fell during the beginning, the CG helicopter and the dragon. He looks a little better than a stain, but it ruined everything in his favor when he walked the hallway in the same way over and over again. To his credit, the flying dragons at first seemed fine from afar (although the one in the cave is probably the worst in the whole movie). However, these things are fun to watch. The scenes showing a million different shots of the same person that face different forms are not shown. Neither the "introduction" screens with vital statistics. <br /> <br /> When coming to the actors, they were not the best, but I guess at least they tried. They seemed more enthusiastic about what they were doing than many of the actors who participated in the recent "BloodRayne", for example, and you have to give them points for that. However, one thing I noticed was that the woman who plays Meredith often had her face covered in makeup, which was many shades lighter than the rest of her. It seemed that he had a bad spell with a little white face. <br /> <br /> The script is bad and corny. You do not really realize the music, but it's not really that bad for the most part. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that you do not see it unless you want to see it because you hear it is bad (like I did), although the only fun things are the bad effects of CG. Apart from that, do not waste your time and money.
