That is not the sound of the bees, it is the induced effect of seeing this extremely long film, extremely boring and of bad performance. How I managed to overcome 3 1/2 hours without falling asleep, I'll never know. The plot is simple ... 3 totally unpleasant imbeciles talk about sex for 3 1/2 hours. And you thought that Rohmer was mortal. This is even worse, if that is possible. > I must really be a masochist if I could watch this whole movie without turning it off ... or killing someone.
