This is not as funny and bloody as the DVD box claims. I really love twisted and strange movies, but this one is really boring! It's an hour of torn penises, flying dolls born and many rapes! I think the intention with this amateur sleaze was to make a "It's so bad, it's good" movie, but it fails. It's just bad! Some scenes are fine, but in general it is a disaster. If you like amateur splashes like this one (only better) I would recommend Violent Shit 2 and 3 by Andreas Schnass.
