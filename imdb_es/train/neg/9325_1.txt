SICK. it really means So Incredibly Crappy i Milled. There was absolutely no action to talk about. The best part of the entire production was the artwork on the cover of the box. The budget of this movie was enough. The filming was on the street subssememe. The production is similar to that of the underground filming for Mafia hits. The accessories used in this film were stolen from a clothing store. The ending was so predictable that you should overtake the last 5 minutes and laugh. If there is a book for this movie, I'm sure it's better. I would avoid this at all costs. I enjoyed the intimate scenes that made the whole movie worthwhile. it's a joke.
