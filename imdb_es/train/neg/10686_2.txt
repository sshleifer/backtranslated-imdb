Please, help the economy - spend your money elsewhere! The synopsis of the film is: the First Lady has her husband murdered because he was cheating on her. That's. Without being detected by anyone, except Cuba and Angie, he designs and implements a vast conspiracy of murders that nobody knows ... and he escapes completely. <br /> <br /> Some specific points are particularly fun: Standing in front of the president, Cuba to divert the killer's bullet ... which then enters behind the president's head. <br /> <br /> Cuba and Angie see a movie from a news camera and see ... a clue. They do everything possible to protect the film, believing that they are the only people who have a copy of this movie so public. <br /> <br /> Cuba talks to a member of the Presidency staff. The PSM says there was no conspiracy. Cuba states that there was more than one person involved. The PSM then says that the conspiracy includes the FBI, the CIA and the NSA. My God, I wonder if the PSM is involved. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Archer, the First Lady, is a spectacular artist. Cuba can not distinguish a painting, and she says: "You're too close ... go back ... look from a different perspective, look from my perspective". Can anyone miss that clue?
