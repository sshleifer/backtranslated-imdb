Okay, if you have a couple of hours to lose, or if you really hate your life, I'd say you see this movie. In any case it's good for a few laughs. Not only does he have obese, topless natives, but also special effects that are so bad that they are probably banned in most states. Seriously, the rating of 'PG' is also quite funny, once you see the Extravaganza of native pornography. I would not give this movie to my retarded nephew. You could not even show this to Iraqi prisoners without violating the Geneva Convention. The plot is schematic, and clich√©, and silent, and stupid. The acting is horrible, and the ending is so painful to see that I actually started throwing salt in my eyes just to distract myself from the idiocy that filled my TV screen.
