Well, this is a typical killing movie "straight to the bathroom". <br /> <br /> In short, a group of teenagers / young adults are stranded in the midst of spooky forests and are attacked by naked nymphomaniac demons. <br /> <br /> This movie has all the basic elements for this slaughterhouse: <br /> <br /> - Naked women, -teens or young adults who are abandoned in a creepy place, -bloody death knees, -the last The survivor is a well-formed young woman who will always show her stomach, but will never hold it back, a crazy and creepy man who knows about evil, the scene of the lesbian kiss, -sex being a murderer, -no storyline <br /> <br /> Even then, for a corny slasher movie, it was really terrible. The environment is totally dead. Nothing, not even the sexually explicit scenes and nudity, was enough to keep the male and lesbian female audience interested. Seeing him felt as if they were seeing him with an unpleasant headache or an unpleasant head cold. <br /> <br /> Give him the demonic ... 0/10.
