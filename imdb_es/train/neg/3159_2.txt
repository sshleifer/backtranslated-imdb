Sorry guys, I already wrote my opinion about this movie, but today was the first day I looked at some of the other reviews. There are many people who agree with me, but what is scary is that there are some people who seem to like this movie a lot. I do not like to write unpleasant reviews or criticize the opinions of other people, but I think it is fair to warn anyone who is debating whether or not to see this movie. This is not a good movie. I really like movies and I'm going to see almost anything, but this movie came to the incredibly short list of movies I saw and was happy to leave in half. If you really are tempted, watch the trailer ... that's the mistake I made because the whole movie is essentially in the trailer ... after that there are no surprises, just a surprisingly bad dialogue to waste time. I love Michael Vartan in Alias ​​and I'd hate to criticize him, but I think it's my duty to prevent other people from wasting the hours of their lives in a movie like this.
