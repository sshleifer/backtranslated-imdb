After seeing some of the great things about HBO, Band of Brothers, Rome, etc., I must say that I had high expectations before watching the first episode of "True Blood". OMG. Often, the script seemed to have been written by an 8-year-old boy, some parts were just filmed horribly, (the scene in which he "saves" Bill, I mean, come on.) He throws a chain to the boy and come on! Around his neck and magically drown him! That was pretty embarrassing if you want my opinion, or a few moments before that scene, when he discovers that the couple has left with Bill, ridiculous. 5 seconds later, magic! The 3 of them are gone, and without any fight or noise or anything! <br /> <br /> I mean that the idea of ​​the show seemed interesting, mysterious, intriguing, vampires that coexist with humans in our modern society ... but, honestly, I do not think they really want to do more of this than a little soap show, which the average teenage girl looks at all the time but nobody else cares ... Unfortunately , the script is poorly written, mediocre in the The best of the cases is superficial and extremely predictable. I often thought that this was a kind of joke or something. <br /> <br /> The actors offer really unconvincing performances, if you want my opinion. They seem to take the program very lightly, as if it were a kind of regular, low-budget family television program (well, that's what it is, if you take away the part of the family). The only actor that I thought was a good thing was Stephen Moyer in the role of Bill, considering the poorly written and extremely short answers he had to say "What are you ..." "Can I call you at some point ..." I think It did well to bring up the mysterious and terrifying part of a vampire that anyone with a vampire role should have, really. Anna Paquin was also fine, but no more. But the boy, playing his brother, heavens, is horrible. The scene in which he is arrested is simply an embarrassment to modern television. The acting is bad, the construction site seems false, and the other two guys "Why do you arrest him? Uh ... I do not know ..." That was quite embarrassing. <br /> <br /> Another thing that I think was completely lost was the way they presented Sookie's psychic powers. They make us listen to what people think and talk at the same time and that is simply wrong. Often, it seems unnecessarily chaotic, as if the people's thought was a kind of annoying radio channel, and when she approaches it, she reaches the correct frequency level and has to listen to everything she thinks. <br /> <br /> And, finally, the sex scenes are simply unnecessary and the thing about the vampire sex tape was totally unpleasant. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I wrote all these comments not because I thought the program was BAD, but because I was very disappointed. I expected quality things. I did not think it was going to be like that. It's definitely not a good show though. Mediocre at best.
