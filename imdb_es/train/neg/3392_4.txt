What about Indonesian music movies? I have never seen Indonesian musical movies like those made in Bollywood. They miss the spirit of the story and just a lot of 'what they called' poetic lines. <br /> <br /> This story about the love of two children who separate and then meet again after a few years of change has no special observations. It's a simple story argument (but it's pretty focused) with musical story lines "meant to be" here and there. <br /> <br /> The confused characters who should be saved by a brilliant performance are neglected. The main actress may try to encourage the character, but it is the best she can do, trying. As for the casting, I do not feel the need to include a Balinese student in that story and, of course, they are not the only unnecessary characters. <br /> <br /> The strange thing is, why would I want to see it? this movie? Maybe because of the handles ...
