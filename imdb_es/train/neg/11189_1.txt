Always enjoy great movies that deal with the supernatural and deep thoughts of the spiritual world. However, this movie has just turned me off in terms of its production and direction. There is nothing to enter into a deep discussion about what this story has to tell; All I can say is that it was a great waste of time and effort to put it on the big screen. The actors, namely: Mark Addy, Thomas Garrett, had an outstanding performance in their homeland, England, and we have seen it on "Still Standing" a television series. Heath Ledger, played the real evil guy and recently saw him in "Brokeback Mountain", '05, gave him a great supporting role. Shannyn Sossaman, (Mara Sinclair), did a good job of seducing a priest from a church not recognized by any faith. Do not waste your time, you will regret it!
