Spoilers <br /> <br /> First of all, nothing really happened in this movie, apart from a woman who was bleeding inexplicably. Second, it was not scary. Third, it had the worst soundtrack of all the movies. Let me elaborate. The sound was edited by Beavis or Butthead? I'm not sure which one, so we're going with Beavis. The movie gradually becomes quieter and quieter and people mutter and mutter, forcing you to turn up the volume (I saw it at home). Then, Beavis emits very loud sounds with supposedly terrifying / shocking images, which forces you to quickly lower the volume again. This happens many times until, fortunately, the movie ends. I can imagine Beavis laughing vulgarly from behind the two-way mirror as he watched the test group frantically searching for the remote control each time. If you have children and prefer to watch scary movies after they fall asleep, this is a big mistake. But then it's a big mistake anyway. Here is a thought ?? If you're going to make a horror movie, at least add a free beheading, a 19-year-old blonde girl screaming at the top of her lung just before she can take off her sweater, the shadow on someone's wall. being eaten alive just out of reach of the camera, a cat thrown into the camera to scare the audience, some weirdos with a maniacal laugh, or a monster that looks like a stage covered in foil (in the style of Lost in Space of the TV). These people did not even try to scare me. They just wanted to hurt my ears.
