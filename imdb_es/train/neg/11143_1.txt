Hello, I'm a friend of the werewolf movies, and when I saw the title of Darkwolf hitting the shelves, I said to myself "hmm, simple and pretty name at least Althou ... I wonder why I have not heard of before. "<br /> <br /> First of all, the movie starts with the tits. Many tits. The tits are almost all the movies to which he was destined. Who cares about the werewolf effect, just pay the actresses enough to not take them topless! <br /> <br /> Then, about the mysterious dark werewolf character (a bit of spoilers ahead, but who cares ...) He's your average daily biker Not even super tough, but as says the wise old woman in the movie "he is much more powerful and dangerous than you have ever faced". Just describing a type of tattooed biker. Pretty original. I even had to look twice when they first used the "bright red eyes" SPECIAL EFFECT! I mean my god, that "leave-plant-red-in-eyes-with-computer" effect has been used since the seventies. It looks ugly here! And do not make me start with the werewolf 3D-CGI. As I said before, like a bad old video game. <br /> <br /> And finally, how I like the werewolf movies, like I said. They almost always build their own werewolf legend. Darkwolf also builds the world of werewolves, about some silly hybrid werewolf legends and the ancient bloodline. BUT. It is almost instantaneous after creating the rules of engagement "the dark wolf kills anyone the girl has touched" begins to attack randomly. What simply does not make any sense, why even bother to tell us the rules of the killing, when they're not even going to play with them ... In addition, the wolves point of view shots are made with a Sony handycam or something A) Yes. , filming on all the floor and walls. Just add grunting noises and you'll get a super werewolf effect. The blood is partially fine. But when the wolf hits everyone with an open hand, simply placing the hand on the victims, it just does not help me at all ... <br /> <br /> In truth, WHO gives money to Make these piles of trash videos directly on video, which are not even funny movies, bad, but sad.
