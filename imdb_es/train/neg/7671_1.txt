The movie begins with a scroll text that lasts almost five minutes. Give the basic summary of what is happening. This could easily have been done with the performance, but instead a displacement text effect is obtained. Shortly after being bombarded with characters that you learn a little about, keep in mind that this is ALL you'll learn about them. The plot begins to take off and then crashes throughout the film. Not only does it change the plot, but you may even wonder if you are watching the same movie. I have never played the game, but I know people who have done it. From what I understand, whether you have played or not, this movie does not improve. Save money unless you like to sleep in theaters.
