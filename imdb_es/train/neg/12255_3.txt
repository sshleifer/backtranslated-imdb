... which is not exactly sound support. In general, "DinoCroc" was a much better movie. Of course, in that movie Matt Borlenghi played a complete fan who spent the whole movie crying because his younger brother was devoured by the DinoCroc. But the special effects in "DinoCroc" were better, the lines of the plot were better and the performance was better. Here are the problems with "Blood Surf": 1) the killer crocodile looks like the model of a child with a retractable jaw. 2) The plot is ridiculous. Matt Borlenghi & Co. is shipwrecked on a desert island, where they find a rabid group of ugly Filipino natives trying to impose themselves on the women of the group. What was a complete loss of 15 minutes of film. And 3) there is not enough crocodile time. There are a couple of redeeming qualities of "Blood Surf": the actresses are quite attractive and Matt Borlenghi is devoured by the crocodile towards the end of the film. But if you're on your deathbed and you only have enough time to watch a killer Matt Borlenghi / Crocodile movie, skip this one and turn on "DinoCroc" instead.
