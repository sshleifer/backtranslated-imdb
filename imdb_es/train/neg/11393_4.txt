Wow, I can not believe that people consider this a "good" movie. Now, I've seen much worse things, but there are much more romantic / funny comedies with John Cusack. <br /> <br /> This is a mediocre movie at best. While the performance was not terrible, but not excellent, for a romantic comedy, there was little passion, little romance. There were many loose ends that do not appear or are not addressed. Unfortunately, the main characters come out as complete cowards. They do not know each other well enough to realize that they do not love the people with whom they are committed. How do we know they are not in love? For the absolute lack of remorse that both characters have for abandoning their finances. I can think of some more romantic things than the continuous escape of commitment shown by these two. <br /> <br /> The movie does not even end with a wedding scene, it is likely that both will cool and each fall. Others like hot potatoes once a commitment approaches. This film is really about two people who can not commit to anything, unlike the previous characters of Cusack, who were more than willing to make a deep commitment (Loyd in Say Anything, Martin in Grosse Pointe Blank, etc.). <br /> <br /> The biggest failure of this movie was the total lack of turns or anything of interest. When the movie ended, I felt that they had not included a climax in the story, which basically fits the whole movie: boring. There is no suspense about whether the two will end up together, there is no joy when they do it, there are no consequences for their actions. <br /> <br /> It's sad that people are so blind to the poor quality of this movie, that they simply scold Any criticism with 'Everyone is too cynical!'. The criticism of this film is not cynicism, it is simply an impartial examination. There are many other better romantic comedies, even with Grace Kelly or Eva Marie Saint. <br /> <br /> If you think this movie is great, try these films, your hearts will explode: The promised princess, say anything Grosse Pointe Blank, High Fidelity, Keeping the Faith, Charade, Rear Window, North by Northwest , or there is something about Mary (which is a good test of the idealized romance versus today's society).
