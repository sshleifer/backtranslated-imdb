Celia Johnson is good as the nurse. Michael Hordern is good as Capulet, although it is his usual neigh and neigh and not a patch on his King Lear. John O'Conor reads the verse well as Friar Laurence, but never takes it anywhere. Alan Rickman is good as Tybalt, in the first of his "yuk" papers that would make him famous. Benvolio, by Christopher Strauli, is nice. <br /> <br /> The sets are beautiful, if not impressive, as in others of the BBC Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> And that's it. The rest is weak to terrible. Rebecca Saire turned 15 during production, and has no idea how to act, Juliet: she opens her eyes wide and complains about all the lines in exactly the same way. Patrick Ryecart is ill adapted to her, and his self-esteem is inexplicable. The balcony scene flows smoothly and without incident with no emotional or erotic impact. Their deaths come as a relief. If I had a dagger, I would have offered it hours earlier. <br /> <br /> Anthony Andrews is unspeakable like Mercutio, a big shock if you remember his excellent work in "Brideshead Revisited". Break the mirror of Shakespeare's verse into a thousand fragments of two or three words each, and then shout the fragments in the most disconnected and unintelligible way possible. In this production, it reigns mab abdica. Horrible. <br /> <br /> The director, Alvin Rakoff, shows only an intermittent gift of putting the camera where he will show us what we want to see. The opening fight is remarkably incoherent. However, there is humor when in a later fight, Romeo apparently kneels Tybalt right in the shoemakers. Tybalt then takes the offended region. However, did that happen? <br /> <br /> R & J is a long game. This version is not recommended for use in the classroom, or much more.
