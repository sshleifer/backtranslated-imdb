This, for lack of a better term, the movie is terrible. Where do I start ...... <br /> <br /> Cinemaphotography? This was, perhaps, the worst I've seen this year. It seemed that the camera was being thrown from camera to camera. Maybe they only had a camera. It gives you the feeling of being a volleyball. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of scenes, randomly, thrown without any continuity. When they did the 'split screen', it was absurd. Everything was crushed, it seemed ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The color tones were far away. These people need to learn to balance a camera. This 'movie' is poorly made and poorly made. <br /> <br /> The plot - You have to be kidding. If I were an SS agent, I would sue the producers. They looked like the Marks brothers with radios and cannons. Sutherland was in his '24' mode; I can see this for free. Eva Longoria would have been better with a little less, and much more to show. Like an action bimbo, she was not much. <br /> <br /> I could not see a real plot, apart from Douglas blowing up the Presidents' wife. He never said why the mercenaries were trying to kill the prey. I just do not see the president of the United States running for his life in the tunnels of public services of a building, like a rat in a labyrinth. por favor. <br /> <br /> Hollywood is dead. This movie is the test. I like 'the big screen'. Since I was a child. Many more 'movies' like this one and I'll stop going. What's the Hollywood problem, did so many movies for girls, forget how to make a real movie? If I had a theater, I would start directing old movies. The one that has real actors, good stories and good cinematic photography. <br /> <br /> This "movie" is a dog. Do not waste your time or money on it. I rate this 'movie' with a zero! Douglas is not suitable for this role. I can overlook his age, but he is too weak to carry this out.
