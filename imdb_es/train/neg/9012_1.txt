Yesterday I saw the movie Flyboys and my girlfriend told me that it was the worst movie I had seen ... Since I thought it was pretty horrible, it also made me think: what movie was the worst movie I had seen and this was just a movie that came to mind <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, a couple of years ago I have not seen her, but I remember that the horrible Dean Cain was a cocky military man (the pretty boy Cain is not very self-important). The weird deal with the CGI helicopter when it would probably be cheaper to rent a helicopter than to hire some CGI types to do it, but I guess they found the helicopter as a free sample for some CGI program or the producer's son. He liked to play with his new computer. And how did it look? Horrible. And when the dragon is loaded down the corridors of the complex and then reuses the same shots again and again, it looks VERY cheap. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie: it's really horrible ...
