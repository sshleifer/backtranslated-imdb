I read the whole book 'A wrinkle in time' and then I saw the movie. The film contained all the elements of the book, but as the book had 190 pages and the film had 2 hours, it felt really crowded with too many effects and bad acting. <br /> <br /> A wrinkle in time is almost a girl named Meg, Charles Wallace and Calvin must join to find Meg's father and leave Camazotz Island. <br /> <br /> The beginning of the movie is really a stink. The acting is horrible, the direction is ridiculous, and so far the situations are not necessary. I really felt crushed to see the same person who wrote the book Madeleine Engle and created the movie, made a great book and a terrible movie. The acting is worse than any live-to-video performance. Yes, I have to admit that there were great effects. But seriously, they all became terribly and not serially in any way possible. If you read the book you will be crushed by the movie. I wish I could give it a 0, but unfortunately I can only give it a 1. One half could have been useful.
