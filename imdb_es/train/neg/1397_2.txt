Let's see, here are the "highlights" of The Brain Machine: 15 images of a pool and a house; 15 photos of establishment of an anodyne office building; 5 counts back by an insipid technician; 7 close-ups of a menacing guard; and a lot of technical babbling to show us that this is a high-tech experiment. <br /> <br /> Several posters have commented on the discrepancy between the 1972 copyright date and the release date in the 1977 DVD box. This is easy to explain. This dog simply sat on the shelf without being thrown for five years, until someone cleaned it up, thinking that it fit perfectly with the feeling of distrust in the post-Watergate government. After watching The Brain Machine now, my only wonder is that it was ever released at all!
