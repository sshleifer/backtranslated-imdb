After the success of Scooby-Doo, Where are You, they decided to give Scooby and Shaggy their own show. But unfortunately, they added a new character that spoiled Scooby-Doo's success forever. They invented a new show with a new title, Scooby and Scrappy-Doo. It was Scrappy-Doo that made this show a complete failure, probably for both adults and children. Scrappy was the stupid and brave puppy who always seemed ready to hit someone. Scooby and Shaggy were getting scared of the villain, and they were also trying to stop him. Scooby-Doo does not need any small and annoying nephew. If they wanted Scooby-Doo to be more successful, they should have killed or never thought of Scrappy. This was simply poor, maybe your children prefer it!
