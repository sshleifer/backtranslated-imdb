I suppose that today this film has relevance because it was one of Sofia Loren's first films. I was 19 when the film was made in 1953. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie because I wanted to see some of Sofia Loren's early work. I was surprised when she appeared in the camera after having tanned her skin with brown makeup to look like an Ethiopian princess. Surely, today, this would have been seen as an insult and should be avoided in the making of films. Actually, he became annoyed to see Ms. Loren painting with the color of the skin throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Yes, this movie would have been made better if the real opera singers had made this movie. Then, the singing and the real facial gestures of the real artists would have been evident. I discarded the comments of others about whether the real opera singers are older and heavier. <br /> <br /> As beautiful as Ms. Loren was 19 years old and still is today, the film would have been better received as though it was being performed on stage. After all, we do not see beautiful young people on stage with "old opera singers" behind the stage singing from behind the curtain! Do not discount the success of using opera singers of great weight. You just have to refer to the most artistically produced television commercial for the company J. G. Wentworth with the opera singers on stage professionally singing the accolades of the company's product. This is one of the best and entertaining television commercials produced to date. <br /> <br /> The print quality of the film also makes this production a somewhat lower quality. The color ink has faded a lot and that can not be avoided. <br /> <br /> To improve this film on DVD, the production company must add subtitles in English so that we, who do not speak Italian, can know what the lyrics are. They are saying. It would help the story and teach it more than the narrator who gives 30 seconds of introduction to the scenes. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie not because of Aida's story or the fact that this is an opera. Apart from Mrs. Sofia Loren, none of her co-actors are known or remembered by this writer. Instead, watch this movie if you're a fan of Ms. Loren and want to see her at age 19, no matter what the production is. <br /> <br /> Larry from Illinois
