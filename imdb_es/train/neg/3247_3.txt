I really wanted to see this movie because it seemed really promising of the next attractions: Jim Carrey with divine powers was an idea that definitely worked for me. As a big fan, I was sure he would be extremely in his element with such a promising premise, and what could go wrong? Yesterday, my bubble exploded in a big way, boys and girls, because I saw the movie. <br /> <br /> The first act (stating that he hates his life, is a disgruntled employee and a mostly unhappy camper with an ax to annoy God) is useful, the second act (where he is summoned by God for phone and receives Powers Almighty is BIG: Carrey has fun with his new 'toys' and it's a pleasure to see it, really fun, but the third act is unfortunate beyond what you can believe. <br /> <br /> rot begins to set in after the dinner scene between Bruce and his girlfriend Grace (Jennifer Aniston, who appears EXCEPTIONING well in this movie, considering that her part is simply a plot device, even her NAME reeks of insecurity) - she he thinks he's going to ask "the question" but instead, he tells her (with his knee bent, though) that he's finally getting his job as a news anchor, is not that exciting? <br /> <br / > She does not believe it, she wants him to marry her, my ra, so she ends up leaving it, look, even though she still LOVES it a lot, look, and the rest of the movie we spent hitting her in the head with a pathetic, more than heavy I gave her a clich√© of spiritual sounds after next, until at the end I was also praying. . .to finish it. <br /> <br /> I did not mind the lack of subtlety in the first two acts (an example: in the second act, after he gets his powers, Bruce enters the room singing "What would happen if God were one of us, just a lazy one of us, "blah blah blah), and I was even willing to overlook the incredible amount of contradictions that were thrown at us (for the openers, Morgan Freeman - a / k / a GOD) he tells Bruce he can. He does not violate anyone's free will, but he does this, a lot). Those elections were forgivable: this is a Jim Carrey comedy, directed by Tom Shadyac, it's not The Remains of the Day. <br /> <br /> Or, rather, it was SUPPOSED that it was a comedy. When the script writers lose track of that (in the dreaded act 3) and try to turn the proceedings into a kind of Message Film (joke), what we get is hell on earth. Bruce realizes the error of his selfish ways, realizes that GRACE is his salvation, it must be said, grace, and that his priorities in life had been seriously misinterpreted. However, all this could have been transmitted in a much less harsh way. The film did not have to get into the dumper to make these points. Unfortunately, the writers and Shadyac apparently had no idea how to solve the story in an intelligent and light way, so they followed the path of bang-em-over-the-heads in the hope that we would not notice. They even added some surprisingly unpleasant results in the end, hoping that this would diminish the bad taste. It did not work for me.
