The criticism of Poland must be feminist, since it considers that "the young Catherine" is a great and historically accurate film. Could not be farther from the truth. As a practicing Russian historian for many, many years I made an exception with YC in almost all cases, and in particular the politically correct description of her as the chief who alone led Russia to a domain address. The truth? She was only taken to St. Petersburg to be a wife and mother, and discovered that she had to "bond" with the dvoriane, the boyars and the army just to survive. As long as he did not challenge them, he could / did satisfy his cultural desires (fill the Hermitage with artistic treasures, etc.). There is so much evidence that she was not "good", but in this area of ​​postmodern revisionism, the proof is not very popular. YC is just a costume drama, a little fluff from Ted Turner that, like "Peter the Great" in 1986, is yet another example of how bad Russia is portrayed in the West.
