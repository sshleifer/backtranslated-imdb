One of the cornerstones of low-budget cinema is to take a well-known classic story and turn it into a complete bastardization. Phantom of the Mall is no exception to this rule. The scriptwriter takes the script of the opera ghost and moves it to a mall in the late 80's. However, the goal of the "Phantom" now is simply to take revenge on those responsible for disfiguring his face and murdering his family. Special effects provide a good laugh, especially when parts of the body begin to appear on the plates of the yogurt holder. Pauly Shore has a small role that does not allow him to be as obnoxious as one might expect, especially since his fifteen minutes of MTV fame had not yet arrived. If you're looking for some good laughs at the expense of the actors and the special effects team, check out this movie. Otherwise, keep looking for something else.
