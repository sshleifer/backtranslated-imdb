I will give credit where the credit is due and I will say that Linda Fiorentino has a good performance as an actress who takes what she wants. She is shameless, shameless, with hard edges and very sexy; She is much better than this movie deserves. <br /> <br /> But that's it. This boring thriller is a fragmented disaster, trying at the same time to be a stalker thriller, a thriller of murders, a tale of loyalty and betrayal, and an erotic thriller. The movie, my friends, is not exciting in the least. <br /> <br /> For example, who thought of choosing C. Thomas Howell as a desirable protagonist? He is not ugly, but to shout out loud, it seems that the goddess of Fiorentino is getting down to work with a kindergarten teacher. Howell has neither the authority nor the presence on the screen to play the leading role. <br /> <br /> The script is by far the worst aspect of the movie. There is no tension since the character of Fiorentino receives disturbing phone calls, there is no mystery regarding his guilt in the murders that are the focus of the film, there is no sense of liberation, as Fiorentino runs out of strength Howell to lose your inhibitions. <br /> <br /> Look for interesting but poorly made cameos by Adam Ant and Issac Hayes, and a really good sex scene between Howell and Fiorentino. Besides that, my first impulse would be to get rid of this garbage and rent something else.
