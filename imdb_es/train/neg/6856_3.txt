This film begins in a promising way, with an early scene in which Frank Morgan advises against the marriage of Gary Cooper with his daughter, Anita Louise. Frank Morgan, who plays a brazen gold prospector, complains loudly to Cooper about his perception of hardship at the hands of his family, including his daughter, Anita Louise. I'm a fan of the 3 actors. Frank Morgan is (in my opinion) a Hollywood treasure, Cooper a legend, and Louise a very charming, versatile and unappreciated actress who is rarely seen in the lead role. Nor do I have anything against Teresa Wright, and although she has not been blessed with a great variety, she usually offers encouraging performances. <br /> <br /> From a promising opening, the story slides downhill to the end. I did not find anything funny about burning the house of Cooper's in-laws. The butler in such an annoying and non-smoking household would never leave cheerfully, allowing Cooper to continue smoking, or alternatively, provide him with some means to get rid of his cigarette. Also, no one with common sense would allow himself to stay with a lit cigarette without asking for some means to get rid of it. And finally, no one in their right mind crushes a cigarette with a handkerchief and puts it in their pocket! This whole sequence has just made Cooper look silly and gauche. It is a bad idea: poorly conceived and filmed in a way that leads to ridicule not to laughter. <br /> <br /> Cooper's forced medical examination is similarly designed. Nobody is allowed to undergo a complete medical examination without being informed of their purpose or not giving their consent! That Cooper has done it is too far from reality to be fun, it's absurd! Stealing babies from hospitals is a serious legal crime, and that's no laughing matter either. Finally, scenes of Cooper's excessively bothersome and neurotic attention to feeding and his baby's weight may have hit a nerve with some people who have experienced anxiety about their own newborn babies. But I find them tedious and slow. The wardrobe and the prop departments were exaggerated in those scenes, while, paradoxically, the scriptwriter went to sleep. <br /> <br /> The lines are not in the script to generate humor. They only fail on all cylinders. Laughter does not reach a mile per minute, but rather a year-to-light. The only time the movie has energy or humor is when Frank Morgan is in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> The scene that is completely wasted is when the two love interests of Cooper and their respective parents are locked in the same hotel. room together. There is probably a rich vein of humor somewhere in that mine, but nothing was extracted. <br /> <br /> In the end, one of the two very nice girls is going to get hurt. Predictably, it is the character of Anita Louise, who gets angry on her wedding night! While it's not in the camera, that's its destiny, and it's not particularly fun, even like a loose end. She had not done anything in this film to make me indifferent (unlike Gail Patrick, for example, in My Favorite Wife). Consequently, I was hoping (maybe "waiting" is a better word in the context of the movie!) So that Anita Louise also enjoys a happy ending. The fact that such a cute character is essentially eliminated at the end of the movie really undermines the "happy ending" effect for Cooper and Wright. <br /> <br /> I kept waiting for something to happen, for the ingenious dialogue so characteristic of the films of the time ... And never gave it up. A good performance of Frank Morgan in a slightly different role is totally wasted here.
