This movie is just bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Now that I've got it out of the way, I feel better. This movie is poor from beginning to end. The story is lame. The 3-D segment is really bad. Freddy is in his worst cartoon character. Thank God they killed him. And who wants to see the cameos of Roseanne and Tom Arnold? <br /> <br /> The only good thing about the movie is the little background story we give to Freddy. We see that he once had a family, and we can see his abusive and alcoholic father (Alice Cooper). <br /> <br /> Apart from that, everything is bad. There are some quality actors here (Lisa Zane and Yaphet Kotto), and they do the best they can, but the end result is very bad. The hour and a half that I spent watching this movie is the hour and a half that I can never go back.
