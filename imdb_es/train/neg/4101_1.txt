This could be one of the worst movies I've seen. I do not see how this could be described as a horror movie, or even a thriller. It's more like a heavy drama. The terrifying music is EXCELLENT, but since there was no fear, the director thought it would be a good idea to use it for daily activities, such as throwing a garbage can or going down stairs. The movie had a lot of potential. They had a beautiful cinematography (sp?) and interesting characters, but it seemed as if the writers assumed that you already knew them. they would submit to peculiar activities without explanation or even a clue as to what they meant. This is just one of those movies that says it's about one thing and it's something totally different.
