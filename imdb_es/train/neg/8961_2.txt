This movie was another waste of time ... Why, oh, why do I keep renting this shit? ... someone, please, tell me ... * sigh * Oh, good. back to the film we're dealing with: it's probably worth Cube Zero if he REALLY REALLY enjoyed the first movie (as I did), and he just wants to see what happened in the last movie (hopefully) put together just to keep Some poor actors and scriptwriters employed, then, of course, this is the movie for you. But if you're looking for a good movie with good acting and a fantastic plot ... * evil smile * then this movie is definitely for you :-D ... OK, I'm lying ... At best, this movie stinks . Okay, I must admit that certain elements were great ... well ... coolish ... and I laughed many times, many of the wrong things, but nevertheless I had fun. :-) But in general, the few things that barely make the category "ok" is not enough to make this movie worthwhile at all. Unless you count "Hands - Hand of Fate", one of the ten best movies in history!
