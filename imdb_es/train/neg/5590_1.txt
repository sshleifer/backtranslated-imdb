Horrible movie About an old crusty painter who walks with a girl. Boring. Tatum O Neil reviews the movements on his part and presents some of the most important lines in the history of cinema. Richard Burton looks close to death in this movie, and we're supposed to believe he looks "Good for sixty". The acting is bad, as is the plot. The characters are horrible, as is the story. It's very hard to feel for anyone in this movie, except Larry Ewashen, who plays a guy in a porn theater that hits Tatum, is a little funny. This movie is really a waste of time. If you're a Tatum fan, like me, so I rented it in the first place, do not watch this movie. She is very bad at that, and you wonder if maybe PAPER MOON was a coincidence. It was not like that, due to BAD NEWS BEARS and LITTLE DARLINGS you know you can act well, but even so, do not rent this movie. And if you're a Burton fan, rent something when he was handsome, and not a fossil.
