I have not seen him in more than twenty years. OJ was the bus driver, Arte Johnson was the tour guide, Lorenzo was the hijacker. <br /> <br /> Yes, Lorenzo seemed a great villain like the villain, a native. I think I saw it for the most part by OJ, whom I had seen Towering Inferno and Cassandra Crossing, but also Arte Johnson. <br /> <br /> I was a little bored that Johnson was so serious. <Br /> <br /> And yes, changed plots. When I read other publications, I remember that it was a plot that they were going to kidnap a rich girl, but then that priceless stamp business appeared out of nowhere. <br /> <br /> I was going, a stamp? If it came like a late movie, I would probably record it to see it again, but I would not feel nostalgic about it. Not yet, anyway. <br /> <br /> There are better films of the seventies like this to see them.
