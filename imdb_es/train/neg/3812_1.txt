Full House is one of the worst TV series! Why? Because all the characters are so irritating that it is impossible to bear it. The best character is Joey and even he is quite annoying from time to time. That DJ girl, who wrote her character? I want to kill myself every time he talks. Not to mention when Danny starts with his philosophy. <br /> <br /> Example: DJ won around ten thousand dollars or more in the casino. However, he is not eighteen years old, so he should not bet according to the law. However, the casino was ready to pay her money, but then Danny, her father kills her and we do not let her raise that money because she is not eighteen. Come on, give me a break, will you? Since I've seen that stupid and childish scene I instantly turned off the television. Some of the things they say in this series that not even a child would buy. Who in the world could think that Full House is entertaining and fun? Every word they say in this series seems to be like the one Shakespeare wrote. It's. Except that Shakespere knew how to write and except that he would not be. How childish and stupid to write something as stupid as they wrote in the Full House script! <br /> <br /> For all those who have a bad heart or any kind of bad medical condition or any will for life or any sense of the real world, I deeply recommend "Do not see the Full House". Not even one episode as a test. Avoid this series. Save yourself from stupidity and nonsense. This is the worst television show of all time! I prefer to see Teletubbies instead. "Do not look at this."
