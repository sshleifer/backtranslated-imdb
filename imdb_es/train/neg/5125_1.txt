As a youth pastor I heard good things about this movie. Then I looked at him. The performance was not the best. That is forgivable. It is the message that is not: give Jesus your life and everything will change; will face better, achieve incredible captures, stop poking, start making touchdown passes and even reach the playoffs. All because Jesus magically turns the weak of insufficient size into All-American athletes. I laughed out loud when a coach quoted the scriptures to explain to the kicker why he was missing the field goals. But wait, that's not all. You will get a new truck, an increase of $ 6000, and the fight of you and your wife with infertility will end suddenly in pregnancy - twice. THEN, you will win the state championship because God helps a villain to kick the winning field goal 12 yards more than ever before, and no less to the wind, all because "God wanted me to achieve it". Then you will again win the state championship next year. None of these good things would have happened if the team had not chosen to follow Jesus with all their heart. <br /> <br /> This is what I removed from the movie: God can do everything he wants to do when he wants to. He wants to do it, and it's about making our lives better, easier and more enjoyable. He chooses his favorite team and helps them win games. On what bible is this story based? I bet San Esteban wished he had known the keys to such a safe life before being condemned to death. Someone should have made this movie before 10 of the 11 apostles were killed for following Jesus. It would have saved everyone a lot of problems.
