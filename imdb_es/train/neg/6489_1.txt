What seemed like a good premise for a movie ... Unfortunately, it's not true on almost every level. Very difficult to follow at the beginning of the movie, I really found myself struggling against the need to turn it off. The biggest problem from one point of view is the fact that the work of the camera is simply exaggerated with so many "artistic" splices and subliminal cuts throughout the film that really distract you from the general story. He really tries too hard to immerse yourself in the moment and build a suspense ending, but the movie has so many characters conceived in half and a non-relevant script that makes you feel disappointed and confused about why they tried to go deeper into it. .
