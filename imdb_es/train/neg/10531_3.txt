This is a kind of genre, which means that either you like the musicals of the fifties or not. If you do, you will love this. Personally, I prefer the 1930s and most of the musicals of the 40s with the dance talents of Astaire and Rogers, and Eleanor Powell, Bill Robinson, Ruby Keeler, James Cagney, Shirley Temple, etc., but the songs of the 50s, the slowest. The dancing numbers and the soapy melodramas of the decade turn me off. <br /> <br /> This movie is a concrete case. The first song was fine, but the next three did nothing for me. By then, the story was not very attractive either. The presence of Deborah Kerr is another less. I do not think I've seen a movie I starred in that I liked, including this one, in which the two-legged English teacher she plays spends half the movie threatening to leave Siam. (I had!). <br /> <br /> However, by divorcing myself from likes and dislikes, it can not be denied that this production by Rogers and Hammerstein has great appeal for many people, particularly for those who liked "The Sound Of Music" a decade later. There are similarities in the R & H musicals. So, if you liked Julie Andrews' movie, you should also like this. <br /> <br /> This is a luxurious production with, yes, a capital "L". This is the kind of high-production musicals that you rarely see after that generation. You also have the nicknamed singers, unlike today, where the actress is not really able to sing, so Marnie Nixon comes to rescue Kerr, as she did with Natalie Wood in "West Side Story" and Audrey Hepburn in "My Fair Lady. " "<br /> <br /> Yul Brynner is the" Mongkut King "and is the stereotyped traditionalist, the kind filmmaker who always portrays negatively, he is not" progressive, "as the leftists like to say, but the A teacher of education (Kerr, like "Anna Leonowens") will straighten it in. Today's secular progressives always place teachers higher than people trying to cure cancer! However, Yul is good at this role and even employs some comedy along with his character of more barks than bitten Justifiably, he is the great star of this film Brynner had magnetism Even in "The Magnificent Seven", Yul was the only cowboy who hypnotized the audience. <br /> <br /> In short, it's a good movie for its time and millions of people enjoyed it.
