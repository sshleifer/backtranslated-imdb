Oh my God, this was so bad! The story was weak, at best, and the animation was flat and lifeless, even childish. This movie is taken too seriously ... unless, of course, they want to be fun. I saw it last week at the Science Fiction Festival in London and everyone was laughing at every scene. I think my favorite was 'you should not be studying medicine in Oopsalof'! And I also think they were trying to see how many times they could get into Nicalo's only line of the character "we'll be together ... it's our destiny". I'm sorry, but after the first time, the words lost all their meaning. <br /> <br /> And what about the apple? <br /> <br /> I recommend this as a lesson for the Americans: you can not cheer up, so please do not try to just embarrass yourself.
