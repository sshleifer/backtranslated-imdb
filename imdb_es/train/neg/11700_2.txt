I really wanted to see this movie, but after seeing it I was very disappointed. The best thing was when Stephen King was in it. Robert John Berk can not act to save his life and none of the others can do it. Some of the performances even made me laugh out loud! The film was not as I had imagined it, after reading the book, which was incredible, I imagined it darker and much more terrifying. If I were Stephen, I would be really angry! <br /> <br /> I do not know why they changed the ending, I thought the end of the book was very good. If you just discovered that the cake killed your daughter, you would not give it to anyone else, right ?! <br /> <br /> The book was much better!
