This inferior sequel based on the characters created by David Selzer and Harvey Bernhard (also producer) concerns a marriage called Gene (Michael Woods) and Karen York (Faye Grant). Adopt a girl named Delia from a convent. Gene York on re-election for congressman and he chairs the finance committee. Meanwhile, Delia seems to be present when unexplained deaths occur. She creates havoc when she goes to a metaphysical fair, as the numerology, therapy, counseling, yoga, tarot and other stores are destroyed. Karen York hires a private eye (Michael Lerner) to investigate strange and strange events. <br /> <br /> This sequel to TV shows emotions, chills, spooky events and bloody murders. Delia, like Damien, seems to dispatch a new and mysterious murder every few minutes of the movie, horrible murders happening. The main emotion lies in observing what a new and innocent victim can do with the special medium effects. In addition, the mediocre protagonists, Faye Grant and Michael Woods, regardless of the good secondary cast, such as Michael Lerner, Madison Mason, Duncan Fraser and the recently deceased Don S Davis, was an Army captain turned into an actor. As always, excellent musical score taken from Omen I and III by the great Jerry Goldsmith. The film is exclusive for hardcore followers of the Omen saga. The film is poorly directed by Jorge Montesi and Dominique Othenin Girard. The previous and much better versions are the following: The immense original superior 'Omen' (Gregory Peck, Lee Remick) of Richard Donner; 'Damien' (William Holden, Lee Grant) by Don Taylor; 'Final Conflict' (Sam Neil and Tisa Harrow) by Grahame Baker. Rating: below average.
