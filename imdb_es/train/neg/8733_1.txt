*** Possible Spoilers Plot *** <br /> <br /> I love Dennis Hopper. I question why he accepted the detective role of the police in 2000 at The Spreading Ground. This movie sucks and I'm about to tell you why. <br /> <br /> It is a small town that is about to get a contract for a sports stadium. One problem: there is a loose assassin and that is bad for business. The mayor makes a deal with the Irish mafia to find the killer and make sure he never gets to court. Det. Ed Delongpre has other plans. He also wants you to catch this guy, but he's on the level and he believes in the system. He wants the system to do its job. <br /> <br /> That could have been pretty good. It could have been fascinating. It was horrible. First, they label this guy as a serial killer. Err no. There are specific criteria and none of them fits here. The bad boy killed 5 children the first day, and I think it was 2 the second day. This whole movie extends as a period of time of 48 hours ... Action of Hardly Killer Serial. I do not care what distorted motives they give you in the end, Serial Killers does its job for a long period of time. They do not suddenly kill 7 children in two days. That is a Spree. <br /> <br /> Ok, irritating other, the performance was atrocious. The only name here was Hopper, and he is the only one who was even close to achieving his part. Unfortunately, he is a kind of cast for me and I think he does psychological parts much, much better. This simply was not a good vehicle for Hopper. It did not allow him to do what he does best, which is to act in a creepy way. It's not that I did it wrong, it's that I've seen it do it much better. <br /> <br /> The Irish mob boy, Johnny Gault (Tom McCamus - The Long Day of the Night Journey), who is in charge of His investigation is too rigid. Contradiction? Not really. He is trying to play the boy cold and hard, and he does it to the point that the character is made of wood. Bored to the fullest. He did not scare me. It did not inspire any emotion, except boredom. I can not say how many times I checked to see how much time passed until the end of this movie. <br /> <br /> The other thing about this is that it had the feeling of being a movie made for television. . You know what I mean. The poor production values, low budget, reuse of scenes to save costs. Only eh. Yanno? But, I feel that comparing this to that is an insult to them. <br /> <br /> Derek Vanlint was the Director and Director of Photography for this project. He bit more than he could chew. I can not help feeling that Hopper must have assumed this role as a personal favor for a friend. That is the only rational that occurs to me. This was the first work of Vanlint as Director, the third as director of photography. I hope this has been a learning experience for him. <br /> <br /> I will not ruin the end in case you decide to torture yourself with this, but I want to say that everyone left the ball here. ..even hopper. In a scene that should have been emotionally heartbreaking for the detective, it was just ... well ... blah. I did not see the anguish at all that would accompany the total gear change that this guy did. Very disappointing. <br /> <br /> This duration of 100 exhausting minutes and R-rating of violence and language. No child under the age of 13 will have any interest in seeing this, so do not worry. It is not suitable for anyone anyway. je. <br /> <br /> Skip this one. You will thank me later.
