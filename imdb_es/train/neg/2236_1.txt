I really do not know where to start. The acting in this movie was really terrible, I do not remember seeing so many "actors" in a movie that they could not perform. Not only was the acting bad, the characters were also incredibly stupid. <br /> <br /> Then there is the action. I think even children know that when someone is shot, there is blood involved. But when someone is shot in Snitch'd for ten (!!) times, there is no blood at all. Well, I guess it's just me. <br /> <br /> To summarize a long story (because, believe me, I can talk for several hours about this movie), this is without a doubt the worst movie I've ever seen. This movie should be number 1 in the bottom 100 no doubt.
