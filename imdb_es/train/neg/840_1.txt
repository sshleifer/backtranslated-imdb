I totally agree with the last commentator: this could be the worst movie ever made. I also had to move faster in most of this movie. Michael Madsen must have made this movie as a favor to someone. The quality of the image is grainy at all times. And the little plot that exists is simply stupid. I give this movie a 1 out of 10 if I can give it a lower score. Do not waste your time in this movie or you will regret it.
