It's not the worst movie I've seen but it's definitely not very good either. I myself am a paintball player, I used to play a lot of airball and going from woods to airball is a big change. The film presents similar qualities First of all, the film starts with this team that apparently is trying to film this guy "Ghost" or whatever, they seem to be a professional team and they wear t-shirts and they shoot magazines, autocockers. A boy wearing a hairy. There is not much wrong with the movie, but more how it is perceived to have been very cheesy. A group of children who are good are woodsball players who do not seem to have much money and dream of having "better weapons". Another team chooses them constantly and insults them because they play the forest and blah, blah, blah. The ghost helps these children of Woodsball and trains them and all this shit, takes them to play the air ball and basically defeats all the teams, including the "professionals". <br /> <br /> So, what exactly is wrong with the movie? Well, the budget is a huge thing, a paintball movie would NOT be bad, but the budget is quite low and the film looks like it was made by an amateur. There are no big names in this movie and the acting is very cheesy. The perception of paintball is also quite bad. It seems to imply that everyone goes to the fastball and all this other shit. In my opinion, it was just a terrible movie and it does not give a real perception of what paintball is. To be honest, true paintball is not everything as a friend, it's a lot of insults and rewards, not "respect" and according to the rules. Do not watch this movie and then you wait to go to a field shouting "4 is 1!"
