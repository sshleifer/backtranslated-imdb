The Golden Age of Disney cartoons was dying in the late 1990s. This Quack Pack program should not even be considered a spinoff of DuckTales because the show had little to do with DuckTales. This is a Huey, Dewey and Louie of teenage age, as they create problems for their uncle Donald and speak in hip-hop lingo and are fully dressed unlike DuckTales. I prefer the little adventurous nephews of DuckTales. There are humans in Duckburg and the ducks are the only animals that live in Duckburg. There are no references of Scrooge McDuck. The stories are repetitive, the plot is boring but the animation is good. If you want a lot of slapstick humor, I recommend this. If you want a better Disney show, see "Darkwing Duck" or "DuckTales".
