A perfect little atrocity ... I doubt that a single shot lasted longer than the regulation-MTV 4.4 seconds. Horrible release, worse even than in the version of Kusminsky (a reminder: managed to splurge Juliet Binoche and Ralph Feinnnes). But, hey, the rich got what they deserved. The dark and melancholy Heathcliff was reduced to the status of a golden angel, the fragile and angelic Catherine presented as a chubby, melon servant, humble and weak. Linton is a tom who watches furtively, and the innocent Isabel becomes Sara Michelle-Gellar's character of Cruel Intentions. . Eddie Bauer, 15, Abercrombie and Fitch donners, take note. This thing was made for you. It is a music video of an hour and a half in which you are given everything; you are saved from the uncomfortable need not to even try to understand the complexity of the characters, but even the initial impact of their actions. The actors tried, but, as I said before, they were embezzled. Decent photography, but the edition is at the level of the television production class in high school. I implore you all: read the book, or even the cliff notes; look at previous versions, including Kusminsky's; But stay away from the many future reruns, during which you will not receive the benefit of the premiere without commercials.
