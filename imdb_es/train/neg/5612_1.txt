As a spiritualist and not a Christian. I thought I was really going to cling to my faith, but what a load of seers. I thought the movie would have great arguments, but I only got a partial view of atheists and Jews. And who are all these people on the street who are interviewing and who do not know the back of their arms? Where are the appropriate theologians and priests and things from which you could have obtained arguments? Non-retired nuts that wrote books and finished their studies in 1970. Personally, this DVD was a waste of time and is not worth my time to check if the facts are correct or incorrect or if I should or should not believe because an anti-Christ He told me so. Please think that you came to the conclusion that you did not find God because your own ego and demons overcame it. I will not say that the film was impressive to help atheists read this to feel better about themselves. But if you really want to show the world that you care about the poor souls who believe in Jesus, tíñanos with your courage, not your battery.
