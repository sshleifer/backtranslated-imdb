'Maladolescenza' has the air of a dark fairy tale, with its children protagonists, the forest environment and the discovery of the ruins of a castle. However, in its essence, the film is essentially an unusual psychosexual study of teenagers. The film, which begins with a sequence of dreams that employs the not so subtle metaphor of Fabrizio struggling with his menacing dog, details his psychological persecution of Laura, the girl who promised her love and his eventual romance with the equally malicious Sylvia. The film's psychological intricacies give the movie credit, but there's no question how unnecessarily exploitative the film is in its description of nudity and sex. The look of the film is based more on its magnificent places than on a particular cinematographic ability, and there is no doubt that the biggest asset of the film is the chilling children's soundtrack augmented by the chorus. With its strange dream quality, the film is, at best, interesting, but pales next to the mysterious "Black Moon" by Louis Malle from the same period. Certainly, deserving of the debate between art and pornography, since unlike many forbidden films, 'Salo' by Pasolini or 'Ken Park' by Larry Clark, for example, the film is quite unremarkable from an artistic perspective. The cinema seems to be gradually losing its capacity for commotion, so perhaps the 'Maladolescenza' should be admired for retaining that power thirty years after its release. However, the shock value is the only reason why the movie is memorable. <br /> <br /> The movie has its defenders. However, so does Nazism.
