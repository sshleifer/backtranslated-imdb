Only an old silly movie. First, Stanwyck's son gets stuck in his foot in a really silly way, and then his husband gets caught in his foot in another really silly way. In an effort to save him, Stanwyck has bad luck, once again, and finds an escaped convict. She has the opportunity to kill him, but fails in a very foolish way. In the end, her husband is safe, and Stanwyck tells us through the narrative what the stupid message of the film is. Everything is fine that ends stupid. <br /> <br /> I could never understand how an unattractive woman like Stanwyck once became a leading woman in the Golden Age of Hollywood with a glamorous style; What nose is so beautiful? So photogenic? The film is mercifully short, and lasts little more than an hour. It's as if the director felt he was committing shit, so he thought it was better to keep the shit short.
