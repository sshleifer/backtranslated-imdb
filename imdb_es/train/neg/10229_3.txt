I am basing this on my observations of an episode I saw last night (9/27/06). I do not think I'll be seeing again. The performance was totally wooden, the plot completely predictable, the ending totally unrealistic. I mean, who would believe a $ 30 million trial for the death of a recovering drug addict with terminal cancer? The main actor (Victor Garber) seemed so uncomfortable, almost embarrassed in his role, maybe he realized how bad the writing was! I realize that the drama that is offered this season is quite poor, but surely you can find better writers. Maybe they are outsourcing the writing to India or China !! I bet we will not see this next season!
