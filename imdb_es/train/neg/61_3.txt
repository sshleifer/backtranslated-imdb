There is not a drop of sun in "The Sunshine Boys", which makes the title of this supposed comedy the only ironic moment of Neil Simon. Simon, who adapted the script of his work (which has not been proven), equates old age with irrational behavior, and, what is worse, clumsy, galumphing, mean-spirited irrational behavior. Walter Matthau is relentless with us playing an old vaudeville actor who met former comedian George Burns for a television special (it is said to have been a team for 43 years, which raises the question "how long did it last? the vaudeville, anyway? "). Burns, who won a supporting Oscar, has the misfortune to come to the film in about thirty minutes, after which Matthau has already flown the material to hell and returned. The more noisy the film is, the less tolerable and visible it is. Director Herbert Ross only did a solid job when it was not together with one of Neil Simon's scripts; here, Ross prepares jokes as an amateur who hits hard, hammering the belligerent routines that do not work (like Matthau, semi-incoherent, who shows up at a mechanic's garage for an audition for a television commercial). At this point, Matthau was still too young for this role, and he overcompensated by slouching and screaming. A Ross and Simon had to tone down the character, nuance his temper to give a little sun to "The Sunshine Boys", however, Walter continues to project as if we had all been deaf. The image looks terribly monotonous and creeps at a rhythm without spirit; one loses hope of it from the beginning. * 1/2 of ****
