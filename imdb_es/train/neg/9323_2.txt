What did I just watch? I spent 90 minutes of my precious life watching one of the dumbest movies I've seen. The concept of a serial killer clown is actually quite scary, as there are many people who are afraid of clowns ... but being a 300-pound children's song that recites the killer clown makes fun of the genre. I still wonder how the character that Mark could not escape from the clown ... he weighs 300 pounds and finally he's going to get tired. The whole ending made me get up and literally say out loud "What did I just see?" Apparently, Brandon is Denise's cousin ... and they put him near the middle of the movie, which means he had sex with his cousin ... Yeah, that's something people want, so see * shudders *. <br /> <br /> Another thing I found hilariously stupid was the opening scene where the clown stabs a woman and she says "What did you do?" Well, Bytch, what do you think he just did? The last thing that was stupidly funny was in a second that the main character was slapping the hitchhiker and calling her on the phone and then, 5 minutes later, saying that the violence is not helping at all ... did the author of the script give the line ? the wrong guy? Anyway, none of these movies makes sense. <br /> <br /> The movie was more or less a stupid low-budget porn that attracted me the purchase (all 3.99) and had no entertainment outside of the sex scenes. I'm surprised that the fat clown did not join the orgy, it would have fit well. I expected the movie to have some entertainment value like other B movies, but I was wrong. This is a piece of garbage that is not worth seeing. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10
