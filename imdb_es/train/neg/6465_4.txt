This departure from Charles is decent, but this is a pretty discreet performance. Marlon Brando stands out. There is a secondary plot with Mira Sorvino and Donald Sutherland who forgets to develop and the film hurts a little. I'm still trying to figure out why Charlie wants to change his name. Each movie with "Charles" has been pretty bad.
