This film deserves more than a 1. But I give it one because many fans of Fricken have given him a 10, which results in a rating that will take him to the list of the 100 best. Seriously, it's not so good, it's not that bad. It's a stupid cult classic with so many Fricken fans that it's ridiculous. These are the guys who probably still laugh at Chuck Norris's jokes and still say "I'm Rick James B! Tch" No matter how old or annoying he is. I am afraid to have to hear that "I am tired of the MFn snakes on this MFn plane" within a few months, of idiots who try to be funny. It's a bad plot, shit, acting, etc. It's okay to love a bad movie, but you still have to admit it's a bad movie. <br /> <br /> Wait until the Marine, starring John Cena, wants to see a real movie.
