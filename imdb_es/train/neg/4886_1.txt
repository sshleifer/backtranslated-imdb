Due to budget cuts, Ethel Janowski (again played by Priscilla Alden) is released from a mental institution (even though she killed six people) and handed over to the Hope Bartholomew Lodge. Once there, she immediately falls back on her criminal ways and kills anyone who stands between her and her food. <br /> <br /> HOLY MOLY! Does this movie suck! You know you're in trouble when the open credits begin and it's just the credits of the first movie, apparently filmed from a television screen. Nick Millard (under his pseudonym Nick Phillips) decided to return to the world of Crazy Fat Ethel more than ten years later and with a budget that probably covered the cost of a blank tape and the rental of a video camera for the weekend. Let's say that Millard's unique style does not translate well into video. Seriously, I've made home movies with more production value than this. And Millard tries to get a SILENT NIGHT, SAME NIGHT 2 filling in half the execution time with images from the first movie (which looks like it was taken from a worn VHS copy). Alden is again good as Ethel, but the movie is so inept that you start to feel sorry for her for starring in this garbage. I mean, at least the first movie tried. Here we do not have music, weaker effects (if possible), unstable camera work, horrible audio and editing that seem to have been made with two connected video recorders. Avoid this at all costs!
