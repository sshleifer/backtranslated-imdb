I have never published a review before, but I had to do it for this movie! This movie is SO bad, I found myself trying to justify how bad it is to try to think of it as kitsch or parody. But it is not. It is truly, without being aware of yourself, BAD. This is a serious attempt that fails gloriously. Other critics have pointed out the many flaws in the film, so I will try not to repeat them, but I urge you to watch this movie. Throughout all this, I was speechless, literally gasping in disbelief, or rolling on the floor in a state of hysteria. I had not had so much fun watching a movie in years. In fact, I'm going to try to get all my friends to see it because it's the kind of movie that should be shared. <br /> <br /> My favorite parts: - When Arthur auditions to be an opportunity. -good boy (his dance is amazing) - Free nudity (the director / main actor only had to be shot naked) - The preacher's office with his cardboard and crayon of Christ - Of course, the famous wedding scene with palm trees and the forgotten rings (what narrative function does this play?!?) - The ex-wife's struggle coincides with Ben to take possession of his weapon - The detailed sequence in which Arthur kills the preacher; apparently he burns it with this incredibly miserable combination - Yeah, the fanatic brother of homosexual religions with his bleached hair and his fashions WeHo - And, my favorite, the use of Joplin's "The Entertainer" as the opening soundtrack and the " Canon de Pachebel "in D Major" as the closing soundtrack! - the list goes on and on - YOU MUST SEE IT !!!
