"Could a great documentary be?" Yes, if one is deaf, dumb and blind. Everything but meaning, wit, visual style and interesting subject. Other than that. . . <br /> <br /> Seriously, volken. This is a movie that is completely inauthentic. A document of adventures without adventure, a war document without feelings of war, a countryside without any sign of ingenuity. It does not mean anything, it feels like nothing and carries the implicit message that absolutely nothing matters. No wonder he has so many IMDb fans! Of course, entering you know that a film starring the great Skip Lipman will not have culture, will not have intelligence, will not have ingenuity (apart from a corrosive adolescent joke), and there will be no recognizable human emotion. Only adrenaline. "Darkon" is not a movie, it's a panic attack! Avoid. There are too many real documentaries and very little time in life to waste it in the accumulation of toilets like "Darkon".
