Are you kidding that it was horrible! <br /> <br /> But even though I got this movie and another 3 and they were all on DVD. The movie starts practically like a good movie but it goes downhill from the middle forward. <br /> <br /> And the end, well, let's say it was one of the most recent anti-climate endings in the history of cinema. A lot of blood in the final sequence and if you like a dose of Schlock Horror, this is the movie for you ... <br /> <br /> 3/10
