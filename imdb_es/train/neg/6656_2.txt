This gives me two because I liked it when I was a child, but it became so redundant that I started to hate it ... I can not give this a descriptive review because I would be rethinking one thing after another, I probably would not. Do not say anything that everyone else has not already said. <br /> <br /> The only other thing about this program is that it is quite unpleasant, with the child with whom he boils that twisted babysitter to the stupidity that runs around. and about that. I have a cousin who loves this show and is the strangest and dumbest person I've ever met. This show must be taken off the air. It's always the same again and again ... They need to put better shows on Nick. I'm really very tired of things like this.
