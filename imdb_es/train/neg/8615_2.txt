This movie was so bad, obsolete and stupid that I had difficult times to see it until the end. I had seen this guy from Rodney in Natural Born Killers and I thought it was really fun, but this movie was crap. The "jokes" were not funny, the actors were not funny, none of that was even remotely fun. Do not waste your time for this! Only positive things about this were the beautiful wives :) and Molly Shannon, who I'm sure did everything possible, but the script was too horrible. That's why I rated it with "2" instead of "1", but it's definitely one of the worst movies I've seen.
