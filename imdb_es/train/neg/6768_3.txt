Herbie, the Volkswagen who thinks like a man, is back, now driven by Maggie Peyton (Lindsay Lohan), a young woman who hopes to become a NASCAR champion. The only thing that stands in his way is the current champion, Trip Murphy (Matt Dillon), who will do anything to stop them. <br /> <br /> The original error of love was not so good. Even as a child, I remember that I did not like it very much. Although I had some hope for the sequel. I mean, the cast is pretty good and the trailer makes it look like a pretty funny movie. Unfortunately, Herbie is not better now than he used to be. The film is definitely weak for people older than 12 years. It will probably entertain the children, but that's it. <br /> <br /> I realize it's a movie for children and everything, but they could have made the movie a little more interesting. There was very little laughter and he got bored at the end. Most of the actors seemed dead in their papers too. Lindsay Lohan was fine as Maggie Peyton. She usually gives better performances as in Freaky Friday and Mean Girls. Matt Dillon gave the best performance of all. He was very good as the bad guy, although he did not have much to work with. Justin Long, Breckin Meyer and Michael Keaton are really there and they do not do anything special. <br /> <br /> Angela Robinson directs and does a good job. She tries to keep the movie interesting but is working with a weak script. Thomas Lennon and Ben Garant wrote the script and would you be surprised if they were also responsible for Taxi and The Pacifier? These two make light films, but they do not make the stories interesting or enjoyable. It is not entirely your fault, but I hope that next time you will try harder. In the end, Herbie is a safe and predictable family movie that is worth seeing if you are a child. Everyone else is better jumping. Rating 4/10
