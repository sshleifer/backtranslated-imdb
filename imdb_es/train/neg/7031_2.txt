What made me trace this movie was the Vampyres visualization, I thought I had to get the other films that this guy (Larroz) did, I regretted having traced this, it's a weak attempt at an occult / satanic type movie. with sex and only sex (with ugly actors and actresses, this is an excuse for sordidness.) The only redeeming factor was the environment and the atmosphere, avoid this, too much publicity, it is not worth the effort to find it, this refers to Welcome to the Grind House edition, I hope you have other films that are up to Vampyres, Oh, and the goat scene was very boring, I understand that this is what the hype is about.
