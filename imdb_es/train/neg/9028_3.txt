I just watched this movie and I have to say that, with such a great premise and great talent, this turkey stays there !!! A friend lent me this movie and I looked at it with an open mind, mainly because he praised the story very much. <br /> <br /> Well, the movie started with Kevin Costner as a fighter pilot retreating ... why? Why did you become a fighter pilot? He was supposed to be hired by the character of Anthony Quinn to be his new pilot ... well, we never see Costner approach an airplane for the rest of the movie! <br /> <br /> Costner meets a Texan (James Gammon) who sells a horse to a great Mexican businessman and Costner labels to take him. Not knowing what happened, Gammon is almost dead and Costner takes him to the meeting, what happens is that he is with a Quinn associate! But, nothing comes out of it ... nothing, zilcho! Why did they have the character of Gammon? Why did they have the horse sale with Quinn's associate if nothing came of this? <br /> <br /> Also, after leaving Costner for death, they make the character of Madeline Stowe become a whore, then she attacks one of Quinn's men who was paying a turn ... she stabs him with her own knife, and the next thing that has been moved to a convent! It is not explained why he moved, or when it was done! <br /> <br /> Too much talent wasted on such a weak script and a poor edition! I only saw it because a friend had it and let me see it ... I'll throw it to him during the 2 hours that I wasted my life watching the damn thing!
