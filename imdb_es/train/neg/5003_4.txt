I am ashamed to be writing this review. I say that because those of you who read it will know that I sat through the whole thing and that is embarrassing to admit even to strangers. But I only had to warn those who read the comments of the viewer in IMDb before watching a movie to not see this. It is the least I can do. This is a bad movie! Trust me. The plot is ridiculous. The acting is amateur. And the direction, the camera work, the sets, the costumes, etc. They are second category. Let it go.
