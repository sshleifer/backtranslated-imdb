Oh man, it's amazing how anyone can claim that global warming is a science, well, I guess this elitist nonsense is now replacing the science of eugenics! Al Gore tries to make this problem seem complicated, although he just needs common sense to see that all this is a great deception on the part of a man with his own money-making agenda. <br /> <br /> How have scientists estimated the historical temperatures of this planet? Estimating the activity of the sunspot. Has anyone ever questioned whether this method has been accurate? No, not even Gore himself! So, how on earth would it not be necessary to forecast the future temperature with the activity of the sunspot if it had been so accurate in the past? According to the activity of the sunspot, the current temperature is totally in line with what it should be. How is it that the temperature in the whole universe has increased (relatively) as much as on Earth? Do our SUVs cause the temperature in Jupiter to rise? <br /> <br /> Use a little common sense! It is not necessary to be a space scientist to realize that this can be nothing more than a HOAX. Please investigate yourself. What do Al Gore and his elite friends like Rothschild (the banking family that organized the event live on Earth) earn? Well, the new global bank will be based on carbon credits, which is a tax on everything that produces CO2 omissions, and it's easier to get away with it if people are attracted to thinking that it's to save the world when it's only about money, centralized control and more power for elite bankers. Al Gore even has a company that sells carbon credits! Is it not noble to voluntarily pay carbon credits to save the world, especially if it is your own company? <br /> <br /> I do not want you to believe me blindly, do your own research and use your own common sense and I am sure you will come to the right conclusion.
