I never thought I would see a movie worse than "Lisa Picard Is Famous", but this was pretty close. As is often repeated throughout the comments, it was predictable; Five minutes after the movie, you will know that you will be stranded in the final result. This movie painfully references / rips everything from "Something about Mary" to "Revenge of the Pink Panther." The writer Greg Glienna (Meet the Parents) needs new material. <br /> <br /> The only turn is the misguided boyfriend / police officer pursued by internal affairs, but even that opportunity is lost. Lots of adjustment shots of the Seattle Space Needle needed to disguise the obvious Canadian shooting spot. Some of the worst driving situations in the car scenes almost effortlessly to hide the fact that the car is being dragged through the city in a trailer. Geez, at least turn the wheel or step on the brakes from time to time. Selma Blair is inert and cutting short hair is a crime. $ 3 million for Jason Lee, for what? I guess it's better than skateboarding! <br /> <br /> So here's who should see this movie: the Bee Gees fans who want to hear two actors sing 'Islands in the Stream' badly; People who do not get tired of Julia Stiles. 1/10
