Despite the great design touches of the future, the intelligent premise of Asimov and the excellent performance of Will Smith, this film does not live up to expectations. The clich√©s come thick and fast; (Upon awakening from a recurring nightmare, the dissident policeman revoked his badge the lieutenant of Hardass, to enumerate more he would be ruining it, he can see the end a mile away). This movie is also on the scene: you never feel that you have traveled anywhere; What is supposed to be a global disaster never leaves a Chicago CGI obviously. The robots themselves are good in the foreground, but the "crowd" scenes are more like a bad Disney: the CGI is exaggerated over and over again. And if you can destroy the robots by crushing them, why do they need to inject 'nanites'? You know it's a duff movie when stupid questions like that start bothering you before the climax. It could have been great, but it is less than the sum of its parts, mainly due to the totally predictable plot that could have come from any action movie of the last forty years.
