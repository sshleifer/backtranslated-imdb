By all accounts, this could have been an interesting movie. With a score of the mighty Cradle Of Filth, starring its leader Dani and being touted as "the future of British horror," he hoped Alex Chandon's gore fest would live up to expectations. <br /> <br /> It was wrong. <br /> <br /> Everything about this movie is cliché or inept. The configuration of the story anthology was put to death (and much better) in the seventies and eighties. It's true that the idea of ​​'the sickroom' sent a chill down my spine, but like most of the film I was disappointed by the bad writing of scripts and acting. <br /> <br /> Chandon can not write dialogues. All the prayers with the main investigator of the police are full of insults and insolence (the typical formula of "police to the limit." It's funny, I'm sure I've seen it somewhere else before ...) No, Chandon, You are not Tarantino. . Or Scorsese. It sounds BAD. Ridiculously adds to OTT acting with a very unreliable casting (do not get me wrong, Dani Filth is a great singer and musician, but the actor is not) and the performances are more than laughable. Give me Bruce Campbell any day. <br /> <br /> The visual effects are generally poor, with some atrocious CGI, terrible bloody effects (for the love of God, Peter Jackson did better and it was more than ten years ago with less budget) and filters of editing that scream OVER-USE! As for the often undue use of the Cradle Of Filth ... man score, they must sue. <br /> <br /> The fundamental problem with Cradle Of Fear is that it takes itself seriously, trying to create an atmosphere and incite terror and repulsion within its audience. too many good horror movies made in the seventies and eighties do this much better with much superior gore effects (eg, maniacs, zombie meat eaters, beyond, sighs, etc.), which makes Cradle of Fear, in my opinion, second-rate and obsolete. <br /> <br /> I hope that Chandon can learn from this horrible ghoul from a movie and continue to make a quality horror that really scares. <br /> <br /> Better luck next time.
