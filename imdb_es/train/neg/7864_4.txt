The Hills Have Eyes II is what you expect it to be and nothing more. Of course, it's not going to be an Oscar-nominated film, it's just entertainment where you can get lost for 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> The plot is basically about a group of National Guard apprentices who are fighting the notorious mutated on their last day of training in the desert. It's only they who fight throughout the whole movie, which includes a lot of violence (which is basically the whole movie), since the blood and guts are constantly flying throughout the whole thing, and also another graphic scene of rape that throws uselessly to surprise the audience. <br /> <br /> I would give Hills Have Eyes II 4 out of 10 for pure entertainment, and just that. Although even then I found myself looking at my watch more and more as the movie progressed, as it began to crawl due to the fact that I kept trying to surprise the audience with graphic gore and the occasional jumping scene just to make sure that the audience stay awake The Hills Have Eyes II is just a decent entertainment, something to pass the time if you're bored, and nothing more. <br /> <br /> 4/10
