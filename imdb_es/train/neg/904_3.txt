"Stella," starring Bette Midler in the title role, is a blatant tear-jerk of tears. Located in the state of New York, Stella Claire works nights as a bar maid, serving and dancing in a worker's classroom. One night, an inert medical intern arrives, Stephen Dallas, who courts Stella, and in the course of his adventure impregnates her. She rejects her offers of marriage and abortion, sends him to a lucrative medical career and raises her daughter in near poverty. Flash-forward 16 years and the daughter has become a beautiful and loving young woman. Dr. Dallas is not out of the picture, he still has a tenuous but compassionate relationship with his daughter and ... I digress, and worse, making the movie sound interesting. The acting and screen writing are so exaggerated that you let out a moan in almost every scene. The main criminal is Bette Midler, but behind is John Goodman as his alcoholic partner. Each scene seems more elaborate than the previous one until the end, which is really a flash. Taken as a dramatic piece, this film is not more than a D-grade, but as a field, it gets an unwanted B +. <br /> <br />
