All this is very nice to see ... the photo shoot in Europe was a good idea. The main actors are attractive. Punctuation is useful. <br /> <br /> BUT THEN THEY SPOKE! And the no developed plot! And everything went downhill from there. Pacino is sleeping and Keller is still talking about how bored he is ... hello, dear, you are not alone. When you do an imitation of Mae West, you may have to hide your face, it is so painful to see. <br /> <br /> I can not imagine how actor or director Sydney Pollack got involved with this, or rather. he asks, why did he end up stinking so much? <br /> <br /> Since death is represented in almost every scene, one way or another, maybe you're supposed to enjoy little here. Maybe it's supposed to feel as empty and cold as death. But I still can not recommend it.
