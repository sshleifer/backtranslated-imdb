The only thing that proves "An uncomfortable truth" is that Al Gore is still an idiot. These "unchallenged" experts are not challenged because the response to their innate hypotheses is generally below real science. This is mainly fake science people. The biggest source of greenhouse gases, CO2, is the people, we exhale it, and unless you're willing to start sacrificing your brothers to save the world, there's nothing to do. We have heard how the world would end as a result of man for more than 50 years. The fools publish a timeline for their doomsday and when the time passes, nothing has happened. "An uncomfortable truth" is just another vehicle with which a faction of the American society can sell its poop. <br /> <br /> And as for When you quit the tobacco business because of your sister's death from cancer, that's a burden too. Al could not manage his farm better than the country could handle. He was losing money in the operation because he did not care about the farm when he could earn more $ on tours to talk about. The only global warming that is not challenged is the hot air produced by this gas bag!
