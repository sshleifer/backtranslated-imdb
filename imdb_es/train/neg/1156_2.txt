Looking at the tenants has been an interesting experience for me. It's the first movie I've seen where I've traveled at great speed through parts of the (non-action), and I can usually see anything from turgid action movies to Serbo-Croatian Indian films and I find them fascinating. <br /> <br /> The tenants are frustratingly slow and too orchestrated. One of the main problems of the script is that there is little realistic dialogue between the characters, apart from the pieces where the characters 'clash' in a very structured environment (to make this work, the film needed to feel more conceptual, which did not happen ). ). This leads to a lack of realistic character development; Everyone looks two-dimensional. <br /> <br /> The worst of this is the character of Bill Spear, also known as Snoop Dogg. I found his characterization very uncomfortable and very unfriendly. At one point, I even stopped the movie because I was so annoyed by the character's aggressive, violent and monotonous delivery, the lack of any other layer of personality apart from the reactionary "on" switch (which becomes really predictable after a while) and so desperately wanted him to have some redeeming qualities. However, one of the reasons for this bottle could be the nebulous aspect of the film's time (supposedly, in the 70s, it is felt and seen more often). If he had fixed more securely in the 70s, his character might have seemed more understandable. <br /> <br /> The lighting of the film was also uncomfortable. At all times, the soundtrack attempts to provide a certain harsh and infused atmosphere in the jazz that did not come off, largely because the ensemble was too well lit. <br /> <br /> The tenants, for me, are an incredible movie. It does not represent real people or propose any interesting way of thinking about the race, identity or life of a writer, be it black or white. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, I had the feeling that this project needed David Lynch; their strange, clastrophobic and obsessive look and feel would have made the actors and the script quite remarkable.
