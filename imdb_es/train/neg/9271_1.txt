To the small minority that is seen here, praising this movie IS SERIOUS. I know it all depends on the personal opinion of the people at the end of the day, but anyone with more than a couple of brain cells can surely see that this is total rubbish. So bad that it does not deserve to be part of this franchise. I can only assume that those who say how good this is are friends with someone involved in the movie and are trying to push their career. Poor in every way, do not deceive people by saying otherwise. Storyline is a weak rehash of the previous entries, the script also. Attempts to hide the lack of originality by using a girl (WOW!) Do not disguise the lack of ideas of the filmmakers, and unfortunately there is a complete lack of fear. Absolutely none of the redeeming qualities, absolute turd. I have given this pair of chancers a brand simply because I had the novelty of getting someone to finance this piece of garbage. They should have put more effort into that than into the actual realization of the movie. Shame.
