I'm not sure what Diane Silver was thinking when she was making this movie, but obviously it had nothing to do with Richard Wright's novel, on which the film is based. <br /> <br /> We read the novel this past Summer for AP English 12, and I just watched the movie. During the taking of periodic notes and the checking of the clock, I contemplated the possibilities of being struck by lightning. Of course, the sky was completely clear, and I was forced to watch the rest of the movie ... and then write a 5 paragraph essay on the subject. <br /> <br /> Wright's novel dealt with very real issues, from The Mind of a Killer and the psychology behind it. Silver's movie turned a murderer into a victim, which is NOT what Wright wanted (see: "How Bigger Was Born," 454). <br /> <br /> I'm going to make this short and sweet: if you want to Leave your conscience, in the words of Rafael Lambert, without blemish, skip the film and read the book. The 1986 adaptation is not a stimulating material. <br /> <br /> ... :: sigh :: Now I have to write the essay.
