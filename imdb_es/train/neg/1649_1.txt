Every Sunday, a trio of outbreaks meets at a New York restaurant to brag about their sexual conquests from the night before. Sometimes they are joined by a newly married comrade and a hoochie hunter who hangs them like a barnacle. It's about horny dogs / not sassy corn dogs, and Mia, who witnesses them hunting, decides they should be taught a lesson, damn it. Ergo, she will go out and throw herself away, why not? The three! <br /> <br /> panting. What a wild idea. How radical, naughty gal. Women now have the right to go out and sleep as much as they want. As much as men, even! <br /> <br /> There is an element of lonely laughter in "Whipped": the fact that not once, during the detailed discussions of the friends about their bodily functions and the tantric talents of the bedmates to whom destroy, other customers in the dining room, turn around and say: "Friend, we are trying to eat here." In fact, a hehehehe asshole has an older woman who enthusiastically evaluates the useful sexual properties of certain beverages. A great Kermit the Frog "Sheesh" to that. <br /> <br /> It is really unfortunate that a film of friends with an excellent stage, a smart and cute heroine and three possible couples should have such a difficult ending. . <br /> <br /> PS - 30 "whip-oosh" sound effects for the screenwriter for the use of the phrase "You go, girl". He was tired in 2000, and now he's tired. <br /> <br /> Save time and see some repetitions of "Sex and the City" ...
