I remember seeing this movie when I was young, but I could not remember the title of it and then, going through the horror movies, I find it and I think "is that the title?" This movie is a combination of disaster film / insect attack with fewer notable stars. It is also somewhat boring, since it has that television environment where you can see how the film fades for commercials and so on. The plot has this type of resource invaded by ants. I think they were a little disturbed by the construction or something that was happening nearby, but do not cite me in that. The most memorable ant attack for me in the whole movie was the first one that involved the child who falls in the pool after being attacked and, of course, the Summers attack scene as well. What stands out most in this is the very ridiculous end where the survivors use cardboard tubes to breathe. In the end, although like most television movies, this film is very docile and does not give much fear unless you get scared when you see the ants.
