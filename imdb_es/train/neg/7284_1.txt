Wow. I read about this movie and it sounded so horrible that I had to see it, and by God, I can smell it in San Luis. Where do I start? National Lampoons tried to track 5 years later of Animal House's success, but the brand was completely lost. I'll go chronologically with these short films. <br /> <br /> Short film # 1 <br /> <br /> Poor Peter Riegert (Boon of Animal House). Apparently, he was not working at the time, so the guys from National Lampoons probably called and said "hey, we're making a p ** ppy movie, do you want to be in it?" Peter said "well, I'm not doing much these days, why not?" He was a great supporting character in Animal House, but he could not load this pitiful short flop for 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> POSSIBLE SPOILER The premise is quite funny, with Jason Cooper (Riegert) telling his wife to leave him, she needs to find herself. It's too weird that they're actually in a happy marriage. So he drives her away, there he goes, and Cooper is in charge of the children. This, of course, leads him to burn the house, lose several of the children and sleep with a variety of bimbos from New York (including a Diane Lane, always so young). Then the wife returns, loves the children and the film ends with a coin that will decide the fate of the children. The idea was actually something intelligent, but the director stank. All the characters seem to be falling asleep, they HAD to be doped. Sorry, Boon, your legacy was tarnished with this flop. <br /> <br /> Short film # 2 <br /> <br /> MORE SPOILERS <br /> <br /> Enter Dominique Corsaire. Pretty girl, just finished college, not knowing what to do with his life. So she becomes a whore, starts sleeping with some mega rich guys, takes their money when they die, and does not stop until she sleeps with the most powerful man in the world, Fred Willard (Ooops, I mean the president of the United States). Once again, it could have been fun, and although he was happy that Corsaire (Ann Dusenberry in real life) was not afraid to put up with everything, his performance was horrible. What a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Short film # 3 <br /> <br /> I can not believe I've made it this far. Here's the rookie cop Brent Falcone (Robby Benson) with veteran Stan Nagurski (Richard Widmark). Falcone is young, naive, believes that he can really help people, although he becomes cynical after receiving several shots. Nagurski, in fact, has just stopped worrying. He watches robberies, assaults, whatever, and never intervenes. He believes that the world is lawless and will probably be sued if he does something. Even Christopher Lloyd (at the end of the taxi race) gets into the action, calls the police, commits a crime, but has his lawyer there to protect him. God bless America !! <br /> <br /> Once again, it could have been fun, the performances were intentionally countryside, but kindness, without any energy. Henry Jaglom and Bob Giraldi should feel ashamed to have their names in this mess. I think the writing was not bad, the ideas were there, but the execution was carried out as well as the rescue attempt in the Iranian hostages crisis. If I had been part of this movie, I would like to have my name removed, it's horrible. On the other hand, that's why I saw it. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this crap is that Dr. John made the movie score (repeating "Going to the Movies" over and over again) and the movie is not much more than an hour and half. Show this in film classes with the title "what you should NEVER do in making movies". This script should have been left on the shelf because yes, it's so bad.
