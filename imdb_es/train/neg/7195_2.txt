Disney has done it again. The company that made "Mr. Magoo" and "George of the Jungle" made another film that hardly resembles the caricature on which it is based, and does not keep anything of the spirit of the original. <br /> <br /> "Inspector Gadget" was one of my favorite cartoons when I was young, and for a movie to exist, it may have been a dream come true at the time. Now that that movie exists, I felt very disappointed, even outraged. <br /> <br /> First we have the characters. <br /> <br /> The same gadget has the gadgets that made it such a funny character in the original cartoon (with well-made special effects that accompany them), and even has some naivety with the original Gadget, but now it's more competent and expected to solve the crime while Penny and Brain just observe it. <br /> <br /> Penny has little to do; While playing an important role in the cartoon, discovering the crime and stopping it, and occasionally being captured by MAD agents, now it is simply presented and forgotten, although at least it sneaks into the base of Claw. <br /> <br /> Claw is the movie version of Dr. Claw, who was a pretty sinister, hoarse-voiced man, wearing metal gloves and sitting in his chair, his face hidden from view, while caressing his cat and supervising several crimes. Now he is simply a man with a claw by hand, without any mystery behind the character. <br /> <br /> Brain and Mad Cat exist in the movie, but they are quite insignificant for her. <br /> <br /> Even small parts of the caricature are not saved in this butcher shop. The famous expression "Wowsers!" it mysteriously changed to "Wowser", and Gadget's Gadgetmobile now looks different and speaks. <br /> <br /> There are even product promotions everywhere. Why is "Yahoo!" Advertised on a poster? Why does the Gadgetmobile have buttons for M & M's or Skittles? <br /> <br /> Caricature fans will hate it, it is likely that others will find the film on par, and when all is said and done, this movie is another attempt. to make some quick money from another old show.
