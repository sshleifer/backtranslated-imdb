Holy God cursed, almighty, powerful. This movie was so bad, I thought I was on drugs. In a bad way ... The character's performance is the poorest thing I've seen in a long time. This movie was more like Lord of the G-Strings, IMHO (it's a real movie). Most of the movie seemed to be made on a horrible green screen. My favorite part was when they are in the carriage, and it can be said that there is no horse. They are running away from the alien monsters, and they are going at the same speed as a fast trot. Then switch to a distant shot with a ridiculous CG horse. And the GC in general seems to be below that of Beyond the Mind's Eye of 1992. It's serious. It felt like a horrible episode of Hercules, only without Kevin Sorbo to save the day. Worst. Movie. Forever.
