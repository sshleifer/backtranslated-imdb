The husband and wife team of Bennie Fields and Blossom Seeley were big stars in vaudeville, although they made very few movies. As is the case with other artists of his time (George M. Cohan, Fanny Brice, Gertrude Lawrence), the most accessible piece of film for Fields and Seeley is the biographical film ABOUT them, in which they are represented by other actors: "Somebody Loves Me", starring Betty Hutton and that inimitable singer and dancer Ralph Meeker. <br /> <br /> At its height, Fields and Seeley were so enormously popular that another vaudeville husband and wife acted - Jesse Block and Eve Sully - achieved almost as many stars by performing an almost identical act, effectively becoming the "second team" of Fields and Seeley. However, offstage, there was a big difference in the living arrangements of the couples. Fields and Seeley lived in the hotel suites, paid room service fees for every meal they ate, and eventually ran out of money. Block and Sully lived modestly and invested their profits wisely, ending in a comfortable retirement. <br /> <br /> The first 30 seconds of this Vitaphone short are occupied by two pianists who use spats. Apparently, these two men had a slight value of their own name in 1930, although I have never heard of them. Finally, Fields and Seely hurry up and start acting. Both have a lot of energy and she is quite attractive. <br /> <br /> It bothered me that the two artists continue making movements as if they were about to get into a dance, but never did until the third. Of the three songs they make in this short film. When they finally start wandering, the results are not impressive. <br /> <br /> I loved having the opportunity to see these two main artists doing their act of acting. Now that I've seen it, I understand why they never became stars in movie musicals. My rating for this: only 4 out of 10, and I'll stick with Block and Sully.
