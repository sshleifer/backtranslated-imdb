In short, this is a simplistic and one-dimensional film. The title, The Rise to Evil, should tell you that this will not try to be something deep or do much with the character of Hitler. Rather, from the first minutes of the movie where we see the baby Hitler looking evil with malicious music playing in the background, we are given a vision of Hitler who is presented as a cartoon supervillain, apparently torn from a television program on Saturdays in the morning. The movie REALLY wants to make it clear that Hitler was bad, but does anyone need a movie to convince them that Hitler was bad? Ultimately, turning him into such an evil character in one dimension is both boring and confusing (one must wonder how the inept and fictional character of the film always persuades a nation to follow him or be named Time's man of the year. ). This film had the great opportunity to take a figure who committed some of the most horrible acts of the 20th century and try to deepen his mind. Instead, he basically just says, "Hey, Hitler was bad! I thought you'd like to know ..." over and over again. The great irony is that the film was still attacked for presenting an overly sympathetic view of the character. Give me a break.
