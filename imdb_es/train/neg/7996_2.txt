Is there a book entitled "How to make a film with every clich√© imaginable 'Man against nature' imaginable"? If not, the ants would be an excellent source of information for the chapter on killer insects. The ants do not have a pinch of originality at any time of their execution time of 100 minutes. I guess the most surprising thing about the ants is that they actually stretched the movie to 100 minutes. Do the settings, the characters, the various subplots, the scenes of death and the way the ants appear have been done many times before? And in most cases, much better. It is amazing that so many of these Insects in a Rampage movie were made in the 70s because they are basically the same movie. <br /> <br /> And can someone tell me what the hell is Myrna Loy doing? This monkey from a movie? A woman as talented and classy as Loy deserved better than Ants as one of her last films.
