I do not want to take a chance here, but ... this is the worst "movie" I've seen. Worse than the avengers. Incompetent management, unconnected writing and horrible acting are the only consistent elements in everything. Filmed in a very cheap video, it looks like a high school project, but without emotion. Lighting often looks like a single Sun-Gun. The sound is slightly better than a single microphone on the camera, but everything else about it is just horrible. The plot is directed in strange directions without foundation or subsequent resolution, the technical elements are obviously absurd, and the editing looks worse than a rough cut. It's not even bad enough to be fun. It's just bad. By the way, the packaging is intentionally deceptive. <br /> <br /> Lion's Gate owes me $ 4.00.
