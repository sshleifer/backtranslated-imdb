This was the worst movie I've seen and I've seen many bad movies. First of all, I'm from Kansas, this movie has nothing real. It's like they took the BTK name and did the rest. Besides that, it seems that someone was like I only had $ 20 here, take it and make a movie and, oh yes, do not worry about investigating anything, just invent something. Seriously, pure dookie, nobody should see this movie. Killing cows scenes and having their victims eat things and describe killing animals BTK did not do any of these things, but the film does it because God's love never sees this dreadful movie. Those made for television are much better and much more precise.
