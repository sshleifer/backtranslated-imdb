Few performances by Sinatra, Martin and Hyer. Very little developed support characters. Talky annoying without real plot. The ending leaves you more flat than a pancake, with more loose ends than you could tie in four sequels (that is, if you even care about these wooden characters). MacLaine is the only real asset. That penultimate sequence in which "Chicago Hood" seeks the character of Sinatra is ridiculous. The music in that sequence is also poor. And in the final scene, when the character of Martin takes off his hat for the woman he called "pig", he almost makes me go out and find a rock to throw through my television screen.
