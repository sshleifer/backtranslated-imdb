Someone must have been joking seriously when he made this movie. <br /> <br /> In the first place, it is absolutely impossible that this film was made in 1993. Fashions and music dictate that this is seriously the 80s. I suppose this has remained on the shelf during long before a crazed distributor picked him up and launched him into an unbelieving world. <br /> <br /> There is a plot. More or less. A solitary stranger meets a random man with a beard who tells him that if he meditates while singing his favorite song, he can become whoever he chooses. At this point, I feel compelled to point out that Lonely's favorite song is London Bridge Is Falling Down. Why is this your favorite song? Because he is an idiot. We are only one minute away from the film and the film has already reached a monumental level of stupidity. It becomes even more stupid. <br /> <br /> The solitary one is the collector of nostrils. I can only assume this since there are two scenes in the movie where he is seen sticking his nose. That clarifies the title. He decides to change a girl to be able to approach other girls. And kill them. That is more or less. <br /> <br /> The acting is universally atrocious. Each performance in this movie stinks. In fact, I would dare to say that the performance is the standard of a pornographic film. It really is that terrible. The nostril selector appears before the public as the nostril selector. The characters in the film see him as the girl he has become through singing London Bridge Is Falling Down. Man, I feel like an idiot even writing this. Anyway, it's kind of strange to see a middle-aged stranger hanging out with girls from school. And not in a good way. There is even an extensive montage of scenes where the nostril collector is at school with the girls and a song plays overhead. It is quite possibly the worst song ever recorded. I'm not even going to describe it. You will know when you hear it. And you will agree with me. <br /> <br /> There are some scenes of violence, sure. And there's a chase sequence in the style of Benny Hill that involves a transsexual. There is even a bit of immortal dialogue, which may or may not have been taken from Shakespeare or John Milton, where the nostril collector tells a prostitute, "I have the money if you have the wound." Lovely, I'm sure you'll agree. <br /> <br /> Nonsense.
