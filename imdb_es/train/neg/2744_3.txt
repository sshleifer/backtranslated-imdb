I was bored, around 10 pm, so I saw this movie. And I could not stop laughing. Everything was so ridiculous. The way the children acted as if they were over 11 years old just made me laugh. One of the children had a ring, which supposedly killed people after approximately 3 years. It gave me the impression that I wanted to be a gangster. <br /> <br /> It is quite difficult to take little children seriously, especially when it comes to eating worms. They act as if everything is so important, as if Billy (the main character) did not eat the worms, then the world will end. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie for young children (excluding the fact that a 5 year old says 'penis'), but not for teenagers or adults who do not want to waste time.
