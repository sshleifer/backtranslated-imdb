Hobgoblins ... what a concept. Rick Sloan was a teacher with this movie. He had the brilliance to produce a movie with actors who could not act. In addition to that, he chose to write a script based on a kind of bad trip with acid that went badly wrong. Together, you end up with a movie that stinks more than a warehouse full of suction cups and vacuum cleaners. This movie was very painful. The pain he caused is approximately equal to the pain caused by having his genitals carved with a spoon, and then having the whole wound covered with salt and hydrochloric acid.
