Inept, boring and incoherent supernatural "thriller" in which university student Cassie (Melissa Sagemiller) is the constant victim of hallucinations and nightmares after a car accident takes the life of her boyfriend Sean (Casey Affleck). <br /> <br /> I can not begin to tell you how bad this is ... nothing of importance never happens nor is there any real entertainment value. I did not like this cast in this particular movie, they are all sadly unconvincing (on the other hand, their roles are not good). Promoting this as a horror movie is a joke. Where are the scares? There is no sense or suspense, there are some good songs, but that is all. <br /> <br /> How the hell did this project get the green light? Writer and director Steve Carpenter does not have a discernible vision or talent that I can perceive. Worst of all, the conclusion really makes the whole movie useless. <br /> <br /> The supposed "killer cut" I saw was 86 minutes of pure tedium. <br /> <br /> 1/10
