From start to finish, this is the most emotionally disturbed movie about NADA I've seen. The characterizations and interactions between the character of the title and the character of Marthe Kller are pure torture. The hippodrome as a trick of the metaphor is so exaggerated that it borders on the clich√©, but the director Pollack treats every turn of the curve as if it were something deeply important. <br /> <br /> Perhaps there is something of value for a reproduction of MSFT3000 of some of the scenes, like Pacino that gets in touch with his inner woman, for his courage. But, even that accidental humor is hard to find in this total turkey.
