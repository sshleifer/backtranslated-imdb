The life of Jack London was certainly colorful enough for a dozen movies about different aspects of him. It is sad to say, but what his life was used for in the movies was in a propaganda during the war that put the best face on some of the less attractive parts of his character. <br /> <br /> Jack London, who barely saw the age of 40 When he died he wrote some of the best stories that exist. He wrote about what he knew, but he also wrote like everyone else who brings with him the baggage of his own life experience. Part of that experience in another day and time would have been condemned as racism. But this was World War II and London was a great believer in the "yellow danger" as it was called in his day. <br /> <br /> Two-thirds of the film covers his life as an author, we see his years. as a sailor from where he got inspiration for the sea lion. We see him in the Yukon in a miner's cabin with a dog that was undoubtedly his inspiration for The Call of the Wild. London was able to capture the spirit of adventure that his own life had to do with the world so that the world would enjoy it ever since. <br /> <br /> The last third referred to his time as a war correspondent covering the Russians. Japanese War London was a socialist, but its socialism did not include people who were Orientals. Like a few other millions, he saw the growing immigration of Chinese and Japanese to our Pacific coast as a threat to jobs for whites. He advocated strict immigration policies for the Orientals. <br /> <br /> The film puts the cart in front of the horse. London is presented as a man who saw because he was present in the Russo-Japanese war what Japan's ambitions were and for that reason he was as xenophobic as he was. Actually, the kind of atrocities present in the Second World War did not exist during the Russo-Japanese conflict. Japan had its imperial ambitions, but so did everyone else, including the USA. UU At that moment. But our immigration policies caused by pressure from our West Coast politicians were an important factor that contributed to the deterioration of relations with Japan for a couple of generations. London was part of the cause, not a prophet crying in the desert. <br /> <br /> This movie was the first independent production of Samuel Bronston, who then made some films with a little more budget than Jack London. If he had had a little more money, Bronston could have got James Cagney or Spencer Tracy, who would have been right for the role. Instead, they got Michael O'Shea, who was making his second movie after Lady of Burlesque. O'Shea is fine on paper, but it certainly was not a box office. <br /> <br /> When London is covering the war, he meets a Captain Tanaka who is played by Leonard Strong, an actor specializing in Orientals and played a lot of them in World War II. From the point of view of 1905, Strong stands out in the best tradition of Fu Manchu. The imperial objectives of Japan to the United States eventually. He must have had a great time with the swing change crowd. <br /> <br /> A lot, of course, is out of London life, including a first wife. The second and only wife in this film is Susan Hayward, who only enters the film when it is about to end. I wish we had seen more. Charmian Kittredge London survived her husband for almost 40 years of death in 1955. <br /> <br /> In fact, O'Shea met and married the protagonist of his life at Jack London. Virginia Mayo has a small role in Jack London and they were married for 30 years until O'Shea died in 1973. <br /> <br /> Maybe one day we can see Jack London who will be much better than this one.
