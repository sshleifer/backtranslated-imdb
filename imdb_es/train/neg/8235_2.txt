As fans of horror, we all know that blind rents are shit. Sometimes we find a real gem, but many times we realize that the film in which we have just spent the money that we earn with so much effort is nothing more than a rotten vapor worsened by the complimentary reviews and awards of the film festival that They are in the box. Such is the case of Five Across the Eyes (a title I'm sure is a double meaning that refers to both the budget of the film and the compulsion that anyone who sees it have to use the five fingers to stab their eyes). <br /> <br /> The story, or at least what writers * ahem * think, goes through one, focuses on a group of teenage girls who, imprudently, decide to go for a walk at night late at night, after leaving a football game and facing him. a crazy woman who plays with them the cat and the mouse as punishment for what she thinks the girls found in their car after a defense in the parking lot of a gas station. <br /> <br /> To be fair, it's an interesting idea. Some of the best horrors have very simple stories. It is in the execution of Five Across the Eyes that this idea fails. The film tries to be a cross between The Blair Witch Project with its shaky camera work and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre in its brief approach to the material, but it can not be either. What we get instead are redundant scenes of persecution, torture, liberation; chase the torture, free it, in that order for 94 minutes with long interludes of bitching, moaning and incoherent ramblings acting as a lot of stuffing between chase sequences. <br /> <br /> The appearance of the film is incredibly grainy and Dark, which, in a better made film, could have increased tension and realism. Here is simply annoying. The characters are not developed and the viewer is pressured to find something that sympathizes with them. A character stops to get a first-aid kit and fixes a few scratches on his face while the shots that are heard in the background indicate that his friends could be killed. Another girl hilariously mumbles silly lines like: "Do not go out, he'll catch you, if he catches you, he'll kill you and if he kills you, you're dead". <br /> <br /> It was an award from the magazine Fangoria and Dreadcentral.com that appears in the box that forced me to verify this. Talk about a fake orgasm! Maybe my expectations would have been fulfilled if this had been in the comedy section. I'm in favor of low-budget indie horror, but this one gets the crap-cake. Give a pass to Five Across the Eyes (or FATE; get it?). <br /> <br /> RazorFriendly gives FATE 1 bar of five /
