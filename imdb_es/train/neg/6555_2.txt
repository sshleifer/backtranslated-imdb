So the other night I decided to see Hollywood Hills Tales: Natica Jackson. O Power, Passion, Murder as it is called in Holland. When I bought the film, I noticed that Michelle Pfeiffer was starring it and I thought I had to say something about the quality. Unfortunately, it was not like that. <br /> <br /> 1) The plot of the movie is really confusing. There are two story lines that run simultaneously during the movie. Only they have nothing in common. Throughout the entire film, I was waiting for the moment when these two story lines came together to make the plot clear to me. But he does not have it yet. <br /> <br /> 2) The title of the movie says that the movie will be about Natica Jackson. Well, it is, sometimes. Like I said, the movie covers two different stories and the part about Natica Jackson is the shortest. Then, another title for this movie would not be a wrong choice. <br /> <br /> To conclude my story, I really recommend that you leave this movie where it belongs, on the shelf of the store in a place that no one can see. that. By doing this, you will not lose 90 minutes of your life, as I did.
