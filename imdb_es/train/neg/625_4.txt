With all the excessive violence in this movie, it could have been NC-17. But the gore could have been pg-13 and there were many oaths when the mother had Jackass's original boyfriend. There was a great development of characters that made the film better to see, then, after the child came back to life as the scarecrow, there was an hour without a mind and ten minutes of it killing people. The violence was excessively excessive and I think the number of bodies was higher than twelve, which is a large number for films like this one. Almost all the characters in the film are stabbed or cut their heads, but the teacher called him "white trash" and "prick" (although the character of Lester is anything but a child, not even close, I know hoods and I am part Hood, they do not draw in class, they sit there and they throw things to the teacher). The professor deserved a more frightful death than any of the characters, but he was stabbed in the back. There were two scenes of suspense in the film, but they did not last long enough to be scary. As I said, the murders were excessive and, sometimes, people who have nothing to do with the plot cut their heads off. If the gore was really fun to watch, then it would have been nc-17. Two children describe a body found in corn fields, describe it as much fatter than it really was, explained to the police that there were worms crawling through the intestines of men. His stomach had not even been cut, so there was no worms in his stomach, although I would have liked to see that. The acting was pathetic, the characters were losers and the scarecrow could do many gymnastics stunts. I suggest renting this movie for scenes of death, I will not see it again soon, but I enjoyed the excessive violence. Also, do not worry about the sequel, I watched it for five minutes and I got bored to death, it sounds good, but it's not. The original scarecrow really kept me interested.
