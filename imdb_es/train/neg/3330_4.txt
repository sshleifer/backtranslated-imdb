This movie has an o.k. Result and a not bad performance of David Muir as Dr. Hackenstein. The initial and final credits show, along with most of the actors and the "special effects", that this is a low budget movie. There is nothing in this movie that you can not find in another mad scientist, in horror comedy or in low budget movies. Nor is it special for lovers of the nude scene or the bad lovers of the film. This movie is simply here. Anne Ramsey and Phillis Diller also have nothing to get excited about. If you are curious as it was and I can really find this, you will realize the truth of the summary of a line.
