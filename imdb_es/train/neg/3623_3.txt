(aka: BLOOD CASTLE or SCREAM OF THE DEMON) <br /> <br /> * spoiler * <br /> <br /> This was an entry function, billed along with THE VELVET VAMPIRE. A Spanish-Italian co-production where a series of women in a village are killed almost at the same time as a local earl named Yanos Dalmar on horseback, riding with his dog "man-eater" behind him. <br /> <br /> The people of the town already suspect that he is the one behind all this and wants his castle to burn. The murders began around the time when Count Yanos's older brother, Count Igor Dalmar, was horribly burned and died in a laboratory accident. <br /> <br /> Then a woman Ivanna (Erna Schuer) that Igor hired before his death to help He appears in his experiments. Yanos agrees to hire her instead of her brother and together they look for formulas for the regeneration of dead cells. Yanos wants to bring back to life the charred body of Igor. <br /> <br /> But, of course, Igor is still alive (although he is horribly burned) and harasses and kills women in the village. We see his grilled face at various points in the film, so we know he is still alive, which makes everything seem too obvious. <br /> <br /> Igor meets another fiery extreme when he enters the scene. a fight with Yanos for Ivanna, with the candles burning falling on the same bed in which Igor stumbles, finding another end grilled. <br /> <br /> The Retromedia DVD is taken from a VHS source and looks pretty grainy and bad. Apart from an even rougher trailer, other extras are not included. Although it has a nice and spooky Spanish castle and good atmospheres, I found it quite boring and predictable, without emotion or mystery, at all. <br /> <br /> 3 of 10.
