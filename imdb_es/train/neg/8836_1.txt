This is not art, it is internal-urban propaganda, politically correct! Jindabyne's political intolerance is unforgivable ... he does not see people as individuals, but rather as members of categories. <br /> <br /> This is the most paternally offensive Australian movie I can ever remember (and even against a pretty tough competition!). A film message, every tired theme beloved of the fashionable left is there: the aborigines are victims; White men are violent or alcoholic; White women are not that bad, especially if they are lesbians, but they are probably depressive in nature. <br /> <br /> Four men who go fishing to fish, find the body of a murdered woman (Aboriginal, of course) and leave her in the river for several days while catching trout. It is a strange decision that is taken almost without discussion, as if men were animals. The only man who rejects briefly is the good ... we know because he lives with a bisexual woman, he likes to hold his baby, and eventually he moves to a more fashionable coastal place (away from all these beasts that live in the bushes). <br /> <br /> This is a movie made by those fashionable urbanites who live in fear of the Australian landscape and the evil peasants who reside inside. Ignorance of life in the countryside is almost as shocking as their contempt. The film is filmed with a long distance view of the bush backed by a premonition, mysterious music. In the end it is very clear that the aborigines are the only ones that live in this landscape. It concludes with an incredibly implausible scene of reconciliation between black and white. <br /> <br /> In Jindabyne, life in the countryside is reduced to little more than a backdrop for a story that, by implication, proclaims the superiority of the values ​​of enlightened citizenship on the left. inhabitants over those of other Australians. <br /> <br /> This movie was not made by people with real jobs, but financed by the Government Film Funding Corporation. It is a product of the artistic whole, that soulless emptiness populated by the beautiful people for whom the government's generous funding supports these paternally offensive projects (which are the furthest thing from real life), instead of making popular movies that people want watch. It does not matter if the movie sucks, they still get paid. <br /> <br /> Save yourself from wasting time, avoid it like a plague. More comments jaded than real entertainment, this movie deserves to be seen!
