I will participate in the album as the second person who, after years of using the IMDb to search for movies, has been motivated by Nacho's movie, The Abandoned, to create an account and post a comment. This was without a doubt the worst movie I've seen in my entire life. The plot was on the verge of non-existence, and none of the "puzzle pieces" was added in any way. The performance was laughable and the writing was shameful. How this film supported and became is completely beyond me. The only saving grace I could find was the repetitive and cunning use of Anastasia Hille from the word f. (and a brilliant sound design) If I were faced with the option of seeing this film again or being attacked by bored savages, I would face a difficult decision. I am disappointed that I can not give you 0 stars.
