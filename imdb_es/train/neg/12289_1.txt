I'm getting tired of the movies that sound entertaining in a synopsis of a line and then end up being the same as what you would find in the middle of the bottom of a pile of compost. <br /> <br /> Who knows: "Witchery" may have sounded interesting in a tone for the studios, even with a "cast of big names" (like Blair and Hasselhoff - wink-wink, nudge-nudge) and the effervescent tastes of Hildegard Knef (I do not know, some woman ...). <br /> <br /> But in the movie, it just falls apart faster than a papier-mâché sculpture in a storm. It seems that these unfortunate people are trapped in a mansion on an island near the east coast, and one of them (a woman, I suppose) is being attacked by a satanic cult to give birth to the child from hell while the others are exposed in grotesque and tortuous turtles. shapes. <br /> <br /> Well, right there you have a cross section of the plot lines of "The Exorcist", "The Omen", "Ten Little Indians" and some other minor movies in satanic -orshipers-run- amok line None of that is very entertaining and, for the most part, it will make its way from scene to scene until it ends. <br /> <br /> No, neither Linda Blair nor David Hasselhoff help much. They are only there to collect a paycheck and they do not seem very determined to give their "everything". <br /> <br /> From what it seems, Hasselhoff would probably wish to be back on the field with Pam Anderson (and who can blame him?) and Linda ... well, who knows; a PETA benefit of celebrities or a professional golf tour or whatever it is today. <br /> <br /> And the torture scenes! Ecchhhh You will see people sew their mouths, hang them inside roaring chimneys, hang them from trees during a violent storm, ships exploding from their necks, etc., etc. Sheesh, and I thought "Mark of the Devil" was the most sadistic movie I had seen ... <br /> <br /> Do not bother. It's not worth your time. I can not believe he told you as much as I did. If you see it, just look if you can tell the clichés. And yes, Blair is possessed, as if you had not seen ESO coming down Main Street followed by a band. <br /> <br /> There are no stars. "Witchcraft" - these witches will make you itchy.
