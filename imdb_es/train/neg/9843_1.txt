It's just Robert De Niro's movie that I really hate. It's a stupid movie with a horrible performance (of course not De Niro). For me, Brian De Palma must make his mafia films as always, like Scarface (1983) or The Untouchables (1987). I also loved the De Palma Mission: Impossible (1996). De Niro worked with Palma twice as well, Greetings and The Wedding Party. I thought the wedding was good too (I did not see the greetings). <br /> <br /> The script is really bad and without grace. There is no scene in which I can smile even once. The film lost the opportunity to be a fun style even a little in the "Be Black baby" scene and I also do not like the scene in which a boy's sex organ appeared. So, it's one of the worst movies I've seen! simply the worst I hate that.
