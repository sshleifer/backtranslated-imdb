As a former resident of Kalamazoo with a fondness for the city, I was eager to see this movie. But, what a disappointment! Although the performance and the values ​​of production are not bad, the script is horrible, the plot is not realistic and the subject is disturbing. <br /> <br /> The main message of this film is that women are nothing without husbands and children. I can hardly believe how regressive it is in his vision of women. Has the writer been living under a rock? <br /> <br /> Although I enjoyed watching my beloved city on the big screen, I would not recommend this movie to anyone. It's terrible. It is a shame for the city that bears his name.
