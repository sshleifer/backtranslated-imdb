This movie could have been an interesting study of characters and could have given an idea of ​​the subject, but the real problem with this movie is that it has none of this. It does not give any idea, or solutions to the problem. It is only the portrait of the "old" male addicted person and the problems that this is creating for his daily and family life. Why would you want to see this? It is totally useless and meaningless. <br /> <br /> It also does not help that the main character is a wrinkled man of more than 50 years. It will be difficult to identify and sympathize with him. It just seems like a dirty old playboy, which is a constant search for women and sex. It has all kinds of sexual relations approximately 3 times a day with different women and not only with prostitutes. <br /> <br /> It also does not have a bad visual style, although everything feels a bit forced. But, nevertheless, everything looks better than most other direct video productions. Who knows, if the filmmakers had been given better material to work with, the film would deserve better faith. <br /> <br /> The story is really ridiculed sometimes. There really are some nonsense arguments that are often more ridiculous than they were obviously supposed to be. I'm talking, for example, about the whole Ordell plot. Things get worse once the movie starts to move towards the end. It also tells the whole story, trimming between the events that happened and the sessions of the main character with his psychiatrist feels a bit cheap and simple. <br /> <br /> But when it comes to bad movies, this is not one of them. It really is not better or worse than any other random live video movie, with similar concepts. <br /> <br /> It still seems strange and quite surprising that they have managed to elect Nastassja Kinski and Ed Begley Jr. in that way. A simple small insignificant production like this. I guess they were really desperate for work and money. <br /> <br /> 4/10
