Karl Jr and his dad are now running an army on a remote island. They capture a trio of guys who run into the island. Who after a while defends himself. (well, the survivors) This one has blood, blood and carnage non-stop, which would have been good if any of them looked remotely real, or if the production does not seem like it was done with a week of lunch saved money (it might be exaggerating too much there, probably worth only a couple of days). The horrendous dubbing did not bother me that much and I suspect that if I had been really drunk, something might have been a bit humorous ... maybe. But as it is, in just 78 minutes the movie still felt too long for ... Oh, I do not know ... 78 minutes. Do not waste your time. <br /> <br /> My grade: F <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Extra movie: "Zombie '90: Extreme Pestilence"; and Trailers for other films released by Shock-o-Rama
