one can ask why? the characters growl, shout and chew the stage without any discernible reason, except that someone wanted to make a film in Barcelona. Billie Baldwin, is it the right one?, Can you forget in the role of police / separated husband / cute-little-blond-girl-baby-father. The story seems to have been cut and pasted from the scenes thrown out of the adventure films in the last three years. Ellen Pompeo's lack of charisma is a black hole that seems to absorb the energy of each scene in which it finds itself. his true range of performance is shown when he removes his blouse while the cinema moves from one chase scene to another. unfortunately, the address is rarely bad enough to be a camp or a parody. everything is clich√©, familiar in all aspects. the director chose his own daughter as the precocious brat, probably because no respectable agent would have allowed a client to ruin a career by being in such an unconvincing, artificial, and uninteresting movie. The only theft here is the theft of the investor's money and the viewer's time.
