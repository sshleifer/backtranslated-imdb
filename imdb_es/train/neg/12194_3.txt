The film begins with a voice-over that tells the audience where they are and who the characters are. And that's the moment when I started to dislike the movie. With all the infinite possibilities that any film director has in hand, I really find that it is a very easy and inexpensive solution to express the situation with a voice-over that tells it all. In fact, I think the voiceovers are a betrayal of the shooting concept. <br /> <br /> I do not like a voiceover to tell us where we are, what date we are on, and especially what the characters feel and think. I think a director has to find a visual way to convey the feelings and thoughts of the characters to the audience. <br /> <br /> But after the introduction of bad influence, a very surprising movie starts and continues for a long enough time. The lives of a middle-class family and all members individually are represented in a perfectly realistic manner. I think the director has talent to capture real-life situations. For example, a parent who has to make his private calls from the bathroom may seem abnormal at first, but life itself leads to some situations that may seem abnormal but also very normal. I think the director is a very good observer of real life. <br /> <br /> But that's it. After a while, the realism in the film begins to sacrifice the narrative. I really felt like I had a big headache because of the characters that talk non-stop. It was as if the actors and actresses were given the subject and allowed to improvise the dialogues. It's real actually, but the characters always ask "it's really like that", etc., or the characters that say "no" or "you hear me", ten times when saying it only once is enough for me to have a headache. <br /> <br /> I also believe that the practice of play and the scenes of reading books are more than they should be. I understand that the work and the book in the film are closely related to the plot, but I think the director has not seen the point at which he should stop showing these scenes.
