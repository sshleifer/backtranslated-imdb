I'm sure that in the depths of Jack Blacks, the character of Nacho Libre is absolutely hilarious, but it's not. You can tell Jacks that they had a great time at the time of playing a Mexican friar who dreams of being a fighter, but this movie is a total failure in almost every department. <br /> <br /> I I just sat there for most of the movie thinking "Is this supposed to be fun?" and "This is the Tenacious D type, right?" The truth is that this movie has nothing to offer. ABSOLUTELY! It's a lousy script with crappy characters and really bad interpretation and direction. You will see countless moments in which you think something fun is about to happen, but it just does not happen. I was bored stupid for about 10 minutes, but even though I would surely recover. He did not do it 90 minutes later, I barely managed to avoid an aneurysm, it was so painful. <br /> <br /> It's like, remember, years ago, when you saw something with your favorite actor, even some of them really The first roles before they were famous, and you would really be ashamed that the actor was really in a so big load. If so. <br /> <br /> I've enjoyed some of Jack Black's previous films, like Shallow Hall, and I'm really looking forward to seeing Pick of Destiny but come on, man. If you do this to us again, Jack, I'll have to go around and hit your knees or something. At a minimum, I'll be serious. <br /> <br /> I know it's a clich√©, but this is one of the worst movies I've seen and for many reasons ...
