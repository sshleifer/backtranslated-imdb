Well, then, someone, somewhere, a few years ago, thought it would be a good idea to make an IMAX movie in 3D about some flies that hide in Apollo 11 and go to the moon. They did it. Somebody, somewhere, was an idiot. <br /> <br /> I want to give the accessory artists to do their homework on the hardware. As far as I can tell, the rockets and launch hardware were hit. The graphics in general were pretty good: the launch of the rocket gave me chills, as always makes a good launch of the rocket (the blood of my head of transmission of the flying car Popular Mechanics still runs strong) and the 3D was quite effective. The CG was not Pixar quality, but overall it was good. The flies were anthropomorphic a little mediocre, with some characters in the middle of the sixties to color (hippie flies, African American flies with giant Afros and black shadows, etc.) and the worms were more like larvae with human heads. although they made adequate silencing noises). <br /> <br /> The writers certainly did not do their homework, based on offensive and obsolete clich√©s (gender politics of the 60s, including mostly useless female characters, racial stereotypes, evil Russians, fat fly that only wants eat, rude humor and high level). In a film directed to IMAX, they missed the wonderful opportunity to sneak into some educational content about physics and space travel: they did not achieve correct physics (zero-g in the Lunar Module during the landing burn? PLEASE.) They could not ' do not even bother reading the original radio transcripts between Houston and the astronauts, all of which is in the public domain; instead, they wrote their own dialogue, which looks like crap. <br /> <br /> But we liked the worms. <br /> <br /> So they got a point and a half for rockets and worms. Uh, yay. 1.5 / 5
