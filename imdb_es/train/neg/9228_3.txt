CQ is incredibly slow, and I'm a fan of David Mamet. The film follows a young filmmaker who is making a film very much like Barbarella. After that the movie started to lose me. Deep and deep? Not really. The movie "Dragonfly" made in CQ has the problem of having no end. This is quite parallel to the CQ, which also lacks an ending (in my opinion). <br /> <br /> I was lucky enough to see this movie at the SxSW film festival. I had quite high expectations after having seen Y Tu Mama Tambien and several other great movies. I was also waiting for the performance of Jason Schwartzman. But it was not an easy movie to get. If you do not like sci-fi movies or slow ones from the 60 that do not go anywhere, skip them. <br /> <br /> CQ feels like a student movie. If you want a recent independent science fiction movie rental Donnie Darko, it will not make you sleep.
