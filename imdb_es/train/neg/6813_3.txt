Jean Rollin artistic nonsense about vampires, aliens and the search for immortality. <br /> <br /> Women are beautiful and photography awesome. The dialogue is inane. It is a ridiculous disaster. Excellent to watch, but like any resemblance to a horror movie or a thriller, just horrible. I'm trying to find out if we should be scared or not. At the same time is it a position or not? It's a strange mixture of art, film and horror that never mixes and, although it's nice to look at it, it seems it never "means" anything, and it's not scary, even if the occasional shot or sequence creates a frisson moment. It's well done. presumed pretentious. Something to leave in the background as a live wallpaper for those who like naked women.
