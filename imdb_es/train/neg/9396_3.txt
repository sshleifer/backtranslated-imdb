Radar Men from the Moon is a fairly typical rate of the 1950 series. The special effects are quite cheap, the lunar vehicles are obviously surplus jeeps from World War II with plywood painted on them, and the like. The acting is regular. It does inspire the imagination of the children, to whom I believe this was directed. By today's standards, it's boring, cheap and bad. There is also a large amount of archival material in the first 9 episodes of natural disasters.
