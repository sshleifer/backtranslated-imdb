Some people seem to think that this was the worst movie they've seen, and I understand where they come from, but I've really seen worse. <br /> <br /> That said, the movies I can remember (that is, the ones I have not blocked) that were worse than this, were so bad that they physically hurt all the senses related to watching the movie. Movies that are worse than War Games 2 are the ones that make you want to tear out your eyes, or to stab sharp objects in your ears to prevent another part of your soul from tearing you apart for mercy. <Br /> <br /> War Games: The Dead Code is not so bad, but it's pretty close. Yes, I was a fan of the original, but I did not expect miracles from this one. Let's face it, the original was not really that good of a movie in the first place, it was basically an 80's teenage romance movie with some geeky appeal. <br /> <br /> That's all I expected For, something bad, but that could have pulled my geek cords. Was it too much to ask? Is it really not possible to do better than the original war games, even for a direct launch to the video? Well, apparently that was a lot to ask. Stay away from this movie. At first it's just bad, like "Oh, yes, this is bad, but I'm enjoying it, maybe the end is good as in the original". And then it gets worse and worse, and in the end, trust me, you wish you had not seen this movie.
