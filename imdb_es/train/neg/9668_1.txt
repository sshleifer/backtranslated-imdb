1940. - A visit to the Lodz ghetto in Nazi-occupied Poland, recorded by a German cameraman with the ingenuous cooperation of the Jewish community, is combined with archival material, international news clips and extracts from related cultural films to portray . The Jews of the world as swindlers and parasites. This "documentary" interprets Jewish life from the point of view of traditional anti-Semitism and Nazi ideology. A frank and cinematographically unique expression of racial hatred. Personally I find this film terrifying and highly offensive. You can only hope that images like this never reach the screen again.
