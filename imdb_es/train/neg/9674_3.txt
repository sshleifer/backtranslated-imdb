This movie reminds me of some really bad sci-fi movies from the 50s and 60s. It's not scary or interesting, but it's boring, cheesy and stupid. The special effects are ridiculous, all the actors are ridiculous and the ending is just horrible. Do not do it. waste your money, rent or buy something better. I give it 3.5 out of 10 (this turkey I found quite fun due to its stupidity).
