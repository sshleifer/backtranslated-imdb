wow this is the worst movie of all. The only reason I signed up for IMDb was to be able to complain about this movie. I never left a movie theater or stopped a DVD, but I almost stopped it (and I should have). but I saw it until the end only to disappoint myself with an absolutely terrible ending. Wow if this is all that Wes Craven can produce his time is long. I've never seen the first one and I'll never see it later. It is terrible to act with a terrible plot. Hey, look, someone is looking at us with a mirror. Let's take a look. and the sad part is that when this movie came to DVD, it was completely verified in blockbuster forever. so I feel bad for all the people who saw this garbage.
