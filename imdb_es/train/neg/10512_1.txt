I rented this movie for a reason, Tom Savini, I respect his work, but it was a real disappointment, I had horrible clich√©s, half of the movie were naked women called "fallen angels" running trying to act scared, oh and then there was movement Black and white casual "Blair Witch" that affected the scenes of the camera. Tom's character was really horrible, horrible script. And you have to love these lines that they use. "Is there anyone there? Who is there? This is not funny." No, but your performance was. I wish I could give this movie a 0! Oh the names of the characters. Judd, Molly, Ally, Emilio, but they left Anthony out, The Breakfast Club gathered in the forest of the unforgivable performance.
