What the hell was all that? I saw Matrix and was amazed. It was the most spectacular movie ever made. What the Wachowski brothers once owned to make this film surpasses me. <br /> <br /> There is no argument, you can not argue with that. Basically, this whole movie was a burden to talk about, and do not get me wrong, I do not have any problems with Talky's films, but everything that was talked about in The Matrix Reloaded was a useless load of the transmission. Then there would be a sequence of struggle that lasted too long, then a more useless march, then another fight scene that lasts too long and everything accumulates to the greatest anti-climax of all time. A little bearded guy talks to an incomprehensible bull for 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> In addition, Keanu Reeves gives his worst performance so far. I knew he was not a good actor, but this was more than a joke. If you look at his films in the order in which he was in them, it seems that he gradually got worse as they went along. God knows what his performance is like in Something's Gotta Give! Keanu Reeves: the only wooden board that has become an actor. <br /> <br /> After the splendor of the first film, this was a massive disappointment. If you have not seen the first movie yet, I suggest you see it, but do not waste your time with this bunch of turd. <br /> <br />
