I saw that the comment on the capsule read "great performance". In my opinion, these are two great actors who offer horrible performances, and without chemistry between them, for a great director in his worst effort of all time. Robert De Niro has to be the most ingenious and insightful illiterate of all time. The performance of Jane Fonda moves uncomfortably throughout the map as she clearly has no control over this character, mainly because the character is very poorly written. Molasses would be an adjective too fast for the unbearable rhythm of this movie. Although the intention of the film is to be an encouraging story of curing illiteracy, seeing it is a real "nuisance". I give it 1 out of 10, really one of the worst 20 movies for its budget level that I've seen.
