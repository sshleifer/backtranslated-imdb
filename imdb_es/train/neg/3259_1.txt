Fantastically putrid. I do not want to imply previously that only a few people should avoid the "Doc Savage". Almost all demographic groups will be bored with this trivial production, with the quality of a television movie. It's a bit like the "Batman" television series of the '60s, except it's not funny. Even accidentally. You are better taking a nap.
