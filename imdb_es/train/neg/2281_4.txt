Think "play" It's worth watching once for the performances of Lionel Atwill and Dwight Frye. Share it with Melvyn DOuglas in "Ghost Story" with Melvyn DOuglas from this movie. Are there loose vampires in this 'Bavarian' village, or is there a more natural, albeit equally sinister, explanation? Dwight Frye is Herman, a red herring, who appears as an especially moronic character. It is fun to see his different facial expressions in what is really an original character. Not much happens for a long time, but then we discover that the real smoking pipe Atwill is the real killer. There is too much 'comic relief' but that is part of the course for this era. Fay Wray looks very good.
