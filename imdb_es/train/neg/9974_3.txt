I must admit that I have trapped him several times in the US network. UU There is something in the stupidity of this movie that makes me want to see it when it is on. Yes, you are right about subpar acting, the plot that only a seven-year-old child would like, etc. But I can not help but feel sympathy towards some of the actors. On the other hand, some of these actors were enrolled in the even more atrocious sequel.
