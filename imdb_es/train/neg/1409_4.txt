They are not really spoilers in my opinion, but I wanted to cover myself, however. As an executive producer, Morgan Freeman wants the audience to ignore the numerous absurdities of his character in 10 Items Or Less, a movie with an intentional indie feeling, and that is absorbed by the mentor / being as much as he can-he is afraid. Play in an alternate universe, semi-washed version of the real Morgan Freeman, which has a driver in an old Econovan of a child up to Carson, California, from Brentwood, to investigate his next role in the film. Why Carson, is a mystery to So. Residents of lime I could have saved the trip and gone to any part of the San Fernando Valley and found the same elements. It is nice to see Paz Vega, a cross between Salma Hayek and Penelope Cruz, who plays a disgruntled grocery store in a large but slow local market that is apparently the best source for Moragn Freeman's research. His character is only known as "He" to allude to how the actors are seen when they meet in real life with average people. "Psst, that's 'he', etc. Unfortunately, I was too distracted that He had all kinds of worldly wisdom and advice, but he did not have a reliable return to his home in Brentwood, he had no cash or debit card, or he had the wisdom of having a cell phone with him, if you have such a high opinion of yourself that you think you have an answer to everything as He does, then I have to see cash and a Blackberry that shows intelligence and good survival instincts In fact, nothing happens in this film, I do not think any of the main characters were substantially changed by the encounter between them, he flirts with the idea of ​​adultery, but then that thought vanishes This for me was similar to Steve Martin's Shopgirl, without intercourse, he was self-indulgent to Freeman and unconvincing to the public.
