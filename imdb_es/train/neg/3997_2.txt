After seeing the high rating in IMDb, I decided to go see this movie. Beyond that high rating, I intentionally avoided reading any of the criticisms. I wanted to enter the theater with a clean slate, without knowing the plot or having predetermined expectations. <br /> <br /> Given my rating, you can see that I was disappointed. I enjoyed the development of the main character Mike Enslin. I also enjoyed how the hotel manager tried to convince him not to enter the hotel room. By the time Enslin entered the room, I was ready for some scary things. <br /> <br /> First the chocolates appear on the pillow and the toilet paper is folded. Enslin reacts in a credible way. He has been scared. I'm encouraged and I think, this is going to be good. The people who made this film understand that less is more. <br /> <br /> But what happened next was a big disappointment. The subtlety is quickly replaced by the predictable focus of the shotgun ... It simply destroys the audience with every scary Hollywood trick in the book and expects something to work. Let's see, a clock radio that turns on by itself? Well, that's always scary. Objects that move around the room? Well, you can not complain about that. Blood dripping from the walls and sinking? Cool. Ghosts who commit suicide? Good. Anything else? What about loud noises, tremors, fire, more tremors, disorder in the room, more blood, etc.? Everything is fine. And everything has been done before. Overstimulate our public with attention deficit Disorder with all kinds of things in rapid succession, and they will not be able to look the other way. <br /> <br /> Well, it did not work for me. And you know what else? When I go to see a horror movie in a theater, it is typical to hear several groups of girls in the audience screaming in fear in times of fear. But this movie did not have any moment of fear. The audience was silent and disinterested. I did not feel any chills down my back. Nothing. The Shining was 100 times what this movie tries to be. <br /> <br /> So, who are all these people who say it's one of the best horror movies in history? Friends of the director? I'm sorry, I just do not understand it.
