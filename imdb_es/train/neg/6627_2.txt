What is happening to RGV? It seems to be repeated in all the movies. Have you run out of creative ideas? If you have done it, it's time to take a back seat. I went to see the movie with great anticipation; Of course, not once did I imagine that it would be close to the original. I knew I would not do it, the promotions said it all. But even then I thought it would be a great treatment for RGV, after all, is not it the same guy who directed Sathya and Company? Or is it? I have my doubts after seeing Aag. I will not talk about the plot or the story, since most of it is taken from the original. If you really want to go see this one, you could play a fun game with friends: identify the original scenes. one and give own ratings! So Veeru becomes Heero (how corny is that?), I guess Heeru would not sound so good. Ajay Devgan is a mess because Heero, the comedy is tense and the confusing talk that really was effective in the company sounds false. The chemistry between Heero and Gunghroo (Nisha Kothari) does not exist at all. In fact, the more charming Nisha is, the more irritating she becomes. This reaches a peak at the end. In fact, Raj is not bad compared to others, he is a boy to follow in the future. I was really disappointed with Amitabh Bachchan as Babban, it looks like a caricature of Gabbar Singh. There is a scene in which he is drinking something from a bowl covered with a shawl, instead of inspiring fear, he looks like a beggar with his bowl. The only performance that really stood out was Mohan Lal as Inspector Narasimha. I'm afraid I do not have the patience to write more.
