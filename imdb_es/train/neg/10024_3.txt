First lesson that some filmmakers (especially those inspired by Hollywood) should know: only the "style" is not sold. I guess Tashan when translated will mean style. Second, if you are determined to sell style, that does not prevent you from having a decent story. <br /> <br /> Tashan has a story that could have been enough with a better director. But it is not slippery. For example, the three, Saif, Kareena and Akshay, are storytellers at different points in the story. But this configuration is not used correctly. There could have been a better combination of his narrations. The sequences of actions are from the seventies. <br /> <br /> The cheoreography of the movie is horrible. I think Vaibhavi Merchant just slept while walking through this movie. Vishal-Shekhar has achieved a good score, but does not belong to this movie. Why is there a Sufi song (Dil Haara) in Tashan? Why is the cool Hinglish song (Dil Dance Maare) not in Anil Kapoor when he is the English madman? <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar is the salvation of the movie. But he is in his stereotyped being. You will not mind missing this movie.
