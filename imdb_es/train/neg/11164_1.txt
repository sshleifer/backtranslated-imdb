What a disappointment! <br /> <br /> This movie seemed to be trying to copy a "cutting edge" comedy but the direction and script were sloppy, sickly and sentimental in the worst cinematic tradition. The performance / role of Jack Black was self-indulgent and selfish ... and the other characters were also unmasked and uninteresting. The soundtrack was tedious. We are (WERE) fans of Black, but none of us did more than manage a time-forced titter. Why did you feel that you needed to make this mistake? <br /> <br /> We will not see another of your movies without reading the reviews with more care first! <br /> <br /> Was he drunk when he read the script before enrolling in this drivel?
