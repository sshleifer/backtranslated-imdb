This movie was absolutely horrible. I can not think of a good thing about it. The holes in the plot were so big that you could drive a Hummer through them. The performance was so surprisingly bad that even Jean Claude should be ashamed, and that's saying a lot !!! And the dialogue, what dialogue? To think that I was a fan of the first one (I use that comment lightly, it's more like a guilty pleasure, than anything else). This movie had Goldberg in it for screaming out loud! Nothing good can come from this movie. What makes this movie even worse is that it is so bad that you can not even see it with a group of friends to make fun of it. This has to be in my five worst movies of all time. 2/10 because it is very difficult for me to give a 1.
