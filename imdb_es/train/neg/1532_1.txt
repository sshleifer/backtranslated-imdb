Although correctly warned, I actually sat down to watch this movie. Partly because I usually give each movie a break, and because I thought that a single movie could not be that bad. I'm corrected. Not even George Kennedy, Barry Bostwick or Ben Stein could prevent this turkey from sinking like a ton of bricks. Only once, during this humor, the abandoned parody of a parody, did I laugh. That is, during the scene Simon says. The other jokes are wrong or just are not fun. And some of them really come a mile away. This movie does not have what it takes to be a good parody like Airplane! (I + II), Naked Gun (I + II + III), or Scary Movie. All had A. funny jokes, B. good dialogue and most important of all C. unforgettable appointments. Men In White has D. none of the above. Calling this movie bad would be a gross underestimation. Avoid this movie in any way you can! CONSIDER YOURSELF NOTICE!
