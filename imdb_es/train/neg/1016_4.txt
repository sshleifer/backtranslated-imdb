The movie itself is not that bad; Many comments have pointed out the obvious flaws of the script, but it is observable. However, what really scares me is that people like Justin Timberlake are even chosen for movies, and besides that for films like this one. I must admit that I had never heard the name of the man before seeing this, but in the same moment he appeared, I simply bothered. The voice is shit, the face is a bad Legolas scam, the posture is horrible, and it can not even coordinate the three properly. That said, I loved that he jumped out after leaving the club, because he hoped that from that moment on would only be Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey. Too bad I was wrong. These two and also LL Cool J give a very decent performance, and are the main reason why I give it a 4. <br /> <br /> I see many upcoming films with the little cast of Timberlake ... and I can not believe it
