Florence Lawrence and Dorothy West, Dad's girls, receive great news at the local post office, not knowing they are being harassed by thief Charles Inslee. Meanwhile, Father David Miles receives a message (from young Robert Harron) that demands that Dad leave home; Then, when the young girls come back, can they be? home alone. As the vulnerable couple goes to bed at night, the local "Gran Bola del Negro y Bronceado" is set in motion; and, a dark-skinned drinker presages an additional danger to D.W. Dynamic duo of Griffith? <br /> <br /> Mr. Inslee has one of his best roles in Biograph, stealing the "The Girls and Daddy" movie. Ironically, director Griffith appears as one of the black-faced extras at the "Black and Tans" dance. "Biograph Girls" Lawrence and West later suggest "Griffith Girls" Lillian and Dorothy Gish, especially in "Orphans of the Storm" (1921); and, they are excessively affectionate in bed! The racist tone is unfortunate, since the story of a redeemed thief saving his potential victims from a greater danger is intriguing. <br /> <br /> *** The Girls and Daddy (2/1/09) D.W. Griffith ~ Florence Lawrence, Dorothy West, Charles Inslee
