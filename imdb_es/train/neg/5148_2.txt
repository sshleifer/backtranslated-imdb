There are a lot of errors with this image, starting with a script that is obvious and redundant. Courtney Cox plays a comic book artist who escapes to a small desert town after being raped twice in the big city. Immediately she is harassed by a local that seems quite deranged (Craig Sheffer), and that seems to be trying an imitation of Mickey Rourke of third category. D.B. Sweeny is a local policeman, who is supposedly there to protect and serve. Meanwhile, the script manipulates the audience as to who is really good. Logic flies through the window after the first ten minutes and never returns, and there are more unanswered questions than there should be. If you think that "Blue Desert" could be saved by the wonderful Philip Baker Hall, you will be disappointed. His part is insignificant, like the whole movie. - MERK
