Seeing Marlen Brando on the screen is like watching a master carpenter chisel intricate details into a piece of mahogany. Brando's performance is the ONLY thing that makes this film visible. The plot is inane and ridiculous (not funny). The other renowned actors seem to be making desperate attempts to give the characters that represent a bit of humanity ... these characters have the humanity of wet cardboard. Everything about the technical side of this film is mediocre or simply horrible. The director shoots slow-motion and slow-motion photos with impunity. The incidental music is a caricature and destroys any sign of dramatic effect. It's not something I really look for in a movie, but even the closet was far away. The venerable Brando could not divert attention from the horrible rags that had him in disguise. I've heard this movie called "David Lynch-esquire" and "irreverently funny" ... it's neither one nor the other. David Lynch's films are born of a perverse creativity; this movie was not creative at all. And do not confuse irreverence with stupidity.
