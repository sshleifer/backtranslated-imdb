I sat through this movie tonight, forcing myself to follow it though I never cared about any of the characters or what happened to them, because the two protagonists, Gérard Philippe and Michèle Morgan, were the main movie stars of their time. I wanted to see them in "something different", which undoubtedly was. Both gave good performances, but unpleasant characters. <br /> <br /> In fact, the whole film is about a small city in poor condition in Mexico inhabited by almost uniformly unpleasant characters (the doctor is, of course, the main exception). What Michèle Morgan never sees in Philippe to fall in love with him is never explained. <br /> <br /> This supposedly is based on a work by Jean-Paul Sartre. All I could think was that, if Sartre's work is anything like this movie, it must be a very mediocre attempt to imitate Camus's masterful novel, The Plague, which treated a plague in North Africa. <br /> <br /> A Well-acted but uninteresting film.
