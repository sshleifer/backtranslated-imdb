(Some possible spoilers) <br /> <br /> I'm not really sure what Dreamworks was thinking when they decided to spend $ 80 million on this extremely tired and lame animated movie. They probably thought that the spectacular animation would be more than enough to attract the audience (mostly families) to see it in droves. Well, it seemed to work for the first weekend, it won $ 26 million, approximately and it has earned $ 38.1 million. total (an estimate for this weekend). But I think the audiences that came over the weekend saw almost the same as me, when I saw and spread the word. This is a very unconvincing film, apart from the animation of everything else, most of the three years seem to make the script. <br /> <br /> The movie lasts only about 80 minutes. Long, but it feels like a three-hour epic. Some key points for me are, well, the irritating narrative is one of them, and it's obviously written. At one point, he escapes from some captors and, although you can see that the horse is obviously scared, the narrator (the voice of the talented Matt Damon) appears to clear up any misconceptions (which would only happen in the simplest way of thinking ). br /> <br /> Another is the constant pop up of Bryan Adams songs, now I'm a fan of his music, I think it's good, but actually Dreamworks thought the audience could handle 8-9 of their songs to Throughout such a short film, I certainly could not. Finally, and here is a spoiler, a horse is shot at close range by a member of Calvary, no less, she (the horse) then falls into a raging river The spirit (the focus of the film) tries to save her, but both go through a waterfall that must have at least a 50-foot drop, well later in the film, near the end, we see that this horse is alive and well. I know this is a movie for children, but even that small amount of realism is unacceptable. <br /> <br /> In summary, this is a really boring moment. Go, do not say that children do not enjoy it, but anyone else will check their watches waiting for this trip to end. Definitely on my list of the 10 worst of this year. - ** of 4 stars. <br /> <br />
