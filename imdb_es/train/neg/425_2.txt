I can not believe I'm so angry after seeing this that I'm about to write my first review on IMDb. <br /> <br /> This Disney documentary is just a version of Planet Earth. Now I knew it was advertised as "from the people who brought you Planet Earth," but I had no idea that they were going to blatantly use the same cuts as the groundbreaking documentary miniseries. I just paid $ 8.75 to see something I already have on DVD. Shame on Disney for not warning people that there is absolutely nothing original here (except a voiceover of James Earl Jones and 90 seconds of sailfish that I do not think were on Planet Earth). <br /> <br /> But the greatest crime of all, is that while Planet Earth uses the tragic history of the polar bear as evidence that we are killing this planet and a catalyst for ecological change, Disney took that story and turned it into a family friendly tripe. After the disappearance of the male polar bear, they show that their puppies grew significantly a year later, and spit some trash on how they are ready to charge in their memory, and that the earth really is a beautiful place after all. There is no mention of adult puppies that are about to die due to the same situation their father endured, there is no warning of problems for future generations if we do not act together, nothing. Just a montage of things that we have already seen throughout the film (and many times more, if you are one of the one billion people who have already seen Planet Earth). <br /> <br /> I have never left the theater with so much feeling. Ashamed and deceived in my life.
