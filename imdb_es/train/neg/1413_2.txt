I love Morgan Freeman. Paz Vega is an attractive, attractive and talented actress. I'm sure this would have been a good movie if something had happened in it. Nothing does It's short (less than 90 minutes). They were 75 minutes too long. After an hour of frustration, I reviewed the remaining 20 minutes. Unbearable. <br /> <br /> Freeman plays an actor, who has not worked in a long time, investigating a role he could play, as a paid employee in a supermarket. He visits the supermarket where she works. Nothing happens. She decides to take him home and they go to an Arby's, to Target, to car wash. Nothing happens. They talk about their lives. Nothing happens. Never. <br /> <br /> I do not understand it. But I also do not get Bill Murray's films "Lost In Translation" and "Broken Flowers." If you like those movies, maybe you like this. Many people find films like this capricious, charming or, for reasons that escape me, find fascinating dialogue. A common device in movies of this type is to have a LONG take of stillness / silence after an actor emits a line that is supposed to be meaningful. We know it is significant because it is followed by two minutes of nothing on the screen. I'm sorry, I must be a philistine. I do not understand it. For me, this type of movie is not funny, nor charming, nor thought provoking. They are just boring. Why? Because there is no comedy. Without drama. No tension. Do not laugh. There is no suspense. There is no action. Nothing to see In short, none of the things I go to the cinema for. I can get bored for free. I see strange / extravagant characters in real life. I go to Target, and to fast food restaurants, already washed of cars. These elements do not make a movie, even if the stars are doing this. I pay you to entertain me. <br /> <br /> If you're crazy about Morgan Freeman and you just want to hear him ramble on about nothing, have fun. If you want to drool over Paz Vega, you can look at it and listen to it. But nothing happens, I promise. A total of snoozefest.
