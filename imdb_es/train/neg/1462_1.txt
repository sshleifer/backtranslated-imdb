This could be the worst movie I've ever seen. Despite what Mikshelt claims, this film is not even close to being historically accurate. It starts badly and then everything is downhill from there. We have Hitler's father cursing his own bad luck for the "fact" that he had married his niece! They were, in fact, second cousins. Hitler's mother, Klara, called her father, Alois, "uncle" because Alois had been adopted and raised by Klara's grandfather and raised as his son, when he was really his nephew. Alois was much older than Klara and, as a child, had a habit of calling Alois "uncle". <br /> <br /> The scene in the trenches where Hitler is mocked by his fellow soldiers and decides to take him out with his dog is simply a disgrace and an insult to the intelligence of all the spectators. We see Hitler chasing the dog through the trench, when he meets the poor man, proceeds to beat him for disobeying him. In the distance, we see and hear his fellow soldiers continue to mock and punish the cowardly little man, but then a shell falls directly on his pursuers, and each one, according to what they tell us, is killed. How, then, if Hitler was the only person who survived the scene, was this story of brutality and cowardice told? Did Hitler himself "boast" about it? - I do not think so. <br /> <br /> Next, Hitler intimidates and intimidates a poor Jewish officer, stressed and tired of the war to give him an Iron Cross! I can only assume that this Jewish officer had been a lender before fighting for the Fatherland, and had carefully brought some promised medals from his shop, because I am sure that the Iron Crosses would not be delivered as shown in this comic farce. <br /> <br /> Here are all the grotesque clich√©s, not least the soothing and hypnotic effect of Wagner's music on the little man. I wish the producers had kept Ian Kershaw on his side. Then they could have discovered that Franz Lehar's "happy widow" was more likely to float in the Fuhrer's boat than any "flying Dutchman" in Richard Wagner's cannon! <br /> <br /> Hitler may have been responsible for the deaths of 60 million people, but how can he be forgiven for his appalling musical taste? <br /> <br /> I could go on, but I would do it for hours. <br /> <br /> Give it a miss.
