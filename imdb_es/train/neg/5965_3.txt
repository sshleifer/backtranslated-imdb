In 1454, in France, the sorcerer Alaric de Marnac (Paul Naschy) is beheaded and his lover Mabille De Lancré (Helga Liné) is tortured to death accused of witchcraft, vampirism and lycanthropy. Before dying, they curse the next generations of their executioners. Currently (in the 70s), Hugo de Marnac (Paul Naschy) and Sylvia (Betsabé Ruiz) and their friends Maurice Roland (Victory Winner) and his beloved Paula (Cristina Suriani) attend a session of sessions , where they evoke the Spirit of Alaric de Marnac. They decide to travel to the Villas de Sade, a property of Hugo's family in the countryside, to look for a monastery with a hidden treasure. They find Alaric's head and the demon possesses them, returning Mabille to life and executing the locals in blood sacrifices. After the death of his father, Elvira (Emma Cohen) remembers that he has the amulet Hammer of Thor hidden in a well; along with Maurice, they try to defeat the demonic Alaric de Marnac and Mabille. <br /> <br /> Last weekend I bought a horror genre box with five Paul Naschy DVDs for US $ 9.98; Despite having no references, I decided to take a chance. The first DVD with the uncut and restored version "Horror Rises from the Tomb" is a garbage movie B (or C) that immediately reminded me of Ed Wood. The ridiculous story is revealed through horrible script, direction, performances, cinematography, decoration, special effects and editing and with many naked women. The result is simply hilarious and I can guarantee that Ed Wood's style is back. My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Not available
