This should be my kind of movie. Even if it stunk, I should still have been in my alley; Damn, I like the movies "Congo" and "Allan Quatermaine". I have a weakness in my heart for the extraterrestrial movies / demons / foolish adventures. Let's review why I decided to see this in the first place. <br /> <br /> 1. Horror / science fiction almost always intrigues me 2. I am a big fan of archeology, and this movie involves a weird treasure. 3. Super-natural enemies with quality effects. 4. Christian Slater and Dorf I generally enjoy. 5. Tara Reid is hot. <br /> <br /> So this movie had potential, at least in the cheese horror section of the video store, but the guy did suck his ass. The only redeeming aspects are Slater and Dorf, and not everyone finds them as entertaining as I am ... I mean, let's face it, both are melodramatic. But now let's go to some of the many faults. <br /> <br /> Tara Reid. Even though the movie as a whole is worse, Reid's performance is really horrible. Not only are we talking badly, I'm talking about nominating Tara Reid for the worst performance of the year. I do not know if she is capable of acting, but interpreting the curator of the museum is simply out of reach ... completely. Seeing her try to take the role of a cultured scientist was not very different from what she sees when she sees the configuration in a bad pornography. I mean, this is not just bad, it's ridiculously bad. Oh, and for those of you curious, she does not get naked, she just keeps a bra in a silly and totally unnecessary love scene. <br /> <br /> Even with Reid's performance, maybe the movie could have worked, but the plot is what dominates, and the plot seems written by a 10-year-old boy. I had not realized that it was an adaptation of video games until AFTER watching the DVD, otherwise, I would have appreciated the stupidity in real time. <br /> <br /> The plot goes back and forth from Slater's childhood in an orphanage where he receives flashbacks of something terrible that happened, he has amnesia, of course. In his adult life, Slater was recruited by some Unit 713, a paranormal military force that apparently hunts evil or something. Slater had to leave because he was too rebellious, I guess, you never know, unless it was one of those voice-overs that I noticed. The film begins with Slater's hunting artifacts, obtaining his last piece after some deals with a "Chilean mercenary force that specializes in selling rare antiques". I may be wrong about the exact quote, but you understand the idea. <br /> <br /> There is an evil doctor who wants to unleash some demons on earth (for no reason), experiments with children, super demon / alien. human hybrids, "photonic" bullets (things of the devil can not stand sunlight) and, of course, Slater and Dorf try to save everyone. <br /> <br /> Jesus, I can not even be able to go through the clich√© elements. The script did not need to go back to work to limit the focus and provide ANY depth. I mean, why is this evil scientist so evil? Oh right, humans are condemned and he is just trying to save the human race. I assume he is infected? How did that happen? Oh right, he has one of the things of the evil demon in a cage and draws his blood to shoot himself. How the hell did that happen? Why and where did he get the super slugs (oh, yes, they use the old sci-fi support of alien / parasitic demons that "fuse" with their host's backbone)? Of course, Slater is, like Blade, half super bullet fired, but his bullet "did not merge completely due to an electric shock", thank God. Oh, and the people with these "fused" thorns, have no idea that they are half alien / devils and act like good community members until a secret signal is given of where they become murderous zombies. Yes, we have zombies. <br /> <br /> So a lot of crap could be entertaining, but none of that is. <br /> <br /> Also, the ending is completely stupid since everything turns out to be not. That big problem to fix in the first place ... at least nothing that a bit of dynamite can not handle. <br /> <br /> It's not the worst you'll see, but a really bad movie.
