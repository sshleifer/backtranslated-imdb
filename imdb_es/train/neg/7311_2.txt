Well, I had heard little about this movie, so when it appeared on the movie channels on television, I wanted to see it, being a horror aficionado. I think I can make a collective "huh?" for all who saw it. <br /> <br /> I decided to go on with my life, but at a party with my closest friends, we saw that it was coming and some of those who already saw it decided that we could laugh through it, both proclaiming "this It's the dumbest thing I've seen. " It was not scary I'll give it to Roth (which I think is a young hack); the characters change throughout the film, wing "Cube". <br /> <br /> HOWEVER, despite its typical "rat in a cage" scenario, who will take care of who, etc., was a pretty average horror. <br /> <br /> Some points: 1.) What happened to that child? I'm not even talking about him being strange and biting people. I'm talking about the whole "slow kick of karate", what was that? 2.) Okay, I know that Rider's character liked Jordan Ladd's, but as a young woman, I was horrified that he just went ahead and bothered her in her dream. Uh, that's illegal. <br /> <br /> 3.) Roth was in the movie just so Roth could be in the movie. Talk about writing to you uselessly! 4.) What happened to the deputy? 5.) Then the dog pulled her away instantly? And there was little or no blood left? Just a piece of his jeans? Anyway, we laugh, and I love laughing during horror movies (Return of the Dead Dead 2, Evil Dead), but I do not know if we were supposed to laugh here ...
