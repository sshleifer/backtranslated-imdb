This is the kind of movie he regrets having put on his VCR. It is a strange and bad version of the movie "Misery (1990)" by Stephen Kings. I can not understand how this movie got a score of 5.2, because it has no story, and when the movie finally ended, I felt relieved. <br /> <br /> This movie should have been released as a short film Instead ... it spends a lot of time on the same thing. And like in all bad movies, everything happens right at the end of the movie in a time lapse of 10 to 15 minutes ... <br /> <br /> Therefore, before deciding to watch this movie, make sure Put some new batteries in your remote control, because it will do a lot of fast forward ... do not worry, you will not miss anything important.
