There's nothing like watching giant robots battling in a desert desert, and Robot Wars meets. Of course, the performance is terrible, the dialogue is deficient, and the characters are one-dimensional, but it has giant robots! The special effects themselves are pretty good for the period. Certainly, they are not as polished as today's standards, but they contain a minimum of computer graphics and instead use miniatures, which is why they have aged quite well. His shortcomings are easily overlooked due to the short running time of the movies, and he has a certain ironic humor in some parts that makes it quite pleasurable. I would recommend it to any fan of giant robots or cheesy sci-fi who is looking for a happy hour of distraction.
