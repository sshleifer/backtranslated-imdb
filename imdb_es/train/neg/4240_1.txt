As we all know, Hollywood enjoys changing historical events for our enjoyment, and 44 minutes is one of those hollywoodized movies. For example, bank robbers never returned to the bank when they started shooting at the LAPD, but in the movie we see them return twice. Another example is the number of Los Angeles police officers who were shot near the end of the movie, this is far from the truth! But, of course, Hollywood must have a bloody good ending to * add * a little more blood and guts. Some events were combined and many of the main actors played different people, but this is what Hollywood has always done. Why do they complain? I think the only sad part is that I've seen some one-hour documentaries about the North Hollywood shooting at TLC that were much better than this!
