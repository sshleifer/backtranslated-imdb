What a powerful start for a movie when the character of Julia Roberts is hit in the face by her abusive and anal husband played by Patrick Bergin and I felt ready to experience a powerful film at the same level as The Burning Bed by Farrah Fawcett. Well, as the summary says, I was wrong. This movie was nothing like The Burning Bed, which had power and Farrah played the role of a woman you really felt, and felt her pain and her need to survive. Sleeping with the enemy fell asleep after the first act became a cheap excitement with Roberts faking his death to escape his husband and goes to live in Iowa. At first, her husband believes that she is dead, but begins to suspect that she may still be alive and go after her. The rest of the movie is basically a cat-and-mouse game where Julia gets a house in this small town in Iowa and changes her identity ... she does not mention, of course, how she got the money for this, but at this point of history. Film that I did not care much about. She meets a guy (Mr. Nice wimpy) and falls in love with him and her husband finally reaches her, but not before he goes back to fix his cans of soup and fix the kitchen. This was what I assume to provide a cheap emotion to the audience. But I did not care much if she was a battered wife because the movie, as I said, deceived the audience. If he had stayed the course, he could have felt it for her and her situation. Of course, the husband is murdered and all is well for little Mrs. Roberts. If only the real world were something like this ... See the bed on fire and understand how a movie is supposed to be on the subject of domestic abuse.
