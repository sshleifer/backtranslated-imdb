Terry West had a good idea with this movie. It just did not come true. There are endless shots of the spooky looking school exteriors that go on forever and probably to improve the movie's execution time. Also in this school there are only 2 students. Misty Mundae is good as always, but this movie will always belong to Ruby LaRocca (which is the only reason to see the movie at the beginning). If the script focused on his interesting character we would have a movie to watch. She is so beautiful! Good news for DVD buyers, Terry West's previous (and best) film, "Blood For The Muse" is a special feature. One thing I would like to say is that this movie feels as if someone who is not good at executing the final line at the end of a long joke for the end, feels the same way. Then again, just look at this for Ruby LaRocca.
