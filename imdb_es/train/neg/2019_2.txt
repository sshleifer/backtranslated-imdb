Oh, man, this sucked ... I could not get my courage out of this ... and I sat all the time on Showtime ... Do not bother waiting for the "nude scenes" ... it's too late and only the plastic Jenna Jameson is involved. It shows how much discretionary money should be thrown by Hollywood just to get its name in the closing credits. I think Showtime had to include something. at 1 am ... Next time I think I'd even prefer to see ESPN in a loop every 30 minutes ...
