The words fail me. This movie was extremely difficult to see and, in retrospect, I really wish I had not done it. Even though I tried to sit down to the end, I have to admit that I could not last more than an hour, so my opinion could be unfair. However, this film would require the last most impressive third in the history of cinema to be given a review that is not cruel. <br /> <br /> Please, do not see any part of this movie. .
