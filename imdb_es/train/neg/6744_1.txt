As you all know, JIGSAW did not get to Blackbuster because of a Full Moon staff member, Devin Hamilton. Devin is the one that sells to all the video chains. He recently released a movie, BLEED, which was selling to Blackbuster at the same time as JIGSAW. He convinced the Blackbuster buyer not to take JIGSAW and doubled the BLEED number. The result is that JIGSAW seems a failure, and BLEED seems a success. The main problem with that is that BLEED is one of the worst movies in history, and as we all know, JIGSAW is, well, gold. I urge everyone to go to the BLEED website and vote for the movie that hurt JIGSAW, and all its talents. In the same way, you should go to the JIGSAW page and issue high votes (if you have not already done so). We need to get JIGSAW at least an 8 or 8.5, and BLEED at around 2 (therefore, put it on the list of the 100 worst Internet movies). Also, try to convince friends and family to do the same. <br /> <br /> I hope everyone is well, - Matt
