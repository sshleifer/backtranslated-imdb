So begins with a beautiful old house in the country. You have a group of people who are asked to come to this house and, of course, caregivers always close the doors at night for no apparent reason. Anywhoo, people laugh, joke, etc. This Dr. tells a spooky story of this woman and some children. They get scared, they start to feel things. Oh no, the ghost of a girl sees. Some more speak, then comes this great ghost and etc., etc. This girl discovers that this ghost killed small children and that she must free their souls, yes, yes, blah, blah. She does it but, oh no, she dies the way she does. And go to heaven while this evil ghost goes to hell. Two people survive and escape from the house. The script is terrible because a man is cut off his head and Elanor (the one who dies saving the children) says "oh no". The performance is wooden, the effects are shit and the set is a couple of rooms that are used again and again. Basically, if you like to laugh at bad movies, watch them, but if you're looking for a scare, then you definitely can not miss this movie. I was very disappointed when I saw this. A very big disappointment. My sister (who becomes easily sacred) got bored in this movie, it's awful.
