As a lesbian, I am always looking for films related to gays and lesbians. However, with this type of garbage out there, it would be enough to discourage any audience. <br /> <br /> I kept waiting for something to happen, anything, a story to develop, or just for it to make some kind of sense. Neither of them happened. It was just meaningless scenes, disconnected in any way with anything. The film did not convey any kind of history or depth to the character. <br /> <br /> After an hour or more of this nonsense, I simply turned it off. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time on this absurdity. <br /> <br /> 1 star - and it does not even deserve it.
