This ambitious film is the one that suffers most from the delirium and greatness of writer / director Paul Thomas Anderson. Highly derived from a much better material ("Nashville by Altman", "Red" by Lumet de Altman), this heavy elephant takes too much time to get anywhere. A couple of wrong detours along the way (an embarrassing musical interlude, a biblical plague) do not help at all. Neither does the unequal level of performances. Especially bad: William H. Macy, whose character and plot could easily have been eliminated completely; Julianne Moore, for her unconvincing anguish. And how many times should we see the trick of the sad sack of John C. Reilly ("Chicago" and "The Hours" will suffice)? Tom Cruise goes well in comparison? his misogynist and evil Holy Roller was pretty funny. Speaking of disgusting mouths, the script was so loaded with "F" bombs that they lost their impact in no time. Do not even talk about that horrible soundtrack, full of insipid and annoying voices of Aimee Mann. His extended interpretation of "One," a phone number to begin with, led to distraction at the beginning of the movie. I should have paid attention to the writing on the wall and saved three more hours, at which point I had been pushed to the edge of hell. A redeeming feature, which I have not seen mentioned in other reviews, is the best performance in the group, by the unknown Melora Walters in the role of Claudia, the damaged Coca Cola demon who is inclined towards self-destruction. His credibility far outweighed all the others. This movie was taken too seriously and I just did not know when to finish.
