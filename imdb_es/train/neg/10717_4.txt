I give this generous four out of ten stars, or points or markers, or something. <br /> <br /> There were a total of two really funny scenes in this movie. All the scenes with Amy P and Tina Fey and Greg Kinnear (Greg Kinnear !!) advanced quite nicely. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, the usual traffic of stereotypes, the speed of the fires, rudely driven by a stupid soundtrack, and the "soundtrack" is generous. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the two really fun scenes involved Amy P. She is really very funny in an animal way. She is a mixture of that ape that they make in SNL and Lucille Ball. <br /> <br /> I hope that they (Amy P and Tina Fey) have admitted that they did this for money, because if they do. She gave birth to Sarah Palin's parodies, so I guess we can say, yes, it was worth it to put the black man back in the role of servant, who is really there to help you be more human. <br /> <br /> Blah. 4 out of 10 as I said is generous. <br /> <br /> But no more, girls, okay? Oh, I almost forgot. The mother of "Two and a Half Men" is in this movie, and she has undergone some kind of plastic surgery, so her mouth now looks like the mouth of a 30 year old child, so every scene in which I am, it's like trying to rearrange your face, or putting it in my mind, or just answering the question, "No. Wait ... Wait ... HAVE YOU HAD A PLASTIC SURGERY?" Because as a spectator, you really do not want to have undergone plastic surgery.
