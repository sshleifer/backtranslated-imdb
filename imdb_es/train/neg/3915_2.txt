This film is not only badly written and directed, it is simply unpleasant. A beautiful novel is terribly misrepresented in this film. Many changes have been made in history, probably to speed up the time frame. But what results is simply confusing. The performance can not overcome the script that eliminates the motives of the characters for their behavior. Also, the conversion to English does not work when everyone refers to the patriarch EsTEban as ESteban. Horrible. Please, please read the beautiful novel, in Spanish if possible. Do not watch this movie. It will ruin for you what could be a wonderful experience.
