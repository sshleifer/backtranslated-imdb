Evil Breed is a very strange slasher movie that unfortunately is not good. The beginning of the film looks promising, but in general it is a disaster. The dialogue is bad enough but not as bad as the acting. The acting is brutal and unbearable. the characters emit lines horribly and even if that is on purpose, the method does not work because the characters become annoying. Some of the murders are innovative, but they took too long to reach them. After about half an hour through the movie we get the first death (apart from the beginning) and then almost all the other characters smoke in the next five minutes. The movie became a kind of parody with ridiculous-looking characters, unrealistic karate like fights and a scene in which a man causes his intestines to come out of his a * sscrack. None of them is funny, it's just ridiculous. The film becomes ultra bloody and ultra meaningless. Most of the characters are cliches even by slasher standards and they are as solid as we left them on the counter for 5 days. The Evil race is not even ridiculously bad, so it fails in its main task. Watch the Texas massacre, Just Before Dawn, or See No Evil for a true slasher.
