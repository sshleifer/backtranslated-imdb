The only aspect of this film that prevents me from becoming my favorite piece of celluloid is a single line uttered by an agent trying to infiltrate the man-eating tomatoes dressed in a tomato costume: "Can anyone pass the ketchup?" I strongly recommend anyone with a sleep disorder to use this film as a sedative; It works better than an overdose of demarol.
