What did the director think? All those who have read Artemisia's biography are impressed by their guts to face a public trial for rape in the Renaissance times and even suffer torture to prove that Tassi was guilty. That fact shows true independence and emancipation: in her most terrible hour, she meets her MAN. Why do the films that show the Renaissance have to be so beautiful and romantic from the clinical point of view, we are afraid to see the rougher side of life or have we won the happy mood of Hollywood? While I would always defend the freedom of a director to create his own reality in a movie, it does not make sense to change the story of Artimisia's life. Very disappointing option on the part of the creators of this movie.
