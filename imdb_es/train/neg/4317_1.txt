My wife and I found that this movie is very sloppy. It started well, but it quickly became incredible and ridiculous. Most of the acting was bad, with the exception of the girl, Abbie, who really was great. In addition, the dialogue was predictable and lame, especially Gideon, the Angel. Also, without revealing anything, when one of the characters has a tragedy, she seems almost indifferent. At first we thought it was a 'shock', but then we realized that it was just a terrible script. We love almost all of Hallmark's films and their moving stories, but this movie is not the occasion. There are so many great, do not waste time with this horrible movie.
