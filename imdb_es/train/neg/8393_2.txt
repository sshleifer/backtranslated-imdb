John Carradine, John Ireland and Faith Domergue, who, as players, saw better days in better movies, came together for this Grade G horror movie about life that imitates art in a mysterious mansion. <br /> <br /> For Carradine was in those In the last two decades of his career that appeared at any point of the theory, it was better to continue working no matter what he did and receive those checks. With that magnificent sonorous voice of his, Carradine always had a great demand for images of terror and Man did not discriminate in the least in what he seemed. <br /> <br /> He's in charge of looking after an old Gothic mansion that film director John Ireland has rented for his latest low-budget slasher movie. It even has a cemetery, but with a lost occupant. Faith Domergue is the star of Ireland and Carole Wells is the young naive. <br /> <br /> In the last twenty minutes, the majority of the cast ended up dead that is not yet dead. The script is so incoherent that I'm still trying to understand the point. I will not waste more gray matter on him.
