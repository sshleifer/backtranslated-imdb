What exactly happened during World War 11 in New Zealand when US forces were there? <br /> <br /> This terrible story of 4 sisters was really pathetic. Can you imagine choosing Joan Fontaine as Sandra Dee's older sister? Fontaine looked more like his mother. Even more fun was that Fontaine became pregnant in the movie. <br /> <br /> Piper Laurie and Paul Newman, who were so good at screen chemistry 4 years later in "The Hustler," have no scenes together in this movie. Laurie plays another sister who goes to Wellington to wander around, even though she is married. Woe to her when her husband returns from the war. <br /> <br /> Jean Simmons is a widow and finds romance with a very dim Paul Newman. There's even a romance for young Miss Dee here. <br /> <br /> The image has little or no meaning. Are you trying to say that everything is fair in love and in war? If they are, they did a bad job selling this. <br /> <br /> The conflict of interest with Newman and Simmons is resolved quickly. That's what should have been done quickly with this terribly disappointing 1957 movie.
