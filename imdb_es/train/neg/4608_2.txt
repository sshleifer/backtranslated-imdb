I bought this DVD because it has kari and the classifications of mpaa say; "R rating for violence and strong sexuality, nudity and language". <br /> <br /> correctly, OMI, should indicate; "R rated by strong violence, sexuality, nudity and language". <br /> <br /> The word "sexuality" should appear after a "comma", not a "and" because of the great difference in meaning it has. I think many of the people who have seen this movie will agree with me that sexuality and nudity are SOME parts almost non-existent. My first impression when I look at mpaa's rating was that I will be seeing something like a "vivid" movie. That's why I felt cheated. As far as the story goes, it was more or less, after all, who really cares about the story if the magnificent kari was in it. I know not. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is just my opinion. <br /> <br /> Joseph
