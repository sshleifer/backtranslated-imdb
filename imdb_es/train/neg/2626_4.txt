Years ago I saw this movie in a group tradition of Fast Forward Film Festivals, where we set out to rent a bunch of B movies and vote for who chose the worst. <br /> <br /> The night we saw this, it was voted the best, due to its plot appearance and funny costumes. <br /> <br /> This is certainly a stupid and cheesy movie, to be seen under the full understanding that you are seeing low-budget fluff. Personally, however, I would not recommend additional substances ... this movie will leave its own mark on you. <br /> <br /> I was impressed enough that I really have been trying to get my practice a copy for a few years. <br /> <br /> A good option if you are willing to watch bad movies. This is fun, and I remember the inflatable music ...
