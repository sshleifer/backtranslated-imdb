Peculiar, independent, theatrical, Christian Slater, these are all the teasers that made me hope to spend an hour or so "discovering" a jewel of a movie. Boy, I was disappointed. Julian Po never overcomes himself. The film is tirelessly shy. I found myself unable to suspend disbelief even for a moment. The exaggeration, obviously the theatrical sets, the exaggerated, obviously the theatrical performance, the exaggerated, the obvious theater direction, well, you understand the idea. <br /> <br /> It is not necessary for the allegories to be handed out in hammer style. And it's hard to feel a lot for Julian Po because we never know much about him. The ridiculous girlfriend, the annoying people of the city, the idiotic clergyman, the spoiled children. Why does someone, particularly someone with a long lifelong ambition to get to the beach (the character of Slater), decide to stay in such a depressing place?
