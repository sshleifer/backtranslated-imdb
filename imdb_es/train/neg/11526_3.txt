I enjoyed the previous Ittenbach movie I had seen, "Burning Moon". But while the movie was quite unpleasant and unpleasant, "Premutos" seems to play it mainly to laugh. While it's admirable how Ittenbach made this film penniless in his spare time (and the DVD documentary is worth seeing), I found myself constantly struggling not to move quickly towards the next bloody scene. Sure, there's blood, and if that's all you want, then go ahead and enjoy. But be careful: there is an inordinate amount of boring comedy and tedious exposure of stories. Many are comparing this with Peter Jackson's films, especially "Braindead". But seeing what Jackson did with a similar budget in "Mal gusto", it's clear that Ittenbach lacks one thing that Jackson has: talent. 3/10 (for fairly good and abundant gore effects, and to make the most of limited resources, but it's not worth the money I paid for it)
