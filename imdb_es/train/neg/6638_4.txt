If your dialogue reads like the dialogue in this movie, destroy your script and try again. <br /> <br /> I did not have many expectations, but I was intrigued by the description that indicated there was a mystery in the Christmas Ornament Factory. The Mystery is solved very early and the film becomes a direct romance. I almost stopped seeing him at 5 minutes, at 10 minutes, and at the first break. My spouse, who is the Hallmark & ​​Lifetime fan, gave up on the first break. <br /> <br /> Forest River is a city of the company: the main business is Aikens Ornaments, which manufactures all kinds of Christmas decorations. The patriarch of the company has recently passed away, so the future of the company could be in doubt. Soon we find Noelle, who would rather be on Wall Street than with Main Street, and with the mysterious Justin, who has a date with Noelle after a big snowman that is inflating hits Justins' car. Once we meet with Alison Aikens, doing due diligence for the Board, we have our history configuration. <br /> <br /> If you can not identify all the arcs of the story in the first commercial break, you have not seen enough. this type of vacation movie. Maybe that's a good thing.
