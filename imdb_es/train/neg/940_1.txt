Well, guys, we know why we watch movies like "The Invisible Maniac" (just look at the cover, man!). T and A in the whole place (with much more T than A). But ... should not there be a story that goes with it? <br /> <br /> "Come on," I hear you say, "this is just naked girls! Who needs a story?" <br /> <br /> Well, if this was called "The NAKED Maniacs" ", I would not have any problem. But since these guys are talking about "The invisible man," they need to have some history around here, you know, to keep your mind occupied. <br /> <br /> However, all they can muster is how this crazy doctor creates an invisibility serum and, when it breaks, uses it to spy on naked women and ends up killing many teenagers. And when you see the smart-looking teenagers you're after, you'll be grateful. <br /> <br /> One star, for the T and the A, but there is too much gore for your skin fans, so continue with caution. <br /> <br /> TIDBIT - yes, it's ESA Savannah.
