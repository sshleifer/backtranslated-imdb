This was not a Trainspotting or Guy Ritchie movie. It was a great wannabee. I wanted to be a nervous movie, a nervous laugh, that affirmed urban life, but it's more like a disorderly camera, disorder. It is much easier to imitate something else, than to create a real story with real characters. From the beginning, I could not care less about the characters or what they were involved with. They were always hitting, urinating or crying with each other. Only, there was no substance in what they were doing. The dialogue between the characters is meant to be modern, revealing, instead it's trite, and one scene after another is predictable. I know there are spectators out there who really liked this movie, so I could be wrong.
