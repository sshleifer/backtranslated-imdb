I do not understand how these animated films keep coming out, and no matter how good (or bad) they are that people love. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie with my two children (5,7). They like virtually everything animated (like most people who rated this movie). The theater was almost full, and I expected to see the movie with its excellent cast. Truthfully, I was bored silly. It was incredibly predictable and simply not funny. There were a couple of giggles throughout the movie and that was it. Of course, they tried again and again to get the cheap laugh, but it just did not work out. My son almost always tells me that he wants the DVD after we see an animated movie, but not in this one. My daughter fell asleep halfway. In addition, the children thought that the animation of the character was rare. I have not heard that from them since I saw The Polar Express, which gave my daughter nightmares. <br /> <br /> Trust me, I'm not the type that looks for the negative in everything. But quality is quality, and like so many animated films that launch, it has very little.
