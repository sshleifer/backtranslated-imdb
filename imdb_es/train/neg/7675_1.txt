Can you ever say that there are some movies that do not have any redemption feature? Answer: Yes, and this is one of them. After directing the unfortunate director of 'House of the Dead', Uwe Boll has now put his untalented eye on another videogame adaptation. Do not these guys understand? For anyone who can not understand, here is capitalized: THE VIDEO GAMES DO NOT MAKE GOOD MOVIES! The performance here is, at best, sub-standard. The design of the set and the special effects are bad. Unlike the video game (which had its moments of fear), the film does not have an atmosphere of imminent death, nor a feeling of danger or threat. The rhythm and layout are confused and the paper on which the script was printed would have been better used as toilet paper. The principal culprit is the director. Uwe Boll uses the camera with the grace and skill of a monkey that uses a brush. The zooms, swoops and pirated pans come together in all the grim business at unpredictable times that leave the audience disoriented and bored. The reason why this guy was allowed to approach a movie in the first place, must be one of the biggest secrets of modern cinemas. Avoid at all costs.
