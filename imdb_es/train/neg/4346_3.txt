['Why, oh, why do people take good material and feel the need to change it in some way? Having read the book on which this film is supposedly based a couple of years ago, I can say that there is little or nothing of the original book. I entered this film with few expectations, I knew I would have a TV sensation, but I did not even fulfill this. <br /><br /> This is not a prequel, the only relationship you have with the original is the name. This is not the story of Carlito Brigante, it is the story of a character totally different from the one that has been given the same name. They just spit totally in the faces of all the fans of Carlito&#39;s Way; adding insult to injury by choosing Luis Guzm√°n, who plays a crucial character in the original film, in a different role. <br /><br /> The most disappointing thing is that now that this movie has been made, no other film will be made that addresses the original and intact material of the book Carlito&#39;s Way, something that I would really like to see. I felt the same with respect to Chopper: they have four books and interviews with fantastic non-fiction material and could have made a brilliant biography of the most feared figure in the underworld of Australia, instead they made a boring movie about a crazy but strange way . A pathetic little thief (although the performance of Eric Bana was successful). Now we can never see Carlito&#39;s true rise and fall. <br /><br /> The three stars are because, considering them purely as an independent film, it is not so atrocious, there are some decent performances (Jay Hernandez is not Carlito but could be good in other roles) and the story is not so bad. . Even Puffy Combs adapts to his role. But they totally misinterpret the nature of the underworld at that time (I&#39;m a little fond of crime and not fiction), something that the original film and the books were right (having been written by the then lawyer and now Judge Edwin Torres). <br /><br /> However, the fact is that it is not independent, it may be the most disappointing prequel ever filmed.']
