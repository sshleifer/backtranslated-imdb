I just saw this at the Vancouver International Film Festival 2006. The synopsis in the festival guide sounded pretty good, so we decided to take a look. I'm sorry to say that I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Besides being poorly written, it was boring. I will not take away the actors, since there is not much they can do with this bad script. <br /> <br /> The first bite was a clich√© without being ironic, the seriousness without being funny. The movie would have been better if Hunt Hoe had had a sense of horror. Instead, it was taken seriously and this turned out to be a boring movie. I can not recommend this movie. He felt too long and generally just weak.
