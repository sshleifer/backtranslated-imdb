I have to admit that when I went to see this movie, I did not have many expectations. But even with my low expectations, I was totally disappointed ... <br /> <br /> Basically, Luke Wilson is a hot shot that tends to come out with a little crazy girlfriends. There is a slight mention of a girl who stalks him, but that's all for that character. Which I do not care because it would probably be as undeveloped as the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Then, while in a subway, Rainn Wilson (who I really liked before this movie) convinces him to speak. to a "hot" girl, Uma Thurman. It is strange to say the least, since everyone can clearly see that Uma Thurman does not belong to the "hot" category. <br /> <br /> Rainn Wilson's performance is also far from being "hot". I'm usually in favor of his acting, but even he could not save this movie. His character was nervous, unrealistic and quite annoying. You could never tell if the writers were trying to turn him into the comic gay token closet guy or just desperate. It was almost painful. <br /> <br /> But anyway, someone steals your purse when you leave the subway, and Luke Wilson is the charming savior who runs after the thief. Now we all know that Uma Thurman is the superhero or "G-Girl", as they like to call her in the movie. I'm still puzzled by what the "G" means, but we'll leave that to discuss the forums. <br /> <br /> The sex scenes that I guess are supposed to be fun, but I find myself wondering who has sex like that? They almost throw the bed through the wall because of Uma Thurman's "passion", shall we say. My head hurts, but not in the way that "I'm really thinking hard to understand this." <br /> <br /> When Uma insults Anna Faris, calling her "bitch", I did not have any debate with that. Apart from the fact that she can not choose movies correctly, she can not act and trusts the fact that she is blonde and typical. <br /> <br /> In general, I would have left the theater if I had not paid $ 8.75 to see it. The characters are typical and have absolutely no chemistry, especially Uma Thurman. Someone should let you know that just because you move your head a lot does not mean you're acting. <br /> <br /> Also, the script and the story could have used a lot of work or a game and a lighter fluid. In fact, I started to feel embarrassed by the actors and their moribund careers. In general, if you value your money and your self-esteem DO NOT waste your time with this pathetic attempt to see a movie.
