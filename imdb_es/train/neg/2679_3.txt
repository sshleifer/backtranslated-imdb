(SPOILERS FORWARD) Russian fantasy "actioner" (and I use the term lightly) that I've been trying to see for over a year. I have finally reached the end and now I wish I had not made the repeated effort. <br /> <br /> In an effort to save two hours of your life, I'll tell you what you plan ... a boy who has the ability to project a long sword from his arm returns home to see his mother. Things get ugly after being hit by the mafioso boyfriend of an old friend. He takes revenge on the boy when he brings the girl home. The boys' mafia mom sends his men to take revenge, while the cops also start looking for him. <br /> <br /> It is said very little. no explanation is given at all (such as why they lock up the ID bride in an asylum) and the action, for the most part, is off the screen. The film consists essentially of a guy who looks like Adrian Brody with an intense look and without saying anything, killing people (off the screen, most of the action happens off the screen). It looks good, it is well acted and if there had been some kind of reason for what is happening, it could have been a good movie. Hell, I would have liked to have a real sense of the development of the character or a background story (all we know is that the boy was chosen as a child). The film lasts almost two hours and it feels like six. If they did not tell us anything, at least they could have accelerated the pace, so it seemed that it was moving too fast. No, on the other hand, we have the hero on a ship. The hero in a bus, the hero walking, the hero looking disturbed. Hero with his girl. It really bothered me, because I think this could have been a good movie if they had just done something or if someone had said something significant other than giving instructions to "get this guy". <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10. It's about four hours (all my attempts to see this) I will never go back. Only for those who want to see a melancholic Russian action movie with very little action.
