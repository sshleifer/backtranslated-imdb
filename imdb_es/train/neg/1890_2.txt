The problem I find with this title is that I'm not sure if the director is trying to produce a documentary or a movie. A mixture of the two genres simply does not work and that leaves everything hanging in the middle of nowhere. This is more because the director has chosen the extremes of what is supposed to be happening in our daily lives, which makes it an unconvincing documentary. If it is meant to be a thriller / drama, this is too boring and monotonous. In any case, what is the moral or message that the director is trying to convey to the audience? That around us there are people who mistreat others who are willing to be mistreated? That there are many crazy fools around us? And that?
