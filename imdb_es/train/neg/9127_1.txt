['Ok so here is the basic plot. It is 1933, Peter Sellers is Dr. Fu Manchu, a 168-year-old Chinese man who has lived a long time. The film begins with his birthday in which he celebrates drinking a special elixir that (even the movie never mentions) prolongs his life. Well, on this occasion, the elixir is knocked down awkwardly by an assistant (Kato if you remember the Pink Panther movies) and orders his followers to go after 6 rare objects to make the elixir. This creates a search for men around the world in which his henchmen end up stealing from diamond museums and venturing into London, to meet the crisis of Dr. Fu, a retired Scotland Yard Nayland Smith detective, also played by vendors who They try to stop him in what is supposed to be an ingenious comic adventure. <br /><br /> Apparently this was the last film by Sellers that he made before he died. The terrible tragedy is that he was in it. Vendors who are such a talented comedian and who have had memorable &quot;fun&quot; roles in Panther movies and particularly in the movie &quot;The Party&quot;, are anything BUT in this movie. This movie was an absolute torture to sit down and I could not even finish it. He completely GOD and I kept shrinking while watching the performance of Sellers. After coming from the great work of &quot;Being there&quot; a year before, how can I do this and how was this thing done? As one person mentioned, the first 10..15 minutes are fine, but then everything is DOWN ... <br /><br /> Avoid like the plague. <br /><br /> Score 1 out of 10.']
