Life is really too short for movies like this. I knew it could not be good when I realized what I had already suspected: that David Schwimmer would play exactly the same kind of person he plays in "Amigos". <br /> <br /> Let's face it, either. The boy can not play anything other than a nerd or is never offered any other part. I have the feeling that it is a mixture of both. <br /> <br /> And I must say that it is extremely difficult for me to like a film that completely wastes the considerable talent of Gwyneth Paltrow, Barbara Hershey, Toni Collette and Carol. Kane !!!
