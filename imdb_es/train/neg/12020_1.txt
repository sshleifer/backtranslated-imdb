This was a waste of time. Danger: if you see it, you will be tempted to tear your DVD from the wall and throw it out the window. <br /> <br /> An amateur production: a terrible dialogue, repetitive and empty. trace thin as paper; wooden performances; Lucy Lawless was pathetically trite. <br /> <br /> A seriously flawed story, completely unbelievable characters. The two worst concepts in cinema and t.v. They are: (1) the evil twin, (2) amnesia. There are no twins. <br /> <br /> Does the plot "turn"? Indignantly simplistic and obvious, like seeing a train that goes down the road in the middle of the day in the meadows. It is not even solved properly. Evil is not punished for the original crime. <br /> <br /> Please, please, do not see it even if it's free and your only option is to go to a synagogue.
