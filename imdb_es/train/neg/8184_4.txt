This is almost like two movies: one literate and attractive, the other stupid and clich√©. It is really a pity that not all the problems with the writing were solved, but considering the speed with which they were written and produced most of the B films, this is not too unusual. However, it is a real shame, since this could have been a very good movie. <br /> <br /> First the good. The film is original and involves the decipherers of World War II codes. This is quite fascinating and I liked seeing the leader (Lee Bowman) go through his steps as a code decoder. In fact, the first two thirds of the movie were very good. But now, for bad, the film went on too long and lost strength in about 50 minutes. In addition, the role of Jean Rogers as the "crazy girlfriend" must be one of the worst written and distracting roles in the history of cinema. For every intelligent move made by Bowman, the idiot Rogers intervened to ruin things as a kind of "comedy relief". If his paper had been written intelligently, the film in general would have improved immensely! Instead, observing it, it is difficult to understand how we won the Second World War.
