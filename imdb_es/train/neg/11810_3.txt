I noticed with some amusement that in the final credits, the participation of the Detroit police for their participation is appreciated. The chief of police even has a speech line that touches himself (and boy, can you say he can not act)? The reason for the fun is that in this movie the police shoot first and then ask questions. It's not the kind of public relations, I think a police force would want. Apart from that, this is his standard film of cops and robbers dressed for the 70's with a racial angle. Alex Rocco is assigned the ungrateful role of a lifelong cop who can not get ahead and faces a wife with a mental illness. He makes up for it by hanging out at the local whorehouse. Hari Rhodes is his handsome partner who has a wonderful wardrobe and likes to chase the suspects while wearing a raincoat. The film advances to the penultimate shootout that does not make any sense (why do people who are only guilty of a robbery, assume an entire police force?). Not only do we see a shooting but, since there are four bad guys, we can see four. Then there is a turning end that is supposed to leave one guessing what would have really happened, but it just left me thinking that it was stupid. Seeing that director Arthur Marks was also behind the "Friday Foster" and "Bucktown", he should not have asked me.
