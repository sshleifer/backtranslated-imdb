As a writer, I find films so bad that they make a slap in the production. Talk about insults. I was writing better stories than this in 8th grade. Bad performance, bad writing, bad direction and when they all add up together, the result is complete and the total failure. <br /> <br /> The only thing this film manages to achieve is to trick the unsuspecting consumer into wasting his time. Who would give the green light to something so badly written? It is not artistic, intelligent, intelligent, suspenseful, mysterious, frightening, dramatic, NOTHING. <br /> <br /> The characters are flat and boring without development. The plot is as recycled as an aluminum can. Somehow, they managed to choose a few very familiar actors who all must be quite desperate for the job or expect one of these low budget independent films to become the next "Pulp Fiction". This script should have been used to align a bird cage, not a movie. <br /> <br /> Oh and last, but not least, a 5'2 105 lb woman of course has the strength to kill men and women twice their size without a fight and in one fell swoop. <br /> <br /> Avoid this bomb since it will infect you with an STD.
