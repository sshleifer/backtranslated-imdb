This movie is predictable; it's more predictable than a Vinnie Testaverdi pass, when he ties the ball to the Jets. One saw the ending reaching the middle of the film. Politics reminds me when I was back east. Many people know when the solution is. I gave these four due to the performance, but the story is sparse.
