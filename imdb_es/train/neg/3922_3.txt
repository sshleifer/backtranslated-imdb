Predictable parody, which almost does not impress throughout its eight minutes. The only thing that made it worthwhile was the NO COLORIZE line at the end of the credits. The shame of something more entertaining was not included in the DVD, as the nice profile of Jonathan Ross Romero in "The Incredible Strange Film Show."
