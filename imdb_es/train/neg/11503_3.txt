Quentin Crisp once said that when things are very good, one is romantic. When things are unbearably bleak, they are realistic. And when something receives the ironic treatment, it is perfect. Unfortunately for León de Aranoa, he falls into the second category. Obviously, this director has tried too much to make a movie like "Ken Loach" in Spanish, unable to capture the comedy, and the warmth between the characters, which makes Loach's films are not simply "depressing." Mondays to the Sun, it's just that, just depressing. Things are unreal dark. The last moments of misery of the characters reach a climax in the same point, and if the sad story is not enough, Aranoa washes the story with a palette of visually gray and grimy colors. The movies were ridiculously overrated in the Goyas. A film that shows empathy for the weakest citizens of society, in this case unemployed workers of the port, does not automatically generate a good movie, although it would be the first to sympathize with the destinies of these people. This film only manages to make me grow disinterested in its destiny. In 21st century Spain, unemployed people do not live like beggars, and public transport ferries have decent bathrooms, and it is difficult to find a bar with so few punters and so little happiness. Leon de Aranoa, obviously, has no idea of ​​the working class of Spain, and does him no favors. Pretentious is the only conclusion I can draw. The scene in which men watch a football game for free, has been copied directly from a film that deals much more "realistically" with the theme of the trap of "poverty", namely, "Purely Belter", which It is, by far, more interesting and fun. and yet sad.
