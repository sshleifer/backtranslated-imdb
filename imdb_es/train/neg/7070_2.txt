Boy oh boy oh golly gee, <br /> <br /> The most interesting part of the movie was the hilarity of the blue screen effects used to create the "invisibility" of mom. They seemed like they were filmed in a cheap video, and it seems totally unreal, and not even in a good way where it's so fun that you end up loving the movie ... <br /> <br /> I did not end up loving this movie The attempts of "steadicam" shots were also really pathetic. I mean, hey, if they had a low budget movie, that's fine. You can still make a great movie with a low budget. But, a bad movie and a low budget and effects. That makes for a bad combination. In this case, a combo so condemned created the craptastic movie, "Invisible Mom." If you have children, and your children do not like them, they may stay awake during all this.
