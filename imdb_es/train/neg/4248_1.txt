This film had mediocrity, laziness and lack of reflection written everywhere. If you are going to make a film about vampires that has already been done thousands of times, then it is better that you do a good job. I'll be the first to say that this movie just did not cut it. Some horror / fear films simply can not break the mold of "let's leave something forbidden and abandon it for fun, because all the stories are just lies" clich√©. This, unfortunately, was no different, and like all horror movies, once you venture down that road there is no turning back. <br /> <br /> And the end? How do the heroes do the same job over and over again throughout the film, but then they mysteriously get wrapped up in the moment and can not do the job in the end? The ending was very anti-climatic and spelled part 3 that I will never see. Terrible movie
