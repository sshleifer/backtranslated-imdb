In the last 10 years I have worked in 3 different independent wrestling organizations, I have handled many professional wrestlers (including 2 stars of wrestling in the backyard), I have worked on 2 different wrestling television programs and I have voiced Off and comments for many wrestling DVDs. I have NEVER witnessed the level of absolute amateur stupidity, lack of talent and skill, and shoddy production quality found in Splatter Rampage Wrestling. Even listing this as a wrestling video of ANY kind is a misuse of the term. Filmed with low-cost video cameras, it is essentially home-made videos of children playing in the backyards. The quality of the sound is bad, the quality of the video is bad and the performance is horrible. The "fighters" wear improvised costumes with hand-drawn T-shirts and ski masks, and they hit each other with a variety of items and almost mimic the fighting movements. Sometimes the "parties" are in the grass. Sometimes in a trampoline backyard. ALL are badly executed and executed with a blatant lack of any fighting skill. In short, do not bother with this stinker. Whether your interest in this DVD is entertainment or academic (in my case), you will be terribly disappointed.
