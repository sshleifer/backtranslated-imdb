Police in Bangville allegedly marked the debut of the Keystone Kops, which is named after the studio where they worked. In this case, however, they do not dress up in the disguises of dumb cops or drive the accelerated car that is their trademark. Anyway, Mabel Normand is a peasant who begged her father for a calf. Later he sees some strange men in the barn and quickly calls the police. One responds and the persecution is under way. Then Mabel slammed the door just as someone entered. It turns out that it is his mother who comes to the conclusion that there are thieves there. So while Mabel blocks her door with furniture, the mother and father try to break through to enter! This was perhaps the funniest part of the short film along with some explosions from the police car. It was 7 short minutes that happened so fast that it was over before we started. The only real characterization that has developed is that of Mabel, who exudes charm with only her face and big eyes and seems so optimistic and cheerful here, except, of course, when she is scared. It is easy to see why he became a star. It is largely because of her that I recommended seeing this at least once and why I give it a 4.
