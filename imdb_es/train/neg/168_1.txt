Despite a decent first season, this series never came to realize its potential. Established as a prequel to the original "Star Trek" series, it was condemned almost from the beginning by an executive producer, Rick Berman, who felt compelled to artificially limit and restrict the definition of what could be a "Star Trek" series. which made this futuristic show increasingly anachronistic from a dramatic point of view). The show's real runner, Brannon Braga, did not help matters because of his lack of inspiration and tiredness from previous episodes of Trek and the careless oversight of the franchise's internal mythology (it was painfully obvious that he was in this just for the check of payment). I have never seen a series that lasts so badly a bad service to a cast of talented actors (except Jolene Blaylock). It is as if all this series was produced in an existing bubble outside the contemporary television scene, where the public (even a public of Trekker) is more demanding and sophisticated in its dramatic desires and needs. Unfortunately, it seems as if Berman and Braga had managed to convince the Paramount high command that "Enterprise" suffered from "fatigue for the franchise" and that its main audience did not leave but was expelled. Produce a quality offer that meets the high ideals and standards of their predecessors and they (the audience) will come. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, In a TeeVee universe where we are given shows like "Battlestar: Galactica" and "The Shield" the powers must give the audience that sees it a "Star Trek" that is height and is dramatically competitive. It's that simple and easy.
