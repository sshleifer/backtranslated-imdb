This series is one of the worst shows I've seen. Terrible performance, terrible effects, terrible writing, you understand my drift. The stories are so far from the Robin Hood legend that it is amazing. It seems they just wanted to use the name Robin Hood to attract an audience. It could have been called New Adventures of Mr. Bland Acting. <br /> <br /> Someone told me that if you had imagination, you would love this show. That is a horrible approach to a television series. A visual medium like this should awaken your imagination, you should not have to force your imagination into something to make it good. That would be like the episode of The Simpsons in which they try to brainwash Homer with a religious propaganda movie, and he starts talking about who killed who or whatever. "If a movie is boring, I only invent my own story." <br /> <br /> In conclusion: Absolute human waste.
