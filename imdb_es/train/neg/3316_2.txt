This was the first Ewan McGregor movie that I saw outside of Star Wars. Since then I have become a huge fan of Ewan McGregor, but I still can not forgive the existence of this movie. <br /> <br /> My sister has always been a big fan of Jane Austen and that is why I have been subjected to several of the classics, Emma is one of them. I have always considered them irritating, stupid and boring. However, after seeing this terrible interpretation, I was forced to admit that the original Emma was charming and charming. Ewan McGregor barely has a purpose in this movie after they hacked and mutilated the role of Frank Churchill. Gweneth Paltrow is ridiculous in a ridiculous character and the rest of the movie is normal and stupid. <br /> <br /> My recommendation to anyone who is remotely interested in the drama of the English era ... go see the originals. If you're a fan of Ewan McGregor ... believe me, by skipping this movie, you have not missed anything but five minutes of him in a silly hat and a bad haircut.
