Description: Corny, absolutely stupid and worthless. It's so cheap and scarce, it will make you wonder why these abnormally stupid people wasted approximately 2 months to spend a budget (I guess this ...) probably not more than $ 700 to make this movie. It was simply hysterical to watch with or without Mystery Science Theater. I am giving you the best advice in the world: <br /> <br /> Save yourself, save time, life and money, NO. I repeat, I do not even wonder if you should watch this movie. This movie is so corny that it will make your face turn purple with indignant boredom. If you have a one-digit IQ, be my guest and see this absolutely despicable movie. Actually I could admire it. (As I said before, IF YOU HAVE a one digit CI) <br /> <br /> With approximately 12 own actors, some puppets that you bought at a garage sale and, of course, cameras and music, I guarantee you will make a home video a little more entertaining than this piece of absolute garbage.
