This movie has an interesting plot, but the acting is pretty bad and the script is poor. I was very disappointed. The moral dilemma facing the main character is intriguing, but due to poor writing and the release of this potentially winning premise, it is looted. 2 of the other 4 people in the theater left after about 45 minutes and the other 2 were laughing at how bad the movie was. I stayed until the end, but I must admit that I played Blackjack on my phone to make the last 30 minutes more bearable.
