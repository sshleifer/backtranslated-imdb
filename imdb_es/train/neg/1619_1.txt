At the beginning of the film, the beautiful photography and the scenes of the fox were incredible. However, the story was very slow and boring. And then the girl begins to tame the fox, leading to tragic events. We live in the forest, and we often see foxes. One thing that everyone should know is that you leave wild animals to be wild and enjoy them from afar. This movie gives a terrible example to children who will see it when trying to turn a wild creature into a pet. I do not know what the purpose of the story was. Even after the terrible events with the main fox, the girl still wanted to play with the kits. Does she never learn her lesson? And there are other scenes with predatory animals for the fox, which only adds to the trauma inflicted on the children who watch this movie. What a disappointment this movie was. And what a horrible story that counts. The final narrated dialogue was so stupid, for when my wife and I shouted on television! I absolutely hated this movie, and I would never recommend it to anyone!
