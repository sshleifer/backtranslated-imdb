What a total disappointment! The score of 6.1 here in IMDb generated some slight expectations, but, oh, I was disappointed. The first thing that bothers me are those stereotyped and stereotyped university students. Yes, I know that teenagers can be childish and so on, but why in movies are they always portrayed as complete idiots? There was a character that I thought was fine, but he / she (without revealing it here) was killed before the end. The other characters were badly executed and even the supposed hero / heroine just did not do it for me. On the positive side: the plot is quite good and the productions have a higher value than this type of films. The performance in general was not very good, Rutger Hauer stands out in a small role. But everything fails with the characters sosos and braindead. Just stop worrying about them after 10 minutes. 4/10 (and that's being generous).
