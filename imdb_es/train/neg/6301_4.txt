Despite the excellent work done by the supporting actors and the intelligent script of Alan Plater, this film suffers from a fatal flaw: the lack of charm of the character / central actor. One of the characters describes the character of Richard E Grant as "a little weeping witch" and unfortunately this sums it up perfectly. There is nothing about him or his performance to make it credible that his girlfriend and the editor / friend of the upper class spend so much time and emotional effort on him. He is rude, arrogant, selfish, self-destructive and completely annoying. The party asked an actor who can make you love him even when he's being a prate: an Ewan McGregor, for example. <br /> <br /> All the clever satire in the class system, etc., was wasted, thanks to this irritating and totally unpleasant performance. All he wanted to do was shake him and tell him to get over it.
