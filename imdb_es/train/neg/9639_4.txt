From time to time a new entry of foreign films is served. That is his great attraction. They take of life and serve it raw. American films rarely dare to touch the forbidden subjects of society. Too many problems and a morbid fear of financial failure. The almighty dollar determines your selections. Something that invites European directors. In addition, audiences around the world are hungry for "different" movies, especially those that offer a tasty morsel of the miserable and suffering body of humanity. Despite the fear of directors or producers, many audiences yearn for beauty, poetry and the pristine taste of life. That's what the movie "On the left of the father" offers to curious audiences. A family locked in the belief that the unity of the family is derived from the unity of its obedience to tradition. However, when the patriarch of a family is forgotten, its members are human flesh and blood, full of unbridled and unbridled dreams and dark passions, then the two are launched against themselves. Selton Mello plays Andr√©, a son who seeks to control his inner passions with the stagnant philosophy of his father. Raul Cortez plays his father. Simone Spoladore is Ana, a young girl who seeks to quench a thirst forbidden from family waters. Leonardo Medeiros is Pedro, the older brother. The movie offers a lot, but it takes an extremely messy time to say it. ***
