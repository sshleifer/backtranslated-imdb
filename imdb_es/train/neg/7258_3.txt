This grainy film has a cult following and one of those mouth-to-mouth features you just saw. It may be hard to believe, but there is a rural community in southwestern Arkansas, Fouke, who knows that the legend is true. This story is told in a documentary style narrated by Vern Stierman and filmed in real places talking to real people involved. The legend changes with the story, but during the late 60's and most of the 70's, Fouke's surrounding area was visited by a Bigfoot-like creature that traveled through Boggy Creek. With long legs with three toes and more than 7 feet tall, this shaggy creature periodically damaged and frightened the "bejeebers" of the majority of the community. I personally crossed the little Boggy Creek bridge in 1974, and yes, the hair on the back of my neck got up. Of course it was around 1 a.m. in the rain. When I got to Shreveport, I was laughing.
