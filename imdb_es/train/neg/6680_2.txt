Wow, what a sleeper. Definitely one of the worst bacon movies. The bad performance, along with a script of formula, if not incredulous, makes me long for the time I lost watching this on cable television. I really can not say much about it, a basketball scout gets too attached to the person who is recruiting, who belongs to a tribe that is on the verge of war and who decides to play a basketball game (spoiler). Grade: F +
