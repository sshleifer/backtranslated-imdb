The saddest thing about this "tribute" is that almost all the singers (including the incredibly talented Nick Cave) seem to have missed the point where Cohen's intensity is: by delivering his lines in an air almost without harmony, Cohen transmits all the scope. of his poetry, his irony, his complete humanity, laughter and tears in one. <br /> <br /> To see some of these addicted singers make faces of twisted suffering, throw their pathetic screams in the obvious effort to shout "I'm a singer", it's a real pain. It's the same feeling that many of you probably heard some horrific operatic versions of simple songs like "Imagine" by Lennon. Nothing, simply nothing is close to the simplicity and frankness of the original. If there is an art form that does not need ornaments, it is Cohen's art. The ornaments threw him into the street like the nasty sex makeup for sale. <br /> <br /> In this tribute to Cohen, I found myself suffering and suffering through lamentable tributes and horrible reinterpretations, all lacking the original. The irony of the maestro and, if the truth is told, several of these singers sounded as if they had been recruited in some asylum talent show. Cohen is doing a tribute to them by letting them sing their material, in reality, not the other way around: they may have been friends, or those of their daughter, they could have become very tender and wanting a gift. Too bad he did not stay in the family. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, but only at the end, Cohen himself made his majestic "Tower of the song", but even that flower was spoiled by the totally incongruous background. of the U2, all of them with the expression that boring children have when they visit their poor grandfather in the nursing home. <br /> <br /> A sad, really, and sadder show if you really love Cohen as I do.
