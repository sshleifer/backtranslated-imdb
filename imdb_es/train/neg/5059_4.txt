If you want to see a movie about two completely unfriendly characters, this is the only one. The performance is magnificent, both John Cassavetes and the crazy paranoiac who, as the saying goes, REALLY HAVE TO COME, and Peter Falk as his lifelong best friend whom he resorts to in search of rescue. Big mistake, but since both are amoral mobsters and misogynistic bastards to boot, it is difficult to decide who to encourage LESS. Only writer / director Elaine May could have got away with it. I found it interesting that in a long interview with producer Michael Hausman included in the DVD, he revealed that the two stars had "very different ideas" about the script, that it was almost impossible to work with the director, that the director of photography had they made impossible demands, that the crew was constantly angry about being made to wait, and so on. This state of mind of a very dysfunctional large family appears clearly on the screen.
