First of all, what's so good about the movie? A pretty actress? The exotic background? The fact that the actors do not laugh while they act (what would they have done if they had been in their situation)? I do not know. The story is simple: a catholic priest who does abstract painting tries to find out who (another abstract painter) killed his little brother, a prostitute (raped by another priest when he was young ...). I'm afraid there's nothing here to learn or stop thinking a little about serial killers, art or religion. Dennis Hopper is not very good here. This is the worst episode of the worst "profiler" season (the series) with incredible replacement actors and coincidences (the uncle is the policeman who, the girl who lives in the house of another victim could have a baby with the priest, etc etc).
