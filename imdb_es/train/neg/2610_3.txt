102 DALMATICS [Walt Disney]: I was not a fan of the previous installment and this effort has all the weaknesses of the first, a stupid and quilted, terrible story about the performance of Glenn Close, who ruins each scene as if he were playing for his own fun, and the main actors incredibly rendered and uninteresting. Once again, dogs are the only "actors" that seem "real" and that is a stretch. Another wasted effort here. GRADE: D
