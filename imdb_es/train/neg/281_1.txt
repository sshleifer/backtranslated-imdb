Horrible, just horrible. It demonstrates my theory about the "power of the stars". This is supposed to be a great television because the guy who directed (battlestar) Titanica is the same one who directed this shlop schtock schtick on a girl. B O R I N G. <br /> <br /> Find something a thousand times more interesting to do, like watching your TV without images and without sound. 1/10 (I rated it so high b / c there are no negative ratings in the IMDb.com rating system). <br /> <br /> -Zaphoid <br /> <br /> PS: My theory about "star power" is: the more "star power" is used in a show, the weaker the show. (Indirect proportionality is called: quality 1 / "star power", less "sp" makes it of better quality, etc. Another way of looking at it is: "more is less"). <br /> <br /> - Z
