The intention that the directors have for these films is quite honorable, but their history of their productions made me realize that this could not reach the nucleus as other filmmakers would. taking into account his great 30-day TV series, but also counting on his MTV production "I Bet You'll Do It" that opposes his seriousness in any of the issues he documents and also counting on his rather disappointing production "Supersize Me". wait up high Unfortunately, this movie disappointed me, nonetheless. As with "Supersize me", after a while I asked myself what exactly was the point of all this. the main statement becomes clear enough after half an hour, but the rest of the game time is filled with rather useless things and repetition of things that were already shown this way or another previously in the movie, so it wears out and It becomes extremely boring towards the end.
