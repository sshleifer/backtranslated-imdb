What is the point of creating sequels that have absolutely no relevance to the original movie? Has no sense. This is the reason why the sequels of Prom Night are so shamefully bad. <br /> <br /> The original film involved a group of children hiding a dark secret that would eventually kill them all, except one, in a brutal act of revenge. Can someone, please explain to me what a future dead queen of the graduation dance from the tomb to the steel that the crown has to do with the first film has to do? Prom Night 2 had continuous holes in the plot that left the audience constantly wondering how this happened and why that should happen. But in the end, I think you could call it one of those movies that is so bad, you end up laughing at yourself.
