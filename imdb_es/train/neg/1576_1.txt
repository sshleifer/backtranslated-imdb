this movie has it all; the skillful camera work, reminiscent of martin scorcese or oliver stone, the tense action of 'heat', the explosive action of a jerry bruckheimer movie, the witty dialogue of a tarantino script and the epic feeling of saying 'the godfather' <br /> <br /> The character of the judge's reinhold shows a fiery temperememt, but it also shows depth and real emotional intensity. His performance reminds me of the performance of Robert De Niro by Jake la Motta in Raging Bull. <br /> <br /> The action scenes are really impressive, not since Bullit has a movie with such high octane and stylish car scenes. Special effects push the limits of technology and film to its limits. Independence Day set the standard that this film has clearly equaled, and exceeded greatly. <br /> <br /> in general, excellent performance from your list of actors (like a list of invitations to oscars night parties!), class locations, exciting action, and a tight script.
