"Handsome guys with bad haircuts!" "Beautiful girls without any clue !!" "Stupid gangsters who can not shoot straight!" From Dragon Dynasty comes the drama of Hong Kong gangsters "Dragon Heat" For reasons that will probably always be completely hidden, production and casting require this film of 'criminals on steroids' that somehow made Maggie Q and Michael Biehn they will register as villains. But they do not have much to do in this horrible slug festival. <br /> <br /> They are two of the best contemporary actors, each with their own resume and list of achievements, and Biehn in particular, has had the courage to take on some rather challenging and non-heroic roles. <br /> <br /> Maggie Q was the super bad "Mai" in "Live Free Or Die Hard", so it is not said. <br /> <br /> Biehn is, of course, famous for being the soldier of the future who made "The Terminator" in 1984 such a credible science fiction / fantasy game, facing Big Arnold, which is now the Governor of California !! <br /> <br /> Michael Biehn is almost completely lost in this terrible train crash of a police drama. There is absolutely no reason for that, since the incredibly complicated plot, given mainly in Chinese, since it is a Hong Kong story, could have been better elaborated for non-Chinese audiences with a foreign narrator. <br /> <br /> In other words, if Biehn had been used as something like an observer or Interpol coordinator, or a covered agent, who needs to be given a little "splaining" every five or ten minutes , that would have been great. But no, it has been incorporated as part of a strange group of bad guys from special forces who seem to be freelancing in their own corrupt deal, in the middle of another person's totally corrupt agreement that involves the local king of corrupt deals. <br /> <br /> Yes, there, I said everything. Confused? I also. "Welcome to the party, friend." <br /> <br /> In Hong Kong's truly excellent crime drama, known for its English title as "Breaking news", there are also several fascinating characters at work, but it's just a story in the plot. <br /> <br /> Bad guys against good cops. In this unfortunate and excessively violent foray into the world of a Hong Kong triad or gang, it seems that the aggressive police force is little more than a parade of ducks in a shooting gallery, the way criminals cut them. Then, as is logical, there is an almost incomprehensible scene (in fact, several scenes), where the children try to shoot the wooden ducks in an arcade game to win prizes of stuffed animals. And so the good and hot guys' police officers intervene naturally in his name, so the owner of the game room has to give up the Kewpie dolls. <br /> <br /> There is also an unenthusiastic attempt to create a "love interest" between one of the "visiting police officers" and the only female "visiting police". <br /> <br /> The visiting police officers are supposed to be important witnesses against the gangster leader of the Triad, who is kidnapped on the way to his appearance before the court, but not by his own team but by the mercenaries (Biehn , Maggie Q and some others). All these killers want something, but we can not learn what it is, until the end of the movie! That was a stupid mistake in general history. <br /> <br /> You can not create suspense in a criminal drama without something to get, or get, or get away from, being introduced very early in the story. <Br /> <br /> Add to that some "clipped scenes" made for purely artistic purposes, which show the recent past of the bad guys and the bad guys, and any movie buff can easily understand why this barking dog gets a rating of 1 of this fan of all cinematographic things with criminals and conspirators and Hong Kong.
