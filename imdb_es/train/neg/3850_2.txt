I saw this movie in SXSW with the assistance of the director. A good number of people left, and the audience could barely muster a nice round of applause at the end. Of the 60 or 70 films I've seen at this festival, Frownland is among the worst. <br /> <br /> At 106 minutes, it is at least 95 minutes too long. You can see the unsuccessful and prolonged communication attempts of the main character, in prolonged real time. The same grimaces, movements of the hand over the mouth, words and kinetic syllables and frantically repeated over and over and over: WE OBTAIN THE POINT. <br /> <br /> A site actually compares this work with Mike Leigh. What drugs would you have to be on to make that statement? Since Frownland is a song by Captain Beefheart, maybe you should be able to enjoy the replica of the trout mask in the heavy rotation to appreciate this movie. Incredibly, this won a jury prize at the festival. You can bet he did not win an audience award.
