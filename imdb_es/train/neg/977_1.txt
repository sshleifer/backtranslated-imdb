"Fever Pitch" is not a bad movie; It is a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> Is it possible that the audiences and critics of American films are so numbed and lobotomized by the excrement that Hollywood produces that they praise the skies, even a mediocre movie with little laughs? That's the only reason I can think why this horrible romantic comedy (and I use that term lightly because there's nothing funny about this movie) is getting good reviews. <br /> <br /> I sat through this movie amazed that screenwriters Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel would even think for a moment that their script was fun. <br /> <br /> The brilliant Nick Hornby usually translates well into film. Adapted "Fever Pitch" for a British film starring Colin Firth and Ruth Gemmell in 1997; Peter Hedges found Hornby's voice for "About a Boy" (2002) and when "High Fidelity" was Americanized in a movie in 2000, writers D.V. DeVincentis, Steve Pink, John Cusack and Scott Rosenberg were not wrong because they kept the essence of Hornby's wit and humor. They did one of the best movies of that year. <br /> <br /> So, why is the American version of "Fever Pitch" going so badly? The British version was not a masterpiece, but it was charming, fun, unexpected and gave us two characters that we might like, respect and understand. <br /> <br /> But Ganz and Mandel have eliminated all the funny things about Hornby's work. In the Americanization of history, they have massacred it, eliminating all that was good and unique about Hornby's work and replacing it with conventional nonsense. <br /> <br /> They have transformed a funny story into a romantic formula comedy, never once deviating from the miserable formula. Lindsey (Drew Barrymore) has three friends, each of whom has a different role. One is overweight, the second is cynical and ambitious, and the third is romantic. Do you want to guess how many male friends does Ben (Jimmy Fallon) have? <br /> <br /> What made "High Fidelity" so much fun was not only a good protagonist, but also supporting characters. In this "Fever Pitch", the six support friends do not do or say anything especially funny. They are so insignificant, they are not even decorative. The only reason they are in the movie is because the formula demands it. Poor Ione Skye ends up as Lindsey's friend in an ungrateful role. The lovely Skye must have been wishing that Lloyd Dobler would rush and take her away. Come to think of it, Cusack would have been an excellent Ben. Of course, Cusack is too smart to join such a tedious script. <br /> <br /> There is not a single moment in this movie that seems original or not forced. Every turn of the plot is predictable, every joke lame telegraphed. Ganz and Mandel work to laugh. The first 45 minutes are so terribly slow that one wonders if these guys realized they were writing a comedy. You can mark the turns of the plot in this movie by your watch. It's almost as if Ganz and Mandel wrote this with the formula of a screen writing guru taped to the wall. When they reached a certain page, they looked at the formula and said: "Okay, the guru says this has to happen now." And ready! <br /> <br /> Directors Bobby and Peter Farrelly do not help the film. They have no idea how to present their story and their characters (they deliver the VO narration not to the protagonist, but to another guy who sits behind Ben in Fenway Park). Thanks to an extremely awkward writing, we have to see Barrymore and Fallon stumble through their initial little fun meetings. <br /> <br /> Barrymore makes him cute and adorable better than most. She is as good at that as Goldie Hawn is at its peak. But even his tenderness can not save this extraordinarily horrible movie. She struggles to get some energy and humor out of this story. About 30 minutes into the movie, Lindsey tells Ben: "You're funny." The only explanation for his comment is that it was in the script. For Fallon's Ben, he never says anything even remotely funny. Fallon is neither witty nor funny; when he does comedy, he exaggerates. <br /> <br /> Fallon was never good on "Saturday Night Live". Possibly he was the least fun person in that program. Remember that sketch about a radio DJ who made all the voices? The only reason "Weekend Update" worked occasionally was because Fallon's cohort, Tina Fey, knows one or two things about comedy. <br /> <br /> The actors who think they are funny and behave that way rarely, if ever, are. Actually fun That's true of Fallon. He thinks he's hysterically funny when he barely giggles. His stuttering trick, unsure of himself, did not work on the small screen; It's weirder on the big screen. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately for Fallon, his role in this image also requires some dramatic moments. If you thought your comedy was bad, wait until you have a lot of your dramatic material. Two scenes in particular, the first in a park, the second in front of Ben's school, are painful to watch. The scenes require an actor with a bit of dramatic ability, but Fallon does not have the knowledge or ability to make them work. His range of emotions does not even cover the range from A to B. <br /> <br /> Ben has no personality or depth. Often, he introduces himself as a oaf. And not an adorable one in that. He is surprised what Lindsey would find attractive to him. Compare Fallon's performance to Firth's in the British version, and you'll understand how terribly flat, fun and forced Ben de Fallon is and how wrong he is with this role. Seeing Fallon in "Fever Pitch" extends the dramatic depth and comedic nuance of Ashton Kutcher! <br /> <br /> As "High Fidelity" did, an Americanized "Fever Pitch" might have worked brilliantly. I just needed better writers, more competent directors and, definitely, a stronger, more fun and smarter leader. Do yourself a big favor: avoid this rotten movie; Rent the British version of 1997 and read Hornby's book.
