Although the title may suggest examples of the 10 commandments, it is a definitively incorrect assumption. This is an adaptation of 9 seemingly unrelated stories from the fourteenth-century "Decameron" collection of Giovanni Bocaccio. <br /> <br /> Located in the predominantly rural town of an Italian medieval city, it is a diatribe about the reality of sex (and its consequences) within that world and time. A realistic view of life within this world, sometimes feels like a journey through time. <br /> <br /> Given the human element represented of its time, you can also see the more adventurous side of morality in its protagonists: as well as the ironies of life, sometimes. Or it can also be seen as a general satire of the rules of the Catholic Church. <br /> <br /> Nothing terribly special, but definitely interesting if one comes without expectations or assumptions.
