Can he say to himself, "Don Johnson as Elvis? Can it work? Is it possible?" It seems like a terrible choice, but maybe I should have an open mind, maybe I'll be surprised. br /> <br /> NO! <br /> <br /> Don Johnson is not a bad actor. But it's a horrible Elvis. He is too short, he has a voice too weak, he is very well presented ... well, you have already imagined how bad it would be. Add to that a black hokey wig and an eyeliner and heavy hand mascara, and it's a big embarrassing mess. <br /> <br /> The best I can say is that since Johnson's performance is decent and his impersonation is far away, after a while, you do not even think of him as Elvis anymore. You see him as another pop star instead. Then, at that level, the film becomes visible. <br /> <br /> Stephanie Zimbalist is also not ideally chosen as the tall and beautiful beauty queen, Linda Thompson. But she is attractive in her own right and plays the role with the honesty, elegance and intelligence we expect from all her roles. There may be too much intelligence in his performance. You have to be a kind of drug to continue with a drug that abuses drugs. <br /> <br /> There is nothing new in this story; We've heard it many times before. If you are looking for new information or information, you will not find it. It is told as a love story, unrequited: Linda for Elvis and Elvis for drugs.
