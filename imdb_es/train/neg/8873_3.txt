Did someone stop to realize what kind of movie they were producing here? Now, let a former naval officer be assigned to a group of children in a cadet school, so this should be a family comedy, right? Incorrect . This is just a crude comedy aimed at teenagers with many moments of bad taste. It could have been observed in an extremely foolish way at the moment, but the voice of Damon Wayans seemed irritating to me beyond belief. Do you talk like this in real life? If he does, then he has my sympathy, but he will not get any of my money when he sees his films.
