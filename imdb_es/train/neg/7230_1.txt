I love science fiction, I am fascinated by Egyptian mythology and I appreciate digital animation. I thought that a movie that combines these three would be at least nice. I could not have been more wrong: the story (or the lack of it) was completely lacking in inspiration and lacks imagination, while imagination is often the most important component of any science fiction story. Dialogue and acting are even worse than in an average porn movie. Especially Thomas Kretschmann gives a new meaning to the term "poor performance". The bad performance would not have been a big problem if the 'director' Bilal did not take himself so seriously; All the lines sound like they are supposed to be poetic, it seems that Bilal really thinks he has made a work of art here. Well, there is no art or poetry in this piece of scrap, just pretension! This man should really devote himself to making comics, since he fails in all possible accounts as a director. Worst of all is the terrible digital animation, which is so ugly that it actually turns this movie into a physically painful experience. The graphics look so fake that they even make the werewolves in 'Van Helsing' look like live actors! And since half of the characters are animated by CGI, it is a big problem that the effects of CGI look so false. If the Egyptian gods really exist, then Bilal is a dead man, since they will no doubt take revenge on him for the ridiculous way in which he portrays them in this disastrously bad movie.
