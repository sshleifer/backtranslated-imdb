This is your typical Priyadarshan movie: a bunch of crazy characters on a silly mission. His signature climax has the entire cast of the film coming together and fighting each other in some crazy moshpit for hidden money. Whether it's a winning lottery ticket in Malamaal Weekly, black money in Hera Pheri, "kodokoo" in Phir Hera Pheri, etc., the director is becoming ridiculously predictable. Do not get me wrong Because of the clich√© and absurdity of your films, I usually end up enjoying comedy. However, in most of his previous films there has actually been some good humor, (Hungama and Hera Pheri are notable). Now, the hilarity of his films is fading, as he uses the same formula over and over again. <br /> <br /> The songs are good. Tanushree Datta looks amazing. Rajpal Yadav is irritating, and Tusshar is not much better. Kunal Khemu is fine, and Sharman Joshi is the best.
