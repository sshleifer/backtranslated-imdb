I just watched this movie on TV and I have to admit I was a little surprised that it was on. There were so many mistakes, messiness and bad editing that an old episode of Sesame Street would have been better to see. The performance was fine, but please, you can really feel the "Direct to the video" feeling. The cast / crew made this movie a bad melodrama. Yes, there is a message in the movie, but wait until ten minutes before the end to listen to it. Trust me, you would not even tell the difference.
