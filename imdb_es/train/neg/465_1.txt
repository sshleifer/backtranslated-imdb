When I was in the movie store the other day, I let Blonde and Blonder in, but it seemed like something could be a nice movie. Who knows? I mean, I'm sure most people attacked Romy and Michelle before they saw it, Blonde and Blonder could have been another secret treasure that had passed. But when I started watching it: executive producer Pamela Anderson, wow, I knew something was waiting to scare me. Not only that, but both were what was considered the pinnacle of warmth: Pam Anderson and Denise Richards, not to offend them, but they were not aging well at all and they are playing roles that I think were more suitable for women than what are. They're supposed to be in their 20's, not their 40's. The story was simply bad and unpleasant. <br /> <br /> Dee and Dawn are your stereotypes of blond stereotypes, they really have no idea what's going on in the world, it's really sad. But when girls are confused in some way with murderous assassins, the police are in their history and they are really calling the girls geniuses because of their attitudes of "ignorance is a joy". They are set up to make a "blow" to a boy, and they think that they are only going to "show him a good time", but the real murderer is marked and wants the case and to kill the girls. <Br /> <br /> Denise and Pam look very clumsy on the screen and almost as if they read the script the day before. I know this was supposed to be a stupid comedy, but it was more than stupid, it became hateful and it was simply unnecessary. Would you ever recommend this? Not in a million years, girls are just at this point trying to maintain their status as "sex kittens", it is more a sign of desperation and Blonde and Blonder is a great blonde BOMBshell. <br /> <br /> 1/10
