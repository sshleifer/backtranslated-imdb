Was it a thriller, as I thought when I saw the cover in the video library? No. Was it a "food that was thought" maybe the author was maybe trying to do it? Not really. So, what was it? It was a very normal movie, which had great potential and was well directed, but disappointed by a confusing story with no strong points, starting in the middle and the end, with a deficient performance of the character of the serial killer, who although seemed too enthusiastic at times. He delivered the best performance of the cast in general. It was a good photograph, with good colors, great high-tech things, beautiful landscapes, but it leaves you without knowing where you are going and where you have just been. And with the feeling that we're going to wrap it up quickly at the end. It's fine to see if there's nothing else on TV.
