It seemed to me that the Darkness was too DARK. I had a kind of great idea and some ambitious ideas, not bad action scenes and a few flashy moments to make you go! BUT, it was subalt to the point of confusion. You really do not know what is always happening in the dark scenes and for a movie that was filmed in Super 8 Film, you already have all that nasty grain with which to deal. As with Nathan Schiff's films, it's too much. The director Leif Jonker seems to want to make an original film, but he lacks the knowledge to do it. The camera never points to the right place, the lack of foundations, such as how to shoot simple dialogue scenes and how to light a movie, too. The actors are all quite uneven and hammy. But despite these negative aspects, the music is good, the gore is abundant and ranges from fools to really good devices. Is this a classic as it says? Is it worthy of the two albums worthy of praise? DO NOT. But it's a good first try. Now, if these guys stopped giving themselves a pat on the back on this movie (from what I understand here, the only one they have finished) for a while and try again, they may do it better.
