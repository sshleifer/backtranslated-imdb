I totally hated the movie. I was so delayed. They need to get some acting lessons ... no, wait, that will not help because the Naked Brothers band is a delay. Do you know why I'm here even though I'm a Naked Brothers Band fan? Warn people before they see the silly movie so that the NBB does not receive money from it, so they can not do more stupid amateur songs that are so late that any older person can write them in 10 seconds. Not only are the lyrics of the songs delayed, but they are sung badly. Well, I'm coming out of the movie ... anyway, it was boring and they acted horribly. It was NOT fun at all, even though they made a great effort to make it so. I guess they deserve some credit for that ... well, the movie is not worth it. Just look at your rating. The movie (and the series) is very painful to watch for anyone who has even half a brain. Seriously, if you liked it, you should go see movies in which the actors act, do not stammer your lines in a monotonous tone. I'm in the theater club at my school and some people there are BETTER than the guys from Nat and Alex. Hurry before it's too late! I seriously thought that Herbie Fully Loaded was better than this piece of poopie. I do not even know why I went through the middle of that movie. I do not think it deserves to be called a movie ...
