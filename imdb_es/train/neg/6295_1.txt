Suffice it to say that, in spite of the strange ridiculous panegyric of their "skills" concealed here, the director of this inept, odious tosh, has not made a film since then. Well, that's excellent news for me. <br /> <br /> Dead Babies has all the bile of its creator, but it lacks the ingenuity and technical skill that make Martin Amis a readable novelist. <Br /> <br /> When will the British film industry wake up and realize that if it wants to regain the status it once had, it should stop producing garbage in this way and do something that people would really want to see? <br /> <br /> Avoid like the plague.
