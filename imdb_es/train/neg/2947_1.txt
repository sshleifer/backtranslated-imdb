There have been very few movies that I have not been able to see. I did it through Battle Field Earth without any problem. But this, this is one of the worst movies ever made. I understand that Whoopi Goldberg tried to take action. I do not blame her. I would feel embarrassed to have this on a resume. I think it's a rare occasion in which almost all the arcades of a movie fall flat on their face. Well, here it happens. Not to mention the SFX, look for the dino with the control cables hanging from its back! In the middle of the movie I was still looking for a plot. I never found one. Save yourself the trouble of renting this and save 90 minutes of your life.
