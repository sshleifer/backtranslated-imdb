I wish I could give this film a zero, or even less, because unfortunately that's what it deserves. Honestly, I never get out of a movie, but it was so terrible that I could not take it another minute. Please, please, for the good of humanity, skip this movie. If you want a lesbian movie in which you can really go deep, this is not all. <br /> <br /> It has unattractive, unattractive clues, ragged structure, ridiculous dialogue, and is absolutely unconvincing in every conceivable way. . On an absolutely basic level, you can not entertain. Everything related to "Mango Kiss" is so stepped that it is A LOT of any student movie that I have seen. <br /> <br /> As if it were not enough, the whole movie is based on the constant voice (and I mean CONSTANT) on the narration. The screenwriter may also have written a novel, because they insisted on TELLING EVERYTHING, instead of SHOWING IT. We are supposed to assume that Lou and Sassafras are best friends and have a special connection, although there is no character development to illustrate this. In addition, this film continues introducing new characters after the first five minutes, and not in a natural way, but in a frozen frame of the characters with their name written on the screen. There is no introduction, there is no development of any of the characters. We do not really know any of them. <br /> <br /> This is the most amateur movie I've seen. <br /> <br /> I am a gay woman, I saw this movie with my roommate (another gay woman) and we both found that this movie is a depressing representation of queer cinema. I'm starting to think that gay and lesbian movies are very similar to Christian rock: no matter how atrocious it is, people will continue to come to him and defend him, no matter how bad the quality is. Please do not rent this! Instead, let's encourage the production of gay and lesbian QUALITY movies by renting "But I'm a Cheerleader" or "Fire" or "Heavenly Creatures", instead of swallowing any nonsense that targets the gay community ( that is, Queer as Folk).
