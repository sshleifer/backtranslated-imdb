With a title like that, it's beyond my comprehension how this movie did not attract me. Of course, there are some moments of poor quality and a bit of gore, but the way the film was filmed and the general story seemed like an idiotic and lazy attempt at profuse tactics of "shock" ... The inconsistent plot begins with A boy raping and murdering a woman stranded on the side of the road. He and his enticing brother are imprisoned until the brother bursts and prepares to meet his girlfriend in the forest. He ends up forcing her to enter a house where they get fucked and later shows him a collection of guys kidnapped in the basement. The heavily drugged captives consist of her old boyfriend who raped her, a neighbor "caught" and her sexually aggressive boss. He explains that he is going to kill them all. She ends up killing him and then focusing on the men (or pigs) she tortures and kills, herself ... Most of the violence and humiliation has to do with eating and destroying the genitals, all of which is far away. Of disturbing and essentially soft. The best scene is a graphic masturbation with a broom handle followed by a painful violation ... Surely, "I spit on your body, IP! Ss in your grave" was conceived as an unofficial sequel to "I spit in your grave" - based on, mainly the title and a reference given by the main character, suggesting that his mother was Camille Keaton. Personally I consider it a tremendously blasphemous statement! This movie is a boring and amateur mess that fights for the commotions but that failed miserably ...
