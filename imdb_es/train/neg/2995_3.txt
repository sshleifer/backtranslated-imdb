Only in a very rare occasion, an episode of the x files does not generate any emotion or the episode contains something that is totally boring to watch. A detective and his former partner die in unexplained circumstances. The deaths are related to the presence of a little girl who was there when the deaths occurred. Mulder devised a theory according to which a policeman killed by his colleagues has reincarnated as the child and is demanding revenge. It has no connection and seems to be just a random person chosen as the reincarnation. I think this was a bit lazy on the part of the writers and this episode ranks as one of the worst in the history of the x files!
