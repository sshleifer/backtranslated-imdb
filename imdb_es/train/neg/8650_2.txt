If it were not for a naive and immature idiot, I insist on seeing this "documentary" I would never have seen this comedy! This movie is full of bad scripts and laughable moments. One in particular is where the Afghan police / soldiers arrest Don Larson for filming in the streets while allowing the cameraman to continue filming his arrest and then walking away, still filming, probably to his luxurious hotel. Then there is the scene in which a car collides with another that has been overturned and parked very well on the side of the road with no evidence of a collision or explosion. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised at this. Currently it has the rating it has (5.8 / 10). I thought that IMDb users made more sense.
