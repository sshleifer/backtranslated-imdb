I remembered this program from when I was a child. I could not remember too much about it, just some minor things about the characters. For some reason I remembered that it was very intense. It was also turned on really early in the morning in PA. Finally, after looking around the web for a long time, I found an episode. The first episode no-less. Criminey! This show was so horrible. It was obviously made to show the children playing the lazer label and having a great time. the show begins with bhodi li telling his mom "I'm not Christopher, I'm bhodi li-PHOTON WARRIOR !!!!!" then we are forced to see the children who play the label lazer with the song "foot loose". And not just a little bit quickly, but the whole song. ahhhhhhhhh my brain hurts just thinking about it. Oh yes, and as if it could not get worse, you can not even see the laser beams of your weapons. It's as if they were just running around the whole song "loose foot". Later, after Bhodi climbs into space or wherever, they have a laser gun fight in Phil Collins' song "su-su-sudio". Oh, trust me, you do not want to know the rest. What can I say ...... THE LIGHT SHINES !!!!!!!!!!!
