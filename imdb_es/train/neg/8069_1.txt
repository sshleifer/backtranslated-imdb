An incoherent mess with a soundtrack that is terribly deafening, "Soul Survivors" is the latest entry in the horror film genre "Who is dead and who is alive". Two teenage couples, Sean and Cassie and Matt and Annabel, prepare to go to different universities, but before separating until Thanksgiving, attend a last party at a rave party in a church burned at the suggestion of Luscious Annabel horny (Eliza Dushku, also known as Faith, the other vampire killer). Spooky, unmotivated kids start paying too much attention to Cassie (the generic Melissa Sagemiller) for reasons that are never explained, and in no time, the quartet leaves the party. Driving away in their SUV, they are chased and then passed by the creepy guys without motives, who quickly and inexplicably do an intentional 180 in the middle of the road, causing an unpleasant and fatal accident when the SUV turns on an embankment and it sinks into a river. Sean is killed (or is he?), And Cassie spends the rest of the movie dealing with loneliness and guilt (she was driving) when she is not being chased by Sean's ghost or pursued by those creepy guys without motives. There follows an inexplicable incoherence as Cassie's mental state degenerates further, until we reach the predictable conclusion. So who is dead and who is alive? After ninety minutes of this purgatory, who cares?
