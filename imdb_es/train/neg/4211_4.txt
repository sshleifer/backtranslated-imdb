About 4 years ago, I liked this movie. I would watch it again and again. But now ... I do not. Actually, I think this movie would have been great for Mystery Science Theater 3000. It has a lot of actors with heavy comments (Macaulay Culkin, Christopher Lloyd, Patrick Stewart, Whoopi Goldberg) and a pretty corny plot. My favorite part is when Culkin is riding his bike and meets a gang and a gang member says, "Hey, Tyler, where are you going? THE MOON?" Also look for the classic line, "Do you have sensation in your toes?" <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it is better than "The good son".
