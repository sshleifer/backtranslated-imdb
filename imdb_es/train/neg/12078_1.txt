I literally fell asleep 3 times watching this movie. Of course, it is Shakespeare and that requires a certain mentality to be interested or not. But this film overcomes any barrier of long soliloquies and, what does not, can prevent many from simply not worrying about a Shakespeare-based story. <br /> <br /> The biggest obstacle to this production is the complete plain of the characters. Often, during character interaction, it is almost difficult to distinguish who's lines are. Of course, I think this movie is dubbed in English. Certainly, they could have obtained voice actors that could have added a little more drama to these classic literary lines. <br /> <br /> It would be difficult to rate this movie above 1, although maybe it is based on prejudices Maybe old and what would seem a very low budget. Still, it's absolutely painful and boring. If you insist on Hamlet, do yourself a favor and go back and read the book. 1/10
