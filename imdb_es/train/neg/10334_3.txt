A story of incredible disinterest kills "The Psychic" over and over again. The characters and the plot are completely uninteresting (as is Fulci's angry camera work, which is often a redeeming factor in his films), and no suspicion of suspense can be found. It has been completed to an unbearable degree: in the end, you will not be crying out in excitement, but with boredom (and, like me, maybe an uncontrollable urge to fall asleep). The performance of Jennifer O'Neill deserves occupation in a better movie. Beware the gorehounds Fulci: there is not much to do in "The Psychic". <br /> <br /> 3/10
