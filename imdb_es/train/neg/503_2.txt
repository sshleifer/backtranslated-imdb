After an initial release of 4 very good Eurotrash titles, REDEMPTION has managed to scrape the bottom of the barrel with THE BLOODSUCKER LEADS THE DANCE. I did not find any Bloodsuckers anywhere in this movie. <br /> <br /> The story is simple. A mysterious earl invites several actresses to his castle for a small vacation. After some sexual antics, the girls are beheaded one by one. Who is the murderer? Who knows? There are more false leads in this than in the local fish market on Friday. <br /> <br /> The pace is unbearable. The story is silly and the fur scenes are not so great either. <br /> <br /> Make this opportunity miss.
