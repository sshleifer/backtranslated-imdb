OK now, let's see. What was funny in the first movie? I know, people with funny accents, people who fall in the water, stupid boat crashes and funny comments between the two teams. In this movie they have twisted the accent part to the maximum, it is not good. A lot of people are falling into the water for uncertain reasons, it's not good. Boatcrash, check. Funny comments between the two teams, they tried but failed. In addition, there are also many personalities that are following in this movie. This movie should be about what is happening in the water, not on the ground. I regret to say that there is too much distance between the funny parts and the sponsors of the film are exploited to the fullest. Not good. In general, I give it four out of ten, since it has some fun parts.
