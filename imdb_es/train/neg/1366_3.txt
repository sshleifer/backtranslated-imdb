** CONTAINS SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> The truly exquisite Sean Young (who in some scenes, with his hair up, looks like Elizabeth Taylor) is surprising in his early moments in this film. Sitting in the back of a police car waiting to point to a bust, her face and body are tense and distracted. Unfortunately, once the bust is over, Young's tense behavior never changes. This is an actress fatally inhibited. <br /> <br /> One only has to compare Young to the actor who plays his co-worker and best friend, Arnetia Walker, to understand what's missing from Young. Walker is open, emotional and calm at all times ... in the sense that there is no apparent barrier between what she can feel and her expression. She is an open book. Young, on the other hand, acts in the carefree and timid way that one might expect his neighbor to act if he were suddenly to star in a movie. Basically, she has no idea. <br /> <br /> With this great void that looms in the center of the film, they let us reflect on the implausibility of history. For example, after Miss Young is abducted by the criminal she is following and locked in a closet, she breaks the door when she is alone. Granted, she is dressed only in a bra and panties, but in a similar situation, with a psycho-captor who will return at any time, would you go to the door ... or take the time to check her dresser, get some clothes? And get dressed? I suppose this and other scenes are trying to suggest some kind of mixed emotions that Miss Young's character is experiencing, but Young can not convey this kind of complexity. <br /> <br /> There are some moments that affect the movie. , like the short interviews of the police with the past victims of the criminal, but in general this is an aimless effort. It's a shame that Miss Young was replaced while filming a couple of comic-style movies that might have exploited her limitations with some humor (BATMAN and DICK TRACY), because her difficulty in trying to play real people is strangely moving. Seeing Miss Young trying to act, at least in this "thriller", is a sad spectacle.
