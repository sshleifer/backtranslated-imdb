A very cheesy and boring road movie, with the intention of being modern and modern, shown in the editing style and some strange camera angles, which result only in drowsiness. <br /> <br /> The cast is wasted, the writing is stupid and pretentious. The only thing that is worthwhile is the Lalo Schifrin first class soundtrack, really great and also the opening sequence, very original and interesting. <br /> <br /> Run, if you can, the bad opinions and comments about this movie are totally deserved; It's really pure trash. Of course, this has its charm, to see a movie in which everyone would not drop the glass of beer if it were on fire, but save it for a stormy day where it has absolutely nothing else to do.
