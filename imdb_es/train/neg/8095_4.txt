The point of Wolfe's original novel, and indeed the point of the whole story, is that things take place because of a carefully calculated sense of convenience. The goal is survival within a particular type of lifestyle. The novel is full of malice. The only relationship that sounds emotionally true is that of Sherman and his daughter, Campbell, and that is only mentioned. Leaving aside, everyone is out for what can prevent advertising, power, money or self-aggrandizement. <br /> <br /> Wolfe was criticized for hitting all the characters and all the social segments of New York City in the head. . His response was a denial. After all, he himself lived in New York and belonged to a neighborhood improvement committee and other admirable organizations, exactly the qualifications one would want on his resume to deny that he did not like New Yorkers. (Wolfe has a doctorate in American studies from Yale and is not stupid). These supposed weaknesses are what made the novel memorable. No one was good. And Sherman McCoy ended up bankrupt, a professional demonstrator for social justice. The film discards all that and imposes a moral framework to the story that simply does not fit. Wolfe did his homework. The novel was rooted in reality. Each event was not only possible but it was completely credible. Wolfe could have been a great cultural anthropologist: he knows how to enter a system and record its details. <br /> <br /> Yes, any of us could have found us, as Sherman and his lover do, trapped. the south of the Bronx, threatened by a pair of black children, and fleeing after colliding with one of them. That scene transfers perfectly from printing to celluloid. <br /> <br /> But after that scene, the film seems not to trust its audience and, at times, it becomes frantic in its attempt to spell out its message, however nebulous the message may be. <br /> <br /> Sherman may accidentally hit a child and arrest him for being in the novel, but if he did not get out of jail immediately, he would return to his incredibly expensive condo, take out a shotgun and start shooting to the ceiling with him, as he does in the movement. In what is supposed to be a fun scene, the ceiling plaster falls on the party guests and they scurry, screaming. It just would not have happened. The film has left the indescribable reality of the novel in the dust. Wolfe's sensitivity, the work he put into capturing the real, has been lost. What we get instead is a noisy, fantastic and silly scene that does nothing except awaken the audience. Similar empty scenes follow, shouting at Wolfe's verisimilitude. <br /> <br /> The film also fails because it gets many sins and redemption into an entertaining story of moral nihilism. Here we see "Don Juan in hell" in the opera. We received lectures on the redemption of a poet with AIDS. We see a lot of guilt in Sherman. A black judge who preaches from the bank and gives one of those final speeches about how we should all begin to behave well again. A reporter who feels sorry for Sherman after turning him into a sacrificial lamb. And a happy ending in which Sherman frees himself by breaking the law with an idiotic smile. The scene is set in the film like a jester's cap on the head of a circus elephant. <br /> <br /> The film not only makes points that are already trivial and unoriginal, but exaggerates them, as if the audience were not capable of absorbing any subtlety. <br /> <br /> It is not the acting or the direction that is poor. The movie is not bad in those aspects. And the picture is also quite good, including two quite spectacular shots: the gargoyles of the Chrysler building and the landing of the Concorde. It is the script that is completely ruined. <br /> <br /> The first half of the film, approximately, is well in its conception and execution. Save some of the little details of the novel. Sherman and Judy's dog is named Marshall. Who the hell would call a dog Marshall? He loses his focus almost completely in the second half and, in general, it's hardly worth seeing. <br /> <br /> Wolfe's cynical right-wing redneck may be offensive to many people, but he has the balls to put his perception away. Unfortunately, the writers and producers did not have the courage to pick them up and, therefore, They missed the opportunity to do a fascinating study on New Yorkers.
