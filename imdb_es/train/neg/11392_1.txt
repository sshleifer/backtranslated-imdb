For years, I remember reading about this "Trouble With Tracy" program in the TV Guide. CFTO-TV Toronto every Saturday at 6 am! I lived about two hours by car north of Toronto and could not get CFTO, but you know how it is, we always want what we can not have. <br /> <br /> Well, I knew what I knew. I wanted and what I wanted was to see what this "problem with Tracy" was about. Did you have a beautiful girl in the leading role? Was there nudity? Was there suspense? Was it a comedy? It would have been nice if there was some promotion of the show. At least I could have known what I was missing. But no! The mystery drove me crazy, until CKCO, a CTV affiliate, built a re-transmitter in Wiarton, Ontario, and started broadcasting "Trouble With Tracy" at the same time as CFTO ... on Saturday mornings at 6 am! One Saturday morning, I got up and turned on the television at 5:59 and finally I could see what "The problem with Tracy" was. Yes, the "problem with Tracy" was that it was Canadian content and was in a harmless place at 6 am so no one would see how horrible it was. <br /> <br /> The talented Canadian actor Steve Weston died a few years ago, but many would say he did indeed "die" the first time he appeared on this show. When I first saw him that cold Saturday morning and fell down again in my bed, a part of me also died.
