I saw it by chance, and I liked the cable because I thought Sandra was pretty funny because of what she remembered. The only facial movement that I had throughout the movie was amazed by the horrible movie I just suffered. <br /> <br /> The person who said that this is one of the funniest movies of all time, points to a line. , just a scene, that is even worth laughing. <br /> <br /> She is a much better singer than I remember she was, but she did not want to see a performance in the living room. <br /> <Br /> I think this is a difficult movie to like because they think they should watch it and not see it objectively.
