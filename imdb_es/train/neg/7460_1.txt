Corky Romano has to be one of the most shocking and horrifying "comedians" ever made. <br /> <br /> While Chris Kattan is sometimes funny and had a very funny performance in his character's hilarious "secret brother". Corky is so stupid and so little fun, which is a shame, since the premise is a wonderful idea. Too bad, they ran out when they got to page 3 of the script.
