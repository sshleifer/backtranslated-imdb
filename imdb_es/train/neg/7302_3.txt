The first five minutes of this movie showed potential. After that, he went directly from something possibly decent to some kind of illegitimate comedy. The best part is that I could not stop thinking about Supertroopers thanks to Joey Kern. I would recommend watching this movie for the mere fact of learning not to make a movie. There are so many scenes in this movie that make you stop and wonder if the entire cast and crew stopped worrying at some point. What surprises me most about this movie is that it grossed $ 22 million at the box office and only cost around $ 1.5 million. Congratulations to Lion's Gate for being able to achieve that.
