First, this movie is GLACIALLY slow, and I can see most viewers lose patience with it in the first thirty minutes. <br /> <br /> The theme of the film was one that I think would be the basis of an excellent film. What was missing here was a plot that would advance the underlying themes. <br /> <br /> It's unfortunate, because in the hands of a writer like (for example) Lanford Wilson, I believe that symbolism like a mountain lion invades a school campus could assume great tragic proportions without being a hand hard. <br /> <br /> I think that, with a good script that supports the film, the same filmmaker, with the same tastes and even with the same actors (who really did not even have the chance to impress me), it could have been able to present a meaningful and moving representation of the pains and struggles a child goes through when he develops a powerful "crush" on an older child he admires. <br /> <br /> However, I regret to say it without this foundation, and armed with a vague, boring and very uninteresting script, without any argument in sight, and without any argument. sensitive structure (for example, after seeing it, I think you will find that you can not point out climatic scenes and, instead, we will find ourselves listing "well, maybe that scene, or that, was the climax ...") - the result is 95 minutes of tedium. <br /> <br /> Without a good plot, we are never terribly interested in any of the characters; their trials and difficulties are simply boring and boring. <br /> <br /> Without a good plot, the dramatic devices and freedoms of Surrealist directors become baffling and confusing rather than improvements in the story line. I never really believed, for example, the creation of "Leah" and I think most viewers would be completely taken aback by the conventional way in which their phone calls were filmed. <br /> <br /> Currently, the movie I'm afraid it's one that I can not recommend at all. What I can never understand is why a movie like THIS is not remade by an enterprising filmmaker ... instead of all the mediocre remakes of movies that were superlatively good at the first release! All you need is a good script, written by good writers, and I think this movie could easily become an unforgettable classic about an aspect of the male age that is rarely discussed in the drama. All the elements that were so tedious and seemed so complicated in the film (the messages written on the child's belly, the scenes of "Leah", the fantasies of the television screen) could be enriched if they are based on a good LIST OF HISTORY . <br /> <br /> I see in many comments that people talk about this movie as if it were somehow a "gay" topic, and I think that is a mistake. Obviously, the "infatuation" represented is that of a newly pubescent child in an older adolescent, but the character of Logan is too young to have decided on any particular sexual choice, and, in fact, in his represented masturbation fantasies, we see all kinds of stimuli, sexual and non-sexual, as one would expect in a very young boy like him. I believe that "lovers" like Logan's are common among young males who grow up to have a strong preference for sexual partners.
