I did not care about the movie, the book was better. Does anyone know where it was filmed? *** This was my first visit to your site ... I found the answer to my question. So now I look like a fool, but I think I'm still going to send my comments. and yes, British Columbia is lovely. Or why did they take it from its coastal environment in South Carolina? (This question is valid) The place was essential to the structure of the book and its change was part of my disappointment with the film. Oh, I just read where I need to write at least ten lines. Here is my other main problem with the movie. Kim Bassinger was too insensitive and it was not at all what he imagined of the book. I know, the book was the book and the movie; Well, not so good. I found the character in the book much more empathetic. The book also evokes rustic, almost primitive images of the monastery. While the "castle" in the film was much more visually impressive, it distorted the feel of the story and seemed to disagree with the characters.
