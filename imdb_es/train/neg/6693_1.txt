Run away from this movie. Even by the standards of movie B this movie is terrible. It is also insidious in its subject. The main theme is that people who reject society and have no respect for anything are interesting and worth admiring. People who treat others with respect are losers. Guncrazy is a movie that speaks of the marginalized much better than this movie, see it instead. <br /> <br /> No normal child would do what Trent does. State Troopers do not work like they do in this movie, etc. Watching this movie makes you understand why writers use the hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold clich√©. Mija is a completely unfriendly prostitute, who has had a terrible life. However, she is such a terrible person that the audience can not identify with her. <br /> <br /> Usually, there is one thing for which a movie can be recommended, in this case there is none. It's such a ridiculous movie that it insults the person trying to identify with the main characters. The performance is appropriate to the standards of film B and the direction does not present anything new or interesting.
