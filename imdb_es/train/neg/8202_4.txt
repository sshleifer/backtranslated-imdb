It is a new version of The Thing (1982/1951), I think so, there are many factors of the previous films that deny it. <br /> <br /> So the acting is bad, James Spader makes a super-Stargate recreation of himself, with his cup of coffee and his thoughts / movements somewhat strange, but that's it, the other actors that do not even I noticed You do not have the sensation of knowing anyone of the main characters. And the evolution of the plot is slow, boring and, yah, I know what is about to happen in 30 minutes. The score / music is ultra boring, uh, there are a lot of superfood people out there who would get a score for a coca and a credit, but this is a big shit. Some of the special effects are nice, if they were done in the early 90's. If you like Slimy Aliens, chills and emotions, do not worry about this movie. It's a boring combination of the production of Thing, Alien 3, Outbreak and something of Jerry Bruckheimer / Michael Bay that has gone really badly. Now, this combination would be great if someone knew what they were doing, and the only ones in this production who knew that it was, nobody. <br /> <br /> Although I have seen much worse, I would not recommend this movie to anyone, but if you are awake on a cold night, and you just want to take a look at something, time will pass, slowly.
