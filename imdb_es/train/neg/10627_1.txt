I realize that most people who think that this film tells the truth were not born before the moon's landing (1969-1972), or are not old enough to appreciate them. I think it is much easier to question a historical event if you did not live it. <br /> <br /> I was a young man at the time of Apollo, but I was old enough to understand what was happening. The whole world followed the moon's landings. Our families gathered around the television to watch the launch. Newspaper headlines shouted the latest events every day, from launch to landing, from moonwalks to moonrise, from start to finish, in a multitude of languages. At school, some classes were canceled so we could see the main events on television. During Apollo 13, the world prayed and held collective breath as men went home to an uncertain destination. You could not go anywhere without someone asking which one was the last. The world was truly one community. <br /> <br /> Now, with a buffer more than 30 years after the fact, it is easy to claim fraud because enthusiasm and interest around the world have calmed down. We stay with our history books, and anyone can claim that the story is wrong and try to "prove it" with a lot of lies and fabricated facts, while completely ignoring the preponderance of evidence to the contrary, without mentioning the proof that dwell in the souls and in the memories of those who lived these wonderful and fantastic days.
