How did this become a blockbuster? My God, I do not know where to start why this movie was so bad. The film was predictable and there was no originality. The only thing I can admire is the performance of some characters. The film was too bright, they should have done something with lighting, for example. Making the environment darker. The makeup of certain dead characters made this movie look like a 1970 horror movie. This is 2006! People do not get scared with other people who use a lot of makeup. Most of the horror scenes we took from other Hollywood or Asian horror movies. Total scam! That's why I do not watch Tagalog movies. The only reason why so many people "shouted" while watching this movie is because of compliance. How many times do we have to copy scenes from The Ring and improvise that, instead of the girl coming out of the television, now come through the next window? No matter how you put it, STILL IS A RIP. If you want a good horror movie, go and see the 50 best horror movies listed on this website.
