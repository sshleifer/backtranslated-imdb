This movie was not so bad compared to the first two sequels of the original. It is directed by Martin Kitrosser on Friday the 13th of fame. The acting is very bad, but the special effects and gore make it interesting. That's something I like about Screaming Mad George (effect makeup artist for the film), its effects are so extravagant and strange that they will keep you watching a bad movie just to find out what crazy people are going to play. . The movie is not really that bloody, but there is a VERY nasty scene with an eyeball in the middle that involves a toy worm (what ?!) Mickey Rooney makes a special appearance that probably was not very excited but he needed Money at the moment, possibly? If you liked the 4th installment of Weirdo (my favorite at 5), you probably like this one. I liked it more than the Matrix! Enjoy.
