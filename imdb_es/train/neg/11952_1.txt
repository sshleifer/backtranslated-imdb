In his first film after the death of old friend John Belushi, Aykroyd shows a lot of fatigue trying to achieve a character that would have been very easy for Belushi. <br /> <br /> Instead, "Doctor Detroit" gives us the book teacher Aykroyd disguised as a weird and violent pimp to ward off an opponent known only as a mom. It's bad enough, but he also has classes to teach, a school dinner for the hostesses, four ladies of the night to protect and a pimp dinner (or something like that) to attend. No wonder Aykroyd seems stunned most of the time. Why should the viewer be alone? <br /> <br /> It was in this film that Aykroyd met the future wife Donna Dixon. At least something good came out of this chaotic chaos. <br /> <br /> One and a half stars. You want a good Aykroyd, look at "The Blues Brothers." If you want wrong, go to "Dr. Detroit."
