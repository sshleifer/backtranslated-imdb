Terrible movie Nuff Said. <br /> <br /> These lines are just filling. The movie was bad. Why do I have to expand that I do not know. This is already a waste of my time. I just wanted to warn others. Avoid this movie. The performance sucks and the writing is simply moronic. Bad in every way. The only good things about the movie are Deniz Akkaya's breasts. Even that was ruined by a terrible and unnecessary rape scene. The film is a piece of trash that is badly conceived and totally incredible. <br /> <br /> Ok, now I'm going to make a rag in IMDb for this stupid rule of at least 10 lines of text. First I waste my time watching these spoils. Then I feel obliged to warn others, I create an account in IMDb and discover that I have to write a good essay about the film to express how bad I think it is. Totally unnecessary.
