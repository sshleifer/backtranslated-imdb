This acts as a satire during the era of the movement for women's rights. Of course, that does not mean that COACH (the movie) is a wonderful sight experience. It runs on the same line as FASTBREAK (which was better, but still domesticated), and it's basically a fluff of standard fare. What I want to say with this movie of being uninteresting is easy to recognize. Anyone who spends time away from a normal job training a group of lunatics who earn their way to sudden victory makes it go to waste. It's the same feeling you can have after seeing this. A good attempt to choose the opposite sex for a man's duty, but I expected better things.
