His first clue that this is a cheesy movie is that it was recorded on video, not on film. The story is complicated and the production is incredibly sloppy. Keep in mind, for example, that when the title couple is on a plane that apparently lands in Vermont, where they have gone to celebrate their relationship in a civil union ceremony, it is seen that the plane enters an airport surrounded by palm trees. His ceremony, in Vermont, takes place in a garden of tropical plants, including palm trees, that would not last five minutes in the New England climate. On another airplane trip, the establishment plan shows a FedEx cargo plane taking off. Presumably they could only afford to travel in direction. As for the plot, this film hopes that you believe that Victor, Arthur's devout Christian brother, is expelled from his church when the congregation learns that his BROTHER is gay. Not only that, but the pastor finally establishes Victor with a hitman for Ben and Arturo to be killed "to purge their souls of sin." Apparently, no one in this church has heard of the Ten Commandments. If it were not for Jamie Brett Gabel, who is surprisingly effective as Arthur, this film would have no redemption.
