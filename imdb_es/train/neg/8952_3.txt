After hearing about George Orwell's prophetic masterpiece for my entire life, now I am 37 years old, but I have never read the book, I am totally confused as to what I just saw. <br /> <br /> I'm very familiar with the concepts covered in the novel, as I'm sure most of them are, but only through rumors and quotes. Without this limited knowledge, this film would have been a complete mystery, and even with that, I am still not more informed about the 1984 story than before I saw it. <br /> <br /> On the positive side. .. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is amazing, Hurt & Burton offer excellent performances and the general feeling of the film is wonderfully bleak and desolate. The prostitute scene was a fantastically dark movie. <br /> <br /> Now, for the negative sides, and there are many ... <br /> <br /> There is a war going on, (at least as far as propaganda is concerned), but Why and with whom? Nothing is explained. There are a couple of names that speak (Eurasia, etc.), but they mean nothing without explanation. <br /> <br /> Who is Winston? What does he do? Where does he come from? Where he works? Why are you changing news reports? Why is not it on the front line? Why do not you eat the food in the canteen? What is that drink you are drinking throughout the entire movie? Why are you so weak and sick? Why did not they brainwash him like everyone else? What's wrong with your mother and sister? What happened to your father? A small return story would have been nice, without any problem, essential for those like me who have not read the book. Without that, this is just an art film and confusing and hard to follow that constantly keeps you guessing what is really happening. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was disarticulated and poorly edited and the constant chatter of Big Brother screens floods the dialogue in places that make it even harder to figure out what's going on. I accept that this may have been an artistic choice, but it is very annoying anyway. <br /> <br /> Also, I know that this has been mentioned before, but why all the nudity? It just seemed totally free and it felt as if it had been thrown there to compensate for the lack of coverage of the plot. <br /> <br /> Personally I can not stand the way Hollywood feels that it has to explain the story lines. By word these days. Not all of us are brainwashed simpletons, but this is a few steps too far in the other direction. I can only imagine that it is based entirely on the fact that you have read the book because if this movie really is the 'literal translation' that I have seen many people say, it would be very difficult for me to understand why 1984 is acclaimed as is the classic . <br /> <br /> It can not be denied that he was light years away from his time and that he has almost predicted all the changes in our society to date (maybe this was a kind of bible for the Powers?) , but many science fiction novelists have done the same without leaving big holes in history. <br /> <br /> I guess I have to do what I should have done from the beginning and buy a copy. of the book, if I have to understand it. <br /> <br /> In general, very disappointed by something I have waited for years to see.
