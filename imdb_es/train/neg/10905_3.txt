Guy is a loser. You can not get the girls, the needs to build, the strongest and most successful kids attract them, etc. I've seen it, I've seen it, it's gone. I must say that Rob needs to overcome Adam Sandler's part of his life. And get out of Adam Sandler's plots. There are two fun parts in the whole movie. I could not even finish the last 5 minutes. I was bored "The animal" is a good movie. I usually enjoy the Adam Sandler movies that have the same plot. But this was too difficult to impress. The jokes are very old. Then, trust me. This is not a movie that most people can really get into. But some did, so I'll be fine. <br /> <br /> 3/10
