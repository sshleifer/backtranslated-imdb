This movie became extremely silly when things started to happen. I could not care less about any of the characters; Susan Walters was so upset, and the main actor (forget her name) was also nervous. I can not remember how it ended and all that, but the general idea that extraterrestrials have human bodies and everything seemed stupid in this movie, things did not get along. My dad told me it's a stupid movie ... I should have listened to it.
