Although I consider myself a fan of the television series Babylon 5, the original film that presented the series was a weak start. Although many of the elements that will later mature and become much more attractive in the series are there, the rhythm of The Gathering is slow, the composition somewhat inadequate and the plot confusing. Worse, the characterization in the premiere episode is poor. Although the chart shows that many fans are willing to overlook these problems, I remember that The Gathering almost turned off what soon became a spectacular series.
