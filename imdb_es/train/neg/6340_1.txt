This is the type of movie that I fear the most. Arrogant and irresponsible, he presents an outline of the Colombian conflict so cliché and silly that it represents an insult for all Colombians. The performances are godawul, from Grisales (his nude scene is absolutely pitiful), to Bejarano, to Fanny Mickey (who seems to have emerged from a nightmare of Tim Burton), to Diaz, who makes a remarkable effort to give life to such a character only. -dimensional, so cliché and so badly written, all he has left to work is a mustache. Not to mention the free end, a cheesy gore fest that would shake Ed Wood. Fail in every way, cinematography, art direction, wardrobe, makeup, editing and, above all, direction. Jorge Alí Triana has always been a lousy filmmaker, but at least his previous films had some dignity. I can not say anything good about this waste of money, except that I hope Colombian filmmakers will learn a lesson about honesty, integrity and responsibility from this intentional fiasco.
