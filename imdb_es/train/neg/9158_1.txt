Oh my God. I bought this movie and ... I ... saw ... everything ... thing. . . Okay, it's going to be fine ... I know I'll be fine in a month or two. At some point soon I hope to get rid of flash backs. I was going to eat something after the movie, but it seems that I can not muster the courage to try to contain some food at this moment. Bad? Yes, very bad. BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD. Wait, evil does not seem to convey the message in the right way. Hmm ... There is not a word to describe how horrible ... it's not horrible ... Hmm disgustingly horribly cast / acted / filmed / directed / written. Now I do not know what to do, but throw it away. Possibly I burn it, I would not want it to end at the bottom of an architectural excavation in a thousand years. The worst movie since "Hey Happy"
