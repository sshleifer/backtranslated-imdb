I can not believe I lost 80 minutes of my life watching this terrible movie. I hoped that in the end it would get better, but I was wrong. The plot was abysmal, the performance was extremely poor and the special effects were terrible. Not even the 2 beautiful girls could revive my interest in this boring and bloody mess. However, I can not lie, some of the lines in this movie were quite memorable, like when the Asian boy says "I lost my virginity with the nanny, so stereotypes of ****" <br /> <br /> please do not waste your time with this shock unless you are ready or want to laugh ... maybe that way you can see it to copy this movie with some colleagues
