The concept for Sarafina seems to be solid, apart from the musical perspective. Try to combine an optimistic African music with a story that describes the atrocious conditions and atmosphere that the blacks were forced to endure at the time the film was shot. The contradictions of each of the two elements are too evident and the film never justifies such rapid changes between joy and terror. If it had simply been a drama that reflected these conditions, it could have been a good movie, however, the scenes of school children being knocked down by soldiers do not feel right next to the songs. <br /> <br /> Aside from the bad premise that the performance is not the best either, Goldberg offers a mediocre performance like the rest of the cast. In general, a disappointment. <br /> <br /> 3/10
