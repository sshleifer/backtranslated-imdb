The version of this movie that I saw was entitled 'The horror rises from the grave'. The horror in question is an evil medieval magician played by the legend of the Spanish horror Paul Naschy, who seems to be playing Abanazer in a panto of the church. He gets up from his grave when a stupid descendant (I think he is a descendant, since he is also played by Naschy) returns to his ancestral home and gathers the head and body of the magician, who had been separated by the witch-seekers who They executed, in an attempt to stop him, er, rising from the grave. <br /> <br /> Obviously, once the head and body are together again, hell breaks loose and many people die. Like all good magicians, Abanazer has a charming assistant. This is interpreted by another great Spanish terror, the beautiful Helga line. Like virtually every other woman in the movie, Line periodically removes the kit. There are a lot of nudes in this movie, and not only of women, we can even see Naschy's body, which is not a pretty picture, I assure you. Most of the sexual angle of the film is ridiculously gratuitous. There is a particularly funny scene in which Naschy and Line discuss their evil plans and then suddenly decide that the two have to grope the young nubile blonde they have possessed. <br /> <br /> It's also pretty bloody in some places, especially a Herschell Gordon Lewis-Escape Moment where Line sinks his hands into a man's chest to take away his heart. <br /> <br /> The best part of the movie is the quite effective zombies that appear towards the end. However, they quickly get scared with a fire and do not bother to go back. What a pity. The scene where the zombies grow, however, is the most ridiculously inept moment in the movie. Everything happens in the long run, and we really have no idea what is going on until we see some figures that advance from a distance. There are several junk moments like this, largely thanks to a bad edition. When a worker falls under the hypnotic spell of Naschy's head, there is a great approach to his face that seems to last forever and is useless. <br /> <br /> In general, it is not a great horror movie, but entertaining. enough. Of course, the version I saw was a bent American version that had probably been cut into pieces. As far as I know, the original version in Spanish could be a masterpiece ...
