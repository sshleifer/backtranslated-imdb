Drew Barrymore plays the young Holly Gooding, who moves with aspiring screenwriter Patrick Highsmith (George Newbern) and completely disrupts his life to say that his "doppelganger", or evil twin, is willing to kill her and her family. <br /> <br /> This silly horror movie is something difficult to take seriously, even if the same filmmakers and actors seem to be very serious. "Doppelganger" is confused, with some unpleasant dialogue. <br /> <br /> Some viewers will notice that the name of the character of Drew is extracted from the role of Audrey Hepburn in "Breakfast at Tiffany's", and that the name of the character of Newbern is a game named after the famous author Patricia. Highsmith (actually is trying to rewrite "Breakfast" as a horror movie, believe it or not!). <br /> <br /> I guess it deserves some credit for not being so Your typical horror movie: I mean, the writer / director Avi Nesher seems to really care about his characters, and gives his movie more plot than the of the standard slasher. <br /> <br /> After a foolish villain -explains- everything to the confrontation of the audience, the film continues to present a frightening and extroverted climax that must be seen to be believed. This film certainly does not skimp on the gore. <br /> <br /> But hey! Drew kills his mother in this case. No, I'm not kidding. Jaid Barrymore appears almost at first only to be killed violently. <br /> <br /> Drew is always very visible, and very sexy in this case. Newbern appears as a pretty nice guy, "good." But the highlight of the movie has to be the scene with Sally Kellerman, an attractive veteran who is very professional in her only scene as a former nun who started a telephone sex business (!!!!!!). <br /> <br /> The movie is basically garbage, but quite funny on a sordid and sordid level. <br /> <br /> 4/10
