The plot was very thin, although the idea of ​​a naked and sexy mermaid eating men is good. <br /> <br /> The movie seemed to wander from one pointless scene to another with very few nuddie / splatter / lesbian mouth licking shots in between. <br /> <br /> The characters were wooden and one-dimensional. <br /> <br /> The ending did not make sense. <br /> <br /> Considering that I had Tom Savini and Shaun Hutson in him, you would have expected a decent plot and decent special effects. Some of the effects were pretty good, but there were very few. <br /> <br /> The brownie points are used for occasional flashes of tits and shrubs, naturally, and of course the lesbian moments. I also thought that the scene with the sirens that bathed in the pool under the waterfall could be seen as an innovative version of the "shower scene". <br /> <br /> The film had many of the elements that are part of the first steps. I rated the horror movie but they were poorly executed or used very sparingly. <br /> <br /> If I had been watching this alone and being 15 years old, I would have really enjoyed it for about 10 minutes (with 1 hand on the remote), then suddenly lost interest and needed a pizza .. .
