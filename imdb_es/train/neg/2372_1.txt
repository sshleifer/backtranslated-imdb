Unimaginably stupid, redundant and humiliating, the closing of the series "Nightmare on Elm Street"! Part 6 is so incompetent that it seems that the director Rachel Talalay intentionally wanted to turn the initial premise of Wes Craven into a great joke without meaning. This is not only the worst entry in the saga of "Elm Street"; It is also one of the most embarrassing horror movies ever made and offends fans of the genre! The story is silly, the drawings of the characters are ridiculous, the structure is murky and ... above all? the special and visual effects resemble those of a Tom & Jerry caricature. The sequences in which Freddy Krueger murders his victims are endless and very uninteresting. Were we supposed to feel petrified when a fucking Freddy turned Breckin Meyer into a videogame, character and pogo, stuck to the walls of a house? The story takes us back to Springwood and it seems that Freddy, suddenly, has a middle-aged daughter. One would think that he would mention it in one of his previous adventures, but would not he? There is only one surviving teen in Springwood and Krueger uses it to get in touch with his lost daughter. Another reason why this final installment is so horrible is the completely illogical structure. The John Doe-boy is presented as the main character, but suddenly he dies and the plot keeps turning into two adults. What about that: Freddy Krueger, who spent five whole movies killing nothing but teenagers, is finally hit by two adults with 3D glasses? Something like the ruins of the whole essence, is not it? As far as I'm concerned, "Nightmare on Elm Street" has always been a terribly overrated series, but so far, even the weakest entries had at least some redeeming elements. "Freddy's Dead", however, is simply unbearable and no one should waste their precious time looking at it.
