After reading the book, which had a lot of meaning for me, the film did not give me any of the sensations that the book conveyed to me. This makes me wonder if Kaufman liked this book, since he turned it into something else. Or that's just bad. Most important, where is the lightness? From the first scene, the music drowns most of the dialogue and feelings, and this continues through the film. I think the creators thought that by playing happy music through the film, this would make the story feel light, however, here they have completely failed. Instead, the music manages to give everyone that movie feel, in a way by dramatizing events so that we stop at them, so that everything feels heavy. <br /> <br /> Another example of how this adaptation fails is by embellishing the storyline making it more dramatic. In the film we see Franz passing Tomas on the street, who is on his way to see Sabina. The introduction of this meeting / casual step, which did not really happen in the book, gives Tomas's story more importance than light. <br /> <br /> There are many other examples in which the continuity of the story has been changed, what is worse, however, this could have been done because the book simply does not become well in a movie, such is the style of Kundera. This makes us wonder if all the generous reviewers of this site wrote considering their experience with the book AND the movie instead of just writing about the movie. A film that is as long as unsatisfying. For those who have not yet read the book, I recommend you read that. For those who have done so, I must say that you will simply waste your time and probably end up here writing similar warnings.
