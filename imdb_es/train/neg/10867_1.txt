This is a movie that makes you say 2 things ... 1) I can do much better than this (act, write and direct) 2) this is so bad that I should leave a review and warn others ... <br /> <br /> It seems as if it had been filmed with my video flip. I also believe that my friend who told me to see this has a vendetta against me. I have noticed that there are some positive posts for this home video; They must have been left by crew members or people with something to do with this movie. One of the worst 3 movies I've seen in my life. Hopefully the writers and the director leave the business. Not even talented enough to make announcements!
