What is written on the poster is: "At birth they gave him 6 years of life ... At 34 he takes the trip of his life". Ami is an Israeli born in the United States who was diagnosed with a muscular dystrophy disease at the age of one year. At the age of 34, after the love for her 22-year-old caregiver did not go well, she decided to come to the United States to confront the doctor who said she would only be 6 years old. I wanted to show the doctor that he is still alive and that he weighs 39 pounds. Why? Your opinion is as good as mine, even I have seen this movie. <br /> <br /> Obviously, it's brave to live when all you can move is your left index finger, but why do you have so much anger towards the doctor? Who diagnosed your disease 34 years ago? Your doctor has just told your mother that, based on your medical history, people with your illness will not live long. What good is it to appear at the old doctor's door? Why is tracking this old doctor in the United States a trip of a lifetime? There are so many things that could interest us in Ami's life: how can you make those animations with the movement of a single finger? How can you go through daily life while totally dependent on others? How did your doctor's prediction live? How do you deal emotionally when other people look at you like looking at a strange creature? The movie did not tell us anything about that. Instead, the filmmaker took a van and arranged a trip for Ami to appear at the door of his former doctor to show him that he is still alive. I thought it was a joke.
