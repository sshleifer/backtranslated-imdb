Reed Diamond plays a man who suffers from amnesia and has been in a mental asylum for more than a decade after he was found wondering about the roads with blood on his hands. Doctors want to try a new experimental drug that will return your lost memories if it works. But when drugs give him hallucinations of a demon, he chooses to escape instead. While outside he befriends a young man whose stepfather (Greg Grunberg) mistreats his mother, does not let her approach the dark room in his basement and acts suspicious in general. <br /> <br /> While the general "mystery" of The Movie is a bit easy to identify before being revealed, I found that Mr. Diamond's performance is fascinating enough to hold my attention at all times. (In the interest of full disclosure, I've been a big fan of him since his murder and his brief, but pivotal role in The Shield to Journeyman & Dollhouse) It's not a great movie or a good one, but it's useful enough. Although I liked it more than the previous films I've seen from Director / writer Michael Hurst (Room 6, Pumkinhead 4, Mansouche) <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: a pair of shooting tits in a hallucination <br /> < br /> My Degree: C-
