I was very disappointed in this movie. Simply, it was weak bordering on the fool: Souls that can affect reality the way they do? A seemingly critical mission for the soul hunters entrusted to one of their youngest members? And the whole B story with the "holobrothel" and the lawsuit against the station was so horrible that at one point I dropped the television, "Why are you wasting your time with this?" <br /> <br /> Thematically, "The River of Souls" did not really enter into the soul question in more depth than the original episode "The Soul Hunter". We see that the Soul Hunters can make mistakes, but we still do not feel their culture. (Is there any female soul hunter?) <br /> <br /> The performance was good, given the material they had to work with, and the special effects, especially the planets landscapes in the first act, were very impressive . But in general, I would say do not miss this.
