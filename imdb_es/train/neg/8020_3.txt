I had some lovely poetic fragments, but in reality it is just an artistic combination and without direction or resolution. How do these people get to film school? Who gives them money to do this shit? I could have been much more, excellent main actor, and I've always liked Fairuza Balk, but come on, the alternative rock metaphor of just looking without being able to find something convincing is so tired, and it sure is useless. movies the director needs to leave and live life for a long time and not go back to the camera until he really has something to say. This is like the artistic school of throwing spaghetti on the wall, simply juxtaposing a lot of fervent images and hoping that the poetry will emerge. That can work, if the director really has some kind of vision, or has a brain that knows when it is in the presence of potential, but here it is only space to fill, without any consequence. I felt the lazy ending approaching moments before it arrived, and shouted "lazy bastard" on the screen when the credits appeared.
