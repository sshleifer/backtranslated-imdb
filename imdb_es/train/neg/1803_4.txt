Here is one of those educational short films made to meet strangers about the facts of life. This time the target audience is preadolescent girls, the fact of life is menstruation. This animated film, created by Walt Disney Pictures, apparently with some Kotex sponsorship. <br /> <br /> Start with the explanation of how hormones make you grow and develop. With the help of animation and a female narrator, she shows us how the body works, especially the ovaries, the uterus and the vagina, and why all this leads to menstruation. It is almost incredible, becoming the comic note here, how to avoid the subject of sex. Even the word is never mentioned, although "furtilized" will happen once. I really do not know why I saw it, but since it's one of those rare short films that could give an impression of an innocent moment, you might want to try it.
