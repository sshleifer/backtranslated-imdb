Bad plot (although good for a B movie), good fast-paced fighting scenes, at most 5 out of 10. But I've always been worried about this movie: why does Mariska Hargitay never speak? In the television version, she shares several intimate moments with Jeff Speakman, including a kiss in a garden. However, in the regular (video) version, most of his scenes are cut and he never speaks at all. This bothers me because not only does it draw a feminine (though clicheed) point of view to the film, it also makes the final photo look creepy. This movie would have been better if they had kept their scenes, because in those scenes at least she has a personality, one that undermines what Speakman says.
