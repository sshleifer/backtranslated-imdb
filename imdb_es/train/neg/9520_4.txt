[*** POSSIBLE SPOILERS ***] The reputation of this film precedes it, so it was in advance that I sat down to watch it in a mailbox at TCM. What a disappointment. <br /> <br /> The cast is excellent and the production values ​​are first class, but the characters have no depth, the plot is thin and everything continues too long. For a film that deals with alcoholism, family divisions, infidelity, gambling and sexual repression, the film is curiously flat, prosaic, lifeless and full of clichés. An example is the portrait of Frank Hirsch's infidelity: his rather clumsy request to his wife to "climb the stairs and relax a little," followed by his predictable plea for a headache, leads him, even more predictably, to your afternoon liaison with your secretary. ("Hey Nancy, I have the blues tonight, let's go for a spin"), all according to a widely used formula. We do not feel that they are real people, but cardboard cutouts that act in a puppet. In addition, the source of the obvious friction between Frank and Dave Hirsch is never really explored or explained. Dave's infatuation with Gwen on / off again is inexplicable in light of his inability to defecate or leave the pot. Her subsequent marriage of desperation with the character of Shirley Maclaine / Ginny is, from the moment she was introduced to this viewer, anyway, obviously doomed to failure, and it was clear, by the conventions of this type of telenovela, that she could It will only be solved by someone being killed. The moment the jealous lover started running with the gun, I started betting on who, Dave or Ginny, would be killed. Everything was false with a capital 'P'. <br /> <br /> Having said that, the performance of Maclaine and Dean Martin are the highlights here. But overall I find that the interest of the film is purely that of a part of Hollywood history.
