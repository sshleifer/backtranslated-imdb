My little sister and I are self-proclaimed lovers of horror movies. We've seen almost EVERYTHING, especially zombie movies. Now, we have seen many good zombie movies and many bad ones. This far is the WORST movie I've seen in my entire life. Not only was the performance horrible, but the special effects, the graphics and the "zombie" makeup were the worst I've seen. If you can even call it makeup (black eye shadow around the eyes) This is a total proof that you should never judge a book by its cover. Because the cover of the film is the only sweet thing. Do yourself a favor and DO NOT LOOK AT THIS MOVIE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I was so convinced of this movie that I went so far as to put a sticky note inside the film before going back to the movie saying: "This movie sucks, do not waste your time, come back NOW" hahahhaa, I do not want someone More miss a good movie night in this POS movie! I do not even know how he got the grades he got, t should be negative.
