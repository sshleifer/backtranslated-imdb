Anyone notices that Tommy only has 3 facial expressions. <br /> <br /> 1. Angry eyes look at each enemy. 2. The grip of the hands to the face, the mouth open and the eyes scared. 3. The smiling Tommy Turnbull. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I hate this program a lot, I do not see it but it's like Code Lyoko, we've all seen at least one, I should say that this program is racist, without interest and without meaning. <br /> <br /> Each episode ends with a winning robotboy, except for one exception when the robotboy basically lets this freakazoid too geek fly in a jetpack. <br /> <br /> The jokes are also pretty crude, I think most are people who say "suck" or throw farts, I think the thugs of the show are also quite shocking. <br /> <br /> Is not there one who hides a bowling ball under his hatred, and the other uses a chain, for God's sake, what kind of school he will attend. Not to mention his older brother, who is a borderline psychopath and has no other qualities of character. <br /> <br /> All the show I feel is cheating XLR and Fosters. As you can tell, the trio of coop, Jamie and Kiva, as well as Robotboy are similar to Megas, where he beats everyone, no matter what the odds are, and has a free spirit despite being a robot. <br /> <br /> There's simply No appeals to this show, I'm surprised it's still working.
