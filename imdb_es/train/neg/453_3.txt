Ok, first the good: Cher's performance and cinematography. Although I'm not Cher's fan, she gives an excellent performance and her part was well written. The photography was well done and captures a sense of romance. <br /> <br /> The Rest: a thin plot, the performance of Nicholas Cage and a totally indefatigable and weak attempt to portray an Italian-American family in New York. First, every time Cage opened his mouth I shrunk. I do not know what kind of accent I was trying to use. Honestly I do not, it sure was not an Italian or New York accent that I heard. It was quite surreal. And it was not because I'm a fan of precision, his voice was heard in my ears. And I like Nicholas Cage in other performances. Second, and this is purely anecdotal, but I have many relationships, Italian friends and acquaintances in New York City, and frankly I laughed and felt more joy at the appreciation of the Italian ethnic family than the movie. And that would be a boring night in the house. What a disappointment.
