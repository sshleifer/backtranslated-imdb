This movie is frightening of God. It is not a quality for this movie. You would think that the gore would be good but it sucks badly. The effects are worse and the performance, if you can call it acting, is the worst I've seen. This movie, obviously, was shot on a camcorder and has an approximate budget of $ 500, probably. If you want to see a good movie of Zombies, look at Dawn of the dead or Day of the dead. If you want to see a good cheap photo in a Zombie movie video like this, but much better than seeing Redneck Zombies. Please, avoid this movie at all costs. It is unappealable and meaningless. You have been warned I have nothing more to say about this stupid movie.
