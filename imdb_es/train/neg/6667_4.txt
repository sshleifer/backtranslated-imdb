I was enjoying this movie until Ed Norton's facial hair problems. Without revealing any detail of the plot, one afternoon he wore a light beard, but that afternoon he no longer had a beard and had a very luxurious mustache. He was much fuller than the mustache that went with his beard. Later, in the course of a dark night in the open air, the mustache was gone and paradise appeared clean. This was an occasion where stopping shaving would not be an option. These discrepancies of continuity completely distracted me from the rest of the film and ruined the credibility I had previously had. Also, I found that the long cowboy scene alone in his room was very reminiscent of De Niro in Taxi Driver. Even if it was supposed to be a tribute, he had been entrusted too much for this viewer.
