This is the worst adaptation of a classic story I've ever seen. They modernize it unnecessarily and some points are really sick. <br /> <br /> The songs rarely move throughout the story. It seems that they are thrown at random. The flight scene with Marley is useless and ridiculous. <br /> <br /> It's not just one of the worst movies I've seen, it's definitely the worst musical I've seen. <br /> <br /> Probably only considered a classic because "A Christmas Carol" is such a classic story. Just because the original story was a classic does not mean that some cheap adaptation is.
