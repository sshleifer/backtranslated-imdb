I was largely persuaded to write this review for several reasons: <br /> <br /> 1) This is, without a doubt, the worst movie I've seen 2) Unless you get more reviews, it will not. be included in the list of the worst movies of all time, which deserves to be 3) I had a bit of luck, I paid five pounds for it. I've seen it in stores for 15 pounds. YOU DO NOT PAY SO MUCH FOR THIS MOVIE! You will be very angry 4) There are many movies in the horror genre that do not get a fair rating (in my opinion) and that this movie has a higher rating than it is criminal <br /> <br /> The summary of the plot: a man without friends meets a vagabond who promises the world; Well, the magical ability to appear before everyone else as someone else. Our hero cleverly becomes a teenager and joins his gang: sitting on swings, babysitting. He kills them one by one until the police track him and find him. <br /> <br /> Why is it so bad? Starting with the performance is VERY VERY bad. Someone else compared it with a school production. No, this is worse than any performance I've seen at school. <br /> <br /> I have bought some of these previously forbidden films from the DVD vipco company and I have not been disappointed as much as I was in this. Well, the acting is bad but the film is not delivered in all other respects. What a sense to make this movie when there is not even gore! Okay, no gore What else can a movie like this offer? Breats? No, not even any emotion! <br /> <br /> It's true that this movie may have a certain charm in its uniqueness, but any potential buyer / observer of this movie should be quite informed that this movie is worth, at most, only one in ten.
