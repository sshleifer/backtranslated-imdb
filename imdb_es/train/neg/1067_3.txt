Only a handful of the segments are committed here. A segment with a Nigerian garage assistant is heartbreaking. One with Fanny Ardent and Bob Hoskins makes his point, turn by turn until the final shot surpasses things. <br /> <br /> The problem with this movie is that only some of the clips invoke Paris. The others are so scattered in the subject, tone, volition and production that you may also be watching "The Years Best Commercials, 2006". It's really the whole place. It does not develop throughout its execution time, and nothing governs the directors. No construction successfully joins the pieces ... the tedium begins. I'm at the point of an hour, twenty minutes and Elijah Wood is in a mute state. -Stick commercial of vampires, overproduced. It has as much to do with Paris as the old women knitting in the Antartic. The fantasy appears, I think first in the segment of the Coen brothers (Uh, thanks to J & E for ruining another movie) and then appears too many appearances. The point of being in Paris is that you do not need a fictional shit to make your days extraordinary. Why divide it by neighborhood if the Quartier de la Madeleine is compared to vampires for some losing director? Has there ever been a genre more represented than the vampire movie? Every three years we have the same clich√©s of vampires. <br /> <br /> What makes things worse is that the change from segment to segment is quite naive. The transitions are lost. This does not feel intentional, it feels neglected.
