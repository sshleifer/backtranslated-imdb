The most misogynist movie of all time? Not to mention that by 68, should not they have moved beyond the whites with the dark face playing the "Indians"? However, my favorite parts have to be when the girls laugh and blush when the motorcyclists drag them to rape them. Rape is fun! Who knows? Let's see, then there are the flagrant scams of "The Hustler" (the character of the fat boss actually plays pool while trying to destroy the Indians with the rebel leader), the horrible performance, the impeccable guy. Power-as-well music tracks have just told you what you have to think, the lack of SOMEONE WHO IS REALLY Indian in this movie. And who are we supposed to be encouraging? I have to say that the figures Quentin Tarantino loves this movie. Even though his films tend to defend strong women, I've heard from at least one source that in real life is a misogynist idiot. Why did I see it, you ask? Do not ask
