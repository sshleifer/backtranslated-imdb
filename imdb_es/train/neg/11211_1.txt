There are so many things that are wrong in this movie, but to summarize: terrible performance, so bad that it must have been on purpose. bad script: you may have had some good ideas, but this was not the best way to present the story. Ridiculously bad ending: in some cases, the end manages to save the movie, not in this case. If you manage to sit through the whole movie, you'll want to kick yourself in the end because it's not even worth waiting for the end. This is the worst movie I've seen in a long time. It was a complete torture sitting in this movie, I would have liked someone to let me know in advance. So do yourself a favor. Watch this movie only if you have nothing better to do. Even then you will regret having gone through the ineffable torture.
