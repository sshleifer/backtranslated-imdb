Andie McDowell is beautiful as the 40-year-old woman whose late start in a serious relationship leads her to a considerably younger man and a subsequent fight with 2 best girlfriends girlfriends. <br /> <br /> See a gigolo / seeker of gold in the sincere young man, the "brides", determined to end this "silly relationship", go beyond the call of duty to "help" his friend (who obviously he is blinded by this gigolo). A tricky success. "<br /> <br /> A short succession of situations is absolutely ridiculous, far from it, and without these incredible scenes, there may be hope for a sweet love story. Left is an involuntary movement of the head - these things just do not happen! Without revealing the details of the cliff hanger, I warn the viewer that he has great expectations for this film, the majority (like me) will be very disappointed. 1 to 10, this one has a weak 4 with me, there's a lot better stuff out there, this is not worth your time
