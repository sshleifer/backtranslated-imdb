This movie was, as Homer Simpson would say, "more boring than the church." Maybe I do not understand it well enough, and I thought it started pretty well, but after (START OF SPOILER), Hermann Braun is sent to jail and Maria starts working / sleeping with her boss, she just started crawling, and I struggled . to stay awake Once again, maybe it symbolizes something, but the explosion at the end seemed very forced and out of place. (END OF SPOILER). In the end, I do not see why others think it is so good, since I found it extremely boring. By the way, I did not see this movie of my own free will, since I was asked to watch it for a film class.
