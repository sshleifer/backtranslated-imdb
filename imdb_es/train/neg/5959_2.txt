A spoiler. <br /> <br /> What three words can guarantee you a terrible movie? Cheap Canadian production. THE BRAIN fits perfectly with those words. Terrible scripts, idiotic performances and funny special effects make this a must for all fans of BAD movies. The horror is hilarious. The postproduction team seems to have surrendered. What makes THE BRAIN admirable is in the second half, it really tries to be good! Can a little ingenuity and coherence save what is already a joke? <br /> <br /> It's at Christmas time. A mother and her daughter are killed by one of the funniest villains of all time. The day after, a rebellious teenager gets into enough trouble to be sent to a psychiatric analysis. <br /> <br /> If a policeman and a stranger with blood on him are cut off and a bloodied ax is told some children did it, who would you believe? What begins as funny becomes boring and tired towards the end when THE BRAIN tries to be serious. A child can not be scared by moments of fear. THE BRAIN is a concept too fun to try to be brave. The Psychological Research Institute is bigger than the main manufacturing plants! Our ugly villain and his cohorts get credit for having achieved some of the worst acts I've seen. The discretion of the viewer advises a lot.
