OK, the director remakes LOVE ACTUALLY Director Nikhil Advani after debuting with KHNH makes his second half and waits <br /> <br /> He makes a 3:30 movie + that loses patience, time.etc The viewer looks like a 3 hours of sleep watching this movie <br /> <br /> OK, they had 6 stories, so it was necessary, but why? 6 stories? <br /> <br /> We have the story of Anil-Juhi convincing but boring. Do not the television series show such stories? <br /> <br /> We have the story of Govinda-Shannon that is fun and works well <br /> <br /> We have a story of Akshaye-Ayesha again credible, but it gets boring soon and the focus is on more in the comedy and that boring comedy also boring <br /> <br /> We have the story of Salman-Priyanka, which is the worst thing, not only the terms of action, it does not make any sense <br /> <br / > We have the story of Sohail-Isha to make you laugh and the trick works sometimes thanks to the boredom established by most other stories <br /> <br /> We have a story of John-Vidya, a good story in all aspects <br /> <br /> But by the time all the stories come to pieces, the viewer becomes bored and numbed. However, the climax is not especially attractive The climax of the Salman-Priyanka story The handling of Nikhil Advani is good in some places, some stories are well managed but weak in places where music (SEL) is good, but too many songs The cinematography is good, each story is given a look, texture and works different <br /> <br /> Actors Govinda rocks, after a farewell return with BB, actually makes you laugh and love him in this movie Despite his age and weight, Anil Kapoor does his part well, although he looks out of shape and John is tired on his part, Akshaye Khanna dispenses with a change <br /> <br /> Sohail Khan is too exaggerated and Isha is not has nothing to do Anjana Suknani is fired <br /> <br /> Priyanka and Salman deserve a prize for this film, are you shocked? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Priyanka exaggerates such a standard that you want to throw something at her, she improves at the end Vidya Balan is fine, Juhi Chawla it's okay Shannon is fine
