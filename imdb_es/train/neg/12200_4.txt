In general, any movie with Sylvester Stallone will usually suck the ass. Rambo: First Blood Part II was no exception to this. The only films in which Sylvester Stallone was good were Rocky and First Blood. This movie is extremely unreal and boring. It has action, but not very good action. I did not enjoy watching it, and I would never see this again. No wonder why he won the Razzie Prize for the worst image. I would give this a 3/10, the only reason he got the 3 was because he had a good action, but not enough.
