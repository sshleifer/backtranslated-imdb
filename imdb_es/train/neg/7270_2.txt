I gave this movie loooooooooooong a "2" because of the sexy actors and the semi-sexy love scenes. Otherwise, if you can not read as a speed reader, you will NEVER surpass the subtitles that try to keep talking about speed in Spanish! And, what the hell is going on in the plot if you can not read the subtitles? Endless looks and bulging eyes and constant rejection. Just boring after an hour or so. A good photograph, but also something so DARK that you think your screen has burned. How this won something I will never understand. It is difficult to talk about "ACT", since the main actors seem to stare at each other and look at each other with love when they are not moving away. The character of Geraldo is so attractive that it is hard to believe that ANYONE pushes him. And what about his mother? They just did not GET IT most of the time, except there were three guys who seemed to have had a story between them ... but they never knew who it was from "EX".
