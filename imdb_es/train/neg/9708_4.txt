When the employees of a theater find an old roll of film, they decide to show it in the midnight projection of The Night of the Living Dead, assuming it is an old preview spool. Unfortunately, it's actually an old Nazi mind control experiment that turns the audience into a horde of senseless zombies. <br /> <br /> I can not understand the hatred for this movie. It is an independent low budget production with a lot of camping, but it does not deserve a "1.1" here in IMDb. It is fun. It is obvious that the filmmakers have a reasonable knowledge and love of the old horror films, and have created an entertaining tribute for them, peppered with references and tributes to a variety of them. It has the feeling of things like The Night of the Living Dead (in many ways, very similar), Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness, and several others. <br /> <br /> I liked the explanation of how the zombies. Actually, just hypnotized to think they are zombies, they actually have the physical attributes of the undead: incredible, maybe, but I appreciate the effort of the writers to explain it. The gore effects were decent for the budget, the performance was good and the story was entertaining. <br /> <br /> I liked it.
