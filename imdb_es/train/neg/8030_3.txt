I'm really not very interested in this. The story is quite horrible and unconvincing. I enjoyed the first 10 minutes, Bill nunns good. After that it was pretty scary. Tim does not fit into the role, he appears like a cocky car and taylor Vince de Pruitt is not convincing as a trumpeter. It is an idealistic film and as a musician, he feels a bit offended after seeing it. There are no scenes of 1900 practicing or playing with his bandmates, he is completely self-indulgent. I find it difficult to build a relationship with this type of character, maybe I'm watching the wrong movie. If you have no true passion for life or a sense of what music is, then enjoy the suspension of disbelief and watch this waffle.
