['When I was seventeen, I genuinely believed that Elvis was the king of rock and roll, and I not only wanted to see all his 31 &quot;character&quot; movies, but it was also my ambition to have them. What an exceptionally poor excuse for a seventeen-year-old child that I must have been. Fortunately, the sense prevailed and Live A Little, Love A Little is the only Elvis movie I have. <br /><br /> The spotlight has fallen on this topic recently since a remixed version of the main song A Little Less Conversation was released as a single. (The first to reach the top ten in the UK in 22 years - his first No.1 in the UK in 25) Even when I was seventeen and needed psychiatric help, I realized that the songs for this movie were not exactly first class. However, A Little Less Conversation (rollnecks and 60s groove) is a real highlight. Finding a lesser-known song of which only a few are aware of being promoted to the mainstream produces a mixture of emotions. It is good to finally see faith in a claimed song, but it is also sad to see the disintegration of your own private cult. (And what a chauvinistic lyrics, too, although what other Elvis song contains the word &quot;dilate&quot;?) <br /><br /> But what really bothers me about this movie is not a little less conversation, but the 84 minutes that surround it. Really based on a novel (Kiss My Firm But Pliant Lips - what kind of lame novel would it be?) This one sees a bored Elvis hidden with a &quot;comedy&quot; dog and a nymphomaniac. Within 90 seconds of meeting him, Michele Carey asks &quot;would you like to make love to me?&quot; A fairly fast engine by any standard, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll agree. <br /><br /> It seems I remember that some of Elvis&#39; early films, especially Jailhouse Rock and King Creole, were not so bad, but this is just the name of Hillbilly&#39;s cobblestones. Being fired from a job in a newspaper can lead to a five-minute karate fight with a couple of gingernuts, which causes a highway to pile up, it&#39;s good to laugh, and the models dress like pink mermaids. There is even a sequence of dreams for the love of God. Perhaps the only stupid stereotype with which he does not conform is not having so many songs. With only four to choose from, including the number of credits, you are waiting for an average of 22 minutes between the tracks. Some films become bland because they have too many melodies, but here they could have helped to numb the pain. Of the three remaining themes, then The Edge of Reality is not really that bad, although Elvis&#39; dance has surely been called &quot;The Bear Trap&quot;. <br /><br /> In a sense, for a film with PG certificate of 1968, this is surprisingly high in sexual content. Unfortunately, however, with the talking dogs, the Central American comedy values and the stiffer dance you&#39;ll ever see, Elvis&#39;s dignity is affected by this movie.']
