This must be one of the worst Swedish films ever made. <br /> <br /> It's shameful that such a bad script has been allowed to turn into a movie and show up in theaters as recently as 2006. <br /> <br /> I've never seen so many sponsored products visible. In one and the same movie. It should not be so obvious. <br /> <br /> I do not understand why so many well-known actors even thought that the idea would be visible in a movie like this one. If I have respected some of the actors known in this movie before watching the movie, I'm sure it's gone. <br /> <br /> I have heard that there will be a follow-up movie for this and I can not understand how it is possible.
