I never expect a film adaptation to follow the novel too closely (especially a beloved one, like Evening), but when I saw that the author of the book, Susan Minot, was a screenwriter and executive producer of the film, I thought Evening would do it. . Be a good adaptation. <br /> <br /> If you enjoyed the book, do not bother with this movie. It is so far from the book that the two almost do not look alike. <br /> <br /> Here, our characters are completely different: the bride is in love with Harris. Harris is the son of the housekeeper. Buddy is a drunk, in love with Ann and / or Harris. I do not believe that a single character has gone from the book to the screen; Oh, it just gets worse with every passing moment. <br /> <br /> And, really, we did not learn from Bridges of Madison County that we cut the story in which we are destined to be captivated, to the scenes of our heroes' adult children who have odious and juvenile fights, just do not work in the movie? This movie is a disaster. Skip it.
