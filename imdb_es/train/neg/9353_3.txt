I was attracted to the title ... I was expecting a deep and intriguing journey towards alcoholism, instead I got a rather boring and uninspiring story about a Scottish Scotsman. <br /> <br /> The main character does not receive much information. Depth psychological, unless you are willing to classify poetry of teen type cheesy as psychology. <br /> <br /> It was a shame, because the core of the story could have been good, with a better effort to represent the inner feelings. of a man who had to live with alcohol and violence since his youth. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the general idea seems to be more like "I am the way I am because I am like that". And the rhythmically bad attempt to give some kind of poetic advantage to a lower class man makes things even worse. Resorting to the abused cliché of the "poète maudit" reeks of a quick fix, a cheap way to make a boring movie look smart, artistic and meaningful. <br /> <br /> But "16 years of alcohol" is not much intelligent, artistic or significant ... The main character does not evolve at all, and the weak attempt to change fails without a good explanation. Just like the first attempt happened unexpectedly. <br /> <br /> The film is inspired by the classics like A Clockwork Orange and Trainspotting, but in the end it does not manage to recover its greatness, not even for a few seconds. <br /> <br /> Jobson put too much emphasis on the artistic side of the story, and neglected the rest, giving us a movie that is pleasing to the eye but insipid for the brain.
