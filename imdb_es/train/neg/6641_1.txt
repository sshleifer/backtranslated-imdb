I saw this movie twice. I can not believe that Pintilie made such a fantastic movie. I'm also a film / theater director and I know what I'm talking about. This is no longer Romania, but I see that events are happening in the same period with the September 11 incident. No history, no plot, nothing. There is no conclusion, there is no message, nothing deep, nothing hidden. Only empty images. <br /> <br /> What most Romanians do not know, this film is for French viewers, not for us. They really believe that this is the reality in Romania. Also for teenagers. Pintilie should stop making movies. I really do not know if we could call this movie, maybe horror. And we wonder why we have such an image in Europe. This was a reality, but it is not. A good friend of mine from the British Embassy said: "He has no idea how much the Romanians walked from Ceausescu."
