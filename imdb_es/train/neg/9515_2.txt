OK, I've seen the original French version. But I can not imagine that this is better with subtitles. <br /> <br /> All I have to say is that this is the most boring movie I've seen in a long time. There are almost no redeeming qualities in this movie. That's why I can not understand all the positive reviews. It may be realistic in a certain sense, but it is better not to tell some real stories. <br /> <br /> Usually, I like slow-paced movies as long as they serve the purpose of the movie. Tarkovsky's Solaris is extremely slow, but allows introspection and sets the mood of the movie, for example. But in this case, the film is presented only with a meaningless dialogue that manages to tell us little about the characters. Nothing that could identify or care for me. In many of the scenes I found myself thinking: "When are they going to shut up?" The acting was pretty bad. Not in an obvious exaggerated way. But it seems that none of the actors cared about their characters and everyone seemed to want to be somewhere else in most of the scenes. This could be due to the uninspired dialogue that was given to them. Also the whole flow of the movie felt quite mechanical. Moving from one scene to the next. It seems that this movie was just written (bad) but never addressed. <br /> <br /> This is one of the few films I can say that did not generate any emotional response in any of the scenes. Without suspense, without fear, without anticipation, without pain, without introspection, without intellectual stimulation, without any interest. <br /> <br /> A perfect example of what I call an anti-movie.
