I really wish I was not writing this review. I am a Christian, so I waited anxiously to see this movie. It seemed great, a Christian movie with some pretty famous stars and a plot that seemed intriguing (not that I bought the Bible Code itself, you can make it say what you want, I do, but I believe everything in the Bible). So I'm sitting on the edge of my seat enjoying the previews, when the movie starts and manages to destroy my state of mind in a matter of minutes. I had to bite my lip to stop commenting on the terrible writing and acting while I was in the theater (people would have cut me to pieces by watching the scenes awkward but basically inspiring and panting in the face of the incredibly obvious and predictable. safe). Once the final credits began to roll, however, I was able to reflect. There were many parts of the movie that I liked, some mostly unexpected twists of the plot, some effects that were really special (I do not count the Visions, they were badly done), and some interesting technical works: fades, sets, what kind of Unfortunately, I had the distinct impression that if I read the book of Revelation to a monkey and put it in front of a typewriter for an hour, I could have got a better script. And the music was more than corny (even for a Bond fan who likes a bit cheesy music in action and intrigue scenes). So I wish I could be like everyone else in the theater, like the people who came out crying and out of breath because of how amazing it was, but I'm not someone who can be appeased by a writer who throws some words about a biblical shell and hits a Christian stamp on it. I need a good plot and a credible dialogue before I can enjoy most of the movies, and this I did not have either. I'm sorry, but I would not recommend this movie to anyone. And that is the tragedy. When will we see some intelligent Christian fiction? It has to be out there somewhere ...
