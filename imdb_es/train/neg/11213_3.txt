OK ... I see many bad movies. I take pride in that fact. Many times there are some gems in bombs classified B But this movie is one of the worst I've seen. I like a good horror movie ... but one with a plot and a sense of movement. The first scenes seemed pretty good. Decent music and images. Then go down the hill from there. One of the main characters has a disability (Ringing in the Ears called Tinnitus). Now this in turn will threaten to reveal his secret. They did that too focused on the movie. Then, what he has ringing in his ears and accidentally left a stopper where he should not have been. There is no need to continue mentioning it. So this guy is having an affair with this girl and in a motel he falls and hits his head on the side table. Then, instead of letting everyone know about his adventure, he decides to get rid of the body. Now her twin sister is trying to figure out where she is and what happened to her. Well, after seeing her sister again and again (like a zombie as a ghost) and even pointing directly at the body's location, she finally finds her. Now the body is recovered and is willing to deal with the only suspect who killed her. The trouble is that she did not have much plan. Just to pretend to be his twin and meet the guy where the body was thrown. The idiot did not even think he killed her. So everything is revealed there and even though she had a weapon ... somehow she manages to strangle herself. So the last scenes of the film are of the "spirits" of her and her twin coming out of the water. So you want to tell me in this movie that the bad guy wins. And not one, but two innocent people die. <br /> <br /> Good things about the movie: images <br /> <br /> Bad things about the movie: the sound effects of the music are long and the wrong direction of the low-rated plot Acting from some actors not all
