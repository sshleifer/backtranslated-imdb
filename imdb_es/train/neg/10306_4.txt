After watching a dozen episodes, I decided to give up this program, since it unrealistically describes what mathematical modeling is. In the episodes where Charlie would predict the future behavior of people who use mathematical models, I thought he was joking about my profession. I am not a mathematician, but a chemical engineer, but I work a lot with mathematical models. So I will try to explain to the layman why what is shown is close to "making believe" fairy tales. <br /> <br /> First, choosing the right model to predict a situation is a demanding task. Charlie Eppes is shown as a genius, but even he would have to spend considerable time looking for a suitable model, specifically to try to guess what someone will do or where he will be in the near future. Individuals are erratic and random, there are no models for them. Isaac Asimov even wrote about it in the 1950s. Even if there were a model for a specific type of individual, it would be a probabilistic (stoicotic) model, which means that it has a good chance of making an incorrect prediction. <br /> <br /> Second, assuming that the correct model for someone or a situation is found, the parameters of the model must be known. These parameters are the constants of the equations, such as the acceleration of gravity (9.8 m / s2) and, often, they are not easy to determine. Once again, Charlie Eppes would have to be someone beyond genius to know the correct parameters for the model he chooses. And once the model and parameters are chosen, they would have to be tested. Curiously, they are not, and by miracle, they exactly fit the situation that is being predicted. <br /> <br /> Third, a very important aspect of modeling is almost always neglected, not only by Numbers, but also by science fiction. -fi movies: the computational effort required to solve these models. Try to make Excel solve a complex model with many equations and variables and one will find doing a herculean work. Even if Charlie Eppes has the right software to solve his models, he may be left with a hardware that will be terribly slow. And even with the right combination of software / hardware, the model solution could take days to be reached. He solves them immediately! I could use your computer in my research work, I would be very happy. <br /> <br /> As a drama, it is far from being the best show. The characters are somewhat stereotyped, but not even remotely funny as are those of Big Bang Theory. The crimes are boring and the way Charlie Eppes solves them sometimes makes the FBI look quite incompetent. <br /> <br /> For some lay people, the show could work. For others, the way things are handled makes it difficult to swallow them.
