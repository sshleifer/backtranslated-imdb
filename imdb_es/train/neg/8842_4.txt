Somehow it is revealing that most of the great reviews of the film in IMDb come from people who have only reviewed a film in their entire career in IMDb and, yes, you guessed it, that movie is "Parasomnia". I have often suspected suspiciously good comments on IMDb for what turns out to be a movie that is not as good as undercover marketing, but it seems fairly transparent in this case. <br /> <br /> That does not mean that the parasomnia is terrible, but it does not become the good or the great movie that has the potential to be. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, he has a big bad guy in Patrick Kilpatrick, who does a brilliant job of projecting threats and evil. I could easily see him have what it takes to play a truly memorable villain on par with Hannibal Lecter. There are some beautiful images in the sequences of the dreams, in fact, if the film had decided to explore that terrain more, it could have been something better. The actual concept of deceptive misuse of hypnosis is also great. <br /> <br /> Although I understand that the suspension of disbelief is necessary for immersion in any good story, it is the mark of a good story that succeeds in letting you do that. If you feel upset about what seems illogical or simply silly, then the story is losing you and that is what happened to me with this movie. Other critics have mentioned this here and I do not want to get into spoiler territory, but I will say that the configuration at the end was particularly absurd and disappointing, not to mention the varied mental age of a character who is only supposed to have experienced a few years of life . <br /> <br /> In short, there is the germ of a great idea here in diabolically used hypnotism, but unfortunately this movie has not become something special.
