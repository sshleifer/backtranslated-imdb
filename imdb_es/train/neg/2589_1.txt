For those with little time on their hands, I will summarize it quickly, in a word ... pathetic. There are many good examples of why this movie fits perfectly with that description. So much that you can barely spend 2 minutes of time on the screen without seeing something completely stupid and without forced sense about you. Do you want a woman completely naked in the first 10 minutes? You got it! The reason why she appears is so useless, however, that it really sets the tone for the rest of this juvenile crap. You can almost glimpse the deceived minds of the 12-year-olds who wrote this piece of junk just by looking at this shit that they expect the public to pay for. <br /> <br /> I have seen many movie franchises decline over the years, but American Pie; Beta House has to be one of the worst offenders if we consider that, despite the average nature of the original movie, it is still a thousand times more fun than this game. <br /> <br /> The plot is predictable, and sometimes you feel like you're watching a school play. The things that happen in this movie are so unrealistic that it takes a lot of suspension of disbelief to really see them (we're talking about Star Wars suspension levels, like the kind you need to convince you that Jar Jar is real). <br /> <br /> The plot is very thin and most of the events that happen are just to show another pair of breasts or create another pathetic joke. There is no talent to act of what to speak, all you get is a group of handsome boys who try to make us laugh. And ohhh how they fail !!!! Each gag collapses and the only thing I laughed at was how socially unconscious the writers seem to be. How else can you explain to the bulls ** t try to pass as a story? <br /> <br /> They pass up all the opportunities to do something worthwhile and entertain themselves in favor of the lowest, badly written, common nonsense. The characters must complete a certain number of tasks before they are accepted as members of Beta House, but this is mainly through a series of very brief assemblies that imply that they are completing the tasks, but we see little or no evidence of it. actually happening It's a very lazy way of telling a story. He also loses the opportunity to be funny when doing it. (Imagine saying The Wizard of Oz, where all the important events happened off the screen instead of doing it, and all we see is Dorothy giving it to the scarecrow from time to time and saying "Wow!" It was probably a great adventure that we had back then ") Lazy, Lazy, LAZY !!!! <br /> <br /> Female characters have little or nothing to say, all they do is undress for no apparent reason and they are used as visual accessories in the larger part of the movie, you will not be disappointed that you only look for T & A, but for that reason you will be embarrassed, if you buy this on DVD, it will contribute to the ruin of society in a special way.
