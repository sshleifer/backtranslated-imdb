Sometimes, doing something strange and contemporary does not always work for the benefit of all. Although I must admit that the design and concept of the film were quite interesting, the execution of these ideas in a congruent story simply did not work. This movie was so horribly slow and meaningless, that not even Robin Williams could save this garbage. It is obvious that Barry Levinson's dream fell on his face, but he should have warned the rest of the world about this fall.
