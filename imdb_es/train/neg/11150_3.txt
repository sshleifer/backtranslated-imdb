I saw this movie alone, in the dark, and there was a full moon outside! I did not do it on purpose, it just happened like this. So all the elements were there for this movie to scare me so much! Well, it was not like that, in fact, I wanted to turn off the DVD player after only 8 minutes, but I thought we were going to give it a try, unfortunately I did. The performance was horrible, the only one with some decent performance was Samaire Armstrong. The plot is not original, if you're a fan of horror, it's the same thing you've seen many times before. Some scenes did not make sense at all, and you only have the feeling that the director wanted to extend the movie! The monster was the biggest disappointment of the movie. The scenes (terrifying) seemed to belong to a horror movie of the 80s when there was not enough technology, but at that time they made good movies! I was surprised to see the name of a major production company at the beginning of the film, I thought they could not put some money in this and make it decent? !! I could not be more in agreement with the qualifications that the film obtained, it is also my qualification for her, 3 out of 10.
