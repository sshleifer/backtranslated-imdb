How cynical writers are, to please him like that. He may be a US citizen, but I do not need to see other Americans patting each other on the back for an hour and a half to enjoy a movie. I'm surprised that so few have commented on how jingoistic, sentimental and trite the dialogue in this film really is. The historical inaccuracies of the film are not as rude and offensive as in "U-571" (which changes British divers to Americans), but you still feel a little sloppy. Actually, the Germans in this movie do nothing but admire the Americans between battle scenes! How sad, unnecessary! I would just like to tell the writers: it is obvious to many of us that you can not capture real people, with real problems, under real pressure, and that you have taken some very well-tested shortcuts. Luckily for you, there will always be nationalist fans to appreciate your sugar-coated gut.
