The one-page campaign and newspaper suggested (as they often did) a piece much more rugged and violent than the one that appeared on the drive-in screens. Claude Brook is actually an Americanization of Claudio Brook, who worked in movies for years. This is hard enough to find more; I would love to see him again to compare him with other international horrors of the day, but I do not remember having impressed him when. Most likely, it was a fragmented version that hit US theaters and videos. UU But oh, that sheet ... it's still a jewel in my later horror collection.
