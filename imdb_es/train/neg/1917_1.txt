This film, although it is not totally bad, should have been filmed where the real events took place. Grand Island, Nebraska, was devastated by no less than seven tornadoes on the night of June 3, 1980. Grand Island is located in the valley of the Platte River, almost treeless, in Hall County. The creators of this film filmed on the tree-covered hills of Ontario and moved the entire event to a non-existent city called Blainsworth. The people of Grand Island bravely survived this horrible night and forgot it because of a bad movie.
