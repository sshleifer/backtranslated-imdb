Do we really need more narcissistic trash in the Baby Boomer generation? Technically, I am a Boomer, although at the moment when all the "idealistic young people" of the 60s read Marx, they burned their draft cards and generally prolonged a war that destroyed tens of thousands of lives; I was still in elementary school. But I remember them well, and 9 out of 10 were stupid fools, who believed anything as long as it was destructive. <br /> <br /> This is just another self-important exercise for children that never really grew up.
