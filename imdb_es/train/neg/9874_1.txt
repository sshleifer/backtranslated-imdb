A fabulous book about a fox and his family that does what foxes do. who is stealing from the farms and killing prey. until a trio of farmers decide they have had enough of this fox and try in several ways to solve the problem. Of course, they are "out of tune" every turn and while the trio is camped in the fox hole, the family raids the land of the three farmers. <br /> <br /> The "movie" version, and I use the term film very lightly, is rather a dreadful pastiche of American films, particularly the Oceans films. They even have George Clooney as Mr. Fox to join in the insult and manage to ignore the point of the story completely. So congratulations to them. They will earn a lot of money and destroy another classic Roald Dahl book for children.
