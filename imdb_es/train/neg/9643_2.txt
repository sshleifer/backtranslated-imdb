Film below average with little music considering a movie based on music. Ordinary script and direction with full of errors. Salman Khan was in his usual performance. Ajay's performance deteriorated over time as his appearance, especially his styles such as Rock Star, were pathetic. Asin was only a masterpiece. In general, I wanted to spend my money at the cinema. Salman Khan is still as immature as 10 years ago compared to Aamir Khan. There were many boring songs in the movie, except "Man Ko Ati". The most important song to impress the music sponsor of the United Kingdom was most impressive. "Khanabad" can be easily understood by a music sponsor in English. The other movie I saw last week was "Wake Up Sid", which was a simple and slow love story with good direction and acting despite the average music
