I read half a dozen comments from other users in this forum and it seems that opinions vary a lot. I have to agree with those who considered this movie horrible. It hurts me to write that, since I would have expected this to have been great, or I would not have bothered to see it the other day. I like to support indie movies, especially if they are gay-themed, but this movie is too much to tolerate. Those who withdrew, as I thought I would after about three minutes, probably did not mind spending $ 11.00, or I just thought I was not going anywhere, fast, and that I was not going to get better. Maybe I'm a little more optimistic than they are ... or that or they did not pay to enter in the first place. <br /> <br /> Logan is bored. He is a klutz He is homosexual. I'm fine with that. The problem is that because the main character in a movie is boring it does not necessarily mean that the movie about him is boring too! There are ENDLESS scenes of this child simply reclining as a load of clothes, restoring everything he has already learned in the first scene, and the second scene, etc., etc ... Nothing or nobody is going anywhere. NOBODY says anything remotely insightful, funny or interesting. Probably the scariest thing of all is that I did not feel the slightest empathy for Logan. That in itself is a great achievement. He did not grow up, he did not change, he did not learn (there is nobody to teach him anything), HE DID NOTHING, and the movie either! Scene after scene of the same do not make a movie. <br /> <br /> In addition, the title does not make any sense at all. 1/10.
