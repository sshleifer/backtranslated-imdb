After the release of Cube 2: Hypercube (2003), and taking advantage of the alleged success of the original Cube (1998), Director Ernie Barbarash takes the liberty of bringing us the third installment of the trilogy, the Cube Zero prequel. <Br /> <br /> In the bowels of a giant institution with no face, time and place unknown, two low-ranking operators, Wynn (Zachary Bennett) and Dodd (David Huband) sit and watch on the monitors the behavior of people who have been placed in a giant network of cubic cameras, some of which are equipped with deadly traps. By telling them that the people they are observing are convicted criminals who chose this terrible and deadly experience over a lethal injection, these observers have had no problems with their work until Wynn, a mathematical genius, discovers that one of the prisoners, a woman called Cassandra (Stephanie Moore) never agreed to be put inside the Cube. Suddenly, he realizes that maybe his "jobs" are not what they seem, and that they can be part of something deeply sick and twisted ... <br /> <br /> For people who have seen and enjoyed of the original Cube, this Prequel is probably not to your liking. It's not that history has no potential; it's just that the first Cube movie never had to expand. Solo, is a small and exciting psychological thriller with very interesting concepts and a certainty about your own message. It was also very well self-contained. The problem with Cube Zero is that it destroys part of the mystique of the original, trying to answer questions with more questions, but it only results in a mess that was never necessary to fix. <br /> <br /> What this new movie What it has to offer, which is questions about the psychological nature of authoritarianism and the banality of evil, are certainly good questions to ask, but they probably should have been done by their own merits, and not as a continuation of a movie that did not have such aspirations. <br /> <br /> Having said that, the other features of the film, such as acting, directing and writing, are not terrible. The film has a dark and dark aspect, similar to the black cinema like 'The Matrix' and 'Dark City', and they have certainly managed to recover the claustrophobic feeling of the first Cube. Unfortunately for Barbarash, these are not enough positive qualities to save him.
