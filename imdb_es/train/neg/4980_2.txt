I just read a review that defends this movie because I had a low budget, now my opinion is. <br /> <br /> The CGI monsters were reasonably well animated but implemented in the worst possible way. The fight scenes were not even fights, it was just an actor's shot and a monster shot with lots of interaction. When the monster interacted, it looked like it was made in Paintshop Pro. In my opinion, if you have a low budget, you should use models and puppets. They may not look so elegant, but at least they interact, just look at the first Peter Jackson movies. <br /> <br /> As for the performance, Beowulf did a downhill job but the rest of the cast did not try it or they forgot. where were you. <br /> <br /> The script seemed confusing. In a minute, they would be talking as if it were a modern stage, the next is Shakespeare's speech from the drama club. I'm not saying that it should be all 'ye' and 'whatever', but you need to find a cohesive equilibrium so that the lines sound as if they were from the same person. <br /> <br /> I noticed one almost at the beginning, when Beowulf quoted the old testament that he would have found if he had not spent the rest of the films talking about gods and portents. <br /> <br /> In summary, this movie is a bit polished. turd, but a turn no less.
