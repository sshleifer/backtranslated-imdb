Jason Lee does everything he can to bring the fun to a silly situation, but the film fails to establish a connection. <br /> <br /> Maybe because the character of Julia Stiles seems uncomfortable as the intriguing and sexy will soon be cousin. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's because she and Selma Blair's characters should have been chosen in the opposite way. (Selma Blair seems more intriguing than Julia would be). <br /> <br /> Either way, this movie is another Hollywood trivialization of a possible real-world situation (the fact that you get caught with your pants at your bachelor party does not tip your cousin), that although promises not to comply <br /> <br /> There is some laughter to be sure and the cast (even if it is a mistake) does everything possible with sub grade material that does not transcend its obscene theme. So instead of getting a successful raunch festival (ie, Animal House or American Pie) we are left with a mid-point of humor in part and in part stupidity (wing Meatballs 2 or something like that).
