Why else would I do this? <br /> <br /> It's not that I expect Dean Cain to produce successful films. Or even decent movies. I saw Lois and Clark, I am aware of what ... "good" is Dean Cain. <br /> <br /> Obviously, this is going to be a cheese movie, and every cheese movie has its own special way of making you scratch your head. I will not call these spoilers since you can not really spoil this movie more than what it already is. <br /> <br /> To begin with, why is it a fake helicopter? I mean ... why? <br /> <br /> Why is one scientist from Chicago and another scientist from Los Angeles and neither could be more from Eastern Europe if they tried? How difficult would it have been to get an American actor, or just change that sheet of state that the film gives us to say that these people are not American? <br /> <br /> Why are there 2 occasions when the movie? gives us a slug line? We received the day of the heliport and then the day of the dining room. And that's it, who cares about the timeline. To be honest, who cared even when they mentioned it, but I guess that's irrelevant. <br /> <br /> Does the movie really improve if you can see it on several split screens? The answer is no. <br /> <br /> That dragon can walk down that aisle ... about ... and more ... and more ... and more ... <br /> <br /> Who on earth? Was responsible for one of the worst endings in the history of cinema? It went directly from Scooby Doo. Oh, the dragon is dead now ... tell me, do you want to have dinner? Sure, but not in some Chinese place ... with Dragon in the name! AH HA HA HA !! HAHAHA!! HAHAHA! I used to be Superman! AHA HA HA! HAHA! <br /> <br /> faded to black <br /> <br /> My God, it made me tremble that I was so stupid. <br /> <br /> But never be afraid ... even though the whole building exploded ... and no one was left alive ... for some reason, there is a second unmanned and intact lab that survived quite well, so they can make a sequel. Hurray for all of us. <br /> <br />
