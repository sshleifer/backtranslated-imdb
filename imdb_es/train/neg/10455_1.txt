$ 25,000 pyramid tracks: deep blue sea. Tremors Slip. Eight Legged Freaks. <br /> <br /> Pyramid category: movies that were more fun and exciting than Snakes on a Plane. <br /> <br /> Hell, with that definition I would have to include the relatively heartbreaking Journey of Ted and Elaine by plane! as superior to Snakes in both laughter and emotion. <br /> <br /> The sad truth is that this is not even like the mother of all the involuntarily intentional funny snake movies: Anaconda! In addition to never seeing the casting of JLo-Cube-O.Wilson-Stoltz-Wuhrer in the same film, Jon Voight achieved the film theft of all time. Only his last scene represents everything that SOAP tried and could not do as a "so ridiculous and funny" movie. <br /> <br /> In the end, Snakes on a Plane is the ultimate test that studio executives and fanboys make The worst possible collaborators. Every big scene had been discussed and dissected so much last year, all that was left for fun the night of the opening was the amount of fanboy sweat that had to be cleaned in my theater. I heard more forced laughter here than in a studio recording for "According to Jim".
