Cut tries to be like most post-Scream slashers, a parody of the horror genre that tried to be clever when referring to other famous horror movies. Now, I'm not packing 'Scream', because I think 'Scream' is a very good horror movie that does a great job of combining horror and comedy. The cut fails at most levels. It has its moments, but in general it does not work, not even as a movie "as bad as good", but below average. <br /> <br /> The first five minutes are fine and set the story quite well, apart from the fact that Kylie Minogue really can not act, and ironically, she takes off her tongue, imagine. Move forward a little and a group of film students want to finish their movie, which apparently is cursed. And, as you've probably predicted, one by one, the cast and crew are slowly selected by a masked madman. <br /> <br /> The non-original plot, the bad performance and a predictable ending are some of the elements that follow. There are many references in the film, everything from 'Scream' to 'The Texas Chain Saw Massacre'. This is not smart either, it feels as if the director wants to feel smart and great when mentioning other famous horror movies like Scream. For a slasher there is a minimum of gore and there is no nudity, which is a big negative when it comes to a slasher that does not have much in its favor. Actually, I should support this film because I'm Australian and we're not that good at horror (although we have our gems), but Cut is definitely not one of them. <br /> <br /> However, he kept me watching for about 90 minutes, so at least it's a good thing. I would not recommend this to anyone, except hardcore fans, who might appreciate what this movie is trying to achieve, but if you're looking for a good movie, get away. <br /> <br /> 2/5
