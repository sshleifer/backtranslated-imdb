ba ba ba bored ...... this is next to the battlefield of earth in science fiction asleep. genie francis (also known as laura general hospital) has a small role as a reporter and that, in itself, should tell you that this movie must be bad ... there is ben kingsley (an actor awarded in the academy) in this smelly and some other decent actors. You have to wonder what possessed them to decide to make this horrible movie. The music rises and falls dramatically as if it were a great dramatic story. Even if you pay attention to the plot it is impossible to follow it. The effects are also mediocre and seem really outdated. All the actors speak in a monotonous voice and have no realism in their dialogue. I could go on and on how this is a bad movie. At least with Battlefield Earth it's so bad that it's funny, but this is just an error. Avoid unless you want to be let sleep.
