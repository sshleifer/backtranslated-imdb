They annoyed me when I could not see this when it was screened at the Philly Film Fest last year, so when I saw it was going to be on cable tonight, I remembered it as soon as I did. might. So, was it worth the wait? Well, back off a bit, since I still have to give you the plot. Sean Crawley is a young man who does not know his way in life. Enter Duke (George Wendt) who introduces him to his boss Ray (Danny Baldwin). One night, Ray gave a total hammering to Sean to remove the boy who had Sean following him. And it continues from there. Which brings me back to the question posed. It was worth the wait? Yes and no, the accumulation was quite good and George Wendt stole the movie. He just took the ball and ran with it. But it is not as violent as I was led to believe and at some point in the cinema, time is not only dropped, it is made clumsy and taken in the other direction. I know where exactly this point happened, but I can not say it without spoiling the film. But it goes without saying that it happened. The ending does not save the movie either. Poor Stuart Gordon, nothing can be good like "Re-animator" or "Castle Freak". <br /> <br /> My grade: C <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Showtime Extreme <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Kari Wuhrer shows her tatas in a fantasy and then in the next ta-tas and low and ... OH MY GOD, MY EYES, MY EYES !!!!!
