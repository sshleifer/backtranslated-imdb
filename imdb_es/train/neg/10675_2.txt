You have to understand that when the name of the star appears wrong in the opening credits, you are not in a good moment (the credit says "Cuba Gooding, J.R."). Some good car chase, shoot them, exploit the action if ALL you want is action, because the relationship with the plot that exists is, in the best of cases, tenuous and completely incredible. The motivations of the characters, especially Gooding's in the end, are worse than incredible, they are irrational when they are not confused irremediably. All I can think is that Andy Cheng should be a good guy to get so many good actors to participate in this project (he can not have anything in all of them, right?).
