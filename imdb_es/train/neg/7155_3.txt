I'm sorry but I did not like this document very much. I can think of a million ways that could have been better. The people who did it obviously do not have much imagination. The interviews are not very interesting and a real vision is not offered. The images are not assembled in a very informative way, either. It's a shame because this is a movie that really deserves fascinating special features. One thing I'm going to say is that Isabella Rosselini becomes more beautiful as she grows older. All considered, this only gets a '4'.
