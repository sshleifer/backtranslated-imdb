Thanks to an infamous distributor of home videos that brought the so-called German Independent Series, Four For Venice is not only horrible, but really horrible. So horrible, that I left it at the second-hand store to get extra money. <br /> <br /> Nick and Charlotte are a married couple who agreed to have sex only on Tuesday because of the hectic schedule of their profession. Eva and Luis are a couple that lives from hand to mouth, where Eva works as a waitress and Luis, an artist. Nick indirectly makes Eva lose her job as a waitress. Luis and Charlotte had an adventure on the back of Eva and Nick. Luis cheated on Eve by lying to him that he would fly to London to do something related to his artwork, but the fact is that he is flying to Venice with Charlotte for a vacation of adultery. Eva kidnapped Nick and dragged her 2 children to Venice for the confrontation. The trip to Venice ends with Nick and Eva falling for each other. <br /> <br /> The presentation of the trip from Germany to Venice between Nick and Eva marks the failure of comedy. It not only looks meaningless, but also dragging. In the movie, Nick tries to seek help in several ways, but ends up in vain. Either they are the strangers that surround him who act like idiots, or they are just fools. <br /> <br /> The comedy also tended to add unnecessary scenes to extend the story. While some of the problems can be solved with common sense, no one in the movie are using common sense to solve the problem. They prefer to go through a big round to solve the problem. <br /> <br /> It's so bad, that even the beautiful landscapes of Venice can not recover the reputation of the film.
