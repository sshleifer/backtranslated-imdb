Please, avoid these movies that teach us that crime is fun and justified. Combine that with an empty script with an intense desire to be a Farrelly or a Coen brother, plus the lives of ANOTHER group of supposedly high school people who represent their Dawson Creek teen angst complete with a GenXYZ soundtrack that try to make the film feel "cool" and, we have an intense and painfully inept satire. <br /> <br /> This is not even 'Ferris Bueller' diluted ... I'd rather see a change at the traffic light. <br /> <br /> Only one scene is highlighted by the price of admission: when the girls of Betty Masked meet a friend of Richard Nixon Masked. It's a surreal moment. It even has no price. <br /> <br /> But for the rest, I prefer to have a toothache. At least I can apply some benzocaine (tm) to stop the pain.
