This is not a good movie. Too much preaching in parts and the story line was sub par. 3D was fine, but not excellent. I almost fell asleep in this movie. <br /> <br /> The story is about 3 young flies that want to have adventures and follow them. The characters are missing, I really do not care about these characters and I feel there was nothing to keep an interested adult. Pixar this is not it. <br /> <br /> I would have liked to see more special 3D effects. I would also like to see more fly jokes than the mother constantly saying "The Lord of the Flies", quite sexist when showing women as wives and fainting.
