Definitely, product of young minds, this piece could very well attract the crowd of 20, who is still trying to find their place in the world, while obsessing with all neuroses. However, I can not imagine that the large number of narcissists who look at the navel, the trivial humor or the banal theme are particularly attractive for anyone over 30 years. Another problem is that the peripheral characters, to whom the filmmakers obviously have nothing but contempt, are promoted to such absurd cartoons for the comic effect, which can not be related in any real way. <br /> <br /> However, one has to give some points of style to the filmmakers, who obviously grew up in the generation of videos, and use every conceivable editing trick in the book to fix a plot that would otherwise does not exist. . There are 2 points to remember here. First of all, be careful with the festival favorites. Secondly, although we live in the YouTube era, not all the stories of their worldly lives deserve treatment on the big screen. But these young filmmakers have every right to make their film, and if other 20-somethings can find something to identify with, then much better. However, I could not help thinking, at the end of this film, how this last generation, now that it is coming of age, will unfold in the real world that presents so many challenges and complications. At the time when each child is constantly sure of how special they are, and that everyone deserves their 15 minutes of exposure, the resistance and the ability to face adversity does not seem to be precisely the strength of this generation.
