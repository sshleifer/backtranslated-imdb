I can not believe how horrible this movie turned out to be. I feel magnanimous even referring to this as a "movie." The performance was flat, the editing was terrible and the plot leaves many important questions unanswered. The premise was correct, though not original: a small group of aliens is living in the United States and trying to slowly take over humanity. But it goes quickly downhill from there. How could you convince a "human" to accept an extraterrestrial as his wife so they can become alien-human hybrids that require? They show an alien larva but they never show what it does. They have a plastic surgeon who can produce a perfect-looking skin on an industrial scale. They pull on the huge obligatory alien monster with their teeth. The ending was almost too painful to watch. I guess I'm disappointed that Bruce Boxlietner has something to do with this. How could he tell the huge alien monster with teeth, "Get away from him, son of b * tch" with a serious face? It is a long fall from his Babylon 5 days. Avoid this at all costs.
