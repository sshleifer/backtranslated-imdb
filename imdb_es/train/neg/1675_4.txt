The plot certainly seemed quite interesting. How can a brutal murder in real life become a really boring movie? Well, you can see "Wonderland" and discover it. <br /> <br /> I had heard about the Wonderland murders before this movie was released and discovered that it was an interesting real story of some genuinely sadistic people. Unfortunately, there is no character development, so we never have the opportunity to understand why any of this was done or to have a clear idea of ​​the interrelationships between the characters. The pace of the direction was very tedious. All this leads to an extraordinarily boring movie. <br /> <br /> Given that Dawn Schiller, a central character like Holmes 'girlfriend, was an associate producer and that Holmes' wife was a consultant in the film, we should have had the opportunity to get a real insight into the characters.
