Well, to answer a person's question of "why does not anyone remember this movie?" It is because really, not many people saw it in 1978 and since then it has not been seen much on television. (If it's a video, that would be something new for me!) Even in the age of sometimes mindless comedies that were the 70s, moviegoers had the intelligence to avoid this movie. Unless you love Billy Crytal, Paul Lynde or Joan Rivers "that" a lot! <br /> <br /> Paul Lynde was more fun in "Bewitched" or "Hollywood Squares" than here. Joan Rivers at this point in her career was laughing making cruel jokes about the lack of weight of the singer Karen Carpenter! Har-har Joan! It also seems that every "somewhat" famous name of the era is in the cast. (The most surprising thing is Doris Roberts after "Everybody Loves Raymond.") <br /> <br /> Anyway, a good idea for a story, a man who gets pregnant instead of the woman is wasted here. With the help of a friend, Crystal prepares with a prostitute to finally lose her virginity, but as she was "on top" instead of him, he gets pregnant! (A comment about women who take positions of power away from men). <br /> <br /> Crystal's stomach grows, traversing all female emotions and related feelings. Unfortunately, he is now a socially misunderstood outcast! He was attacked by a mob that wants him erased (I suppose). <br /> <br /> He is forced to seclude himself to have his baby ... in a barn. Or if you prefer, a manger (God only knows where it could have come from! Ewwww!) It turns out (no surprise here) to be a girl! <br /> <br /> Everything else about this movie is useless and forgettable, humor is of secondary or lower level. <br /> <br /> 2 stars for a good idea and some touching and relevant good times w / Billy Crystal. Ignore the rest of Rabitt's test, fly big! <br /> <br /> I can not believe that Roddy McDowell has signed either! (FINISH)
