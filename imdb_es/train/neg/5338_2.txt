Elvis Presley plays a Native American "mestizo" ("Indian") who has to defend his reserve from the business magnates. Everyone likes to get drunk, fight and have children. Fighting, fighting and "fighting" replace the stereotyped expression "How"? <br /> <br /> Although he has makeup, it is obvious that Elvis is healthier than he appeared in previous films. ; possibly, he was preparing for his famous "comeback". It could not have been because the script of this movie was something to get excited about. Joan Blondell trying to seduce Elvis, and Burgess Meredith in "war paint", should feel ashamed. <br /> <br /> The best song is "Stay Away" (actually, "Green Sleeves" with different lyrics). The most shameful song is Elvis' love song for the "Dominic" bull. There are some surreal scenes, but they never get enough tripled to be successful in that genre; however, "Stay Away, Joe" can provide some laughter if you are in the right "mood". <br /> <br /> Otherwise, stay away. <br /> <br /> ** Stay Away, Joe (1968) Peter Tewksbury ~ Elvis Presley, Burgess Meredith, Joan Blondell
