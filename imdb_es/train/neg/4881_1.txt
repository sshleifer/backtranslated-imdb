This is the most boring and worthless garbage in which I have wasted an hour of my life. All I can say is that thank God it was only an hour. More than half of this "film" is original "Criminally Crazy" footage. At a minimum, I could see the highlights of that rare exploitation classic, because for some reason that defies reality, my video store only has "Criminally Insane II" (as it was, "Crazy Fat Ethel II") . But the rest of this movie is one of the worst home video performances and feature films you've ever seen. Why does my video store have this and not the original? Why do things like these end up in video stores? Why do people rent it and not immediately burn the copy once it has seen its sheer horror? Why? AAUUGGHH - Why, God, why? <br /> <br /> Unless you enjoy watching annoying fruits by eating a whole chocolate bar in an extremely slow scene, or said fruit hanging from the stair railing in an even slower scene, or a character being stabbed laterally (do not ask) several times on the back, or brain cell killer monologues about giving poisoned tea to the wife and then complaining that the whole conversation has caused the tea itself to cool, or mentally eating delayed food or just wanting to see Crazy Fat Ethel dancing with a bloody knife in a garden: Do not watch this movie. Repeat: DO NOT watch this movie. Do not rent this movie. If possible, do not go through a shelf in a video store that has a copy of this movie configuration. You can still be saved, but now it's too late for me. . .
