Considering that I wanted to choose a new Jet Li movie to see some, but I kick and fight hand to hand, I took this title. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie contains more gun battles (Chow Yun Fat wing). but not nearly as good), that Jet Li and the company's stunt fights. Therefore, it was a disappointment. <br /> <br /> The fight against the tap was interesting and even funny, considering that this was something totally unexpected in a Jet Li movie for me, more in line with the Jackie Chan line. <Br /> <br /> But, unfortunately, I would recommend Fist of Legend, Tai Chi Master or even the Enforcer for this disappointment. <br /> <br /> Rating 4 for martial arts Rating 3 for the overall score of the film
