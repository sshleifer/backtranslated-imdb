I saw this movie the first time around twelve o'clock on a Saturday night. It really is the perfect time for this. Never, I have NEVER seen a movie that was more predictable and full of stereotypes. If you want to see an exciting action movie, do not see it because you could lose the will to live in the middle. However, if you want to laugh, please, look at it! I even bought the 3DVD collection from Chuck Norris thanks to my nice Saturday night. What struck me especially is that the scene that I would have to do was copied from a Discovery documentary or an old US Army television special. UU Also, I was surprised by the fact that they did not put any effort into making the production look real. As far as I can remember, Afghanistan is not close to any sea and yet, with a single click, Deke escapes from the sandcastle terrorists with his jet-pack and is taken by a submarine (probably the Discovery). Later in the film, Deke throws a terrorist Islam against the wall. In the slow-motion scene, you can wonderfully see the long hairs of a Korean double flapping in the air when they crash against the wall. I will love it. I recommend that you look at it with some friends and with a good amount of beer, that's the only way you'll understand why I got angry enough to spend 6.99 euros on the box.
