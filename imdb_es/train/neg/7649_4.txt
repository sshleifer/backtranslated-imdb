Joyce Reynolds looks like a mature person for the role of Janie, a sixteen-year-old girl who is crazy about children in a small city in the United States who leaves her stable boy for a visiting soldier and ends up on the cover of Life magazine (kissing a general party)) All in the same week! Tireless bombardment of jokes, dejected, bull chats and small business details like Janie's little sister bribing members of her family, Hattie McDaniel (as the maid) who constantly slips away after the sassy sister, Janie's mother involved with the Red Cross. and Janie's father, who tries to write an editorial about problems with today's teenagers (like the parents, Edward Arnold, affectionate and disgusting, and the Ann Harding talk is an unlikely pair, even by 1944; help to conceive a child much less). raising two of them). Nominated for an Academy Award (!) For the Owen Marks edition, Warner Bros. followed this in 1946 with "Janie Gets Married". Reynolds must have surpassed her cohorts by then, she was replaced by Joan Leslie. * 1/2 of ****
