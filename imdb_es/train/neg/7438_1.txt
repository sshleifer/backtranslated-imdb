This movie is a total waste of time, the plot is horrible, the dialogue is horrible. <br /> <br /> The acting is fine, but the actors have absolutely no plot or script to work with. Photography and some of the special effects are also good, but again there is nothing interesting in this movie to see. There is no logical progression towards history, the line of history is complete nonsense. It is not even scary. For a movie to be scary, there must be at least a small element of credibility. This movie has no credibility. <br /> <br /> There are only three characters in the movie. Each character is superficial and has no personality. <br /> <br /> Most special effects and makeup work are poorly done or, at most, mediocre. <br /> <br /> I hope you read this and do not waste time in this movie unless I'm curious to see a totally horrible movie.
