A Cinderella story made for adults who live in the land of dreams. Romance is very unrealistic, fluttery, lovey dovey, perfect, etc. The plot of Cinderella until the end and Shahid Kapoor is the only reason for my stars. If you're looking for a dreamy romance with a twist, it's definitely your movie, but for the rest of us, real-world people, I recommend you save your three hours of observation time. Wake up people! <br /> <br /> Four of the five people who watched the movie with me would not recommend the film. We had a great time hitting most of the unrealistic scenes. Maybe I'm missing something ... I can not believe that a movie like this can beat a classic like HDDCS!
