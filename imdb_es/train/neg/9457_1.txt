Almost everything in this movie is wrong, bad, bad. Take Mike Myers, for example. He has reached the point where he realizes that his trick has not changed since his SNL days, more than ten years ago. He is doing the same current jokes of conscience and the same voices. Your cat is painfully graceless. He tries too much. He's a weird Type A comedian, not the great cat he's supposed to be. The rest of the movie is just as bad. The sets are incredibly ugly and clearly a waste of millions of dollars. (The cardboard cutouts for the buildings in the background would have made more sense than building a complete neighborhood and a main street). Alec Balwin tries to make a funny impression of the great Santini, but ends up looking and sounding incoherent. There is even an inappropriate moment of cheesecake with the fake celebrity Paris Hilton, which stays in mind simply because it is supposed to be a Dr. Seuss story. Avoid this movie at all costs, friends. It's not even an interesting train wreck. (I hope they make Horton Hears a Who with Robin Williams, then we'll have the trilogy of comedy comedians with the Seuss movie.)
