Johnny Rivers' closing song was the only big thing in this movie. Unfortunately, that's all the positive things I can say about this western movie. I have to write 8 more lines for my comments to be published, but there are more than 8 terrible lines in this western. I'm not sure if the movie was a tribute to Hopa Along, or just a parody. The hero and the villain in this movie were too plastic. It is not realistic at all. Many of the supporting actors in this film seemed authentic, but the shooting scenes were a joke. A previous commentator thought that this movie was great, and in the comments took a cheap opportunity to President Bush. This was not a democratic or republican Western. It was just a bad western movie to be sold commercially. I wonder if he made money. Sometimes I thought I was watching a movie made by university film students. If that was the case, then it was a great movie.
