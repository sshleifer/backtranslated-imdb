This was awful of God. The story was everywhere and most of the time I was confused because of a horrible edition. He did not feel sympathy for anyone because his characters were not sufficiently developed. They were extremely superficial people without dimension. Cheesy, corny stereotypes with subplots that were not going anywhere. The stripper girl was just a distraction, even if she looked decent. I do not know what it was I was trying to be, but how surprised was it when they showed this crap at Sundance? I almost canceled my subscription. One would think that a channel like that would show more quality films. There are many, much better gay and lesbian themed movies out there. "The Celluloid Closet" is an excellent documentary. I really enjoyed "Wigstock: The Movie". I'm sure there are others that have crossed my mind at the moment, but what I'm trying to say is that this was not worth it. If you catch it on television, it's fine, but otherwise do not bother. <br /> <br /> There were maybe three or four shots that looked very good (unfortunately, I can count them with one hand), otherwise the cinematography was pretty crappy too. The lighting was very far in many places. I think some of the effects were used to try to add something that had almost nothing in its favor. <br /> <br /> I can not deny that Johnny Rebel is pretty sexy (without blonde hair, of course). Too bad that his performance did nothing for me. Stay with real porn, dude. <br /> <br /> 3/10.
