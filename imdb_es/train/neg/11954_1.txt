This movie was terrible. Throughout the entire film, I was puzzled and did not make any sense. I had to go to this site and read the review to finally understand what it was about. It's not worth watching this movie. Not only is it sick and disgusting, it's totally STUPID! Please, do not look unless you are one of those who likes to watch bad movies. If this film questions Japanese society and its values ​​and roles, then this is a country that I would not like to visit or that bothers me to know. This is a totally sick movie !!!!!!!! I did not enjoy it because it did not make sense. My boyfriend and I sat there waiting to see if it was a horror because that is what appears on the list. It was a total disappointment.
