Oh darling! The first time I heard of this bad show was when one of my friends shouted like an idiot "JOHNY TEST" while playing video games. I thought I was confusing "Johny Quest" (by the way, one of the best cartoons I've seen in my life), and changing "Quest" to "Test." It's a strange thing that I was wrong, but in fact I was wrong, he did not I was changing nothing, I heard about this program. <br /> <br /> One day, while watching TV, I heard that Cartoon Network was going to be released, I was not sure what was the plot of this program, so I I ventured to see it, and here is my answer "I WANT TO DEMONSTRATE MY MAN" (because I saw this shit and "My gym mate is a monkey". <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst shows I've seen First, the beginning, with the most stupid song in the world, then the argument Oh, where are my manners? I have not said the argument of this program, it is a boy who has INCREDIBLY SMART sisters, who have a laboratory and they do experiments with their own brother, OHHH, now I see why his name is Johny TEST, he is examining his sisters experiments. <br /> <br /> You know, I honestly miss Dexter b's (before he became the NEW Dexter, also a total crap). This is a bad copy of that good old program, except that this program is incredibly bad. Do not see it, do something more productive in that half hour that looks at this shit.
