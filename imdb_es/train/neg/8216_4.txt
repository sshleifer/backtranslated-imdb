And maybe, as Fred Sandford said, "one on the lips." That to those who premiered this film in a confident public. And maybe the person in "Rue Morgue" who called this "Fender Hellbender" and said it was good. <br /> <br /> Five girls, apparently taking a shortcut home from a high school football game, get lost and stop to ask how to get to a small store in the middle of nowhere. While there, the driver accidentally hits a parked SUV and turns off a headlight, but the girls decide to simply leave and not go to look for the driver. But the driver does find them, and it's not just that the headlights of his vehicle have been damaged, but for another reason that the girls still do not understand. When the driver catches them for the first time, she (yes, it is her) brandished a gun and disarmed them and kept shouting "how much did you see?". Of course, the girls are scared to death and do not know what she's talking about. <br /> <br /> As the night ends, the girls end up in a cat-and-mouse game with the SUV driver, who drives to inflict all kinds of injuries on the girls, which are remarkably resistant to shots of guns and screwdrivers where they did not want them. Finally, they discover that something happened in that store after they left, that's the reason for this woman's psychotic rage. And, finally, they have the chance to take revenge and take it as far as they can. <br /> <br /> There are elements of this movie that are quite disturbing and frightening, but unfortunately, those moments are undermined by the bad performance. , bad dialogue, and huge lapses of credibility. A girl is hit by a gunshot and appears to be mortally wounded, and feels cold, her life passes before her eyes, but did it improve? And how far can a mini-van run in an almost empty gas tank at speeds of 80 miles per hour? I need one of those things, it seems that it has a GREAT mileage. <br /> <br /> There should be an end when the girls took their revenge, but the movie continues a bit after that, which is an anti climax, but at least they learn something that caused the woman to stop , and the driver is still worried about "spoiling his mother's truck", which is obviously the least concern of anyone. <br /> <br /> So this is not It's not the worst movie I've seen, but it's too amateurish to be good and yet a little too frightening and sometimes terrifying to be utterly dreadful. But take the cake for a lot of sharp hysteria and you'll want to put two in your ears if you look at this. Which, by the way, I do not necessarily recommend it. 4 out of 10
