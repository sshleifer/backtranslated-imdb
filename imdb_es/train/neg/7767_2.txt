To anyone who is not familiar with c.S. Forrester's book this movie should be interesting. It is colorful, well acted and represents a great adventure, but for those of us who know the original stories, it is frightening. I could barely sit through it. <br /> <br /> For some reason, screen writers seem obliged to rewrite the stories they are working on. Of course, the spoken word is different from the written word, and there are some episodes that would be difficult to film. But why do screen writers rewrite history instead of simply adapting it? In this case, the writers made themselves. <br /> <br /> Just a few examples: There was no riot in Renown. The officers seized the ship after the half-insane Captain went completely crazy when he fell through a hatch, for implicit reasons but never delivered. There was no court martial. The investigation court was held in an almost congratulatory environment. Captain Pellew does not appear in this part of the Hornblower saga, nor does Colonel Ortega's wife. Hornblower, himself, was never in the dungeon, neither on the ship nor on the shore. There are many manipulations of this kind in the history of Forrester. <br /> <br /> On a purely technical basis, I believe that the repeated use of the flash-back device film damages the continuity of the story. <br /> <br /> Why, oh why did screen writers have to ruin a good story?
