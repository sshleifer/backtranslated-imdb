This is a very attractive film for a relatively well-defined group (of which I am not part). I went to a preview of this movie without knowing what to expect, and finally I found it disappointing. The story of a terribly dysfunctional Hungarian Jewish family (often frankly "twisted") is not my cup of tea. An epic saga like this should provide its viewers with something more at the end. Ultimately, images like this refer to the human condition: this image almost does not shed new light on any of its most significant facets.
