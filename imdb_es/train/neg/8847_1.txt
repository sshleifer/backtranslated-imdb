This US soap opera UU., 'Knots Landing' has all the entertainment value of being stuck in an elevator. Each episode contained plots such as rape, murder, kidnapping and drug trafficking, not very different from the plots of other dramatic shows of the time. As for the cast, I've seen better actors in a cereal box. From the mid to the late 1990s, the 'Knots' replays stank the UK-Gold like a mountain of moldy diapers. I regret to announce that I had to suffer this because my mother was a big fan of the program and I would see it religiously. Although since then, the repetitions have been few and far between (hopefully it remains that way). The only positive thing that can be said about 'Knots' is the striking saxophone melody, which was then used as the title music for the comedy I.T.V, 'The Upper Hand'. Great legacy that, huh?
