Amazing. That's what you'd say if you sat down in this movie. Simply, incredibly, amazing. Actually, it's so surprising that someone was stupid enough to throw money to make this monstrosity that you just can not believe what you're seeing. That, my friends, is what really scares this movie. Someone thought it was a good idea to do it. <br /> <br /> Well, here's another amazingly original story: a high school student (sometimes I thought it was a school), has a whore for a mother, lives in a trailer park and is a "artist" who is ridiculed for his "being all different". Well, of course, this poor ridiculed boy is finally murdered and, here is the original part, his soul lives in a scarecrow (under which, he is killed by the last child of his horny mom). Then he goes with the standard murder of all the people who have hurt him. Awww. <br /> <br /> Here's the breakdown: <br /> <br /> The good: <br /> <br /> - An astonishingly funny movie, even if that's not what the filmmakers wanted clearly drunk? . <br /> <br /> - This and the sequel on a disk in the Wal-Mart $ 5.00 container, so it's a bit too expensive. <br /> <br /> I did not hurt him, I did not. t Help: <br /> <br /> - Violence and gore are a bit below the standard. A person is stabbed with an ear of corn. <br /> <br /> - It seems like they put a little effort into the music, but it does not really fit the movie and it's not that good. <Br /> <br /> The bad: <br /> <br /> - Terrible, terrible performance. <br /> <br /> - Another disappointment with sexy women? None of them taking off their clothes. When did that stop being a staple of low-browed slashers? <br /> <br /> - Ridiculous story. <br /> <br /> - The scarecrow vomits in a line that Freddy Krueger and Arnold Swartzenegger would blush. <br /> <br /> - The standard underlying love story is not going anywhere and is badly made. <br /> <br /> - Did any of the people killed seem to have been chosen at random? You never really know who anyone is and then they kill each other. And you just assume that they should have made him come. <br /> <br /> The Ugly: <br /> <br /> - An extremely average slasher fee, only with a killer scarecrow instead of? Well, all that other shit. <br /> <br /> - Not as interesting as Freddy Krueger, Jason Voorhees, Pinhead, Chucky or even Angela from the "Sleepaway Camp" series, all of which are better than this atrocity. <br /> <br /> - The worst dialogue I have heard in my LIFE. The script is loaded with a level of delay that I never imagined could exist. I'm serious, it's a complete step beyond the terrible. However, do not get me wrong, it's funny as hell, but I've never heard more asinine banter, not even in "Slumber Party Massacre III". This movie makes "Jason X" look like Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> - The man who kills the child who becomes the scarecrow: the worst wig of all. Dialog to match <br /> <br /> Memorable scene: <br /> <br /> - In which young people in elementary school give their own witty dialogue: "Hey, we're going to look for small animals to torture them." Huh huh. " <br /> <br /> Performance: 3/10 Story: 3/10 Atmosphere: 2/10 Cinematography: 1/10 Character Development: 2/10 Special Effects / Makeup: 5/10 Nudity / Sexuality: 1/10 (No nudity, mom is a whore, girls do not wear bras) Violence / Gore: 5/10 (Low quality, mediocre amount) Dialogue: 0/10 (Extremely ridiculous, shameless, exaggerated and painfully How funny? that's fine! My first rating for dialogue in any movie!) Music: 5/10 Direction: 2/10 <br /> <br /> Cheesiness: 10/10 Bad shit: 9/10 <br /> <br /> In general: 3/10 <br /> <br /> Another for people like me who enjoy watching pure shit. Or finalists of the movie Slasher. This is not a good movie, at all. The dialogue and the characters that can be laughed at prevent it from being really boring. <br /> <br /> www.ResidentHazard.com
