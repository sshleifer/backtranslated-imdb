Okay, anyone who can honestly say that this movie was great or even good is a fallacy or knows the director, the writer and the producers, and is trying to increase the rumor in this movie. I watched the movie because a friend of mine worked on it and it was horrible. I am an actress and have worked in the industry for a while, now in large and even independent films, and this movie bored me to tears. The reason why I'm being so hard is because this movie was clearly a different version of "Of Mice and Men" and they should sue because it's a horrible scam of the story. In an industry where Hollywood seems to be creatively bankrupt ... for someone to take a classic book and film "Of Mice and Men" and destroy it with a new twist that bothers me so much. The actors, the accents, the dialogue and the direction were amateurs and the writing was terrible. I mean, if you're going to give a new twist to an existing story, make sure it's as good or better than the original to justify the new spin. I did not like this movie at all.
