When I saw the name of this movie, I always thought it was a musical. Like "The girls of Harvey." It is not. It is a pudding that was repaired, hit the roof of the kitchen and ripped out and improvised. There is no music or a piece of time, but it is very unlikely. <br /> <br /> Start with patriarch James Woods who tells the eldest of his three daughters, a little girl who grows up to be Barbara Stanwyck, who must keep the last name. and the home. <br /> <br /> Therefore, we think it will be an historical intergenerational story. And it is, for a brief time. Then it becomes the story of Stanwyck's fight against lawyer George Brent. Why is she so dead against him? Well, why else? As we learned in a strange flashback sequence narrated by Stanwyck, she once thought that she could inherit some money (both for her sisters and for herself, of course) by getting married. He struck someone he interpreted as a peasant in the country, who was in fact the incipient lawyer Brent. <br /> <br /> So that nobody thinks about the child they had, a young man of eight years old at the time of the main plot, is ... well, you know ... They had a rash marriage and, during the short time they were together, it was conceived. <br /> <br /> One of her sisters is in love with a painter named Gig Young, who is played by Gig Young. The other sister tries to take him away. Etc etc. <br /> <br /> It's a raucous mess, not attractive, quite well acted but without a bit of logic or plausibility.
