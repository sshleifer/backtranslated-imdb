Ooof! This was a stinker. It does not fall 'somewhere between Star Wars and Thriller', that's for sure. In all the present, it falls somewhere between the cracks of a Wham! The video and Captain EO, only with a not so big budget, and many more approaches of ugly teens crying. Simon Le Bon takes care of the front and the center, while the rest of the band tries to hide the fact that they stole his entire career from the last 3 Roxy Music albums. Brief clips of Barbarella do not add anything. Avoid at all costs. (However, I liked the part where they performed 'Hungry Like The Wolf', but why was there a tiger lurking in the audience who became a woman painted with tiger stripes? I mean, they're not singing ' Eye of the Tiger 'or' Hungry as the Tiger 'is a wolf! Whatever it is.] A DVD of the Duran Duran 80's videos is probably worth it for the love of nostalgia
