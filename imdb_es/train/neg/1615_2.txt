The same old man as Che. He completely ignored the really interesting facts of Che's true character. Sodeberg remade the same boring narrative of Che. The silly seductive story of a rich Argentine boy who was so impressed by poverty that he became Robin Hood fighting alongside the poor, until he was finally killed by the CIA. Yes, yes, I heard it all before, BORED AND INCORRECT! The reality of Che Guevara is very different and much more explosive! The facts show that he was a totalitarian with a messiah's streak, who wished to openly impose the Maoist tyranny on the world. He was so fanatical that in the hottest time of the Cold War, he even begged the Soviet Union to bomb New York, Washington or Los Angeles and bring about the end of the world. CHe urged Khrushchev to launch a nuclear attack against American cities. For the rest of his life, he declared that if his finger had been on the button, he would have pressed it. When Khrushchev stepped back and literally saved the world, Che was enraged by the "betrayal". If Che's recommendations had been followed, I would not be reading this review now. How a homicidal maniac became a pop icon would have made a much more interesting movie. Amazing that no filmmaker has dared to show the real side of Che and his posthumous transformation of the media. THAT WOULD MAKE AN Oscar WINNING FILM! I thought that making an independent film meant taking REAL RISKS and being GROBRAKING! They just stick to "safe counterculture themes", namely "Che cool", "Wall Street bad", "Republican = Nazi", "Bush ex Hitler", "NRA is worse than KGB", "Christians are fanatics and stupid "", etc ... ad nauseum Oooh, how daring, how amazing, three anti-mainstream and avant-garde, I would like them to have some real balls and to approach the Independent Film Oligarchy! That would be really daring!
