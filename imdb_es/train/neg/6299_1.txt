This inept adaptation of one of Martin Amis's weakest novels fails to even make comparisons with other drug works like Requiem For A Dream or anything written by Irvine Walsh as he struggles to decide whether it's a slap-stick caricature or a hyper-realistic one . Hallucinations <br /> <br /> Bored, led by William Marsh in saturated nuances, a group of students leaving public schools gather in a mansion awaiting the appearance of three American friends during a weekend of decadent consumption of drugs And that is. Except for the absurd sub-plot, which will soon become pointless nonsense about an extremist cult group that expresses itself with the violent murders of the elite figures of the world, whether political or spoiled. On the first reel, you know exactly where this is going. <br /> <br /> What is a talented actor like Paul Bettany doing in this boring and poorly written boredom? Made before his rise to fame and Jennifer Connelly, one can be sure that if he had been offered this garbage now, he would have changed agents immediately! Avoid.
