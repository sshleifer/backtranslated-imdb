I am a boy who loves the movies of boys ... I really wanted to see a dragon fighting with the army with great special effects. All this happened, however, this movie was the worst movie I've seen in my life. <br /> <br /> The story was standard, but the representation of the story was terrible. The scene transitions were the worst I've ever seen. Why would you walk to a beach to relax if your life was in danger? The actions of the snake dragon itself were very poorly written ... and the snake dragon's attack capabilities varied widely throughout the film, several times the main characters should have died. <br /> <br /> The director tried to instill a love story in the middle of the movie during the most stressful moments, this movie obviously was not seen after it was made, I love the movies, but I had to force myself to finish seeing it, thank God I did not buy it, I borrowed it from a friend. <br /> <br /> Do not buy this, do not rent it, just look at the discovery channel ... much more exciting.
