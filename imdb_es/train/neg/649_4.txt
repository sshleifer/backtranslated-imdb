OK, this movie was made for a reason and a single reason to MAKE MONEY. The producers obviously did not mind killing a classic horror movie. I knew that this movie would stink as soon as it was to be a pg-13, how many pg-13 slasher movies have turned out to be good? That's like asking how many women have been on the moon? The answer is NONE! The graduation night of 1980 was not a masterpiece, but it certainly deserves to be recognized as a film that stays true to its genre and the deosnt tries to be something more than that. <br /> <br /> My problem with the graduation night of 2008 is the way he handles the killer and I have 3 main problems with him .................. ... <br /> <br /> 1) The way he escapes, I was locked in a mental institute and escapes through an air conditioning vent! WHAT THE HELL? Why would they have air conditioning in the patients' room? Do you want him to feel comfortable during your stay or something? 2) His intentions are somewhat uncertain: the murderer wants all the main victims, family and friends to die so he can have it for himself, he says he loves her, but the next minute he tries to kill her, for what he wants to kill. Does she love her or does he just violate her? 3) The killer is too good, how did he develop all his skills? He used to be a teacher, so in this scene where he kills the main boyfriend of the victims while he's basically asleep and she does not notice, it's all nonsense 2 out of 10 terrible, stupid and stupid attempts to try. horror movie
