I suppose if you like the endless dialogues that do not convey the history and flashy camera effects like the transitions of the scene on the television show Angel, you will enjoy the movie. I? All I wanted was a nice little story, and it was not there. The rhythm was practically backwards, the plot points were buried under a sea of ​​unnecessary dialogues, and there was absolutely no feeling of fear, tension or NOTHING. <br /> <br /> Is it the redneck? Is it the wendigo? No, he's a speed cameraman. That is not scary. It does not generate a single note of tension or atmosphere unless you're scared by MTV. Like the critics before me, I also noticed that, in the end, the film provokes a mocking laugh from the audience. <br /> <br /> Terrible film.
