I expected to see this movie when I left, since I was a big fan of the SNL. When my boyfriend and I went to see him, people who left the program early shouted: "Do not waste your money!" But, of course, we had to discover it for ourselves. <br /> <br /> While there were some funny fragments (Laser Bra 2000, Root Boy Slim), most seemed like it could have been edited severely into a fun 1 hour show. It was pretty bad. <br /> <br /> When the opera singer arrived, many people got up and left. This made me laugh, because I realized that O'Donoghue was pressing people's buttons on purpose with this movie. Or else, I was just crazy. Whatever it is, you do not need to waste your time looking at it, it's so bad.
