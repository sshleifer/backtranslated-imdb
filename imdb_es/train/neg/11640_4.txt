Pier Paolo Pasolini, or Pee-pee-pee, as I prefer to call him (because of his love of showing male genitalia), is perhaps THE most overrated European Marxist director, and they are very concentrated on the ground. How someone can see the "art" in this dirty and cheap mix of sex surpasses me. Some of the "stories" here could have come straight out of a soft core porn movie, and I'm not even referring to nudity so much as to the simplistic and banal stories, often meaningless. Anyone who has enjoyed this relatively observable but stupid rarity should sink their teeth into the series of German films of the 70s "Der Schulmaedchenreport" by Der Schulmaedchenreport, because that is how I think "Decameron". <br /> <br /> In addition, the film is neglected on almost every level, from beginning to end: <br /> <br /> 1. Edition. An example: at 1 hour: 15 minutes: 45 seconds there is a chase scene that is clearly placed in the wrong place. It was supposed to be placed a minute later, but I suppose Pasolini must have hired editors who have little time for the "fine details" of filmmaking. Pee-pee-pee fans would probably counteract this by saying that it was placed there intentionally, which I very much doubt. Also, even if that were true, it would be even worse, because that story does not gain anything by making it harder to follow. (This is not exactly "Eraserhead" or one of Tarantino's broken-form movies ...) <br /> <br /> 2. Acting. I'm careless. Triple Pee fans (all 8 of them) proudly declare how 3P-O uses "real people instead of actors". (Are actors not people, or are they Martians?) Of course, many actors have a lower IQ, but does that mean we should treat them with contempt ...?) Other directors have used the fans and have been successful (as Alan Parker or De Niro), then why are PPP fans so horrible in their films? The answer is once again frightful laziness. Pasolini is careless in everything, and that includes trying to get as much as possible from his fans without teeth. He is a lazy director, an IMperfectionist if you want. The anti-Kubrick, I suppose ... The main objective of Pee-pee-pee when throwing must have been to find as many elderly as possible without teeth (and young men who are to their liking). In Pasolini's world there is a simple formula: lack of teeth + strange face = realism. It is good to have them toothless, but at least try to get some at least semi-decent performances from these inexperienced neoterrists, otherwise, you are also an amateur, an amateur director, in the case of Pasolini. If 3P-0 was not capable of this feat or just did not care, it does not change anything. (Who knows ... maybe he did not even realize the horrible performance?) <br /> <br /> 3. Audio. The synchronization If 3P-0 felt that the microphones are a nuisance when filming a movie, then he should have made at least a concerted effort in postproduction, that is, getting all these vague actors to say their lines in the studio. so that the spectators do not have to see how the mouths move while the elusive dialogue floats in another part of the film. <br /> <br /> 4. The lack of concept. We have about a dozen stories that are not connected in a meaningful way. Some are anti-ecclesiastical (more on this later), while others are nothing more than sexual threads, that is, cheap (sometimes gay) male fantasies designed to stimulate and nothing else. Stories and characters are not fun (if they do) at an intelligent level, but at the lowest level. 10-year-olds can laugh here ... And there's nothing wrong with that, but then do not call it exalted intellectual art! <br /> <br /> 5. As a result of point 4, there is also a lack of logic in the order of the stories. That goes without saying. Pee-pee-pee could have arranged the order in another way, and we would have had exactly the same movie. This also means that you can start from the middle and then return to the beginning, etc. "Decameron" is like a bowl of spaghetti that way: when you start eating it, you can start with any thread you want. no difference at all. <br /> <br /> 6. The futility of the resolutions of the stories. Most stories end with a joke or cheap joke, that is, some damn nonsense from a porn comic, while some stories do not even have a conclusion: they just end. Finite At best, the stories are semi-anecdotes visible, just a deeper meaning, unless you find "deep" meanings in a porn. There is, of course, nothing easier than searching and finding "meaning" where there is an absence of it. Therefore, even any hardcore porn movie can be philosophized / thoughtlessly incessantly. It's easy and fun. Try it, oh you 8 fans of the PPP! <br /> <br /> Regarding the attacks against the Church ... Some spectators are enthusiastic about their attack on Catholicism and what is not. In general, everything is fine, after all, I am also an atheist, but what these people ignore is the simple but essential fact that Pasolini was a Marxist. It's like the pot that calls the kettle black. A Marxist who criticizes the Church for hypocrisy and stupidity? Where does the nerve get? In addition, Pasolini was not an atheist, therefore, his high and powerful position and self-righteousness is not justified. After all, Marxists are believers: they simply replaced the accepted god with the idea of ​​a utopia, which is simply another supernatural fantasy of illusion. Therefore, I can not get excited about the anti-religion antics of PPP. <br /> <br /> This anthology of sophomoric humpdorama ends with Pasolini saying quite pretentiously: "I wonder ... Why produce a work of art when it's good to dream? That's it?" He really was not referring to this silly little movie as art, was it ...? In case it was, the poor man cheated, then I wonder why he did not just let it dream, and he did NOT do all those bad movies ... <br /> <br /> I want to read my altered subtitles of ¿Movies of Bergman?
