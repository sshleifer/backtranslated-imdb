This was a decisive event in my movie watching life. I went to see this in the theater when it came out. I was completely amazed at how bad it was. Movies like this make you wonder who put the money and who owed him a favor, a very big favor. The special effects are absolutely the first grade level, as any first grade student could have done them. Play rubber bats on strings without trying to hide the strings, the arrows that seem to be drawn in the film and seem to have the shape of an arrow you would find on a sign, and a story of laughter. Ed Wood made masterpieces compared to "Conquest". Every film student should see this so they know the definition of a bad movie.
