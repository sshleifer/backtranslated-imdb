It is unfortunate that someone has decided to split the best horror films of all time in my book. This poor copy steals a lot of material from the first three films that goes so far as to even copy how people die and what will happen in the future to key characters, and basically tries to group three films into one and fails. It even fails to create a good atmosphere of fear for one (except with the rare exception where the impressive choral music brings back memories of the old movies). <br /> <br /> The only thing we can be grateful for is that it has not been a foreshadowing V.
