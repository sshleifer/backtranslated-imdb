A warning for potential viewers: if you are looking for an adaptation of the classic story "The most dangerous game", look elsewhere. "Seven women for Satan" <br /> <br /> only superficially addresses the original work using the name of Zaroff and saying that the character murders people. <br /> <br /> Some of the following points could be considered by some to be spoilers. Or not. <br /> <br /> Boris Zaroff is played by writer / director Michel Lemoine. While his ancestor hunted men because they were the only prisoners that were truly challenging, Boris's victims are generally in a position where they can not defend themselves. The film wanders from scene to scene with a lack of almost total clarity. The director seems to have totally ignored the rhythm and left the viewer with a suffocating and boring movie. Some individual scenes are slightly interesting (like a torture sequence), but as a unit, the film does not entertain. Spectators who are more interested in a variety of attractive and semi-attractive actresses in various stages of nudity could find the film visible. Most will probably find it better to spend their time watching Mentos commercials. <br /> <br /> In a side note, the DVD extras include a good amount of information about the history of the film. Apparently, it was banned for several years in his native France, which ruined the possibilities of widespread distribution.
