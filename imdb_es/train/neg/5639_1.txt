I saw this movie today at the Haifa Film Festival in Israel after hearing enthusiastic reviews, but I guess the critics were just sucking Willem Defoe and his wife (the director) who were present at the festival. Definitely, it's the slowest movie I've seen with numerous pointless, ridiculously long scenes out of the blue. In addition to Defoe, who was decent, the performance of the other two and a half people in the film, including Defoe's wife, Giada, was ridiculously terrible (the way they choose the vendor at the bakery overtakes me). This movie is pretty much less plot with a lame attempt to be abstract and out of the wall. The only scene that provoked any kind of reaction in the crowd was vulgar and came from nowhere to add some kind of impact value to the opacity of this movie. I'm sorry for being so hard, but in reality this movie is a valuable waste of time and money. I appreciate good independent cinema, but this film is not worthy of the time of the spectators.
