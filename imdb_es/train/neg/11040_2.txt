You need to see this program once to see them all, the formula is exactly the same in each episode. Jim does something in his way that has good intentions but alters his wife, in the end she discovers that what he did was really for her, he caresses her cheek and gives her a rubbery smile while he looks shyly. In fact, the story lines are so boring and so complex that I'm going to try it now. <br /> <br /> Episode 'Valentines Pay' <br /> <br /> Jims's wife realizes that all the Jims weekly The pay has disappeared, then he explains that he lost it in the casino. She screams and leaves the house lamenting how horrible he is. Then, Valentine's Day appears in a limousine with tickets for a ball (therefore, explains the missing wages). She realizes the error of 'Ella' and the usual 'Oh Jim, you are so charming'. .. The end <br /> <br /> Another very obvious element is the fact that the character of Jims is based on Homer Simpson, who as a cartoon character can be belligerent and ignorant. When you try with human beings, yes. it does not work and Jim simply appears as a self-centered arrogant imbecile. <br /> <br /> IMO, the only reason this is successful is simply because we are many now in terms of human beings with televisions, these days you could make a show about a man who insulates the walls and get a audience. <br /> <br /> 'Two and a half men' on the other hand is fantastic and hilarious.
