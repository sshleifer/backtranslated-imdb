Good intent and good ideas (the redemption of the prostitute, human beings helping each other, ...) but a bad result ... The director obviously tried to emulate his French colleague Tran Anh Hung by recreating an environment that is supposed to portray Viet Nam ... The only problem is that this Viet Nam has been gone for a long time and when "The aroma of the green papaya" had a historical background ... trying to project this kind of environment (muffled sounds and slow rhythm of life ...) in modern days leaves a feeling of false. In addition, it quickly creates a feeling of boredom and the result becomes too obvious. <br /> <br /> I can only assume that the action takes place in Saigon or Da Nang because that's where Harvey Keitel, a former sailor in the film, was probably stationed during the war ... But in South Vietnam nobody or very few people speak with the clip Northern Accent shown by the actors ... Seriously strange even for a bad Vietnamese speaker. <br /> <br /> An old poet with leprosy ... very doubtful (it is not a disease for people of his condition), a peasant girl who can read and write elaborate Vietnamese poetry, ... even more doubtful .. . <br /> <br />
