I'm a big fan of novelist / screenwriter Michael Chabon. His novel "Wonder Boys" became a fantastic movie by Curtis Hanson. His masterly novel "The incredible adventures of Kavalier and Clay" won the Pulitzer Prize a few years ago, and participated in the script of "Spider Man 2", possibly the best comic book of all time. <br /> <br /> Director Rawson Marshall Thurber has also directed wonderful comedy pieces, such as "Dodgeball" and the great series of short films "Terry Tate: Office Linebacker". And with a cast that includes Peter Saarsgard, Sienna Miller, Nick Nolte and Mena Suvari, this seems like a no-brainer. <br /> <br /> It is. Literally. <br /> <br /> Jon Foster plays Art Bechstein, the son of a mobster (Nolte) who recently graduated with a degree in Economics. Jon is in a state of arrested development: he works at a minimum wage in Book Barn, he has an insipid relationship with his girlfriend / boss, Phlox (Suvari), which amounts to little more than large amounts of sex, with no plans that do not be to chase away a career for which you have no passion. <br /> <br /> One night at a party, a former roommate introduces Jon to Jane (Miller), a beautiful intelligent violinist. Later that night, they go out to eat cake and she asks Jon a question that begins to take him out of his catatonic state of existence: "I want you to tell me something you have never told a single soul. this indelible night. " Then, Jon tells him a recurring dream in which he walks around the city looking at the faces of strangers passing by him, but none of them looks him in the eye. "I imagine it must be how death feels," he says. <br /> <br /> The next day, Jane's savage boyfriend, Cleveland (Saarsgard), kidnaps Jon from work and takes him to a large abandoned steel factory, and soon Jon, Cleveland and Jane spend every moment awake together in punk rock concerts, consuming drugs and drinking a lot of alcohol. This does not sit well with Phlox, who presses Jon for a more personal relationship, that is, letting her meet her new friends and her father. Then, the film tries to take us on Jon's journey while shaking off the chains imposed on him by his father, Phlox and his futureless work when he finds freedom and expression through his relationships with Cleveland and Jane. <br /> <br /> There is a problem for us to follow Jon throughout the film: he is completely disinterested. It has no ambitions, passions or goals. Walk through life as the invisible ghost that described Jane the night they met. At first this is not a problem. But it never gets more interesting. He is a completely passive character. He simply follows the Bohemians Cleveland and Jane, but never gives us any idea of ​​what he cares or wants to do with himself. <br /> <br /> Consequently, the movie and its supporting characters have nothing. Go and little to do apart from the party, have sex and discuss. In other words, a lot of noise and few words. What we have here is the superficial skin of a good movie with nothing inside. Sweeping cinematography, heavy voices with characters that look into the distance, many sex scenes, both heterosexual and homosexual, big arguments, more furious sex, a scene of persecution and a tragic death ... but it does not seem to matter. Ironically, in a moment, Jane, confused by a series of Jon's aimless actions, asks: "What's going on, Jon? What's this all about?" Yes, Jon, say so. We also in the audience die to know. <br /> <br /> The title "The Pittsburgh Mysteries" should refer to the characters themselves, because that is what they are. All are facades, one-dimensional representations for real people. The movie never lets us in. We never know what makes any of them work. We see them do many things, but we do not know why. And the absence of "why" is one of the worst things a movie can have.
