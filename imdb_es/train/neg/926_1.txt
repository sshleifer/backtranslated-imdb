This movie is about Tyrannus, a gladiator who is brought from the dead to summon Tyrannus, a gladiator who must be returned from the dead. Tyrant, we learn after about an hour, it is also called Demonicus. This adds a much needed depth to the script and questions our assumptions about identity, psychology and ourselves. <br /> <br /> The spirit of Tyrannus achieves his little to-do list (kill some people and say repetitive phrases in Latin) by owning the body of a university student. He wears a magic mind control helmet to do this, which the college student willingly puts on, and then, at various points in the movie, he takes off and puts it back on. <br /> <br /> Maria plays oral sex on Sean Willian Scott of a poor man, and Tyrannus uses the Rollerball glove. Tyrannus has its own green backlight for no reason, and apparently has been sitting next to the CG fire in an old concrete tunnel for centuries like this. Total misfortune. <br /> <br /> This movie is empty and will hurt you. Look at it.
