Well, let me start by saying how HILARILY this movie is, I just could not help but laugh at the sheer stupidity. Do not get me wrong, it's well acted especially by Bassinger, but the script is fair, well, the mind really stuns. <br /> <br /> The premise is good and until Della actually witnesses the murder she is committing, but after that she just goes downhill. Halfway through the film, the protagonist pulls out her toolbox and, of course, instead of throwing it at the man's head, she decides to take out a screwdriver, a car connector and finally a flare (as in a sinking ship) respectively to kill their victims. . <br /> <br /> Then there is the final line that I promise, if it does not have stitches, I will eat my own left foot. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie for those who simply want to laugh at some old and frightening movies. I can also suggest that you watch the scene in the junkyard with the guy who falls off the one-foot-tall wooden board, he always catches me.
