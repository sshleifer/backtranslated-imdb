Let me be very clear about this movie. I did not see this movie because of the plot, I see it in the spicy sex scenes. That said, this movie is so damned horrible that between the sheer joy of seeing a pious body of Traci (Mandy Schaffer) and shrinking my eyes at the disaster of a plot. <br /> <br /> Spoiler Alert The first scene in the movie already made me tremble ... you see a woman painting something beside the lake, in pure happiness and serenity, then a beautiful girl approaches and asks if You can paint at your side. When they both finished, they showed each other what they had done ... and the woman painted A VINEYARD WHEN IT IS FACING THE INFRONT OF THE LAKE. What kind of inflatable director would make this kind of mistake? And in another scene, Traci manages to kill her master's lover by crushing him with the sail shaft, and then she walks away, and none of the town's policemen ever suspected her. I mean HELLOOOOO? MANDY DOES NOT WEAR A GLOVE, SHE? YOUR FINGER IMPRESSIONS ARE ABOUT THE BOAT OF GOD HIMSELF !! After that, it gets worse, whenever Mandy is near, the "chilling" sound effect that sounds like a cat in full form is reproduced. It is also a real shame that Rosanna Arquette is in this movie. I'm sorry that she has to star in this soft and low budget porn. The same goes for JÃ¼rgen Prochnow, who also has the misfortune to star in this film. In short, 2/10.
