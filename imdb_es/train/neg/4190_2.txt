I saw this movie a few months ago in the city that appeared as Greendale in the movie, which is the only reason I went to see it. Another place that was there just sent me an e-mail announcement of a replay that shows up because the first sold out and the people were rejected. His editorial comment on his front is a good summary: <br /> <br /> "Yuk". <br /> <br /> Unless you're a Neil Young fan or live in / near "Greendale" (if the latter knows the real name), skip this movie. It is mostly an ego trip for the filmmaker. It does not have a discernible plot, the music is just fine, and a lot of the lyrics are unintelligible, so it is impossible to follow the small fragments of plot that may exist. <br /> <br /> I do not need to put a spoiler warning because there are no surprises to give away. <br /> <br /> I would give it a 1.5 / 10, but that's just for the fun value of watching the scenes in a movie. It was not worth the $ 6. I could rent a video camera and drive through "Greendale" and make a better movie myself. <br /> <br /> If you want to see an environmental message movie * good * without an argument, go rent Koyaanisqatsi.
