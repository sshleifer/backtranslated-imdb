The trash typically typical of director Fred Olen Ray about a cyborg hunter (Teagan) commissioned by warden Jan-Michael Vincent to find and execute the escaped convict alien Ross Hagen who has charted the course for Earth. Soon, Forest Ranger John Phillip Law will have to protect a group of unpleasantly hammam university students headed by Richard Wiley, who ran over Hagen with his RV on a camping trip that went awry. Soon, the cyborg will explode with his arm by laser-burning an innocent alcoholic doctor (Robert Quarry of Count Yorga-Vampire), demonstrating that no one will stand in his way to recover the skin of the convict, whose collar is a tracking device that weakens her body. Law finds an ally in Leo Gordon, a veteran veteran of the Vietnam War with too many weapons hidden in his cabin. <br /> <br /> Maybe intentionally made horrible, this has what fans of the "stale cinema" crave ... terrible special effects, acting and premise. At least, the movie has PJ Soles for a bit of sweet eyes ... even in '89, she was quite smoking. That laser gun is funny ... it can incinerate some houses, but when the Cyborg shoots at Law it hardly leaves a mark in the place where it was fired.
