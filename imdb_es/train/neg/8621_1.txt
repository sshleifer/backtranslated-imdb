The previous poster obviously worked in the movie. It's a joke how bad it is and no one would review this type of movie in the same way that it did. Mentioning all the names of the actors and what they were before is a sure sign that you are involved in some way. <Br /> <br /> Right now he's in Cinemax and he was sure that this was a movie in which the porn stars (the one called Ava is beautiful and well endowed) were forced to do something else for some crazy fiscal reason. <br /> <br /> Also, when I saw it for the first time, I was sure it was made in 1986, and I was born in '73, so I thought I knew what I was talking about ... but no ... It was made in 1993! Amazing! <br /> <br /> Although I would call it one of those bad things that are good movies. Like watching a train crash.
