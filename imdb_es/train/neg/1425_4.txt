I'm not sure which HK movies the other reviewers have been watching, but Enter the Eagles is not anywhere near the top of the HK action. Michael "Fitz" Wong should be happy that he can get acting jobs at HK, because he could not get out of a wet paper bag in English. Shannon Lee looks good and is a fantastic fighter (even better with leg fighting than her father), but her acting skills are also unsatisfying. In fact, all the dialogue in English (90% of the film, even more than in Gen-Y Cops) is so bad that I switched to Mandarin audio just to avoid the misery of the poor delivery of dialogue and the redundancy of English. subs. Sure, there are some decent shootouts (but nothing that we have not seen before) and a good photograph, but the cheesy visual effects really ruin the action. <br /> <br /> That said, it's worth the price of admission to see Shannon and Benny "The Jet" Urquidez go to that. Spectacular, and almost worth seeing the rest of the movie for. <br /> <br /> Finally, you may notice some scenes that seem "familiar" to you, especially a shooting at an open-air market (think of Matrix) and Fitz diving out of a helicopter in a black uniform ( I think MI: 2). I guess someone thought it was worth copying at least some things in this movie.
