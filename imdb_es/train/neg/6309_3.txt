This movie had good intentions and a good story to work with. The director and screenwriter of this film failed miserably and created a boring and boring film strip that made me feel like I was back in Mr. Hartford's 8th grade Social Studies class, back in 67. <br /> < What's wasted, will anyone take this story and make a real movie? The story deserves it. <br /> <br /> Each time a scene had potential, we all kept some clich√©s, combined with black. and the blank images that they probably got from The History Channel to show the action. Shameful. <br /> <br /> Ossie Davis was the only bright light in this boring festival. The other performance was incredibly boring: it fit well with the film and whoever played the Captain set a new low standard for the delivery of lines. <br /> <br /> However, if you are willing to accept all the numerous flaws in this movie and are not worried about being amazed or entertained, but if you want to learn about the USS Mason, it is worth seeing them.
