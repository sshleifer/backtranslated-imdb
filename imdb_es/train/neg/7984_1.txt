Too many secondary raster lines without a primary. Too many hot buttons are pressed for no reason, they managed to fill this boring movie, which says nothing, with every dramatic element that exists: death, divorce, money problems, problems with parents, suicide, psychological problems, drug abuse, adoption , rejected love, travel problems, sex, misunderstandings of generations, theft, legal problems, weapons, medical ethics, "true and profound love"? You would think it would be an interesting movie, but would not it? All these events are secondary to something primary that is not there. Boring. Not to mention that the "super deep" (and the super long) for the child at the end of the movie is a complete nonsense. Pity. <br /> <br /> Oh, I forgot to mention: the actors, all of them, are pretty good. That's what kept me from turning it off. To the bad, his talents were wasted. The film is also well filmed: light, movement, etc. of each episode, everything is in its place. It's just the missing meaning.
