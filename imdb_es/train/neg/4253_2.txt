This must be one of the worst shots of vampires ever conceived by men. How can you turn such a fascinating subject into a totally boring story? Apparently it is not such a difficult task ... First of all, a sine qua non condition of any vampire movie is a dark and somber atmosphere with a nice sexy touch, it lacks all these things ... Too much light, the spots! Oh, my God, why in the name of Christ / Judas was that about? <br /> <br /> Every time Dracula appeared he was devoured by light (in the script to keep him weak, for the record: simply weak) There was only one scene that made it worth seeing, near the end of the movie (beautiful dance with Dracula and his new conquest). I really enjoyed the first one, the turn of Judas was definitely original, but this is not good, in any way. Hopefully the third take care of the signature of the vampire that I like so much in other classics like Nosogatu by Herzog, Dracula of Coppola or even Interview with the vampire.
