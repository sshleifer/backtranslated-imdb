Composer Robert Taylor (as Terry) is "dizzy, happy" and can not see Norma Shearer (as Consuelo) directly. "She makes the sun shine, even when it's raining," Mr. Taylor explains. But, Mr. Taylor has a lump in his throat every time he approaches Mrs. Shearer. Finally, at the Shearer casino in Palm Beach, Taylor proclaims "I love you!" Shearer rejects it, since she is engaged to George Sanders (as Tony). However, to settle a gambling debt, Shearer hires Taylor to pose as "Your cardboard lover", to make Mr. Sanders jealous. <br /> <br /> The title of this film invites obvious and appropriate three-word criticism: "Your Cardboard Movie". It is most notable as the last film appearance of Shearer, one of the biggest stars in the world, from "He Who Gets Slapped" (1924, playing another Consuelo) to "The Women" (1939). To be fair, this was probably the kind of Shearer movie that MGM believed the public wanted to see. However, the part is unflattering. <br /> <br /> With the momentum and power, Taylor and Shearer were better off in "The Escape" (1940). If Shearer had continued, she could have become a better actress than "the protagonist"; Apparently, she was no longer interested, and she certainly did not need the money. Taylor has a great scene, reciting "When I'm Dead, My Darling" by Christina Rossetti, while threatening to jump from Shearer's balcony, as George Cukor indicates. <br /> <br /> **** Your cardboard lover (6/42) George Cukor ~ Norma Shearer, Robert Taylor, George Sanders
