Black and white film. Good photography Credible characters. <br /> <br /> Simply horrible. <br /> <br /> I have lost another perfect evening watching a movie that others rated as "worthy" and "very good". Here is a good performance and the background configuration for the plot is good (it should have done more with this), but its growth is very slow and never develops. It is totally based on sex without much romance with much nudity that is not needed. More could have been done with the main characters. If you are looking for something to see with your family, this is not in the movie and, if not, you will have trouble reading it. Although this movie is long, it is only an inch deep.
