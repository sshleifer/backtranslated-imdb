Today I wrote this angry review on Uwe Boll and Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Hollywood has produced films based on one of our nation's darkest days. The 911 changed everything. It changed our perception of security. It changed our understanding of the evil of man and humanity. The most important and devastating thing is that it changed our world. <br /> <br /> However, I can not help but underline how repulsed, disillusioned and angry I am at the brazen and shameless ignorance of Hollywood that seeks to obtain a lucrative profit. Out of death and destruction. This film and those that are about to cause controversy in the midst of word of mouth between spectators and critics; Most likely, it will echo in the conventional press. Hollywood has sunk to a new low. Even lower than the bastards who committed the most barbarous acts of savagery and relentless cruelty. Behind everything is Uwe Boll. I am very angry with this movie. How dare they not respect the memories of the families of the lost? How dare they mock the lives of the brave men and women who risked their lives to save those trapped in the towers condemned on that fateful day of infamy? How dare they try to satirize and at the same time take advantage of a national tragedy in the midst of a world of mourning and tired after 911?!?!?! How dare they? <br /> <br /> To those who have the nerve to even think about seeing this morally dreadful farce, I say this with a heavy heart with all my strength: Remember. Think about that day and ask yourself if you are a healthy and moral person. Think about that day, ask yourself if this movie is a shame and disgrace to the lives lost on that day. Think of that day of the clamor of the families of your loved ones. Think of that day of the lives lost in those two planes. Think of the new butchery that he caused after the attacks. <br /> <br /> Ask yourself if you have a soul. <br /> <br /> Think. Remember. Respect the memories of the lives lost in 911 by not seeing this movie at all.
