There is only one use for a movie like Bulletproof: it reminds you how bad it can be. We often see movies that we describe as "pretty awful" or "not very good", but then you come across a movie like this and you can see that, although all those other movies are not "good", they are not as disgustingly bad as Bulletproof . This was a birthday present from someone who spent less than two seconds looking at the DVD supermarket at our local grocery store to fulfill an obligation (that is, to give me a gift). It could have been a fortuitous finding, but it was not: this is so clich√©, so badly written, so misdirected, so badly acted that I am surprised that everyone involved has not been arrested and sent since 10 years ago. God, it's horrible. I suspected it from about 30 seconds, but I continued because sometimes, sometimes, bad movies are so bad that they can be nice. This is not one of them. It's just bad I stopped looking after 45 minutes, and tomorrow I'll throw it in the trash.
