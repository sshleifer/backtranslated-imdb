I like many of the actors / actresses involved in this project, so to feel insulted by the film I felt even worse than if they had used something unknown. The main problem was that this film was clearly a concept created to attract baby boomers. 30 years NBC will probably make a movie like this in the early 90's. I can see it now, a black family where children are involved with the riots and the white family has rebellious children and listen to grunge music. The soundtrack will have bands like Nirvana, NWA, Public Enemy, Soundgarden, etc. The movie will be as cheesy as the 60s and I guarantee that NBC will do it. Seeing the biggest problem with vintage pieces when you finish buying networks is that when you are living in a certain period of time you are not thinking that I am living in The 60s or whatever it is a retro fashion at the moment. The next time someone does something like that, they should put more weight on the project.
