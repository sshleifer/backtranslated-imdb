This is one of the worst performances I've seen. I love Almereyda's Nadja, but this is just absolute nonsense. Apart from a few moments of interesting cinematography and music, this movie is a good non-stop performance and stupid material. Jared Harris is particularly bad, but nobody in this is remotely good. The plot is a joke, but not the type haha. I do not even know if you can forgive movies that are so bad. Please delete the last hour and a half of my life. How did this director make Nadja and Another Girl Another Planet?
