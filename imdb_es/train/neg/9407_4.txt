"Houseboat Horror" is often considered to be the worst Australian film ever made and described as a typical slasher movie, which led to the promotion "Watch the movie you can not get an Academy Award". death by maniac burned while trying to film a music video in a remote lake in the Australian outback. They acted in a funny way and wrote a slasher movie with zero suspense and annoying characters. Without a doubt, it offers the blood: the heads are divided in two with a machete, the throats are cut and a woman is killed with a horseshoe. If you like corny slasher movies, you can try this, but you have been warned. At least it's better than the Swedish "The Bleeder" .4 out of 10.
