The Pallbearer is a disappointment and, at times, extremely boring with a love story that simply does not work in part with the casting of Gwyneth Paltrow (Julie). Gwyneth Paltrow goes through the whole movie with a confused expression on her face and it's hard to say what David Schwimmer even sees in her. <br /> <br /> However, The Pallbearer is sometimes fun, especially the church scene and group scenes. With their friends they are a laugh but that is basically that. Watch The Pallbearer just for those scenes and advance the rest. Trust me that you are not missing much.
