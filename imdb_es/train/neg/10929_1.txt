This movie was the most beautiful Mormon movie made so far. It made the RM & Sons of Provo look like well-made movies! It was supposed to be fun because of what they told me. The best part was the best actor in the movie, Travis Eberhard, if he was not in the movie, it probably would not have been done! He ruled! <br /> <br /> 10. It was not funny 9. He was beaten 8. He had Thurl Big T Bailey, whose character did not make sense 7. He was made in Provo 6. He did not make fun of Brokeback 5. He had Larry H. Miller in was 4. It was the first film that Clint Howard did not make in 3. The perfect movie was chosen by Gary Coleman. He commented on the auditions of Surreal Life 1. It was made by Halestorm Entertainment!
