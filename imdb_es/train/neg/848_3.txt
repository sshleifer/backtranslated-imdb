Okay, if you're looking for another Bastketball journal, this is a completely wrong movie. <br /> <br /> I turn around two brothers. Max, the youngest, has a great addiction to cocaine. Adam, the eldest, is a doctor. It is assumed that this film shows the fall of reality to the extreme minimums that drugs make possible. However, it does not. It shows that cocaine can be fun no matter what the situation is. Most of the focus of the film is on Max and his farewell ways. Eventually, Adam can no longer relieve stress from his work and also starts using it (prescription drugs). <br /> <br /> This movie has almost no climax. It does not come down to what cocaine really does to you, it has boring, low-budget scenes, and the performance of the older brother, Adam, is horrible. <br /> <br /> I have no idea how this movie has managed. to pass and receive awards, it is not a heart of heart. If you want a clear and true film about the extreme world of drugs, do not buy "The Basketball Diaries". And notice the difference. <br /> <br /> Try to avoid this movie but, if you think you will enjoy it. Test and see for yourself ...
