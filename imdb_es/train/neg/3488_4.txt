Question: How does a bourgeois director deal with an issue like immigration? Answer: turning it into a parable of existential alienation. <br /> <br /> Yes, we are back in the early 90s, just after the disintegration of the Eastern Bloc and the consequent flood of immigrants in the European Union, and what better way to deal with the issue than to do a film about an existentially alienated middle class journalist, an existentially alienated upper class politician, his existentially alienated rich wife, and so on. <br /> <br /> In the background, immigrants ask for political asylum in a nameless Greek town near the borders. I guess in that way Angelopoulos can show some social awareness, while dealing with the upper classes existentially in trouble. I mean honestly, the scene in which a high-ranking military officer curses his fate because he sent his daughter to study in London is enough to make you vomit. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it can not be so bad Angelopoulos is a master of the cinematographic art, after all, right? Incorrect. It is at this point that his gestures begin to become too artificial, like a filtered image in Photoshop. His usual tricks appear: there are blurred windows, blurred lights, a strange wedding, a walk along the riverbank and people with yellow coats. Mastroianni also opens new paths for most sleepwalking performances. Avoid really. Go for his first movies.
