A waste of my life, ... the director should be ashamed. why people feel that they need to make worthless movies will never make sense to me. When he died in the end, he made me laugh. I had to change the channel many times throughout the film because I was embarrassed to see it act so badly. Let's hope the guy who played Heath never goes back to work. On top of that, I hope that the director can never make another movie and that they pay back the paycheck for this shit. {.02 of 10}
