Lick, I take, I take! A 90-minute feast that lasts 89 minutes. A scenario full of atmosphere and possibility (an abandoned convent) is squandered by a stinking script filled with a clumsy and witty dialogue that strives to be so difficult. Most of it is simply shameful, and gonzo horror attempts go unnoticed (a sample of the dialogue of this film: after demonstrating his artillery, a quick shot was fired at a close-up of the vigilant character of Barbeau, she: ask? ", Hyuck hyuck hyuck). Bad acts, idiots, homophobic jokes and, judging by the effects of the creatures, it seems that the director has seen 'The Evil Dead' many times. <br /> <br /> I owe my friends a great time to rent this turkey and subject them to ninety wasted minutes that they will never recover. What turd.
