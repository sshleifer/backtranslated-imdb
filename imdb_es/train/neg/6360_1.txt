Can I please recover my $ 13.00? I would have preferred to see "Hydropower reaches North America". Again. This is a movie with one voice. The same voice, which comes from the mouths of all the characters regardless of age or gender. To hear that voice again, I would have to charge at least $ 150 per hour. And I do not take it for granted. It was strange to see Will Ferrell transform into Woody. But I do not think imaginative casting is enough. One must wait until they have a story before bothering to make a movie. Unless he's only doing it for money. And if that's the case, why not reissue an All-Rap version of "How about Tiger Lily?"
