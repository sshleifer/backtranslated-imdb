"This story is dedicated to women," according to the introduction, "who have been fighting for their rights since Adam and Eve started the loose-leaf system." When "Politics" was filmed, the Nineteenth Amendment, which guaranteed women the right to vote, was only a decade old. And, the film is about the exercise of political power by women as a voting group. Defending the ban, and closing the talks, was one of the main concerns of women at that time. <br /> <br /> The good Marie Dressler (as Hattie Burns) becomes politically active, after a young woman is shot to death by a clandestine bar. She wants the liquor sales meetings closed; and, it is written in a Mayoral career, after delivering a powerful speech at a women's rally. Mrs. Dressler has the support of her tenants, best friend Polly Moran (as Ivy Higgins) and her stuttering husband Roscoe Ates (as Peter Higgins). Dressler's career for mayor of Lake City attracts opposition from the city's men; then, Dressler orders the women to go on strike, denying them, "everything" in the "living room, bedroom and bathroom". <br /> <br /> The movie sounds much better than it turned out. Humor, frankly, is not too good; and, presents some situations without grace and moderately offensive ("You look like Madame Queen" refers to a character of Amos and Andy). And, the mix of shots and slapstick does not mix well, this time. The producers could have considered making the film more dramatic, focusing exclusively on Dressler and the characters played by William Bakewell (as Benny Emerson) and Karen Morley (as Myrtle Burns). <br /> <br /> **** Politics (7/25/31) Charles Reisner ~ Marie Dressler, Polly Moran, Roscoe Ates
