I have read reviews that apparently you have to have been a student in a very strict British school in the 1960s to understand this. Maybe that's true, if so, then this movie is outdated. <br /> <br /> ************* SPOILER ALERT ************** ************ ************** The end makes as much sense as all the guys who are against the government and anti-corporation without having any better solution that does not incite society to a type of scum of Mad Max. <br /> <br /> Yes, the main characters could leave, but they do not. The reasons why they do this do not make sense. There is not enough character development to explain why. What is supposed to shoot a group of innocent people is never explained or implied. It is mentioned that war is the final creative expression, possibly the only revelation that the characters of this film have, and it does not make sense. <br /> <br /> The characters involved in a wave of murders are not fighting The institution, they are just killing people. I thought that they could have used all the explosives to blow up the place or at least the sanctuary at the end, that would have had a greater symbolic meaning, but they did not. <br /> <br /> tl; dr - This film is the dream of a teenager to fight against the authority that torments them, although in reality they need it. It has no moral, symbolic, or meaning for it; This movie simply shows the fantasy of killing teachers and "power" people that bother you. <br /> <br /> If you think that a murder or shooting in a school similar to columbine or virginia technology is a rational and sensible way of dealing with teachers and institutions that you do not like, then I guess you will love this movie. If you are like me and you are working to make a life for yourself instead of just blindly (very blindly in this movie) rebel against "the man", this movie is youthful and boring. <br /> <br /> You can also say in some parts that funding was missing, and the story seemed to have a bit of attention deficit disorder. <br /> <br /> In general, this seems to be a rough draft of what could have been a good movie, but no effort is put into dialogue, character development or morality, so it is. .. badly done. <br /> <br /> Yes ... I could only recover my two hours.
