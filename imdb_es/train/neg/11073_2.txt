This is incredibly bad and embarrassing for a Canadian. We cultivate good wine. Our writers and poets are among the best in the world. The National Ballet is ranked among the five best companies in the world. BUT WE MAKE INCREDIBLE BLOOD FILMS! This is not especially bad. It's especially typical and typically bad, filmed in two-bit hotels and public parks with thin management, acting at the high school level and "gee whiz ... let's see what this camera button does?" Photography. If Michael Moriarity was so focused on making a personification of Jack Nicholson, could not he at least have done a GOOD personification of Jack Nicholson? And if the film was shot in Vancouver, truly one of the most beautiful cities in the world and also a center for yacht construction (part of the "plot"), why do we let the endemic Canadian inferiority complex dictate that it will be disguised ? Seattle ??? Not only am I angry at this movie, I'm embarrassed and more than a little embarrassed. The Australians produce some splendid things. We produce piffle of pretentious second class. Gawd !!!!!
