I did not expect much from this movie, after the terrible "Life is a miracle". It turns out that this movie is ten times worse than "Life ...". I have the impression that the director / writer is joking with the audience: "let me see how much emptiness you can (audience) sustain". The dialogues are empty, ... the stage is minimalist. In a few moments, photography is very beautiful. Few sarcastic lines are half funny, but it's hard to really laugh during this "comedy". I have laughed at myself for being able to see the movie until the end. If you can rise above this director's fiasco, ... you'll find good performance from few legends (Miki Manojlovic, Aleksandar Bercek), and very good performance from Emir's son, Stribor Kusturica. <br /> <br /> In summary: How bad for such a good director! Emir Kusturica is still young and should be making first class movies. Instead, he chooses to make this low-budget theater movie just for my private cinema, with an arrogant attitude towards world trends and neglect towards his old fans.
