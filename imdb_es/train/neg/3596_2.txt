To be as honest as possible, The Devil's Plaything (or Veil of Blood or Vampire Ecstasy or The Curse of the Black Sisters or ????) is a total bore. The movie has a good premise behind it? The resurrection of a dead vampire long ago through the body of a descendant through the help and assistance of a group of women dressed in black? But the execution is horrible. There are large and long moments of time on the screen when, literally, nothing happens. The characters are left with nothing to do. There is no mystery, no suspense, and there are no plot points to worry about. The acting is simply abysmal. Most of the action consists of a group of women who look below average dancing naked while looking at the camera. They do it repeatedly. And the little plot there seems to be designed to get more of these women less than attractive naked so they can participate in the dance. While it's not as bad or useless as the dance or plot in something like Orgy of the Dead, it's coming.
