Visually interesting, but it falls flat in the originality department. This tedious exercise in technique is exhausted after the initial battle. Jude Law has the charisma of burnt toast, but in his defense this film contains some of the worst dialogues I've seen on the big screen. In fact, the script is so poor that it keeps you out of the movie and made me think about the work, the accounts, my dogs, etc. There are many moments that scream on blue screen. Paltrow is as wooden as they get. This could have been saved by the quick dialogue of the film or the upper camp. My only complaint about the technique is that the film in black and white (sorry, computer) would help because it looks like Turner colored in black and white. Just a big clich√© boring mess. I would rather break my femur than go through this stress test again.
