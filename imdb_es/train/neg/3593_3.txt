This is a 1974 German film that has to do with some women who come to a castle and beyond that, I can not really tell you their purpose or even what the purpose of the film is. I can tell you that there are several women who also work in the moonlight as servants in this particular castle who strip naked, put on body paint and turn the bongos as if they were in the Goth Kit-Kat Klub, and that seems to be a good part of the execution time of this movie. Yes, there seems to be something with the adoration of the devil and the vampires, and there are things of girl with girl, etc., but the main focus seems to be the painted babies that spin in the basement. I liked the fact that one of the main housewives / worshipers of the devil went around, which gave authenticity to the procedures and made it even more evil. Was that Wanda lesbian the evil one (as it appears in the credits)? No matter. If you're not too demanding with your lesbian demon worship movies, you might like this, otherwise it's kind of boring and I could not even finish it, I was so bored. 3 out of 10
