This was the most useless movie I've seen, since there was no argument and the actors did not seem to care. 90% of the movie had absolutely no argument, I laughed so hard that my ribs began to hurt. the part where the old men when they captured Robert Duvall was ridiculous. at a leadership level, making a black film does not involve many rain sequences and useless close-ups on the main character. This is a failed attempt to create a black thriller and, instead, alienates the viewer with incoherent scenes. Since this was based on a 'manuscript' by John Grisham, I do not consider this to be one of his books for film adaptations, since it does not show the suspense and the plot as films like 'the signature' or 'the maker' of rain'.
