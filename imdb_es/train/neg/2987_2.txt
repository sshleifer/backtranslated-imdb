The dubbing / translation in this movie is absolutely fun and provides the only entertainment in this otherwise boring and derivative zombie movie. I have not laughed as much in my life as I have just seen Zombie 3 (and I've seen a really bad dub in my life, believe me). Seriously, the filmmakers could reprint this film and launch it as a comedy and win millions of dollars. It is simply funny. <br /> <br /> But ... If you fall off the couch and laugh at the dubbing in a zombie movie Fulci is not your cup of tea, then AVOID THIS AT ALL COSTS.
