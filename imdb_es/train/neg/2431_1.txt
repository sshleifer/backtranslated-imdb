As a Turk who now lives in Sweden, I must confess that I often watch Scandinavian films. Most if I never understand them. I think the Scandinavian actors work better in Hollywood. Last week I saw a movie called "The Polish Wedding" together with a Polish friend of mine and we both said it was the worst movie we had ever seen. Unfortunately I was wrong in this movie "House of Angels" is even worse. None of the actors can act, absolutely not the woman named Helen Bergstrom. The plot is so stupid that nobody can believe it. I think everything is a disaster from the beginning. A lot of bad acting, except from Selldal and Wollter. Ahmed Sellam
