I've never seen anything so horrible as this movie for quite some time. The movie was boring, long and frightening plot. The special effects stink a lot. It's like watching a movie in 1999. It's a total loss of an hour and a half of my time. Matthew Settle's performance was pretty bad. I saw him in the Banda de los Hermanos playing Lieutenant Sponder, it was not so bad. In fact, it's not bad at all. But in this movie, his performance was not convincing enough, it was quite bad and there was no chemistry between the rest of the team either. Also, his eyes seem empty as if he did not feel it. It really surprised me, because I was good at Band of Brothers. <br /> <br /> Anyway, do not even bother watching this movie. It's a big waste of BIG time. Even if you had to kill an hour or two, get something else to do besides watch this movie. Trust me, you will regret it!
