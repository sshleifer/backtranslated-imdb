Take your basic Frankenstein movie, inject a little Reanimator (but not the good parts) and you'll have Doctor Hackenstein. Certainly, this was obviously inspired by the films mentioned, but it never materializes as something special in itself. <br /> <br /> A scientist accidentally kills his wife, so the whole movie unfolds over the course of a night while he tries. to revive his wife. To revive his wife, he decides to cut parts of the body of some women who have been stranded and, coincidentally, decides to spend the night at home. <br /> <br /> I can not say that the acting is bad. It is not the address either. Everything here is too standard. The little attempts at humor really work (check out the scene where Hackenstein hides behind his deaf assistant because he would undoubtedly be very upset if he saw him holding a woman and a needle), but that's not enough to recommend this movie. The music is decent, the blood there is decent and the cast looks pretty good. And for half the time, he even entertained me with this movie. But I never felt that this was more than a waste of time. Avoidable. <br /> <br /> Try Frankenhooker instead.
