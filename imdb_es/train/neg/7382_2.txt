Well, let me tell you that I have always been a fan of Steven Seagal and that his films are usually great, but this is not up to the rest. This in my opinion is very stupid, I did not like anything. The most important reason why I do not like it is because it has many flaws and for me it does not make much sense. The acting is very bad, even Steven Seagal does not do a good performance. I can see the rest of the actors because they only do it directly to the video films. It does not follow a direct story: everything happens at once, so it does not make much sense. Ther is just an action at all and to make an action movie good, action is usually needed on it. The special effects are very bad and can be said to be false. So, in general, this has to do with the worst movie of all the users, so if you want to see a Steven Seagal movie, do not rent it, just imagine that it does not exist. So avoid this movie. <br /> <br /> Overall score: ** of ********** <br /> <br /> * of *****
