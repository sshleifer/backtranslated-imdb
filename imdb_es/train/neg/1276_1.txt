This is the worst movie I've seen in my life. Let me say it again: THIS IS THE ONLY SMALL MOVIE I HAVE SEEN. <br /> <br /> It had all the hallmarks of a bad movie: continuity errors, bad writing, poor performance, poor production. , bad music. I thought there were a couple of points for horror movies. The first is that it is supposed to be suspense enough to scare you. This movie is put and F in this category. The second point is that when a character dies, or something bad happens to them, we're supposed to worry. This movie gets an F in this sense too. <br /> <br /> The first story, a woman is mutilated by wolves after being afraid of this happening to her. The next story, a boy with OCD dies from not being careful and talks to a dead friend. Oh, and then there's the horrible, scathing story of a bad roommate. Come on, could you choose subjects a little more interesting and less common than being alone in a house, being anal-retentive and having a roommate? It turns out that all these stories are hallucinations, virtual reality induced by a doctor who in turn uses it himself. Wow, stupid. <br /> <br /> Let me explain something to you, I enjoy watching horror movies and laughing at how bad they are. I could not do that with this one. It was a total pain to sit and watch. Do not see this movie under any circumstances. You will regret it.
