I have read all the favorable comments here and I am impressed with the imagination of those who loved this movie. I can not say that I found much to recommend it. The soundtrack of Leonard Cohen is not only excessively heavy-handed, but rather sad. The film seems authentic enough, but something has to happen to make it work, and nothing long ago: a superficial plot (not a real problem for me), not much development of characters, nothing thematic. It simply advances along. In spite of being defective, Cimino's "Heaven's Gate" has some moments of real wonder and it is a film that I would prefer to see again. For a brilliant reconception of the West, HBO's "Deadwood" is far superior to "McCabe."
