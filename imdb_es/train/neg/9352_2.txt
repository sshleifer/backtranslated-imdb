It can often be said that a film did not turn out as it should due to the intensive use of a narrator. This movie presents this device throughout. Richard Jobson, who is not entirely happy to write directly and even finance part of this film, adds to his credits by reading excerpts from his own semi-autobiographical writings, which combined with a beautiful edition, manage to overlook what is a boring and depressing story that must confuse. For the house of genuine art. Kevin McKidd does a good performance. Everyone is fine. <br /> <br /> Budgetary constraints mean that all scenes are recorded in daylight, although most obviously must be at night, although if you know serious alcoholics, they operate mainly on the day, so for me , adds a touch of realism. <br /> <br /> The funniest part of this movie is a waitress who does not age a single day in the odd 20 years between her appearances: a more extreme version of the problem that McKidd has going from 18 to 30 without changing more than his clothes. To bless.
