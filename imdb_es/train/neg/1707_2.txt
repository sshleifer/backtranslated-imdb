and a budget of $ 30,000 and this movie still looks like it was made for $ 50. It can be said, from the first frame to the last, that he did not care a bit about the continuity or the plot of the movies, he was happy to be making a zombie movie. <br /> <br /> What shows the final result is a lazy filmmaker who loves zombie movies. It could have been great if only I had taken care. The end result is an infinite zoom in bad gore, and even more badly produced metal plays with it. <br /> <br /> What happens when you combine great hopes, big dreams, a decent budget, hard work and one? Idiot behind the camera.
