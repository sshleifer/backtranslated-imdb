Spoiler warning. <br /> <br /> When the main character's sister is pushed down the stairs, the killer breaks a glass of vodka by his side to make it look like he's been drinking. But just before they kill her, she tells her sister's business partner (Teri Garr) that she has not had a drink in 4 days. However, the police never mention the results of a toxicology report! And, the characters talk about being drunk when they fell down the stairs. Eh Very wrong mistake in this movie, which is pretty horrible, in general. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly bad, considering the great cast. Some faults: the writing is not very good, the music is made for TV, and there is no tension at all because we already know the answer to the mystery of the first scene of the film.
