<br /> <br /> I saw this on the science fiction channel. He arrived just after the first one. For some reason this movie kept me interested. I do not know why, stop asking. <br /> <br /> --- SPOILERS --- Okay ... It was silly how this guy got involved in the making of the movie. In the first movie, he had a "reason" to kill people, but in this sequence, half of the assassinations / assassination attempts were basically for no reason. Stanley killed the director because of creative differences, he captured the co-writer because of creative differences, but what was the deal with trying to kill the cast? Without cast, without film. Did he want it to look real when they died? If this was supposed to be a movie with such a high budget, use the special effects, MAN. Of course, like the first one, the captured girl escapes, and Stanley ends up entangled and disappears. Woooooow (sarcasm) This movie had potential. And the saddest thing of all ... the really sad part ... I would see a "Cabin by the Lake 3". Just because I like Judd Nelson, and he's the only good part of this episode.
