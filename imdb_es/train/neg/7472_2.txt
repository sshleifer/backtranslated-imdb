This show seemed to be a little good. Kyra Sedgwick is a good actress and I like the police series, but somewhere in the production this program went very wrong. <br /> <br /> First of all, the writers should have more suspects than one, you know who did it EVERY TIME !!!!! That makes it boring. The main character is incredibly annoying and is not credible in any way. I know they wanted her to be strong, but she's bad, stupid and bad boss. The crimes are uninteresting and soft, and it's just boring all the time. As stated earlier, I hate him ... <br /> <br /> In general, it was a big disappointment and very bad ...
