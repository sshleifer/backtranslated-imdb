Really. Is there a week that Oprah does not remind us that she was mistreated as a child? <br /> <br /> It becomes the focus of each interview. <br /> <br /> Oprah can not resist commenting on the answer to every question she asks. He often interrupts the guests before he finishes an answer to interrupt his own anecdote or comment. Obviously, the directors are instructed to focus on their foreground reaction rather than on the faces of the guests because that is what counts: what Oprah feels, what Oprah says. <br /> <br /> Oprah, Oprah, Oprah. It's always about Oprah. <br /> <br /> Oprah says: "I'm sorry for me, I was so poor." Feel the pain of my battle with my weight. Feel my pain when I move away from a luxury store after they have already closed. I feel good about buying my magazines and books. I feel good about my success. Feel good when you give my charity to see me well. Feel good about getting rich beyond what I can believe. <br /> <br /> My interpretation of your point of view: ALL THE VIEWERS ARE VERY DECEIVED AND YOU NEED MY DAILY ADVICE. I have all the answers for your life, although I have nothing in common with you. I have never married nor do I want to be. I have never had to start a family, but I know everything. I have little respect for men or marriage. Clearly, I prefer people like me over others, a witness to "Legends Ball 2006". Gayle is my best friend, but we are not gay. <br /> <br /> As of 7/31/2006, the header of your website says: "Oprah.com is your main source of information about love, life, I, relationships, food, home, spirit and health ". How presumptuous and hateful is that? <br /> <br /> In June 2006, she crashed into two private wedding receptions in Oklahoma to gather images of her September 2006 shows. She keeps promising to leave television but her fight goes on without an end to the view. <br /> <br /> Contrary to what she thinks, Oprah is not a queen or a goddess nor is she on a personal mission from God. She is just a very lucky and overweight black woman who copied Phil Donahue's style and called it her own. It turned out that he was in the right place at the right time and knew exactly how to aim for the right demographic. <br /> <br /> Oprah is the P.T. Barnum of this age and I am surprised that people can not see through its facade. <br /> <br /> So, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, and also Oprah, if you can pass that inflated ego through the door, this way now to the big exit ...
