Ariauna Albright is a really good actress, but why she participated in this written parody is a mystery. What might have been entertaining ends up as classic boredom. The only thing that Ariauna has is that she can act and look very sexy compared to her partner Lilith Stabs, who looks good, but obviously spent the money for the spa's acting school or the beautician. This was a production that claimed by some T & A & with an imaginative scriptwriter that could have achieved it in the flow of things. However, Ariauna does what she can under the circumstances and to a certain extent rescues her reputation. The Tempe company should be aware that when you see two attractive women in fetishistic police uniforms, the spectators will expect some fetish play and T & A. Nough said.
