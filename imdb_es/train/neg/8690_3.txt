Everyone involved (and the audience) should look for "The Candidate" to see how good this movie could have been. What happened to South American history? What did Julie Christie and Kate Capshaw think to allow their papers to be cardboard cutouts? So far I have liked all the performances and / or films of Gene Hackman. I was disinterested (which I can hardly believe) or terribly misinformed. I have also liked and defended Richard Gere (and I have been reviled for it). But here I did not have "power". He was never intimidating and only occasionally persuasive. In general, I was very disappointed. I really expected a lot more from this director and the cast. If you can not find "The Candidate" see "Wag the dog" again or even "Bulworth".
