This is, without doubt, one of the worst movies I've seen ... <br /> <br /> The plot is so full of holes, the story is like a bad version of a bad thriller and the actors. It sounds as if they were reading directly from the manuscript for the first time. The worst of all is Steve Guttenberg. He plays his character as if he were in the "Police Academy", the same foolish womanizer, and that is not appropriate for a man standing out in what should have been a thriller. <br /> <br /> It's really hard to believe that Hanson would. make "LA Confidential" ten years later ... <br /> <br /> Avoid this as the plague ...
