Home Alone 3 is one of my least favorite movies. It's the cream of the crop, or s *** if you tend to be more cynical, as it rises (or falls) there with things like Battlefield Earth and Flinstones: Viva Rock Vegas. In fact, it could even be worse than those two, since those two at least intermittently made me laugh at his stupidity. This made me feel pain constantly and applaud when the credits started to roll. No other movie has made me tremble with pain. Now I will point out exactly why this movie is so incredibly atrocious. <br /> <br /> First of all, the plot is ridiculous. It revolves around a chip in a remote control car (?!) That is out of place and how these terrorists want it. Stupid things. <br /> <br /> The action that occurs is similar to that of the other two Home Alons, with explosive traps and all, but seeing how these traps are executed is, instead of being fun, incredibly unpleasant to watch. I did not laugh (not even as much as a smile) once, rather, I shrugged constantly and hoped the terrorists would catch the child. The bird, instead of providing comic relief, was funny and annoying. <br /> <br /> The performance, as a group of non-names does, varies from poor to atrocious. There is not a single good performance here. Alex D.Linz is absolutely disgusting and funny as a child, while terrorists act (and, judging by the credits of his film, look), as they were rushed out of the street ... and well, that's all . <br /> <br /> I can see some people saying: "Man, it's for children. Do not discourage, man." Well, MAN, children may like this, but they can improve a lot. See Monsters Inc. and Toy Story before you even consider taking this out. Hell, even Scooby Doo and Garfield (who suck, see those reviews for more) are better than this. <br /> <br /> So, in summary, this is an irremissibly atrocious movie. This was clearly recycled for the money, since it almost started the first two; The only thing is that he also completely insults the first two. No human, child or otherwise, should find any reason to see Alone at home 3. Never. It's that bad. <br /> <br /> 0/5 stars
