My friends and I rented this for "Bad Movie Night" with high hopes, but The Brain was somewhat disappointing. The Brain itself has a glorious appearance, but mostly only sits on its small platform. Who thought it would be great if the Brain could only chew three people for an extended 94 minutes? At first, this film has a number of things in favor, including an advantage of Est√©vez playing a rebellious genius (we are told that his enormous intellect is misdirected to his elaborate school jokes and acrobatics, which include putting glue in the chair crazy of someone ). It also has some big lines, a henchman hilariously out of shape and out of breath that barely manages to be everywhere, and yes, some girl gets naked. However, the director desperately needs some education in the art of rhythm. During the last half, things start crawling again and again, with at least 3 or 4 boring and meaningless chase scenes that make up the middle third of the plot. The scenes within the PRI complex are especially bad. At least 15 minutes of this movie are people who run down the same staircase. I could have arranged the script for this thing in half an hour: more cheese, more blood, more nudity, more brain action. If you're going to make a bad horror movie, at least give me something great to watch while my superego goes off. Maybe the director was really trying to attract the audience to his movie. I started to feel like one of the zombie people at the end of this crapfest.
