Miraculously, this is really quite visible. I mean, it's bad. It is really bad. But while the original was so bad that it is ruining my life, this is so bad that it is somewhat entertaining. Well, that's enough weak praise. The production values ​​are rotten in all areas, the performance is unbearable and the satire of Romero-wannabe can not decide which side of the fence of ecology is being mocked. The internal logic occupies a second plane in the heads that are propelled outside the refrigerators, the incubation times of viruses fluctuate according to what the "plot" requires, the bullets work against the zombies or not, the zombies have the power to speak or do not. Gore is the draw, obviously, but the frame is so slapdash that it's annoying. The dialogue sounds as if it had been translated by the same computers that manipulate the instruction manuals, and the scale of the infestation of zombies is not implied in any of the ingenuity of Romero's films. Everything is topped with a horrible synth score. Absolute garbage.
