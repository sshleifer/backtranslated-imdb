You can say that they spent $ 5 doing this. It's a waste of time ... ugh ... there's nothing remotely good about this movie ... I do not know why I kept seeing it ... the chick is not horny acting horrible ... you could do anything and it's a better use of your time ... like watching TV playing fucking video games ... I feel robbed. Simply stolen .. from my time. I have never done a review for a movie as you can probably say, but this movie I felt I needed to save the poor souls who are about to see it and look at IMDb before to see if it is decent and look at the comments. -There was no action- -no hot girls- -no budget- -shittttttttttttttty acting- screams bad movie. **** The whole movie is in a room. ***
