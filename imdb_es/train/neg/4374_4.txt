<br /> <br /> The entrails of a Virgin are so strange and incomprehensible that they allow the spectator to interpret her in a subjective way, applying whatever meaning she desires to her inexplicable excesses of sex and violence. If this were an intentional characteristic of the film, it would be a work of postmodern brilliance, but of course it is not. <br /> <br /> Without going too far into the summary of the plot, let's take a quick tour of the events. In an isolated cabin, an orgy is in progress, which includes topless wrestling and diapers. A group of those who arrive late joins the orgy in progress, but unknowingly, they have been followed by a monster that I like to call "the muddy ninja". This monster precedes to kill the participants of the orgy one by one, except the proverbial virgin (if it does not count the oral sex) that receives its seed and, therefore, is so passionate with the desire that it masturbates with the hand cut from someone. <br /> <br /> Finally, they took out her insides, and then there is a scene that seems to imply that she is pregnant with a muddy ninja baby. Do you have all that? If you are going to rent this movie, it is better that you do not speak Japanese and do not have subtitles. In a season populated by boring Hollywood movies, putting this in your VCR may be the cinematic equivalent of shock therapy. No doubt it will be something different.
