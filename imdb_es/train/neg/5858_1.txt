This was assigned to the fans since the "winner takes all" match occurred between two separate "companies" (the World Wrestling Federation and the "Alliance": an amalgamation of the former superstars of WCW and ECW. The final match to doubt the superior company was a team fight, the fighters limited themselves to throwing opponents from each side of the ring to another, each fighter concludes that to eliminate their opponents and intensify the fight, interference is necessary. The wrestler simply hits an opponent, hits a special move, and marks a partner.The story had been previously marred by Vince's subterfuge that a member of Allance would be deranged and join WWF. WWF prevails In general: very innovative story but poor execution, which is not the shortage of fighters because the format of the match is the tag team. simply disgusting: <br /> <br /> Edge versus T est: powerful "big boot" of Test, but this did not show the true talents of both stars <br /> <br /> Al Snow Versus Christian: good match but superlative to pay per view <br /> Taji vs. William Regal: the worst match of the night <br /> <br /> Immunity Battle Royal: This was an incredibly fun game to watch, but because the Main stars of both companies participated in the main event, only one fighter characteristically appearing in "Heat" and is probably a lightweight rejection of the WCW (ie, the hurricane that is simply hired as an artist) <br /> < Hardy Boyz Versus Dudley Boyz: The best game of the night: Jeff Hardy executed a "Swanton bomb" from the top of a cage and through a wooden table and Matt got into the cage, which seemed to be extremely painful. <br /> <br /> Because Stone Cold was the WWF champion, Rob Van Dam was the Hardcore Champion, and Kurt Angle was a "mole" in the all-star alliance in the main event in the Faction of "The Alliance" was awarded a job after the outcome of the match, except for Booker T., who recently attacked a fighter on "Raw" and, inevitably, will be given work. Shane McMahon will return to television in some way, and all wished to witness the fall and disappearance of "the Alliance" to see Stone Cold without working. The WWF has done much better. A match in which all the players were taken to a faction would have been better, and what happened to the Casket and Iron Man games?
