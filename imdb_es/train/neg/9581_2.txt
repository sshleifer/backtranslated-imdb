That's the only positive thing I can say about this movie. Cleveland is the star, I've been there and I've never seen the city look so good. Beautiful river and urban landscapes. <br /> <br /> This film is advancing at such a pace that they hope they do not notice the lack of relevance in the real world. People running and firing weapons without any consequence. For example, there is a shooting in the house of Rob Lowe's character: two cars are stolen and, nevertheless, the police do not appear until much later in the film. Contract killing never looked so implausible. <br /> <br /> Whoever wrote this movie must be at the receiving end of one of the countless lost bullets. Many of the actors in this movie are much better than this. I check the date of the movie just to make sure it was not written during the writers strike, but unfortunately it was not like that. This movie is currently in rotation on Universal's HD channel, unless you want to drool over Lowe, there's no reason to see it.
