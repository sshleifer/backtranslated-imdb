You like pretty girls Yeah me too. What's wrong with saying about beautiful girls / women? Nothing imo, then why would I give this film only 2 stars out of 5, even though it got the "talents" of Chiaki Kuriyama and Aya Ueto? <br /> <br /> If I really wanted to see beautiful people, I would watch MTV or something like that. This is a movie, an action movie called though. So, by definition, it does not even really need a plot, right? I do not agree 100%, but let's say yes. So, what do you need? 20 minutes of images from part 1 (Could I be exaggerating a bit, but I felt like more than 20 minutes ...)? That would be "No". But, once again, you never know, the people who saw the first part might not know what they ate this morning at breakfast, so let us know ... hey, maybe you remember it twice? Just to be sure they will not forget ... at least until the credits pile up, of course! <br /> <br /> So forget the story, the character development, the real emotions, the "acting" (and no, I do not think women in skirts who walk and / or fight are responsible of the performance)! ... what does that leave? Yes, the action scenes. The action scenes are not bad and that's the reason why I gave the movie 2 stars instead of 1. I was giving this movie a shot, but it was a waste of time ... You have better things to do / see, believe me ...
