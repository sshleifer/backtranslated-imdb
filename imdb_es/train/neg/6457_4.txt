I guess I've seen worse movies, but that may be because I'm so tired of how normal these horror movies are. The killer monster is really very bad, basically it's a guy in a green suit. The performance of the movie B is much worse, but do not think for a second that this was something stellar, hell not. In fact, I had a plot with substance, but I was still pretty stupid. Basically it's just a bad low budget horror movie. But at least it's not as bad as titanic, that movie sucks balls, it just sucks. The blood looks really fake in this movie. That is a complaint that I have about all the horror of the new millennium, the blood goes down, it looks stupid. A good scene of dreadful death with really false blood is so stupid. At least there was a good shower scene.
