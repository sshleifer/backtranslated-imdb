I can not find out who gave this thing a green light! It has no redeeming qualities, none, nothing, zip, zilch. <br /> <br /> the performance was bad. The address was bad. The writing was bad. The plot was bad. the music was bad. The editing was bad. .... well, at least the filmmakers were constant.
