When I saw that the IMDb users rated this movie with the lowest 250 movies, I thought it was too hard but little did I know that the low rating was absolutely correct. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of the Wayans brothers. I loved his Scary Movie 2 and I even enjoyed White Chicks. Little Man, however, laughed very little and the jokes were obsolete. <br /> <br /> Obviously, the joke will revolve around Marlon Wayans, who plays an adult dwarf who recently got out of jail. He and his partner, Tracy Morgan, steal a diamond for a gangster. Things go wrong and the dwarf has to place the diamond with an unsuspecting couple played by Shawn Wayans and Kerry Washington. To recover the diamond, the dwarf pretends to be an abandoned baby at the door of unsuspecting couples. Of course, he is admitted and the drama begins in the search for the diamond. <br /> <br /> The film features some actors and actresses from Saturday Night Live such as Molly Shannon and Rob Schneider, as well as In Living Color. All these talents, however, can not help the poor script and the jokes that just were not fun. <br /> <br /> The special effects to make Marlon Wayans look like a dwarf was fine. I mean, it was not 100% credible but it was good ... nothing great. I just wish the Wayans brothers had put more effort into developing a script with good jokes instead of trying to prop up their poor script with cameos from their famous actors and comedic actresses. <br /> <br /> Expect it on cable or television. It really is not worth any amount of money.
