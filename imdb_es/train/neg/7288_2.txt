NOTE TO ALL DIRECTORS: Largo is not necessarily good. This movie is incredibly long. However, it is not good. The scenes were drawn road, road, road, road, too long. The sex scenes were unnecessary, and often too long. The movie edited at 2 hours and 10 minutes or so would have been exceptional, but unfortunately it became so boring that I can only give it a 2 out of 10. It's way below average. <br /> <br /> Some other problems also exist in this marathon. <br /> <br /> 1) Ralph Fiennes interprets a complete family tree. The boy who played the great-grandfather is nothing like him, but the grandfather, father and son (who gives us the constant and unnecessary voice) are all Ralph Fiennes with different facial hair and the same basic personality of bull's head . No one seems to realize that each of these children looks like a clone of the latter, even though the photos of them are taken at every moment. This one is smaller, but if the movie had not lasted 3 weeks, it would not have been so annoying. <br /> <br /> 2) The fact that no news from Germany was even whispered for a long time. Jews being rounded and expelled is ridiculous. Some word would have come to them and the idea of ​​trying to escape would probably have been discussed. The uncle in France would surely have sent a warning to try to get them to leave. <br /> <br /> 3) The love stories in this movie are totally wrong. You spend forever telling us this and the development of relationships between the main characters is extremely short. Suddenly ... people are in love and almost instantaneously ... married. Then have children. Then, we draw things for 6 centuries and we forget to develop relationships. Again, this would not have stood out so much in a 2-hour movie, but with the time spent we were not given anything. <br /> <br /> 4) The ending was just bad. I do not want to spoil it for anyone, but you will not like it either ... unless you're a sadist. <br /> <br /> The director / writer must be tortured having to see this swollen garbage. a weekly basis, I mean endless loop, oops are the same thing. <br /> <br /> I wonder if Robert Redford did anything for this movie, I mean, I think Istvan Szabo should be modeling his career as a director. Long movie that completely ruins any substance in the movie. A brief description of 'The Horse Whisperer', and Sunshine. <br /> <br /> Sunshine, perfect title. If you start looking while the sun is shining, it is likely to be fine after it gets dark when you leave.
