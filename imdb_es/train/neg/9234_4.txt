Today, this movie would be a very spooky and very disturbing dark comedy. Lurking, obsession, and a network of lies and manipulations are given a 1948 glow of harmless are not very cute. Drake interprets the stalker, a user of people without qualms, alternately pathetic and manipulative, Grant interprets the victim of stalking, alternately angry and oblivious. <br /> <br /> It is extremely disturbing; I have not been able to look at classic romances with the same suspension of disbelief since then. <br /> <br />
