You realize you've been seeing the SAME EXACT SIGN for eight years, right? I could understand the initial curiosity of seeing strangers coexist on an island, but one would think that after seeing the careless and stinking heroes run through the bush with an egg on a spoon for half a decade it would be enough to get you to commit to something a little more original (and interesting). <br /> <br /> And I'm not even talking about the validity of the programs that for the record I find questionable. It is simply difficult to suspend the disbelief of "Bushy Bill" eating a rat when the whole team of producers and cameramen are housed in an air-conditioned bio-dome to make changes by drinking mochcinno's ice cream with moxy. <br /> <br /> What is the appeal here? I do not care about these people or their meandering lives. I just do not understand. But if you find yourself captivated by hairy and dirty people, I suggest you turn off the TV and simply travel to your local bus station, where you can see people like that in their true habitat. They call them MEN WITHOUT HOME, and for free, you can sit down and marvel at their strange ability to recover several cigarette remnants from a lot of garbage cans, which eventually hit "pay-dirt" and create a Dr-style home cancer. Frankenstein - hit, all the time asking people to change their food when the stench of "Aqua Velva" on their breath is enough to suggest otherwise. And the best part? Like Survivor, every week a member of the tribe "abandons" the "Island" when they are sent unceremoniously to the local Institution when the terrifying state of schizophrenia is not comedy in motion. That's entertainment!
