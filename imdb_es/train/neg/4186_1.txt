My comment has nothing to do with the political feelings found in the film. In fact, they are quite congruent with mine. What bothers me is the fact that, in terms of a movie, it is stupid and lacks any aspect of history, motive or dialogue. Maybe someone should tell Neal that replacing lyrics that fail to inspire anyone outside of a shrinking audience is not the same as creating motivated characters to speak because of events created by the writer or director. A silly narrative remains as such despite the iconic legacy of Neal Young. The most childish scene is one in which the devil makes his way in a bar, passes a tonic to an unsuspecting hero, who then goes to the dance floor to tell Young's song to the heroine, who is not aware of what it is. place taken. Somehow, these two devise a scheme in which they will go up to the west coast in search of ????? I'm sorry, Neal, keep the music and leave the film to Steven Stills.
