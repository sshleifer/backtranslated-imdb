I really hope that Concorde / New Horizons did not try to make a serious horror, not even an action movie when they made Carnosaur 3. The movie is completely silly from start to finish. Even the humor in C3 is fun because it's bad. Definitely a high watermark in the genre 'So bad is good'. If you enjoy the worst of the worst, this is for you.
