For those of you who have never heard of it (or have seen it in A & E), Cracker is a brilliant British television program about an overweight, chain-smoking and miserable psychologist named Fitz who helps the police department Manchester to get into the heads of the violent. Criminals It is considered to be one of the best shows in England (and that says something), and was tremendously successful in England and around the world in 1993. <br /> <br /> Now, the original stars have turned to Unite with the original writer to eliminate an episode over 2 hours. I have loved this program since I saw it for the first time, more than a decade ago. The DVD set contains a place of honor in my collection, and I can quote a lot of questioning scenes from Fitz practically word for word. The idea of ​​Robbie Coltrane working again with Jimmy McGovern for another television movie about Fitz filled me with joy. <br /> <br /> I'll start with the good. One of the many things that impressed me about Cracker's original series was how quickly Fitz was defined as a character. Five minutes in the first episode? with his lecture (throwing the books on the air), his way of drinking, and his insults about the boy who chases him in the queue of the gaming machine? and you knew, you just knew, who this character was. You could feel it "clicking" in your mind, the kind of click that only happens when a great actor gets a great paper written by a great writer. <br /> <br /> Coltrane, of course, remained excellent throughout the show. But did I always feel like some of the later episodes? Those that are not written by McGovern? He mistreated the character. <br /> <br /> So the good news is this: Fitz is back. As soon as you see it in this show? Making incredibly inappropriate comments at your daughter's wedding? You will feel that you "click" one more time. It's him: petulant in one moment and truly repentant in the next, always insightful, sincere to the point of tactlessness but brilliantly funny in the process. If you love this character as much as I do, you will be delighted with how they portray him in the film. And this extends to Judith and Mark: in fact, everything that has to do with the Fitz is handled perfectly. <br /> <br /> The problem I have with this movie revolves around the crime that Fitz is trying to solve. In Cracker's standard form, we know exactly who the criminal is in the first five minutes. the suspense is in seeing Fitz solve it. In this case, we have a serial killer who is out on American blood. And the reason for this, unfortunately, is not due to any credible psychological trauma? rather, it seems that the murders are here simply to allow the writer to show his personal political beliefs. <br /> <br /> It's hard for me to write this, since I really believe that Jimmy McGovern is one of the best writers. in the world. Nor do I have a problem with movies that deal with current issues, or movies that have a political position. But in Cracker's universe, we expect to see the characters behaving like human beings, not like cartoons. In contrast, the Americans in this film are represented in a totally stereotyped way. They do not know anything, they complain about everything, they treat locals like trash and cheat their wives. One of them even manages to do all of the above in less than 5 minutes. I honestly thought that I had changed the channel or something by mistake. <br /> <br /> But it does not stop there. Do we receive constant reminders of how bad the war in Iraq is going? reminders that have nothing to do with the story and appear practically out of nowhere. The murderer is so busy talking about Bush being worse than Hitler that he almost forgets to continue the murder; but more specifically, he is a spokesperson for the political views of the writer who forgets to act as a credible human being, and so we ... as an audience ?? Do not buy your sudden transformation from a happy family man to a tortured soul that kills in series. <br /> <br /> I can not say that this ruined the show for me. It was still good television, better than almost everything else in the genre (mainly due, once again, to Coltrane). But his constant politicization made it impossible for him to be as good as Cracker's true classics such as "To Be A Somebody." an episode that was just as "problematic", but that was handled with much more subtlety and psychological depth. <br /> <br /> Two other small points: Panhandle is not a disappointment, but what is worse is its replacements. All the police department? that for so long filled with such great characters, is now full of vanilla. Completely interchangeable policemen who lack all personality (how could drain the personality of Richard Coyle of Coupling surpasses me, but in fact is missing here). <br /> <br /> In addition, there are a couple of moments in which the show was lost. It is credible to me. One of those instances revolves around that Fitz had to reduce the total population of Manchester from 1 million to one hundred according to some very strange criteria (French windows? How does the computer know if I have French windows?)? Not only does he manage to do this, he achieves it in less than an hour. I do not think so. <br /> <br /> So, in general, I was a little disappointed. It is recommended to see, but remember to leave at least some of your expectations at the door. However, if there are new series that come after this, everything will have been for the better: I am convinced that McGovern can still write great things, and maybe now that he has taken his policy out of his system, he can rewrite. about people.
