The story has been seen before, but that does not matter if you can imagine how to make an appropriate storyboard. It is clear that the director has not spent his work on the storyboard. Along with this, the cameraman spent too much time tilting angles that do not match the message of the movie. The most fun is, however, if you take a look at the film's website, you can read that it was on purpose that the director chose to make the film with bad camera angles. Because it reminds us of hunting. But I've never heard of hunting with poor camera angles ;-) It will have 1 star because the story is fine. It is a pity that Ti West has not spent more time reviewing her story. It's as if the movie is more important than planning. Because you have a camera does not mean you should make a movie immediately ... come. Everyone can make a movie, but not everyone will be so good. So a tip for Ti West is: stop and label what you want. Use your time to start planning and not to film until everything is in a storyboard. You certainly have the ability and desire, so do not abuse your talent.
