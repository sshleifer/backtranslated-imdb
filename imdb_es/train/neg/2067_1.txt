Straight to the point: "The Groove Tube" is one of the most infamous, funny and absolutely horrible movies ever made. This "comedy" is so empty of anything that remotely resembles a trace of ingenuity that is almost incomprehensible that it has even been made. I said it almost because, after all, there are fans of everything. <br /> <br /> This movie is not even "good" or bad or "nice". Putting this movie on the same level of entertainment as "Plan 9" or "Robot Monster" would be a crime for those movies. Movies like the ones you can really see and get a kick out of. But this movie is SO bad, SO badly made, acted out and scripted and SO amazing rancid, that there is simply no trace of "camp" or "schlock". <br /> <br /> Although this was done before Saturday Night Live was released, comparisons were probably inevitable. I'm not a big fan of SNL, but this movie is worse than SNL's worst work you can find. And man, that's bad. Just to keep viewers from leaving, Shapiro throws in a couple of breasts from time to time, but the badly filmed breasts of 1974 are not going to excite anyone these days. Honestly, this movie is so badly made and it's an excursion that induces the dream, I doubt they've moved someone in 1974. <br /> <br /> A man named Ken Shapiro made this movie. I swear to God, any ten year old boy with a video camera could have done something more fun and smarter. It's just unreal, this is a really amazing movie. The "jokes" and the "gags" are so childish that even young children who like to sneak out of daddy's porn magazines at night will not laugh. <br /> <br /> I will give this movie one thing: the last sequence. , the sequence of the "man who dances", where a boy (Shapiro) in the streets of New York dances to the rhythm of a song, is easily the best of this horrible movie. It's not that the "dancing man" sequence is so good either, it definitely has its moments of not being intelligent, since Shapiro desperately tries to complete the time of the whole song, but in reality it was somewhat visible. The part of this sequence where the policeman starts dancing with the man is the only trace of intelligence in the whole movie. No wonder Shapiro put this sequence last. Once again, although it is not so great in itself, it easily surpasses anything else in this "movie". <br /> <br /> Otherwise, this movie is such a piece of shit, it's as unfathomable as how a real human being can be so frankly intelligent. The name of this movie should have been "Craparama by Ken Shapiro". It is incredible that this has been done, but many truly talented filmmakers can not enter. However, I'm going to say that I bet the NYU geniuses would love this movie. Total garbage.
