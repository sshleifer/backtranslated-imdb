I read the robberies of Tom Robbins' STILL GET THE BLUES when I was a teenager. I loved every word. It was sexy, fun and full of glamorous landscapes and beautiful writing. But when I saw the movie, I could not believe what a piece of boring, bitter and joyless garbage was. How did this happen? I think someone in Hollywood read this book and filed it in "GAY PRIDE - WOMEN - LESBIANS". (That's the header of the Library of Congress). Now, anyone over 12 who reads the book will know that there is NOTHING to do with real lesbians, nor is STAR WARS about real space travel. The book was obviously, and I mean OBVIOUS, written by a heterosexual man who loves the IDEA of lesbians (naked, all the time) but who has never met anyone. <br /> <br /> Still, someone in Hollywood said: "uh oh, better give this to a gay director or gay people will cause problems". So they gave it to Gus Van Sant. Nothing against man, but no matter how gay he is, he has no idea how to make a funny movie. Gus Van Sant interpreted the playful fantasy of a heterosexual man from a guilt-free action of a girl / girl and male voyeurism turned her into a bored, literal-minded, recruiting poster of lesbian power. It's like turning an Oscar Wilde comedy into a tragedy by Arthur Miller. It's not pretty. <br /> <br /> The main clue that Gus Van Sant had no idea what to do with the source material is the scandalously poorly launched. His influence allowed him to hire the best. His ignorance of the real subtext of the novel (the fantasy of a heterosexual man, not a gay pride recruitment poster) led him to make decisions that were not only bad, but also strange. <br /> <br /> Let's meet the cast of EVEN COWGIRLS GET THE BLUES. <br /> <br /> PAT MORITA as "EL CHINK" Well, there are few Asian actors with name recognition. And Pat Morita, on HAPPY DAYS, was pretty fun. But casting it as THE CHINK was wrong, bad, bad. Pat Morita has no idea that Chink is a very funny man. (Gus did not tell him.) Pat does not seem to know what the Chink is either. . . good, sexy !!! In the book, old Mr. Miyagi is not wise. It looks more like Hugh Hefner! He is an old and capricious and knows a LOT to please Sissy AND Bonanza Jellybean. (You see, in the book, you are not REALLY lesbian.) Do you understand that this is a fantasy of a heterosexual man yet?) <br /> <br /> JOHN HURT as "THE COUNTESS". Okay, he's a friendly gay man. But he is a SERIOUS ACTOR, SHAKESPEAREANO !!!! You need someone who is fun, and camping, for this role. That John Hurt be chosen as a foolish type as the Countess is tragic and sad. I kept waiting for Paul Scofield to wander disguised as Thomas More, and shake his head sadly. "Now, Richard, you know you've lost your soul completely, what a shame, my former student!" And yes, John Hurt was funny (and quite gay) like Caligula. But that was BLACK humor, not humorous and windy humor like the book. <br /> <br /> RAIN PHOENIX as "Bonanza Jellybean". No talent, no training, no problems. Except that in the book Bonanza is fun, playful, cheerful, (mostly) heterosexual and loving. In the film it is sullen, passive, expressionless and boring. As for his taste for women, Robbins in the book expresses it that way. "God knows I love women, but nothing can take the place of a man who fits." Uh, Gus? You read this book? <br /> <br /> UMA THURMAN as "Sissy Hankshaw". This is a difficult role. In the book Sissy really is an unusually passive and timid heroine. Even so, a more skilled actress could have made a sparkle in her eyes, or an oscillation in her walk, to imply some kind of hidden force or the hidden enjoyment of her adventures. Uma does not make it, probably because Gus never told her that Sissy is supposed to ENJOY being a hiker with a beautiful body and giant thumbs. Uma interprets it more as if she were in a television movie about a girl who is dying of leukemia. <br /> <br /> This movie is bitter and boring. And I accuse you, Gus Van Sant!
