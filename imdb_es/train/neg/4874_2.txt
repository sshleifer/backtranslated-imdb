Too bad neither the animals nor Eddie Murphy had anything to say that is worth saying. this movie is simply insipid. <br /> <br /> A movie for children? Well, if you're trying to get them to take a nap, then maybe. They are only 90 minutes of a poor animal lip animation for eyes that are not funny. And lip syncing makes the old Godzilla movies look bright in comparison. Meanwhile, Eddie "Pluto Nash", Murphy, continues with a reduced delivery that is painful to experience. Apparently, he's trying to modify his old maniac persona, but to what? In short, all the magic and wonder of the original 1967 version is lost in this reimagination, or whatever. A people wants to intimidate some creatures of the forest and blame them for doing bad things. Not really. And Pluto Nash can psycho-babble with them. Things come together with some jokes to a boring and uninspired conclusion, without surprises. <br /> <br /> Rent the movie from '67. Or some old cartoons of bears yogis.
