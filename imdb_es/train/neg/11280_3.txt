This movie is about the life of a man who goes wrong. His business is failing, and he can not impregnate his wife despite multiple attempts. <br /> <br /> The plot is a complete chaos. It just does not make sense. In fact, nothing in the movie makes sense. The story is so badly told that I just could not understand it. It's a shame, because the ensembles and the costumes are well made and visually stimulating enough. The shots are well composed throughout the film. However, these redeeming features still can not compensate for the bad plot and the bad storytelling. I'm surprised by the big names that agreed to star in this movie. It's a waste of your talents. This movie is very bad. Avoid it!
