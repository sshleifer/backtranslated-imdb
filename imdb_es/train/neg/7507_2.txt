This movie is bad news and I am really surprised by the level of talent of great names that would sometimes agree to appear on a piece of junk like this. I imagine there were a few strangled agents on Hollywood Blvd. As a result of this fiasco. What really catches you is that it could have been good. The attractiveness of the directors and the main theme was enough to stimulate interest and the sale of tickets, but this is a failure. The multiple lines of the story go from bad to silly at the end of the images, and you end up feeling like a mouse in a labyrinth in search of a piece of cheese that turns out to be rotten. What Spike is able to achieve is revenge against any Italian who may have hit him when he was a child or insulted him, since the film does enough to perpetuate obsolete and probably offensive Italian stereotypes. As with any Spike Lee movie, there is a truly magical and thought-provoking camera work. He has the gift of grabbing your psyche and transporting you to his vision if only for a few memorable scenes. But the question remains ... can you stand the other 2 hours of scratching your head and looking at your watch while you ask and wait for the end that has to be somewhere?
