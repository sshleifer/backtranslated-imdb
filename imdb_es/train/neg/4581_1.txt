Pathetic attempt to use science to justify the religion / philosophy of the new era. The two have nothing to do with each other and much of what is said about quantum physics in this mess is simply wrong. <br /> <br /> Examples? Quantum theory supports ideas in Oriental religions that reality is an illusion. How? Well, in the world of the subatomic, you can never definitively predict a location of particles at a specific time. It can only give the odds that it is precisely in one place at a time. In addition, the act of observation seems to affect the event. Solid particles can cross barriers. All this, until now, is accurate. But then they claim that that means that if you sincerely believe that you can walk through a wall, you can do it. This is complete poppycock. Instead, the theory states that at our level, it is possible for you to walk through a wall, but it is simply by chance and has nothing to do with belief. Besides, you would have to keep walking against the wall for eternity to have the remotest possibility of going through the wall, the odds are so astronomical against it. <br /> <br /> This is just an example of how to misrepresent science But much more annoying is the story about an unhappy photographer, played by Marlee Maitlan. About half of the image, it becomes so confusing that it is incomprehensible. Something to do with the negative thoughts that lead to addiction and self hatred. There may be some truth in that, but quantum physics has nothing to do with this. <br /> <br /> In addition, string theory is the current novelty in physics today. Instead of wasting time with this dreck, I suggest you rent The Elegant Universe, an amazing series made for NOVA on PBS that gives you a history of physics from Newton and gravity to Ed Witten and M Theory in just 3 hours of duration. Quantum mechanics is explained quite well if you want to know it without the fog of metaphysical appropriation.
