Usually, I talk a bit about the plot in the first part of my review, but in this movie there really is not much to talk about. Just a mix of other sword epics and witchcraft MUCH better. The lack of cohesion runs rampant as well as banality. Even the main villain who refuses to wear clothes other than a loincloth is pretty boring, since she has a chest of a small child. In the best case, something fun. Lucio Fulci was discarding the bottom of the barrel here and you see. <br /> <br /> My degree: D- <br /> <br /> DVD extras: Poster and frame galleries; Lucio Fulci Bio; and in the United States and in international theatrical trailers. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Sabrina Siani is topless (some may consider it attractive, I did not); Several extras are topless too
