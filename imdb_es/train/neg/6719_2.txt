This is a great idea for a movie but, unfortunately, it does not turn out to be a great movie. What begins as a sweet and almost ridiculous romantic comedy about a Fluffer in love with his spirals Fluffee out of control in a strange combination of genres and a real stew of plots, with liberal loans from BOOGIE NIGHTS, THELMA AND LOUISE, SHOWGIRLS, FRISK, and even a curious "script" of 400 BLOWS thrown towards the end. (At least the director did his research!) The result is not necessarily boring, but in the end, this well-made and well-produced film does not add up to anything. However, all the actors do a play job with the material and there are some good laughs in the world behind the gay porn stage. <br /> <br />
