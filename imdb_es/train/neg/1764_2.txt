Although in many ways I agree with the comments of other reviewers. I think the plot and the idea are very good. Many of the supporting actors were very good. The fatal problem of this movie is Ellen Pompeo. I am sure that I have never seen a less talented "actor". I can not imagine how this person has been in a movie or on television. In my opinion, she would be better as better in a Wal-Mart. To see a person with this low level of talent involved in the payment of roles, do you wonder ... "who do you know"? I would very much like to see this film re-done with some talent. I do not blame the writer for the fact that this movie is not worth the time to see it.
