All the funny things that happen in this comedy are based on the fact that the main character Jim is a bad father, a bad husband or, in general, a selfish one. How can it be fun? Of course, a character in a comedy has to be defective, but Jim's character is flawed in an extremely unfriendly way. <br /> <br /> And why is that? My guess is that it is because "he should now better". Jim is not a stupid guy, he can take care of things and he has the opportunity to do it. But he chooses not to do it. It is a conscious decision that he makes, when he decides not to play with his children, does not go shopping because he does not want to buy "women's products" and it is a choice he makes when he leaves his family. <br /> <br /> The other characters seem to be alone in the series so that Jim can have someone to be an imbecile with. If Cheryl's character were a real person, she would have left it years ago, and she would not have stayed with the heartbeat for 8 years. But, alas, she is just a catalyst for the peculiar extreme selfishness of Jim's middle class.
