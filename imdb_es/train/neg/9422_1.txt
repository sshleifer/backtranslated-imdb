This film describes the experiences of a pair of assassins (one of them Burt Reynolds), a prostitute and two drag queens in the interval of a few hours in one night in Miami. The converging stories eventually gather all the people in one place and time. The film was slightly entertaining, but the big problem was that everything happened at night and many scenes were literally underexposed to the point that it was impossible to see what was happening. In some scenes, you can see where they tried to "stretch" the development process to save the images. Someone did not know how to operate a movie camera. It's amazing that this movie has been released!
