There are some really fantastic ideas in this violent movie that, if executed clearly, could have elevated it from the folly of Spaghetti-western to something special. Unfortunately, A TOWN CALLED HELL is one of the worst edited movies. The scenes begin and end abruptly, the characters leave for long periods, the interpretations (and accents) of the actors are quite inconsistent, etc. <br /> <br /> Robert Shaw is a Mexican revolutionary (!) who, after participating in ending a village, remains a priest (!) ... ten years later, the village is being led by the " Mayor "Telly Salavas. Stella Stevens arrives to take revenge on the man who killed her husband. Colonel Martin Landau arrives to look for Shaw. Everyone screams a LOT and they shoot a LOT. Fernando Rey is also in it (like a blind man). The performances are not bad, but they are very uneven. Savalas has an accent at times like Landau does (who is really upset here). Shaw and Rey prove that they are unable to be ashamed and Stevens looks quite cunning (although a little out of place among the sweaty dirt).
