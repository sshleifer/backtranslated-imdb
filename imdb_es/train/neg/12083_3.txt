Yay! ... I think. It is hard to say. It's hard to have an emotion about a movie that has no emotion. This film is as sterile as a surgeon's scalpel. For an environment, it has some stone pillars, some stone seats, a couple of stone crosses and some stone actors. They have no emotion! The only thing that saves this movie is the fact that it is Hamlet, and Hamlet is a terribly written piece of literature. However, the dubbing really was not that bad. The voices remained faithful to the opaque, somber, sad and sucking atmosphere of life that the film gave. I have seen this version of Hamlet in the fabulous Mystery Science Theater 3000 three times, and each of the three times, I was about to turn off the TV, despite being MST 3K. <br /> <br /> No An uplifting production of a drama that deserves much better.
