I quote Oedpius Rex because it is a tragedy that this film has been surrounded. <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst movies I've seen in my life! By no means am I an enemy of Uwe Boll like most people without humor in IMDb! <br /> <br /> Uwe Boll's films like Postal and Tunnel Rats are hilariously bad and, therefore, entertaining. But honestly, this movie was just horrible. I hated it so much I would give it a zero star rating if I could. History is crap! Spend four fifths of the movie building the plot and then have the medium, which is just scenes of grizzly horrible murder without taste! Finally, finish it with a "final villan victories" that is totally acceptable, but surely it could have been more elegant than this! <br /> <br /> I am not against Uwe Boll (as I said before) nor am I against violent films! I f ** king love the violent movies! I loved the Saw movies, the Hostel movies, Tokyo Gore Police, The New York Ripper, the 28 movies, Dog Soldiers, My Bloody Valentine, Last House on the Left, Watchmen, Wolf Creek, every Tarantino movie, every Sam Peckinpah, even Cannibal f ** holocaust king! But this! OMFG !!! <br /> <br /> This was just cruel, sadistic and perverted! And look at the movies I just listed! If I liked the cannibal Holocaust and not this, then it must be bad! Uwe, do not get dark again! You're funny when you're cheerful, like Ed Wood. This was just a horrible experience! I felt horrible everywhere after seeing this! <br /> <br /> DO NOT LOOK !!!! AVOID AT ALL COSTS !!!!!
