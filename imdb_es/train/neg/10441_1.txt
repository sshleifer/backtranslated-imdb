I stopped seeing this point of sale as soon as the snakes began to "take control" of the plane. <br /> <br /> At first I thought maybe I should get a "one" for comic relief. But then I realized that I could see the three puppets for free and laugh more! <br /> <br /> Any respect you may have for Samuel Jackson has been irreversibly destroyed. And Hollywood proves once again how far removed from reality they really are. As a child we used to catch snakes for fun. The only thing snakes would do is curl up in the bottom of the cargo hold. And no amount of Hollywood cartoon snakes can change that. <br /> <br /> This movie is not worth a trip to Blockbuster. Be careful: if you pay for it, the only "victim" is your stupid ass. <br /> <br /> If you want to be really scared, I suggest the Descent. If you want humor, go to your local comedy club. Your worst performance will be a million times better than this garbage.
