I can not believe that this jingoistic and skewed material will be passed on to the Americans as art material. At first, from lines as revealing as "we want to make sure they are playing for the right team" and the framing and lighting manipulable, A Love Divided shows its true face. The crude way in which Irish Catholics are shown as hegemonic, to Protestants as peaceful and oppressed, is as poor a representation of history as the first westerns of the United States that represent the struggle between cowboys and American Indians. The truth of history is distorted by the stereotypes and absolute vilification of Irish Catholics in history; A corruption admitted by the filmmakers themselves! It is sad that people today still think that they can gain moral influence by making a film so easily recognizable by its obvious intention, far from trying art. This film does not have to be anywhere in any legitimate library or cinema.
