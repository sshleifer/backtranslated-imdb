This was a really fun movie. <br /> <br /> Every 1 of the movie tried to be serious, that's what made this movie so fun. I mean the head of a shark in a human body. Can it be more fun? Good work Sci-Fi is still coming comedy movies. I never thought that movies could be delayed more. If they keep it that way, they'll have to change the name of the science channel to the sci-fi comedy channel or something like that. <br /> <br /> I can not wait 4 for the next blockbuster sci-fi movie. <br /> <br /> I'll be ready with a bowl of popcorn and a box of beer or a bottle of liquor and I'll be ready to laugh again!
