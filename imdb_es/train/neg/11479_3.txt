This movie deserves another bad review. Consider a critic who extols the virtues of the film that include 'no sex, violence or gore'. Uh, excuse me The very configuration of the film makes us see how the young comrade of Cody, with love for life and who has everything to live for, is shattered leaving Cody holding his bloody and lifeless body. And, given the nature of the war, we know that Cody has seen horror almost daily. So much for those who watch this movie with rose-colored glasses that the violence that defines the person of Cody is erased from the memory of the viewer. <br /> <br /> Sans, any family of his own Cody, like John Rambo, travels the country on his bicycle. making the long trip to the hometown of EE. UU under the guise of a place called Nevada City. Not to mention, without realizing the clear fact that Cody is a damaged product. We know this since his police officer practically declared it, just as he ordered Cody to "rest a little" away from the death and destruction of the war. This explains, since neither seems to notice or worry, the obvious "flat" effect of Cody. It is not bad acting. It is the flat effect of post-traumatic stress disorder. Without guessing here, remember that your police officer ordered you to leave the battlefield. <br /> <br /> What do you think of that 'accidental' kiss as indicated by another review? The fall was an accident, the kiss was not. How exactly did Cody "respect" Faith when he found out that she had spoken to her? Now that was a moment of unfamiliar value. A moment that is then announced to the immediate universe as published on YouTube. Of course, the fidelity lapse of faith, as well as the "approach" of Cody to a woman who plans to marry another, is received in the spirit of the holiday season, and all ACOGEN their hearts and lips cheap. <br /> <br /> We know little about Faith's fianc√©, except that she professes his love for him, it does not take more than a second nano to accept his proposal (he could have waited if he had thought something), he He is generous, he loves her until death, the family has nothing really against him, he believes that marriage is based on compromises and the two have never discussed plans after marriage. There are no criminals here. <br /> <br /> Asner is an excellent actor that is given in the dialogue of the hill as "we love you, son ..." "You are part of our family" literally days after they have met a stranger . called Cody. And the discourse of the "band of brothers" in which the phrase above all never had the intention to apply to virtual strangers outside the battlefield. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell: this movie is a fluff of cotton cotton that reveals itself in important ways. More rudely when she applauds Cody's disrespect for Faith by physically hitting her knowing that she is being spoken for. By redefining the family as we know it by wit: accepting a virtual stranger as a member of the family full of love because we all "love" him. How many of you have done it or do you know someone who has done it? DO NOT.
