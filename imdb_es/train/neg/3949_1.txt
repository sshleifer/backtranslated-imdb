I got a DVD of "Bogeyman" and this stunner was an additional feature. I assumed it was "Boogeyman II" because it was paired with the original. But you know what they say about those who "assume": it makes an "ass-" of "u-" and "I". I had read before seeing that BII contains many images of the original and that it was starring actress Love. While watching "Return of the Boogeyman", I decided to stay through the original images to see the notorious scene of death by the toothbrush. Before I knew it, the movie was over. Tear. I think I thought this was BII because it has a title similar to one of BII's alternative titles. Oh, well, at least this was just an extra feature, right? <br /> <br /> Let me stop talking about my mistake and start talking about the mistakes of the movie. Many, many, mistakes. Who makes this Ulli guy whatever he thinks he is? Do you really think that the same movie will be sold in different ways? There is nothing original that sustains Part III. Basically it is a flashback of the original through the eyes of a psychic, who is giving us a play for boring and exhausting play while everything happens. That is the movie. Oh, and a death scene by stereo, but you can read that in someone else's review. My interest in "Boogeyman II" has been lost forever. <br /> <br /> Final note: This is not a series of films to watch from behind.
