A television movie of average quality, a story of formula totally of religious fanatics (Ron Perlman, who gives a good note "I am not only the President of 'Psychos R Us', I am also a client") that obtains the control of a biochemical virus. (Think of the virus in the movie "The Rock"). It's too bad for him to also get stuck in a bank building during an earthquake with bank robbers and government agents trying to stop him (led by the impressive wolf Wolf Larson, backed by Fred Dryer) along with the standard "in place" wrong at the wrong time "brave woman (the forever Erika Eleniak) and" lived like a puppet but died like a hero at the last minute "male (Brandon Karrer). It has the standard background story to sympathize with the religious fanatic (wife and son murdered in a police raid a few years earlier). <br /> <br /> Basically a decent movie for rainy days. <br /> <br /> Favorite line, pronounced by Ron Perlman after he finds the vial of the virus hidden in the neckline of Erika Eleniak: "A woman and her mystery." <br /> <br /> It's worth it rent.
