I respect the fact that this is a very popular show. However, compared to Robert Altman's witty, hilarious, humorous and innovative 1970s classic, this show was probably meant to be less than mediocre ... even if it ran for 11 years, that does not necessarily do it any good. This show formed a very integral part of my early childhood (I was in repetitions every night, and guess what parents were watching and laughing), but it is one of the memories that I do not miss. And now that I've actually seen the movie, I can give this series a precise critique. On its own, it's not nearly "2 out of 10" bad. However, the characters in this show do not look anything like the ones in the movie. Technically, some of them are the same, but they only have a similar name. For example, since when is Alan Alda something like Donald Sutherland? His style of humor is totally different, as is his characterization and perspective. The new characters are not that big; they only serve to make you lose those you are replacing. It's the same with the new actors (including Jamie Farr). The only thing that is actually transferred to the series is Radar, which is still (despite being interpreted by the same actor) simply a pale imitation of the original. What else? Oh yeah. With a hint of laughter (it did not matter if it was used in the surgery scenes or not), it is scary, due to what is happening in the other configurations. And because it lasted almost four times longer than the current Korean War, it takes viewers to this strange time gap that does not work outside the world of cartoons. I've never liked this show, and I never will.
