He would have left the movie halfway if he had not been with people he liked. The movie is based on real incidents, but it is so exaggerated that it did not feel real at all. I have some psychological background, I spent time with many psychotherapists and I have met very crazy people, so I do not think that people like that do not exist. But in the film, the only characters who seemed consistently human were Augusten's father (Alec Baldwin) and young Augusten (Jack Kaedin). (Although Evan Rachel Wood was an intriguing, very sexy fun with a wicked sense of fun). There were some funny moments, but the overall tone of the movie was grim, strange and unpleasant. What a waste of a featured cast! When I saw them take their turns, I felt that I was watching an acting class. This was taken home during the credits, when it was shown to a couple of people sitting there, without acting, without speaking. Those few moments were more entertaining than the previous 2 hours.
