I had just watched an episode of this program and I could not even get to the end of the show. Every minute I had seen this program, my I.Q should have dropped about 10 points. This is basically like a program for children but with an oath. Not even the swearing and the insults she says to other people made me laugh. Anyway, the story must have been written by a monkey and the people who actually put this script for this filming program should have been held at gunpoint and had no choice but to film this delayed, disappointing and horribly acted show . Sarah Silvermann should use the little money she really earned with this program and get some damn acting lessons.
