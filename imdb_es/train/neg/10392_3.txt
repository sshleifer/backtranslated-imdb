I'm not going to bother with a synopsis of the plot since you know what the film is about and, anyway, there's almost no plot. I have seen several reviewers call ISOYG an 'anti-rape' movie or even a feminist statement, and I just have to remember the hypocrisy of these claims. <br /> <br /> First, what do I do? Do we see on the cover of this movie? That's right: a well-formed woman is behind. If it was Zarchi's attempt to make a statement against the rape, and I do not think it was, that has nothing to do with it. The movie is promoting sex and sexual assault and the material is so graphic (everything except real penetration is shown) that NO ONE, but the hard core exploitation crowd will enjoy it. <br /> <br /> The violation (s) In the film it is uncomfortable, brutal and hard to see. There is something to be said to present a horrible crime in such a brutal light, but there was no reason for this scene to last for apparently 30 minutes, none. There was also little development of the character of the victim and only one of the rapists is slightly developed (mere moments before being killed), so the scene is not at all emotionally attractive. Actually, it is only presented to show extreme sexual violence and it can be said by the films that ISOYG is associated in IMDb (Caligula, Cannibal Ferox, etc.) that attracts only the crowd of exploiters. <br /> <br /> Finally, some critics have praised the so-called documentary style of Zarchi and the lack of a soundtrack. But considering how inept everything else is in the film (acting, screenplay, etc.), I suspect that they were financial decisions and the film looks like a documentary because he literally placed a camera and let his porn-caliber actors do their thing. <Br /> <br /> I'm not going to stand on the content of ISOYG completely. I am in favor of exploitation / horror and love video nasties. In fact, I give this movie three stars just because it really pushes the envelope much more than other movies. However, it is also badly done and after the rape, it is simply boring for the rest of the movie while we watch a lot of murders, mostly without gore murders, and we expect the credits to roll. <br /> <br /> It's probably worth seeing once if you're a fan of the 70s exploitation, but I tell you that, in general, the movie is pretty bad and not worth it for its notorious reputation.
