Nowhere near the original. It is a fairly accurate copy that brings nothing new to the story. But the address is very poor. Basinger is weak, without a good direction. Baldwin is simply a second league compared to McQueen. I saw it just out of curiosity, being a big fan of Peckinpah's masterpiece, and I got what I thought. Almost a B movie with second category acting and direction. I was not even disappointed, I just do not know what they were trying to do. This remake does not try to play with the original material, it is not a tribute and, in fact, it lacks a really good actor of its time. <br /> <br /> It reminds me of a bad xerox copy of a wonderful photograph. <br /> <br /> This is a complete waste of your time. Save yourself 2 hours or watch the original (again :))
