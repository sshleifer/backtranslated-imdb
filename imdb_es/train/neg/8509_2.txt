I saw this movie for several reasons, the main one is Mira Sorvino. With her in the cast, it could not be so bad. And he even seemed to have some mystery and Olivier Martinez was his boyfriend at the time and he was pretty good at "Infidel". The story is set in Spain, so it could be an exotic and entertaining movie with one of my favorite actresses. <br /> <br /> If you're thinking the same thing, let me warn you: this is really horrible, uninteresting. , boring movie. The only adjective that comes to mind is pathetic. <br /> <br /> The story is designed with subplots that add nothing to the narrative. They try to build a slasher / thriller with a look at fascism in Spain, but they fail horribly. The money transfers do not have credibility and the so-called investigation does not lead anywhere. <br /> <br /> The characters are very thin! I did not care about anyone. More than that, they are irritating and quite odious people. <br /> <br /> The acting is atrocious. Look, what's wrong with you? Because look You're an Oscar winner Keep a little dignity! His character was weak, but that's no excuse for such a horrible performance. She seems to be sleeping the whole long movie. Now that I think about it, I really think I saw his eyes slowly close in some scenes. I used to think that this woman was sexy. Well, she is not here. If you want to look at some skin, try Romi and Michelle because there is nothing to see here. And that accent? My God ... <br /> <br /> Olivier Martinez is even worse. It is too painful to remember his performance to describe it here. I'm sorry but I can not. I've already suffered enough with this garbage. <br /> <br /> This whole movie is depressing! It is so bad in every way that it is a wonder how it was done. A terrible team to produce a terrible script and earn some money with the name of the actor. Do not fall into this. <br /> <br /> Avoid it! <br /> <br />
