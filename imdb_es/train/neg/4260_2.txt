Yeah sure. <br /> <br /> I spent the first hour waiting patiently for the movie to take off. It was horribly boring, and consisted mainly of people running randomly through the hills with no apparent direction. Then the hero enters the scene. He was born as an Asian, but when he grew up, he became white. Obviously white. I was not even close to going through the Asian. He looked like Justin Timberlake. It was extremely annoying, and the story did nothing to help the cause. Useless battle sequences and lame dialogue. It's one hour and forty-five minutes, and in the end I was trying to eat my own face. I saw it because the people in the video store where I work always ask me if this movie is good. Now I have an answer. It goes something like this: ahem. "NO, GOOD GOD, NO! IT'S HORRIBLE! DO NOT DO THIS TO YOURSELF! I would recommend another movie, maybe one that is entertaining."
