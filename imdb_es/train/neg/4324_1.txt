Griswalds fools won the big prize of the TV show "Pig in a Poke", and they all fly together to Europe, where they manage to cause one stupid disaster after another. Of all the ridiculous and little fun sequels of money turns, this one surpasses everyone's. Harold Ramis' 1983 film was a mismatch below the average in which the maladjusted family had a nightmarish "Vacation" throughout the United States. This time Amy Heckerling ("Look Who's Talking") heads what turns out to be a disastrous "comedy" that will annoy you more than it will make you laugh. <br /> <br /> The script of Hughes (with Rob Klane) is horrible and you wonder why people like Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo were bothered by such an inopportune project, since even Anthony Michael Hall and Imogene Coca They had the good sense to refuse the offer. Even an omnipotent Michael Palin is unable to elevate procedures to whatever level he might call entertaining. <br /> <br /> However, as inconceivable as it may seem, "European Vacation" was successful enough to guarantee a second sequel! Surely it could not be as unbearable as this. You know, I still have to see a National Lampoon show that was worth it. <br /> <br /> Monday, December 26, 1994 - T.V.
