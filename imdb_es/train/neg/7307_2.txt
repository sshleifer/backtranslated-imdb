This is probably one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. The events in it are completely random and have little or no meaning. The fact that there is a sequel is so disgusting that I can rule out a case of cabin fever (SOM SO SORY). I describe it as a mistake when being stuck to a newspaper because it seems that different parts of things are mixed together. For example, Kevin, the karate kid who loves pancakes, is strangely strange, so there is the policeman who is a bit weird and perverted, then the junkie, and then there is the fact that they attack a random guy who clearly needs help. Then, suddenly, the main character is having sex with his friend's girlfriend just because she says something stupid about a plane that is sinking. then, in the end, a good old family racism followed by a rabbit that operated on Kevin, the boy of karate. Actually, it is quite despicable that they can use racism as a joke in this movie. There's no reason for anyone to enjoy this movie unless you love Eli Roth, even that did not make me like this movie. Hate is a strong word, but since it is the only word I am allowed to use, you will have to do it. BOYCOTT CABIN FEVER 2 !!!!!
