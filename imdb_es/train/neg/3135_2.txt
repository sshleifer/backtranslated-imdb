What a piece of junk this movie was. The premise was fine, but even at the beginning with shit effects to mix in a giant with normal-sized people (even the effects on Hercules were better), I knew this would be bad. But the really horrible part of the movie are the dialogues. He is completely incoherent, stupid and stupid. I felt that it had been written by a 9th grade student in creative class and had obtained a D-. I want to slap Casper van Diem and the other actors for following this movie. <br /> <br /> I've had my share of bad and bad movies (I love the tremors series), but this ... I do not recommend it at all. It's silly and the totally incredibly bad dialogs will make you tremble.
