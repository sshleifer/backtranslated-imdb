This movie is now my indicator against which all other movies will be compared ... as in "Was it as stupid as Revolver?" I was also in the audience at the Toronto International Film Festival last night, where a room full of more than 2000 people came out in a spooky silence after being absolutely stunned by 2 hours of nonsense. Jason Stratham would have been amazing if he had only one purpose. In the first 10 minutes, he has received a proposal from Andre 3000 and Big Pussy (of Soprano's fame) that does not make any sense. Then there are some shots and then there's Ray Liotta wearing embarrassing bikini briefs, then there's a bit of animation, Ray Liotta's naked butt, lots of shooting, gnashing of teeth, the art house wants to be pretensions and more of Liotta's embarrassing body that provoked laughter in each show. .I am not sure of the reaction I was looking for ... not 5 times anyway. Everyone in this movie thinks they're smarter than the average bear and Guy Ritchie thinks he's the incarnate of Bear Yogi. The story lines might not have gone anywhere, but the posture was out of sight! The only way this movie could have been worse is if Madonna was in it.
