Without a doubt, the worst movie I've seen in a long time. I supported until the end because surely there must be something here, but no. The plot, when it is not about clich√©s, wanders to the point of non-existence; the dialogue that is supposed to be street is simply trite; the characters never develop beyond the sketches; The pieces are cliches. Worse, considering his co-director, photography is not very good. <br /> <br /> The comments in other places that elevate it together with Get Carter, Long Good Friday or Kaspar Hauser are far from reality; The lives of the saints lack innovation, let alone their depth and their shadow. In short, his job. A ruthless editor could probably reduce it to a decent short of 30 minutes, but as it is, it is a sixth-form film project made on a scale of one million pounds; To wander and swell with his own pretensions. That he received funds (probably just by the name of Rankin) while other small films struggle to get cash is depressing for the British film industry.
