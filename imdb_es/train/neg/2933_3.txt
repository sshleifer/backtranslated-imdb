If you have read the book, do not make illusions, if you have not done so, go read it and never watch the movie. It is strange to know that Toby Young participated a lot in writing the script (as stated in the post script of the book). Because the movie is very different from the book. <br /> <br /> What the film seems to point to: take a rather entertaining and entertaining piece that combines philosophical ideas with funny sarcasm and simplifying it so that everyone can do it. Understand it - get it perfectly. The film is full of bad and cheap jokes, suitable for a comedy, and has lost any meaningful message it might have had. <br /> <br /> It's better if you do not see it.
