Now look, I will not lie to you, but I only received this movie for $ 3.99 from a friend because I had Danni Filth, the lead singer of the always popular death metal band "Cradle Of Filth". Of course, I expected violence and gore at its best, since that is what Mr. Filth can represent, between a plot. <br /> <br /> But, dear God, I was so wrong. This movie really bites, big time. Being a low budget movie (haha, wait, make that zero budget), this obviously lacks the beautiful musical scores of the Howard Stern orchestra and the special effects of Spielberg. No, it is a single camera, bad angles and bad blood scenes. <br /> <br /> Take, for example, when our violent star and demon, Mr. Filth, violently kills an assailant. A grip on the throat, and blood spits, but oh, there seems to be a packet of juice filled with fake blood on the man's shirt. <br /> <br /> For you, Cradle Of Filth fans: you'll hear Two songs throughout the film, but with the angles of the camera and the filming of poor quality, drag the general pleasure of the song DOWN. <br /> <br /> My final comment: get away from it. It's blood, blood, breasts and hey, even a bad quality story. So, if you like atrocious violence, almost without voices (yes, there are almost no words in this movie), then, of course, buy it. But if bad quality movies are not your thing, then avoid them. Do not waste your money.
