Devin Hamilton is probably best known as the new name in the legendary Full Moon entertainment. Unfortunately, his arrival in this independent study occurred at a time when the budget and production values ​​are at their lowest level in years. However, in his short career, Hamilton has established himself as a creative director who manages to create original and original stories. Now, this does not mean that your movies are good, but at least they are different from the usual ones in the horror genre. <br /> <br /> In his debut, "Bleed", Hamilton presents a creative twist. The sub genre of slasher. Maddy (Debbie Rochon) is a young woman who finally gets the job of her dreams. Not only that, but it seems that she has also found a boyfriend in Shaun (Danny Wolske), it seems that life finally smiles for Maddy after many sad events. Until they're at a party with Shaun's friends, they tell him they created a "club" where members have to kill someone to enter. <br /> <br /> They are obviously joking, but Maddy desperately wants to fit in, that she actually murders someone. After that event, someone begins to kill the rest of the members of the "club" one by one. It's up to Maddy to find out what's going on, since anyone could be the murderer, including her. <br /> <br /> Maddy is a very interesting character played beautifully by the beautiful Debbie Rochon. It is a very interesting twist in the genre to have the main actress as part of the suspects. The concept is so original and Rochon's performance is so good that it's a real pity that Hamilton has not developed the whole story a little better. The film feels quite slow at times and, in general, the feeling is that of a good idea wasted in a bad movie. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is odd in the sense that the entire female cast is very good, while the male cast is painfully bad. Danny Wolske is terribly wooden and his performance as yuppie is pretty stereotyped. Julie Strain, Brinke Stevens and Lloyd Kaufman appear in small cameos and are wonderful in their small roles. In addition, there is a lot of nudity (both male and female) and the cast is very handsome, so it is really a plus. <br /> <br /> The low budget hurts the film in the effects department, since there are very few bloody scenes and they are not really graphic (probably because they would look bad); however, considering the budget, the movie at least looks good. <br /> <br /> The most recent effort of Hamilton, the sexploitation company "Delta Delta Die!", is a better elaborated film and, in general, more fun. While this is not as bad as other well-known films, it still has many flaws and can be interesting only for fans of Debbie Rochon or fans of independent movies without a budget. 4/10
