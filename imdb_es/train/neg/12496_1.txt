To be brutally honest ... I LOVED to see Severed. That's why I gave it a 1/10 star because of its unimaginative plot <br /> <br /> history / shooting / acting / everything. This movie was a RIOT to watch. If <br /> <br /> you enjoy watching bad movies to make fun of them, <br /> <br /> you will really love Severed. <br /> <br /> The story does not really matter, it involves a guy who is bald <br /> <br /> and has a sword and is beheading random people. <br /> <br /> But he has a supernatural turn ... nobody sees him do it. <br /> <br /> Even when, in a memorable scene, he enters a nightclub <br /> <br /> tormented and hits the noodles of a girl and <br /> <br /> nobody sees him . <br /> <br /> Severed does not seem to have been filmed in a video, it WAS <br /> <br /> filmed on someone's camcorder. The filmmakers had <br /> <br /> lighting knowledge (very fine knowledge) and the composition <br /> <br /> actually stays together in some scenes. But mostly you can not listen to the actors <br /> <br /> ... you can not understand what they are doing, and you laugh <br /> <br /> when the next victim gets his pumpkin destitute from his body. <br /> <br /> Go and rent this movie. Supports movies like this: they are hilarious and <br /> <br /> a treadmill!
