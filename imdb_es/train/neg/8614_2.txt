I must confess that I have never been a fan of Rodney Dangerfield. In fact, he receives "no respect" from me. I saw it only because my wife wanted to see it, and found exactly what I expected: a stupid story without any real humor. It is full of funny, crude jokes and a totally ridiculous plot that revolves around the plans of a developer (Dangerfield) to build a ski resort in Utah that simply did not catch my attention. <br /> <br /> Besides Dangerfield The film was starring a weak cast, including Andrew Dice Clay and John Byner, who was totally on the hill (I did not even know it still existed until I saw his name in the credits for this). <br /> <br /> This really is a disaster in Dangerfield. <br /> <br /> 2/10
