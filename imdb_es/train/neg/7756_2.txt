I remember seeing ATTACK when it first came out and caught it again recently. The science fiction channel has run worse, but not by much. An unscrupulous attack from Jurassic Park, ATTACK replaces saber-toothed cats with dinosaurs. And they are loose, devouring as many extras as possible. The CGI is quite bad, and the close-ups of the prosthetic cat heads are ridiculous. We get a little blood, which helps a little. Wait until you see how the mad scientist who started this whole mess understands it. Apart from Robert Carradine, who has very little to do, the cast is unknown. Apparently this was filmed in Fiji. Good job if you can get it. It reminds me of all those STV low budget monsters that were popular in the 80s and 90s.
