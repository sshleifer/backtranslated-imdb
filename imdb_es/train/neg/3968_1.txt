If you have ever watched a Brian Avenet-Bradley movie and compared it with the comments received on IMDb, you know that most of the comments and votes are false. Trust me: you'll get bored! The people on the production team write their comments themselves (sometimes they even admit it). But that's not enough: they also constantly click "no" when there is a negative comment about the movie. That's why negative critics are always placed behind the promoted ones. <br /> <br /> The movie itself is bad, bad, bad: bad acting, bad lighting, bad script, bad ending. Believe me now! If not, you'll believe me later! <br /> <br /> Brian Avenet-Bradley could be a good businessman. Otherwise, you can not explain that you find people who still fund your movies. (Okay, they are cheap, but nevertheless). But as a creative person, it is a complete failure.
