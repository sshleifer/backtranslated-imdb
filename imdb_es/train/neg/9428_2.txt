Normally I do not take the time to make comments that few people will read, about films that few will see. However, in this case, I feel that I should warn everyone who might consider wasting time on it. I just finished watching it just five minutes ago. This is, quite simply, one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. The performance is horrible, the plot does not exist and the production values ​​are, at best, the level of poverty. I know that even a low budget movie can be great, but it is not. There is only one thing that could have saved this movie for the purposes of any horror fan: more screen gore and cuts! The overall total of three times this happens is off the screen. While it is effective and reasonably disturbing when it occurs, especially in the final scene, there simply is not enough. The film is too long for its minimum content, too heavy for dialogue and, therefore, almost impossible to see. What happens? To summarize everything, there are three adolescent girls irresponsibly knowingly and driving in an isolated area where more than 20 girls have been kidnapped and murdered previously. His car, of course, breaks down and they are taken to an old boring house inhabited by three crazy people, one of whom is the psychotic killer. The three are finally killed, one by one, off the screen, after what seems like an eternity of boring, slow-paced nonsense. As I said, the only things that are worth seeing even once are the murders. Please do not buy it or rent it for that alone, and do not be fooled like I did with the misleading description of the painting and the movie. Save your money and your time.
