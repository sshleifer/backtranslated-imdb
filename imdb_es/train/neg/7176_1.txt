I have nothing more to say but it was horrible. I can not imagine why Helen Mirren and others were part of this degrading disorder. And if certain actors do not want people to question their sexuality, maybe they should refrain from doing more of these movies. There was at least one seen that left me curious. It is just my opinion. SHUDDER thinking what was happening was cut from the movie. SHUDDER to wonder what went through the minds of the actors who made this movie. Shudder to think about the thought process and voyeurism that occurred in the minds of directors. As I said before, it is a degrading disaster. It's not even funny. As Ebert said about the movie Caligula with Malcolm McDowell, it's not a good movie, it's not a good story and it's not even good porn. YEESHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH ............
