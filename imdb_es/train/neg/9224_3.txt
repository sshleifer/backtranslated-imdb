Style but without substance. It's not as funny as it should be. Not as deep as he wants to be. <br /> <br /> This is another in the film genre about the difficulties of making movies. A young filmmaker is hired to finish a 60s science fiction movie called Codename: Dragonfly. Think of Barbarella, or Danger Diabolique. <br /> <br /> But Jeremy Davies is a filmmaker overwhelmed by anguish. It is not a hack it is an artist. The movie he wants to make is a diary of his life. Just original. <br /> <br /> All the characters outside of filmmaker Jeremy Davies are as thin as rice paper. They present characters that might be interesting, like their father, their doppelganger or Jason Schwarzmann as a hacking director and then they show them the door without adding anything. <br /> <br /> This movie is full of goodies for the eyes, but when compared to other movies about filmmakers like Stardust Memories or 8 1/2, it pales in comparison. Those movies are fun, provocative with well-developed characters. Those films have lessons that apply outside <br /> <br /> The movie wants to be comical and countryside, but it's just derivative and there's no fun scene. The filmmakers describe it as a farewell, but what is the satirical goal? The actors say it's a tribute, but I think I'd prefer a full version of Codename: Dragonfly. <br /> <br /> Coppola is clearly funny onstage, as evidenced by the visual humor of the science fiction movie. inside a movie. But he does not share why we should have fun. <br /> <br /> Outside of the science fiction movie is just a mess. There are errors of continuity, the filmmaker chooses a science fiction weapon after it has already been chosen. What? <br /> <br /> Simply because it has a scene where the filmmaker confronts critics complaining about the lack of history, the lack of a point, a scene in which he admits that empty intelligence does not mean he has approached them. critics. <br /> <br /> I suppose if your Roman Coppola can go ahead making a film about an idealistic filmmaker who does not know what he wants to say and that's why he ends up saying nothing. In that sense, it can be considered autobiographical. <br /> <br /> I would see it in Circuit City on a wall full of TVs if I had a choice. Look at the code name of 15 minutes: the Dragonfly movies included in the DVD as extras and then return them.
