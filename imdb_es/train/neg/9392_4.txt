... and Ethel Merman, the fans, will also love their noisy and authoritative voices like the evil witch Mombi, but this cartoon sequel to "The Wizard of Oz" is devoid of true imagination, replacing fantasy and emotion with noisy action (and cheap repeating his footage like a bad music video). Little Dorothy is taken back to Oz, who has been ruined, and meets old and new friends. The inelegant animation is trapped somewhere between Walt Disney's weakest and the least inspired Hanna-Barbera shows, however, many of the songs are good, particularly Dorothy's sweet lament "It's a Far Away Land", excellently interpreted by Liza Minnelli. You can count on Minnelli for energy, so the movie is encouraged when Dorothy is near. A lot of this is not memorable, and I'm not even sure that baby boomers get a charge for it, since it has been out of circulation for so long. As an object of curiosity, fair. ** since ****
