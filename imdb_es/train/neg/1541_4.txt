I did not like this movie intensely and I left during the scene in which the British shot the loyal gang. The film effectively blames the people of NI as the cause of their own problems. He suggests that the 25-year war was a matter of intransigence and nothing to do with the British partition of Ireland and the domination of its history, that is, it was created by Great Britain in 1921 regardless of the wishes of the rest of Ireland. <br /> <br /> The characters are portrayed as unfortunate fools, although I despise the loyal paramilitaries for those who fought for a cause: to maintain their artificial privileges over the Catholic community. It is a known fact that British intelligence collaborated with loyalists during the war, no doubt to keep Catholics at bay and demoralize republicanism. <br /> <br /> The values ​​of the nineties on "machismo", masculinity, etc., are incorporated into the 70s. Belfast and are portrayed as part of the supposed "psyche" unique Irish that leads to the violence. The stupid song of the woman in the club, the old Ireland of green fields ... blah ... blah ... - receives a symbolic stature, that is, poor foolish young people who fight for an impossible cause. Tedious, ahistorical, cheap and unpleasant garbage. O'Sullivan has made a personal statement about a conflict that requires serious political analysis.
