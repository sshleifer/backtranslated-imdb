I am the wife of a youth pastor and we take some young people to see this movie. Then we spent an hour trying to explain it to him. They did not understand it and I did not enjoy it. It is based on a concept that has gone through the three most important religions in the world (the Bible Code, the Torah Code and the Koranic Code) and is so questionable that it is ridiculous. This is not a step forward for Christians in the arts, it is a step forward for those who believe that we check our brains at the door.
