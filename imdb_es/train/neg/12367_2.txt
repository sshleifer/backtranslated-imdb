Loony Tunes has ventured (at least) twice in the future. The first time was with the brilliant "Duck Dodgers". Was the last time with this? um ?? effort. "Loonatics Unleashed" is not without merit, and could be considered a good product if it were not for the quality of Warner Brothers. WB cartoons are famous for their cheeky humor, which appeals to both adults and children. These episodes of pedestrian superheroes, on the other hand, can not stop convincing adults to let them pass. <br /> <br /> The premise of the series is that 6 common individuals (2 bunnies, a Tasmanian devil, a duck, a Roadrunner and a coyote live in the "city-planet" of Acmetropolis and acquire superpowers when a Meteor hits the planet at 2772. What is confusing is that the title section presents these individuals with a count of up to 2772 from the 21st century ... Cute, but very stupid. <br /> <br /> In each episode, The super sextet? Amid slightly fun but essentially banal jokes? Fight against several super villains.For most of them, these are types that appear in all the series of adventures of mediocre superheroes and even some of the best. mediocre superheroes, this takes your villains too seriously for context.And of course these guys are the only characters that laugh? The usual evil laugh, of course.Why is it that the villains on predictable superhero adventures siem pre? ALWAYS ?? laugh evilly at every opportunity? The animated material of this type seems to leave laughter exclusively in the province of villains and (occasionally) in its henchpeople and / or henchthings. <br /> <br /> In fact, the creators of this series lost their best bets since the go-go. The superpowers of the characters sometimes rely on their previous normal abilities, but sometimes they do not. The problem here is that we do not see enough WB madness. Lexi and Ace have fairly ordinary biologically generated energy weapons and have virtually no personality traits that one could describe as "like insects". What we have here is basically the silly and drekish "Teen Titans", including their "appearance" of "animation" too modern, but with animals. Feh <br /> <br /> The other false step of the creators of the program is (or are) the villains. As noted above, these are not terribly imaginative and they do a little too much of evil laughter. Surprisingly, the writers overlooked the obvious technique of creating villains from WB characters, as well as the protagonists. Add to the fun could it have been, for example, Jupiter Sam? As well as The Fudd, still hunting wabbits? As well as Tech E. Coyote turned into a really neurotic villain? and so. Ah, the sadness of missed opportunities? <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, all this production has been too much extra time (that is, a second season). However, we can rejoice that there is something new for the crowd of 14 in 9. The rest of us can expect a third season of Duck Dodgers.
