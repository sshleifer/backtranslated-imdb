Okay, during this last recess of thanksgiving, having the whole family together, everyone decided to go see a movie and, since Fred was voted as a majority, that's what we said. <br /> <br /> To begin with, the movie had so many plot holes that it was pathetic. The simple explanations of why a certain event was happening were null. example; Who the hell is trying to "close" Santa's clause? Is it some kind of corporation? A small explanation would have been lovely. <br /> <br /> Second: The movie threw you flimsy characters that did not cause you any compassion for their feelings or actions. Example: the little elf named Willie and the only tall girl in the village of the elves. They see each other twice and then they are a couple and I did not care much because this movie did not make me worry. <br /> <br /> Third: I suppose this is supposed to be a family movie? His rating was low in only PG. For a family movie there were several articles of suggestive conversation. It did not bother me, but if I were a father I could see a problem. <br /> <br /> Throughout the entire film, Paul Giamatti looked extremely bored with his role, but honestly, he was the only one worth seeing in the movie. Vaughn had some fun moments, but he played the same character he has had in the last two movies. frat boy (nothing against Vaughn, it's been good in other movies) <br /> <br /> so this movie gets 3 out of 10 stars from me, just because someone had to make an effort to produce, film and release this movie <br /> <br /> In my opinion, I would definitely broadcast this movie, or if you HAVE to see it, save it for a rental on a rainy day.
