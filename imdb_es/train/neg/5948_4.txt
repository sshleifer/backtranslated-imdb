I will not mention any part of the plot, because, although it would be highly predictable anyway, the only notable twist of the plot is delivered everywhere, in the comments of the film, in the plot summary here, and even in the synopsis of my Netflix envelope. I could have enjoyed it more if I had not known that. Perhaps. This movie has a deceptively good cast, most of which acted creditably with the fairly limited material at hand, including Donald Sutherland, Lesley Ann Warren and Tia Carrere and Rosemary Dunsmore in smaller parts. It was impossible for me to like William McNamara, but that was clearly by design. And there were a couple of quick nude scenes from the Lenore Zann caliph. But none of this brings me the slightest recommendation. None of these good actors read these scripts before logging in?
