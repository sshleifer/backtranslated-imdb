Before seeing this movie, I could already say that it was a complete copy of Saw (complete with the place in the shape of a hut they were in and the black guy who wanted someone to break his hand to get out of his fists). The name of MJH in a movie would normally reject me (ugh, can we say GROSS ?!), but I still wanted to try it. <br /> <br /> Starting, I was a little interested. The acting is absolutely horrible and I found myself laughing at almost every reaction of the characters (especially the man who played "Sulley"). MJH was even worse, but I kept looking. <br /> <br /> However, the ending was the biggest joke of all! Seriously, I sat in shock thinking "ESE was the end?! Is this a comedy?!". <br /> <br /> I thought that this pile of garbage was more fun than the parodies of "Scary Movie" and that REALLY is saying something!
