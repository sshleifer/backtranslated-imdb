Joe Don Baker. It was great in "Walking Tall" and had a good part in "Goldeneye", but here in "Final Justice" all the hope is gone ... the dark side has won. <br /> <br /> As with most of humanity, my main experience with this was in MST3K, and what an experience it was! Mike and the robots dig their claws deep into Baker's broad flesh and completely skewer this film. It is obvious that they were starting with "Mitchell" on his anti-Joe Don kick and here is his continuation on a subject. <br /> <br /> Makes it a fun experience, though: there are many riffs of choice. My favorites - "John Rhys-Davies for sale", "It's 'Meatloaf: Texas Ranger'", "none of them is worth a sponge", "Why did you wear your party dress to bed", and my favorite - "'Son of ...'? What? What was the son of: son of a PREACHING MAN?" <br /> <br /> In itself, "Final Justice" is, as it puts it Joe Don in the movie, "A big fat nothing." But here, it actually has some entertainment value. You have the opportunity, catch THIS version of "Final Justice". <br /> <br /> Two stars for "Final Justice". Ten for the MST3K version ONLY. <br /> <br /> Oh, and try not to visit Malta when Joe Don is in town.
