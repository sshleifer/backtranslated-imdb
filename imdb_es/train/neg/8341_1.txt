I love horror movies. I can even appreciate most cheeses (face to face, 9 out of 10 horror movies are RECEIVED from cheese), but this was just ridiculous. Terrible acting, terrible writing, completely hollow and incredible characters (there are no Meisner actors here!) And a total lack of sufficient body count. I wish I could SAVE the 79 minutes of my life that I just lost. At least the Crook brothers have an appropriate name. The only good thing about the whole movie was seeing how aspiring Alicia Silverstone is hit in the face. How this ever came to Sundance is completely disconcerting to me. Most of the plot was absolutely unrealistic, even by film standards. Well then! Who would rush to get a cheap earring 10 seconds after a frightening stalker has just come out of his door? Lame.
