This film was heavily tarnished by the presence of Steven Seagal. Or as Steven So-boring should say! As before, Seagal is too good or too stupid to re-double his own lines, letting someone pretend to be his voice for the shots where the sound needed to be connected. A few films before this was that he has done it too, but I do not think so until this point! To be honest, the movie looks pretty good, the script could be useful, but parts of this movie looked like a real movie! Of course, all told, this movie is pretty bad. <br /> <br /> It would have been much better without Seagal, which has become a caricature of itself. Do not bother Anything over a dollar for this is too much! Honestly, I think this is the last time for me and for a Seagal movie. What has taken me so long to realize this?
