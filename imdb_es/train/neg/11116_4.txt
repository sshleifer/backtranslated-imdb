This woman who works as an intern for a photographer goes to her house and takes a bath where she discovers this hole in the ceiling. Then she will discover that her neighbor over her is a photographer. This movie could have had a great plot, but then the plot fades. The problem I had with this movie is that every ten seconds, someone inhales heroin. If they took the scenes where someone inhales heroin, then this would be a good movie. Every time I thought a scene was going somewhere, someone inhaled the white powder. It was really bad to have so much use of drugs in a movie. He drew attention to the main plot and a great story about a photographer. Lesbian things did not bother me. I was looking for a film about art. I found a movie about the use of drugs.
