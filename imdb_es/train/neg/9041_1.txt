I liked the movie a little despite its frenetic pace. BUT, I did not appreciate the comment that Canada was referred to as Montana North. It's definitely NOT Montana North and it never will be. Americans wonder why they are perceived as arrogant in the rest of the world, and that is one of the reasons. Stop teaching the children of the United States of America to think they own the planet. Such a centrist world view is not becoming one of the great nations of the world. Even in jest. I would never refer to the United States as 'Alberta South'. Walt would never leave us, so why start now? Apart from that, the movie was pretty ridiculous, better luck next time.
