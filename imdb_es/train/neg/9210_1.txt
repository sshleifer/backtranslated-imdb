I had completely forgotten about this movie so far. This was the most flagrant and worst attempt to demonize a pastime I have ever seen. The message seemed to be: "Teenagers do not use their imagination, they could take games seriously, go crazy and hurt people." I can only guess that the unimaginative writers of this piece thought that D & D style games are a form of evil ritual or arcane worship.
