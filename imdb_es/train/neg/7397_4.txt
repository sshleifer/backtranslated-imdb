I have seen this movie several times in a variety of short film festivals and it always gives me the impression of having seen a movie trailer. <br /> <br /> For a school film it is very well produced and directed, but the story ... well, I needed something more to be a bigger and more interesting film. The character named Tim Watcher needed some focus in the department. This is something that is missing in some Portuguese short films: the script is always superficial. <br /> <br /> But still, I liked this movie ... <br /> <br /> Parabens! (Congratulations!)
