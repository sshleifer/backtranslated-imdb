That is incredible! Fidani (who was also a spiritualist) was one of the cheapest directors in the world. This movie stole Leone's original title "Duck you sucker!" but tell the boring story of a Pinkerton agent against the murderer "Testa di Ferro" (the unlikely Gordon Mitchell, a double). Everything is poor and crazy in this movie filmed in the beloved landscapes of Lazio. The story is bad and at the same time crazy. Fidani was not capable and naive at the same time. In the story happened a kind of illogical follies (like the scuffle at the sheriff's house and the demented appearance of Butch Cassidy!?!?!?!!?) Yes, really Butch Cassidy, who is portrayed as an idiot). Terrible news, absurd behavior, illogical plot, bad performance and a fleeting appearance of one of the most awarded presenters in the history of Italian television, Renzo Arbore. Oh, of course: Klaus Kinski. Yes, it's great and terrible, but I'm sure he only participated for money and for playing with iron horses) 2 out of 10 but ... DO NOT MISS OUT !!!!!
