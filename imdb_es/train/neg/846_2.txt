This has to be, by far, the worst movie I've seen in the last 20 years. When I saw that Michael Madsen was in it, I realized that it could not be such a bad movie, since it has been in some pretty decent movies, and it was a fairly fair actor. INCORRECT! No one should waste their time in this movie. I moved quickly through 80 percent and I do not feel like I missed anything.
