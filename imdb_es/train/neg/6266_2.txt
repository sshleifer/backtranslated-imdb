It seems that anyone can make a movie today. It's like all you need is a camera, a group of people to be your cast and a team, a script and a little money, and you have a movie. The problem is that talent is not always part of this equation and, often, this type of low budget films turn out to be dubious. The shelves of the video store are full of these so-called movies. These are not even guilty pleasures, they are just a waste of celluloid that is better to forget. Troma Entertainment is known for making garbage movies, but most of its films are made of film gold. However, some of the films they published had nothing to do with the performance and others, such as 'Nightmare Weekend', did not deserve any kind of release at all. <br /> <br /> Pros: Cast members do the best they can with the lousy material. Some involuntary hilarity. It moves at a good pace (It should be at 81 minutes). <br /> <br /> Cons: a horrible writing, which includes a putrid dialogue and innumerable gaps in the plot. Ill-lit, especially the night scenes and the end, which can not be distinguished at all. It does not make any sense. Poor scored. Cheap and very old effects. Total lack of character development and you will not care about anyone. It is supposed that this is a horror movie, but it is missing in that area and it does not give the least fear. Nothing interesting or exciting happens. Loaded with unnecessary filling. <br /> <br /> Final Thoughts: I never expected this to be a forgotten jewel, but I never imagined it would be so bad. I do not know if it's the worst movie ever made, but it's a definitive contender. Troma should have let this movie go rotten instead of giving it a release. Do not make the same mistake I made and let your curiosity get the best of you. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/5
