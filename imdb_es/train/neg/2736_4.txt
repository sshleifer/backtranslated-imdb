The only reason I comment is because I finally discovered why Dr. Cox was bald. Although we probably all noticed at the same time this week, Dr. Cox is bald because they showed these episodes in a different order from the one they filmed. The last episode when our favorite grumbler, Jesus' lover, nurse Roberts, dies, Dr. Cox shaves his head. He must have shown them out of order for some strange reason and forgot that continuity escaped them. To shame, Scrubs. They have made mistakes like this before. I remember when Elliot is trying to date Scott Foley and his hair is wet 2 seconds before the water hits her. I try not to notice these things, but my favorite program needs to intensify it.
