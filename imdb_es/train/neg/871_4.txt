['Nicholas Walker is Paul, the local village of Reverand who is married to Martha (Ally Sheedy), but is also a habitual womanizer and decides to fake his own death to flee with his current relationship, Veronica (Dara Tomanovich). However, in doing so, he gets an attack of amnesia (hence the name of the film). Sally Kirkland is also present as an insane crazy old man who looks for the good Reverand in a tone of &quot;Misery&quot;. It&#39;s sad to see a pretty good cast wasted like that. No less important John Savage in a horribly forgettable role as a shoddy private investigator. In a film categorized as a &quot;black comedy&quot;, one has to bring BOTH elements to the movie. While this brings the first with spades, unfortunately it contains nothing of the latter. Also, you can not emphasize with any of the characters and, therefore, you have no interest in them. Technically it is not a bad movie for everyone, just a very forgettable one. <br /><br /> Eye Candy: Dara Tomanovich goes topless; Sally Kirkland also shows some skin. <br /><br /> My Degree: C- <br /><br /> Where I saw it: Showtime Showcase']
