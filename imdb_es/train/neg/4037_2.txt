I have no idea what the producers of The Shield were trying to do, but the result speaks for itself: The Shield is practically impossible to see. <br /> <br /> Supposedly the performances at The Shield are excellent ... <br /> <br /> Actually, the show is so badly organized that you can not even watch the performances. For example, the editing moves away the reaction shots before they have their full impact. <br /> <br /> I do not know what intellectual reasoning there is for that, but it takes away from the demonstration all the emotional impact. <br /> <br /> I'll give The Shield a point for ambition in his subject, but that's all I can give him. <br /> <br /> It's a shame to see several talents. The artist loses his gift in something so strangely filmed.
