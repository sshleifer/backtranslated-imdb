I've seen (too many) movies from this company, this is almost half the package. One of the good parts is that it is a little more stylized and under control than some of its rates, less attempts at humor in the second moment and more adherence to the story (for what it's worth). Many of his titles, such as Sexy Sixth Sense, are buried by baaaad performances and an amateur sensibility. On the other hand, I found simulated sex scenes not as attractive as some of his other films (such as Vampire Vixens, Gladiator Eroticus, Spiderbabe or Mistress Frankenstein). <br /> <br /> Misty Mundae always has a 10 on the peter meter, as is the fall darian. I found Barbara Joyce in fashion at a school, and Ruby LaRocca is a sexy hottie. <br /> <br /> Watch this with the remote control firmly in your hand (free), on a night when you need a break. of porn Do not waste time wanting to review the story, you have better things to do with your life. It's not a movie, it's pure T & A, but it's not bad according to that standard.
