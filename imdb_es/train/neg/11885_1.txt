I will dispense with the usual comparisons with a legendary filmmaker known for his neurotic New York persona, because, frankly, making comparisons with the clumsy loser Josh Kornbluth, it's just an insult to any director. I will also avoid mentioning the "Office Space" satire at the same time as this celluloid catastrophe. Can I, however, compare it with waking up during your own surgery? It is painful to see it and you wonder if the surgeons really know what they are doing. Haiku Tunnel is the type of film that I would like to disconnect in its early stages of production. It was cruel to let him live and, as a result, audiences around the world are suffering. <br /> <br /> The premise of the movie? If you really have one ?? It is not even worth discussing, but as a precaution I will. Josh Kornbluth, a temporary worker with severe phobia of commitment, is offered a permanent job. Your main duty is to send 17 high priority letters to your boss. But ridiculously, you can not perform this simple task. My reaction? What a thing! Is not that a story? It is a passing thought at best, one that should have been overlooked by any filmmaker who respects himself. <br /> <br /> The main actor ?? If you can call it that? he is a clumsy man jester, with plump features, a disheveled and untamed hairline, and a series of facial expressions that range from shaking to disturbing. Where or where the director found this shit? What are you saying? He is the director? Oh my mistake Playing yourself in your own shame of a script is one thing, but I suspect that Mr. Kornbluth is not as convincing as a human being, let alone as an actor. Be assured that this is not, in any way, a murder without character, but never before had I been so irritated by the presence on the screen of an actor. My frustration was further confused by her incessant monologues with the camera between scenes. I mean, as if the viewer needed an ounce of intelligence to understand this nonsense, Kornbluth insults us even more by "explaining" the action (first rule of filmmaking: "dramatize the exhibition", do not say). Who do you think is this guy? He has no charisma, no charm, and judging by his Hawaiian shirts, he has no sense of style. Your casting agent must be blank! <br /> <br /> The supporting actors do nothing to alleviate the intense boredom I felt, with only one exception. Patricia Scanlon presents a very funny appearance as Helen, the former secretary, who has gone crazy for her former boss, and harasses from her basement while holding a flashlight under her face. This made me laugh, but the moment passed and I went back to check my watch to see the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> The title of the movie is also an inappropriate name. The Haiku tunnel has nothing to do with the ancient form of Japanese poetry. Do not be fooled and think that this is an artistic film because of its pretentious title or the fact that it was only played in a handful of cinemas and did not win money at the box office. There is a very good reason for that! <br /> <br />
