Everything that the producers of this atrocious adaptation were trying to do is impossible to understand. <br /> <br /> A group of high quality actors, mostly well cast (with a couple of notable exceptions), which they give quite well. performances Penelope Keith is perfect as Aunt Louise and equally good is Joanna Lumley as Diana. They all do well with the scripts they were given. <br /> <br /> A lot for good. The average would include the sets. Nancherrow is not at all like the house described in the book, although strangely the house they use for Dower House looks a lot like her. It is clear then that the Dower house is too big. In the later parts, the writers decided to bring the whole story to the UK, probably to save money, although with a little imagination I have no doubt that they could have recreated Ceylon. <br /> <br /> Now to the bad. The script. This is an adaptation so appallingly bad that it is difficult to find words to condemn it. Edward does not die in the battle of Britain, but survives, blinded. He makes a brief appearance and then commits suicide. Why? Loveday has changed from the young girl in love with Gus to the wife of a sensitive farmer who can give up the love of his life with just a tear (less emotional than Brief Encounter). Gus, a man in love and passionately in love, is ready to give up his love without complaining. Walter (Mudge in the book) goes from being an unfaithful and shallow husband to a devout family man. Jess becomes a psychologically disturbed young woman who does not speak. Aunt Biddy still has a problem with the drinks, but now without any justification. House Dower is occupied by the army for no obvious reason other than a very short scene with Jess, who is afraid of armed soldiers. While Ms. Mortimer's breasts are absolutely charming, I could not see how her display on several occasions made the plot advance. The delicious Nettlebed becomes the mundane Dobson. The word limit prevents me from continuing with the list. <br /> <br /> There is a sequel (in which I lost all interest in seeing after this nonsense) and I wonder if the changes were made to create the next story. It is difficult to imagine that Rosam√ºnde Pilcher would have approved this grotesque perversion of his book; presumably she lost control when she bought the rights.
