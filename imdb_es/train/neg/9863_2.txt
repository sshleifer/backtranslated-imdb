Christopher Guest should not worry, his supreme dominance in the subgenre Mockumentary is not in trouble to be overshadowed in the slightest, especially not by this so little fun hit for RPG players. The jokes are beyond the lame. There is not enough substance to last the typical duration of a SNL play (particularly stale), let alone the atrocious 87 minutes that I lost seeing this nonsense. The great William Katt (the greatest American hero, House) deserves much MUCH better. One thing and only one thing makes the fact that I saw this worthwhile in my mind and published about it here, so I hope you save someone such a bad experience. <br /> <br /> My rating: D- <br /> <br /> DVD extras: 2 audio comments; 7 interviews with several cast members; 4 scenes deleted; and theatrical trailer <br /> <br /> DVD-Rom extras: 2 Wallpapers <br /> <br /> Easter Egg: highlight the eye in the image on the main menu for a short scene
