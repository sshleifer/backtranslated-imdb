Jet Li, is one of the best melee fighters in the world. It takes more than 20 years and shames others of the genre. Although it is large in Asia, it is almost unknown here in the USA. UU <br /> <br /> Black Mask is supposed to be a movie for him, but it fails horribly. First, it doubles. While it may have camp value (the dub is not even close and is flat), it seems inappropriate for the normal movie viewer. Secondly, the director of this film, Daniel Lee, does a horrible job. He cuts scenes so fast, sometimes, you do not know what's going on. Other times, the camera shakes and wobbles. Fans watch Jet Li's films for fantastic martial arts. However, the director edits the scenes so fast that you do not even know who is who half the time. Other times, a scene hangs (ie, Li is starting to make a hole in the floor of a jeep, while the bad guys put together their weapons, two seconds later, both Li and the love interest are already under the car !) Other scenes are so improbable, that they cross over the point of being completely ridiculous (murderous CD romos? Just give them throwing stars!). Li, you need a director who is less likely to cut machine guns and more to create a cinematic staging. Added rap / techno music is going to be good to be intrusive. The plot has possibilities, but all are wasted by cartoon characters that remove all credibility that this film seeks. And should we really believe that the love interest would not recognize Simon, because he has a half mask? Would not the hair, the lower jaw or the voice reveal it? <br /> <br /> If you want to see a movie by Jet Li, try Iron Monkey or your classic Shaolin Temple. This messy mess is a complete waste of time ..... 2/10
