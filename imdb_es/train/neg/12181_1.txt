Unfortunately there was not a 0 for a qualification or otherwise I would have chosen it. This film lacks the star power that the original film had in such abundance. Carol Burnett, Albert Finney, Tim Curry, Bernadette Peters, Edward Hermann, the innocence of the newcomer Aileen Quinn and the expert guidance of the experienced John Huston (father of the actress Angelica Huston) is what made this film so charming. Even the 1999 remake with Kathy Bates, Victor Garber, Alan Cumming and Kristin Chenoweth had more to offer than this regrettable excuse for a sequel. Before making this film, Ashley Johnson was known for her role as little Chrissie Seaver in the primetime show Growing Pains. She had some small parts in the movies, but I do not know who thought she had enough talent to take a movie on her own. And adding Joan Collins as Lady Edwina Hogbottom, ridiculous! Could not they get actors good enough to play the lead roles like Daddy Warbucks, Miss Hannigan and Annie, but will they sign Joan Collins to play a British lady? I'm not surprised that this movie was as bad as it was. The critics were right to not agree with this movie, even if it was only made for television, it was a bad sequel to a movie that would otherwise be adorable.
