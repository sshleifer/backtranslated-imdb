Somewhere, on this site, someone wrote that to get the best version of Jane Austen's works, one should simply read them. I agree with that. However, we love the adaptations of the great literature and the strike of the current writers reminds us that without good writers, it is difficult for actors to give life to their roles. The current version of Jane Austen's PERSUASION shows us what happens when you do not have a good foundation in a well-written adaptation. This version does not compare to the 1995 version with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds, who acted well and maintained the essence of the era and the limitations of the characters (with the exception of the strange parade and kisses on the street scene in Bath). The 2007 version shows a twitty Anne who seems distressed. The other characters were not very developed, which is a crime, considering how Austen could paint such wonderful characters with some carefully chosen underestimations. The sequence of events that made sense in the novel was completely launched, and Mrs. Smith, Anne's bedmate and impoverished schoolgirl, is walking in Bath, and it sounds on twitter, as many of the characters seemed to do. The strength of character and intelligence of Captain Wentworth, which made Anne love him in the first place, did not seem to be written in Rupert Penry-Jones's Wentworth. Ciaran Hinds had more substance and was able to convey a lot more with a look, which P-J could do with his poses. All in all, the 2007 version was a disappointment. It seemed to reduce the novel to a disguised melodrama of debatable value. If they wanted to incorporate our modern emotional extravagances into Austen's work, they should have done what they do with Shakespeare's adaptations: to adapt them to the present. At least "Bride & Prejudice" was taken out of the historical setting and location and it was fun to watch, just like "Clueless". This was not PERSUASION, but they did not know what to call it.
