Kubrick meets the king. It sounded very promising in the spring of 1980, I remember it. Then the movie came out, and the Kubrick cultists have been fighting with the King's cultists ever since. <br /> <br /> The King's cultists say that Stanley Kubrick took a great horror story and ruined it. The Kubrick cultists do not care about King's story. They talk about steadicams, tracking shots, camera angles. This is a movie, they insist: it must be considered for itself. As it happens, both fields are correct. Unfortunately. <br /> <br /> If one sees it purely as an adaptation of King's novel, "The Shining" is in fact a failure, a wasted opportunity, a series of failed narrative errors. <br /> <br /> I used to blame that on Kubrick's screenwriter. The writer Diane Johnson (author of Le Marriage, L'Affaire, Le Divorce, etc.) has a reputation as a novelist of social manners. Perhaps she was chosen for her subtle understanding of conjugal relationships or family dynamics. But the small blue-collar city of Sidewinder, Colorado, does not exist on any map of its Francophile universe. <br /> <br /> However, Kubrick the Anglophile probably found it pleasant. He, of course, is the true author. And considered by its own merits, its script for "The Shining", with its mixture of abnormal psychology, rationalism, supernaturalism and implicit reincarnation, simply does not resist the logical analysis. <br /> <br /> I am willing to consider the "brightness" of Kubrick on his own terms. I'm even willing to take it as something more than a conventional horror genre movie. But neither does it succeed as a naturalistic study of isolation, alienation and madness. Analyzed in any way, the film falls apart. <br /> <br /> Are the horrors of the Overlook Hotel real? Or do they exist only in the mind, first as prescient nightmares suffered by little Danny Torrance, then as the hallucinations of his father? One notes how every time Jack Torrance is seen talking to a "ghost", in fact, he is looking in the mirror. One notices how the hotel's frozen topiary labyrinth seems to symbolize Jack's twisted, twisted psyche. Very deep things. <br /> <br /> But if in fact the "ghosts" of the Overlook are pure manifestations of the growing madness of Jack Torrance, then who exactly leaves Jack trapped outside the dressing room of the hotel kitchen, so what can Go on your inveterate fuss by wielding the ax? <br /> <br /> And SOMEBODY can explain, with a serious face, that black and white photograph (called "1921") by Nicholson as a tuxedo party. Who leaves the left field towards the wall of a living room Hotel dance during the final seconds of the movie? Should we seriously conclude that Jack Torrance's bad madness comes from some kind of "past life" experience? (And if he swallows that, since when are reincarnated people supposed to be exact physical replicas of his past?) <br /> <br /> Maybe Kubrick did not care about his story. Maybe I just wanted to evoke a feeling of horror. In any case, the film tries to cover its narrative bets: having both forms, rational and supernatural. As a result, the story is a disaster. This film has not improved with age and, of course, does not improve with repeated sightings. <br /> <br /> I do not deny that some moments of fear, claustrophobia and chills in general are scattered throughout this time. , feature film. But those jets of Elevators of Blood, seen repeatedly in the visions of little Danny, are absurd and ridiculous. And the famous quotes of Jack Torrance ("Wendy, I'm home!" And "JOHNNY of Heeeeeere!") They simply puncture the dramatic tension of the film and dispel its narrative energy. (I know: I sat in the theater and heard the audience laugh in comical relief: "Good, I'm glad we do not have to take this seriously!") Finally, Kubrick is completely at sea, or completely cynical, during those scenes in which Wendy wanders around the empty hotel while her husband tries to puree his son. A hall full of mummified guests, all sitting dead in their party hats? Oh, now I really am afraid. <br /> <br /> Given the brilliance of Jack Nicholson over the years, one can only assume that he gave the kind of performance of rolling the eyeball, wagging his eyebrows and making the director dear. The interpretation of Shelley Duvall, as a kind of female version of Don Knotts in "The Ghost and Mr. Chicken", is best ignored in silence. <br /> <br /> This movie simply does not succeed, not as an adaptation, not on its own terms. It probably deserves a 3 out of 10, but I give it a 1 because it has been very FREE in this forum.
