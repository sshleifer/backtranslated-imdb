There may be something poetically correct in seeing dentists suffer. Let them do it, in this sad and truly terrible film, but they also cause the audience to suffer pains from the non-dental variety. If you ever wanted to see a movie full of screaming children, children who vomit, sick children, many long and significant looks, a deadpan wife and a worried husband: everything is here for you. Bored, too long, stands out as one of those examples that scream: why? Is there a saving grace? Yes there are. There is a short scene from Nabucco, with some pretty good songs. Save your money, or if you are on TV or cable, save your time. You can always read a book or make an omelet.
