The lack of content in this movie surprised me more. First I thought that people were going to compare this with Rock On! But I'm really surprised to say that this was worse than Rock On! So, the story The horrible cast Ajay Devgan Jamming with Salman Khan and Asin you have to be kidding. The music was good. Khanabad was the theme of the film. The rest was bad! Vipul Shah has not yet learned from Singh is the critically hit comedy of King. Now, Asin ... where does she come from? I'm sorry for the Asin fan who is out there, but he had a very bad time in this movie. Seriously, acting bad, it did not look good in any makeup overdose! My final verdict is to see Aladin with his family, instead of wasting time here.
