This is easily the worst movie I've seen. I'm not exaggerating, I told the Blockbuster guy that they should get him off the shelves. The only interesting thing about this movie is the box. In the box it says "from the director of the boogeyman", so I thought ... hey, if it was done recently, I'm sure at least the address will not be TOO much: - \, but after I saw the movie and looked at what "Boogeyman" were talking, it's a foolishness from the early 1980s that he did. Great way to bind unsuspecting spectators. <br /> <br /> Either way, I think they just liked the name "Zodiac Killer", and they did not bother to investigate any of the actual crimes of the zodiac or its MO, not even The years it was active . All the crimes they talk about have nothing to do with the Zodiac and the "stories" about the original Zodiac take place several years after the crimes of the royal Zodiac did. They also compare the Zodiac with "Vampire of Dusseldorf" Fritz Haarman throughout the film and talk to Fritz's "son" quite often. Zodiac and Haarman did not look alike, and it makes more sense to compare it with BTK, which also shot people, not a man who killed people by chewing on their necks. None of Haarman's facts is correct, just a lot of nonsense. His son even says: "Do not forget, his name was Fritz Haarman with 2 t" ... His real name only has one! I think the writer / director just wrote in a google search for serial killers and the fastest ones that came were Zodiac Killer and Fritz Haarman. "Oh, those sound like great names, let's make a movie about them without doing any outside research! What a great idea!" <br /> <br /> Maybe my favorite inconsistency in this movie is the way the experts and the youngsters The killer describes the suffering of the DSM-IV and heals it. "They also diagnosed me with DSM-IV and since then I have recovered", etc. For those of you who do not know, DSM-IV is the psychological manual for mental disorders. If someone suffers from the book itself, then they must have some SERIOUS problems! LOL. <br /> <br /> Anyway, my point is that this goes to the end of my 5 worst movies on the all-time list, and it's rare for a movie to reach that point. But, if you're interested in seeing a totally non-fact story about serial killers that is nothing but boring, full of inexperienced actors and not completely rational, I'd say take a look at this movie. <br /> <br /> ... Oh, and I liked how the killer "ripped" some of his victims with dry ice. Good touch ...
