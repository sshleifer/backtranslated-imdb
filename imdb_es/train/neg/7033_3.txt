Black Candles is rather a confusing mess from the same director who brought us "Vampyres" and much later, "Rest in Pieces", among others ... I'm just noticing the ones I've seen. In any case, we have a couple who makes love and then, somewhere nearby, a pin is placed on a voodoo doll and then pierced, and the man stops. I'm not sure if it was good for any of them, at that time. Let's move on to where the man's sister has come to the house to investigate and listen to the reading of the will, or something like that, and of course, everyone else, except her, is involved in something, which is the worship of the devil. It is really difficult to say who is who at the moments of the film and, sometimes, it gets confused a little. To spice things up, however, there is a simulated bestiality scene (I HOPE that is simulated) with a black goat, which will surely please the crowd. Ugh Sometimes, this echoes the "Rosemary baby", except for the baby, because the hostess always gives her a herbal tea and the place stinks of any unpleasant herb that is Satan's, because that is still noticeable. However, herbs are not the only thing that stinks this movie. The end seems to have gone back to the beginning again, and many spectators may find themselves wondering where they have been during the middle part. It's not unappealable, it's just not very good, and I guess it all depends on what you like to see in the movies, and there was not much here that did anything for me. 3 out of 10
