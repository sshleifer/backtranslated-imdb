I can not believe that the Indian film industry still emits third-class scum like Waqt. For starters, is the plot totally unlikely? The spoiled child is expelled from the family home to teach their child to be self-sufficient. So what does he do? He quickly wins a national talent contest doing star jumps in front of a panel of judges (honestly I'm not kidding here). Meanwhile, his father is dying of lung cancer, but he keeps it a secret for his son, but he survives long enough to see his son become famous, to see his new grandson and also to make a toy giraffe with your own hands <br /> <br /> Is the performance cringe worthy in your hamminess? none of the main actors in this film made any effort to try and act convincingly. As usual in Indian films, the family lived in a large mansion and seemed relatively alien to the concerns of the real world. <br /> <br /> To be honest, the biggest losers when making such terrible movies are smart viewers. who made the mistake of watching a movie like that. The actors, like Amitabh Bachchan and Akshay Kumar, will still be revered as gods by those people who only have a blind faith in Bollywood.
