"Black Angel" is a minor whodunit, with June Vincent as a woman trying to save her husband from the electric chair after he is found guilty of killing an old acquaintance. Dan Duryea (the husband of the murdered woman) decides to help Vincent find the real culprit. Peter Lorre has an ungrateful role as a suspect. This film noir looks and plays like a cheap programmer, without achieving anything special. It is nice enough, but then, at some point, it stops making sense and the solution to the mystery provokes one of those great reactions of "give me a break". That ending could only have completely sunk the movie, but what precedes the conclusion is not very good either. Vincent is a weak heroine and Duryea was never very good at playing the good guys. I love black cinema, but this was a real disappointment.
