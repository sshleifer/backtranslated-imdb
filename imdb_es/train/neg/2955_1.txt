Poor Whoopi Goldberg. Imagine it at a friend's dinner and add a comment to the deep political discussion that is unfolding. People just look at her and say, "Oh, what would you know? You were the star of 'Theodore Rex.'" How could anyone take her seriously after she stooped to be the star of this horrible piece of shit? Even little children would be horrified at this Thing. It reminded me of a particularly bad episode of 'Sigmund And The Sea Monsters'. Actually, now that I think about it, 'Sigmund' was far superior to this. <br /> <br /> And yet, it was done? By feeding the producer with an illegal substance before talking about it? Look at this horrible abomination at your own risk.
