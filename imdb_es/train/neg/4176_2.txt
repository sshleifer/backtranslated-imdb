Maybe I missed the meeting when the meaning of "B-movie" was explained, but what I just saw was ridiculous. Do you want a good synopsis of this movie? Take aliens, replace the xenomorphs with vampires, then eliminate everything that was good, and that's it. <br /> <br /> 5 minutes of the movie, the "V-SAN squad" (that's the dumbest acronym I ever heard) verifies a "base" that has been massacred by vampires and then goes down (DOWN? What?) A ladder obviously attached to a billboard with an obvious modern train in the background. When is this supposed to happen? 2210. Ok ... (wait, I'll go back to that) <br /> <br /> Yes. The characters. Wow, well, there's the lesbian Asian girl, the red-collar cowboy wannabe, the whimsical foreman, the Hot Topic goth vampire / cashier and the second wob noob in charge. All of them are interpreted by their respective actors with the same lack of ambition. It almost hurts me to see Micheal Ironside in this movie. Are not you getting enough money being the voice of Sam Fisher in Splinter Cell? Basically, the only original thing about Vampire Wars is how bad it is. <br /> <br /> Upon seeing this later birth of a film, the only amusement I got was because of the weak attempts to create scenarios. Since when does the recording of PCI computer cards on a wall count as a room ready for a spaceship? The money required to make this film could have been used much better.
