Quite the most boring nonsense I've seen in a long time. The plot was full of irrelevance, and the performance was the worst I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, the camera angles that made me feel bad were used, the incidental music was terrible and it drowned out the dialogue (maybe it's not a bad thing then), and the photos of San Francisco seemed having been stolen directly from the promotional video of the city's tourism board. <br /> <br /> Oh, and compulsory sex The scene was not half good. Better lighting next time, please.
