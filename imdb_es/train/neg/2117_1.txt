The brides die on the altar and their corpses disappear. Everyone is worried, but nobody seems to be able to discover why and how this is happening, nor can they prevent it from happening. Be patient with me. Bela Lugosi is responsible for this, since she extracts the spinal fluid of these young women to transfuse her former wife and keep her alive. Keep having patience with me. Finally, the authorities discover that someone must be designing the deaths and disappearances, but, of course, they can not discover the unlikely motive. Just ignore the ridiculous pseudoscience and move forward ... If you can overcome the first twenty minutes of this mess, you will receive Lugosi whipping his laboratory assistant for disrespecting one of the brides he murdered, explaining that he is sleeping. in a much more comfortable coffin than a bed, and other vague parodies of real horror movies (of the kind with budgets and plots). Anyhoo: a journalist follows the culprit's nose (and remarkably the inept police are nowhere to be seen!), And then the fun begins. <br /> <br /> Cinematography and acting are fine. There are many well-dressed people, very beautiful in this movie. The direction is just, and the script is a little better than the deserved material. However, this film fails to maintain the interest of all, except the fan of the most solid film B. The best part of this ... eventually ends, but not soon enough.
