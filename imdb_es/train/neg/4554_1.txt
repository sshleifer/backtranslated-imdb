Bingo is the game, shit is the name. Rarely has the screen been stained with a mixture of half-conspiracy theories, a puritanical mockery and a new-age brouhaha. Most of the story takes place in Viciente, a Christian resort in the Peruvian jungle. Think that Rivendell, of Tolkien, is with Star Trek Baku Planet, inhabited by adepts followers of a love and peace cult not so mysterious but surprisingly narrow. Thanks to the ghastly performance and sticky production design (the rainbow color visualization of the mysterious healing "energy" is particularly frightening), "The Celestial Prophecies" looks and feels like an episode of the "Twilight Zone" from the eighties. The factual errors regarding the history of the church and the nomenclature abound. I can not believe that Hector Elizondo agreed to be part of this. Maybe it was done without your consent, Bowfinger style. May the Lord have mercy on the director, the scriptwriter, the author of the novel and the poor souls who watch the film or read the book.
