This movie aims to be a character study of perversion. Some critics have been deceived into assuming that because the perversion is represented, the film is psychologically profound; Actually, considering salacious material, it is surprisingly tedious and superficial, without motivational substance. Why is the main character what she is like? You will not know the script. For a better treatment of the same subject (and a more entertaining film), try the Belle de Jour de Bunuel.
