It seems that Salvatores could not decide what to do with this film: part of it is a very weak suspense movie (and I say very, very weak), another part is an attempt to explore the relationships between the main characters. Both things have been tested in psychological thrillers, but in this case the film can not keep things together, due to a poor and superficial writing, a bad performance and a film too dark and too boring. I would say that Salvatores gave the best of himself in other genres and in other environments, where he had the freedom to look at the characters without having to think about the plot. In general, a B movie is hardly worth your money ... Vote: 4/10
