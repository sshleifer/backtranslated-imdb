Before the Internet, this movie could never have been made, but the idea that the Web is full of evil is the underlying idea. Unfortunately, that's it: the general opinion that today the Red in your hands can create as much chaos as anything else. in real life. Since the late 1990s, someone discovered that a virus could be created that would disable a computer. Point? Just to do something simply evil by remote control, is the cybernetic equivalent of stealing with violence. What is basically what spam is without violence: it is tricking you into part of your money and it has been going on for so long that it is a wonder that someone realizes it. Nowadays, they become smarter and use real names, since doing something illegal is not a priority. We see that the Internet gets worse every week: social networking sites or chat rooms that lead to evil and child pornography sites that ARE illegal. . So the idea of ​​a movie that invites people to click on a name is exactly the same: actually, it's a site called Horrorvision, which is a pornography site, but it KILLS people who enter their portals . However, the story is so disjointed that it is boring and does not come to any conclusion. The definitive film on this issue of the destruction of an Internet service provider has not yet been made, but clearly many YES need to be destroyed, as they will not be closed when there is money to be earned. Calling this a horror movie is pretty misleading, since it does not bore anyone.
