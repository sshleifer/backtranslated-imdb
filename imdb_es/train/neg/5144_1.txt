The orange hue of everything was just disgusting. Oh yes, the main character lives in a ghetto that is all dyed orange with people dyed orange. Meanwhile, to mentally escape this overwhelming poverty of the body, she plays a video game of total immersion (which has no clear rules nor logic follows the game). Apparently, she earns an income to the game, but it is revealed that she is not an employee of the gaming company. A lot of pauses that do not speak later, the story goes on slowly. She uses an orange computer interface with an operational interface that is visually annoying and I can only suspect a future release from Microsoft. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, I, the viewer, basically ask why you are wasting your valuable time in some moronic game when you barely have the necessities of life? Oh yes, playing games is fun, but what is the point when you almost starve? While she is laughing at her life playing an evil video game of total immersion and more orange tonality, her dog escapes (probably looking for an owner to pay at least a moment of attention and feed him regularly) or do it . stolen from the woman (while she is ignoring her terrible reality tinged with orange). <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, he becomes obsessed with a game in which his game team lost the whole movie without interest. Yawn. So she wants to be the best of the best, go for them Ash Catchem (she has to bore us all). Golly, this main character also stinks as a human being and has no redeeming qualities other than her physical beauty (which she could exchange in some way to escape her crushing poverty). <br /> <br /> So you get to the "The real level and, at least, it does not stink horribly and they send you to kill a former comrade teammate who lives mentally on the" Real "level. the filthy and boring soft film dyed orange is no longer a tedious task to watch, but it has the potential to say something like "the main character is trapped in poverty generated by imaginary computer and is actually in the real world now". Maybe she's going to do the murder and live in the real world now? Well, she kills the guy and he disappears in a digital effect.Wow, thank you idiot director, you suck, you suck a lot, director. <br /> <br Here, the director had the chance to redeem himself a bit by burying this terrible and bad-tempered, raw movie with a philosophical touch. <br /> <The director could have said: "The REAL WORLD is there and if you live in it and contributes to improve it, it will not be a land of poverty tinged with orange. " Intelligent way to make this succulent film an agonizing lesson about basic civic pride (for the 1% of viewers who have not found something really entertaining to watch at the moment or that are masochist movies). <br /> <br /> No, director. The director had to ruin all this throwing a crudino digital effect and ruin all the possibilities of redemption for this terrible movie that was a waste of money, a waste of time and a loss of confidence of the viewer. <br /> <br /> After that, it ends. Good trip I hope the director chokes on that. I put this HACK on my list of "avoid at all costs" for any other movie that is assigned its name.
