I, in addition to having endured hundreds of children's movies in the past, I consider it one of the worst I've seen. <br /> <br /> 1) I regret this day and the time of having to explain to my children that Russia is not "the bad guys". In addition, the mockery of Russian names like "Poopchev" is inappropriate. <br /> <br /> 2) The scene of the grandfather fly birthday party contained a quasi-sexist joke in which he implied that men drink beer and women talk on the phone. Two other flies also unnecessarily use the word "garbage" twice. <br /> <br /> 3) The whole movie in large part smells of 1950s stereotypes and propaganda that I thought, as a nation, we were proud to have climbed above. <br /> <br /> In general it's just coarse, badly animated, even more badly written and it's not worth wasting time to see it.
