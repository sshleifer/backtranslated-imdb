This movie sold for a dollar in Wal-Mart on a DVD, so I do not feel like I've lost anything to watch this movie, except my TIME. He enjoyed the performance of Tom Hanks, (Robbie Wheeling), who looked very young and gave an exceptional performance considering it was a horrible script. The story is about college students who decided to play the game Mazes & Monsters, only in a very realistic environment. Robbie Wheeling has had problems in the past playing this game at other universities and his parents advise him to leave the game alone and get good grades. Robbie meets a very nice girl and has a romantic adventure with her and once he starts playing the game, he stops making love to him and acts like a Monk. There are some scenes in the film that are taken around the old World Trade Center and also on the observation floor and the roof area. It is quite sad to see this part of the film in which so many human beings died because of the evil in the world. This is not a very good movie, except for Tom Hanks who tries to keep the film above the level of entertainment that is sinking.
