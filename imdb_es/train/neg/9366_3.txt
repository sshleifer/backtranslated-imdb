I hired Hybrid over the weekend. What a disappointment! A stupid attempt to make a tele-movie. The guy they got for the lead was totally weak and when he ran (he did a lot) he seemed to be eating those mint sweets ... with his ass! The wolf contacts I was carrying were great, although I think the actor trusted them too much, since there was nothing threatening about his performance. The wise Native American Indian has to be one of the hardest witches ever seen. Talk about a sour cow! She smiled once during the whole movie, and I think it's because she had sex. The sex scene was lame too. It is possible that they have also shown curtains to the wind, if you can dig that. <br /> <br /> Finally, and this is a great pet that I hate, on the cover and on the DVD menu, the losers drew digitally. Sharp and cold teeth in the boy. They were not seen in the movie. :(
