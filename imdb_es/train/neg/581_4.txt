Before continuing, I must admit that I am a big fan of Bon Jovi. In fact, that's what attracted me to the DVD case in the first place. He probably would have bought it anyway, for being a big fan of horror and for having enjoyed the first Vampire title so much. <br /> <br /> But this is not so good. Not even Jon could keep this movie. My main problem would be that it just is not scary. Apart from the character of Jon, Derek Bliss, none of the other characters impress and you do not care if they die or not, especially the annoying vampire / drug addict woman. The vampire woman is simply not scary or sexy. Rather, it looks like an anorexic girl of 14 years old, no wonder she is so desperate for blood at that time. Another big problem is that everything is simply "too bright". There is no atmosphere or feeling of fear. I know that the first Vampires that settled in New Mexico were not exactly the twilight zone in terms of chills, but they still managed to be dark and foreboding when necessary. This movie does not have that tension. <br /> <br /> The story is basically the same as before. The vampire wants the Berzier cross to be able to walk in the light of day. However, the story has less interesting parts this time. There is no surprise factor to know that this is the teacher of all the masters, the original vampire, as in the first movie. You really do not care who or what this is. There is no army of masters. Instead, it hides in an old ruin that looks more like a Disneyland attraction than a spooky temple. <br /> <br /> So there you have it really. Lack of scares, lack of environment, lack of interesting history. A real disappointment to me personally.
