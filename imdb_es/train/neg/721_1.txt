This movie has several key flaws. The first and most significant of which is the clear lack of a good plot! Unfortunately, this makes the film not only difficult to see, but also sends the viewer certain feelings of hopelessness, as if he were wasting valuable time in his short life. This means that the film can not captivate its audience, instead, it encourages the public to see the contempt for the film and everything related to it! In short, it's really very, very, very, very, very bad! Do yourself a favor and chew a big rubber shoe, you'll find it much more interesting and fun than watching Terminator Woman.
