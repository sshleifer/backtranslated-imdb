Broad enough for you? Wait until you see this hard-hand adaptation <br /> <br /> of a small one-act collegiate. What is surprising and wild in college rarely holds up over time, and this is a test. To face the Catholic Church <br /> <br /> with a great sense of humor, it is simply not surprising or interesting or funny, it is a bit boring. The interpreters are all a game <br /> <br />, they give everything they have, but it is basically a work that does not open to film well. It's not very fun
