If this is supposed to be the black experience, let me go out the front or back door. <br /> <br /> A mom boy one day sees two young hoods passing by and since then everything is downhill for him. . Angela Bassett, the only one who shines in this movie, plays her overprotective religious and protective mother. Despite her anger at the way her life has become, in the middle of the image, she really decides to accept this. She allows her friends to enter and, suddenly, it is okay to use desecration as long as she is not in front of the children. <br /> <br /> This is a sad state of affairs with regard to gangster rap. You knew where this movie was going. <br /> <br /> Literally, I laughed out loud when at the end, when Bassett accompanied his son's body to the funeral, she states that although his life had been interrupted at age 24, he had become a man . What a man? He had been a convicted felon, he wrote the most atrocious rap music with constant vulgarity and despised society. That scene in the classroom where he tells a teacher that as a sanitation worker, will earn more than the teacher, is a perfect example of what happens in our schools. The total and absolute lack of respect for the teacher. <br /> <br /> The rivalry of gang rap on the east coast and west coast is never fully explained. All we see are burning weapons. <br /> <br /> A terrible image that does nothing to prevent gang violence. What horrible models are these rap singers and their disgusting music? The African-American community should feel offended by their own being. Who was this fat, classless guy who represented Biggie? It made Rerun of the old television show look slim in comparison. I know it was the streets of Bedford Stuyvesant that turned this little chubby into the vulgar monster that he was. What a sorry state of affairs when this is called cinematic entertainment.
