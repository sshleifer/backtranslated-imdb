I've never been a big fan of Mormon movies. Being a Mormon, I always felt that the humor was too exclusive for the LDS community and made us look like a lot of obsessive crazy people. I expected this to be a breath of fresh air, the Halestorm movie that I could finally discuss with my non-Mormon friends. <br /> <br /> Boy, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> I thought, since this had talents from list B like Clint Howard, Gary Coleman, Andrew Wilson and Fred Willard (one of my favorites), this would have to be at least a little funny. And, in addition, church basketball is full of possibilities for many fun gags and so on. But I must say that, throughout the whole movie, it seemed that no one knew what they were doing. All the jokes were discouraged, and all the opportunities for a genuinely amusing gag were ignored. The dialogue was bland, and the film had one of the worst character developments I've ever seen. All the characters, except Wilson's, were less than one-dimensional. It is hard to believe that after the nine rewrites, the film was still as stagnant as the train crash I witnessed. I can not put into words the anger I felt when going through this. My friends and I were extras in the final scene of the game, so we went to the premiere in Washington City, UT. Kurt Hale, the director, was there, and I must say that I avoided all contact with him after the show. He waited at the door, seemingly ready to receive comments. I did not dare to tell him that his film not only started a good hour and a half of my life, but left an unpleasant and painful scar that I will never forget. <br /> <br /> Here are some specific problems I had: there was a minor love story secondary plot between the janitor and the chubby pianist, but these two characters came out of nowhere, and it was impossible to worry, so my Friends and I constantly wondered why they were supposed to worry about these two lame and uninteresting characters. There were many secondary plots that appeared from time to time, each of which promised the public the possibility of laughing, but each one came and went in a puff of smoke, which ended before you could begin to worry. That was almost how the whole movie felt. <br /> <br /> This movie was a big disappointment, and I feel bad for everyone who expects the first really fun Mormon movie. It is true that the jokes in this are not too exclusive for Mormons. On the other hand, it is difficult to say what was a joke and what was a strong ringing sensation in my ears. <br /> <br /> Please, DO NOT watch this movie. Keep in mind the fantasy that this movie is hilarious. Save yourself the disappointment I suffered.
