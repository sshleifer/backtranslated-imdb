This is, apparently, a movie about multiple pain. As such, it should move viewers and make them empathetic with the difficult situation of the main characters. However, his annoyingly postmodern style makes it almost incomprehensible. The camera continuously changes from one scene to another, from one personal crisis to the next, creating a messy and messy effect. Most of the characters seem to live lives without direction and without structure, united by their professional commitments. (It also extends the credibility that a man who has been given what amounts to a probable death sentence, would indulge in a sexual adventure with a woman he has just met). The plot (if there is a plot) is difficult to follow. In summary, the overall effect is quite disappointing. Despite all that, the acting is generally good and some of the scenes are quite powerful.
