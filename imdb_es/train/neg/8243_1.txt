The word in the summary summarizes it d'oh;) Five girls get lost trying to find their way home, when they stop at a store to get directions, they hit a parked car, they burn a lighthouse, they filter into the scene . of getting into trouble, but suddenly they see a lighthouse behind them (ooooh). <br /> <br /> From there everything is screaming, crying and violence when they try to get away from this crazy person who lost it because of a lighthouse;), well, the scream and the crying are practically maintained throughout the film (very annoying) The film is shot, with a cheap camera that tries to look "real" or "shocking", I guess, it's just shameful and even useless For lack of something better to compare it with "Blair's witch style". <br /> <br /> The scream and crying of almost the whole movie with a horrible sound was too annoying, literally your head hurts :) <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but this was not scary, just an annoying and painful movie of garbage.
