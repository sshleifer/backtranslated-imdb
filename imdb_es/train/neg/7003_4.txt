(Also known as: TRINITY TO TO YES MY NAME) This sequel seems to be made to capitalize on the extraordinary box office success in Europe of THE CALL ME TRINITY, only this time Joseph E. Levine and Avco-Embassy photos wanted to capitalize it in America as well. Too bad they did not get very far, since the Hill / Spencer images have only had marginal success here in the US.

Then they get involved with arms dealers who smuggle weapons out of a monastery and mistakenly believe they are a pair of federal agents. All this ends up falling flat despite a couple of funny scenes, especially in which Trinity and Bambino are in an elegant French restaurant and do not know how to behave.

It seems that a lot of landscapes are being chewed here. In fact, I lost interest in him about 2/3 of the way. The DVD is also terrible, with a constant buzz in the soundtrack and a poor impression that looks like it should have been sent to that big scrap heap in the sky. <br /> <br /> A big step down from the previous movie. . <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
