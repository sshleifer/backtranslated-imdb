I have to admit that Over Her Dead Body was not really as bad as I expected, my mother wanted to see it, so I rented it. I thought just to keep going and see the horror before my eyes, but in reality this was not so bad. I was waiting for this horrible movie, but it seems that the writers did not want to hurt, but the casting of Eva Longoria (Parker, I'm sorry), seems a bit out of place for the movie. I think I could have found him a little better without her, only that she bothers me. But Paul Rudd and Lake Bell had a decent chemistry that made the movie pleasant. But you have to admit that this movie did not make sense, it was one of those quick checks for the type of actor. The movie could have been more fun if someone really paid attention and had a better cast. <br /> <br /> Henry has just lost his girlfriend, Kate, who was killed by an ice sculpture on her wedding day. . But when her sister takes him to a psychic, Ashley, Henry falls in love with her, but Kate pursues her from beyond the grave. Kate is jealous and does not want Henry to move so fast and will make sure that Ashley does not catch him torturing her day and night with her walks, believe me, with Kate's voice, that's scary. <br /> <br /> Over Her Dead Body is a good movie, I'm not sure if it's worth it, but I'd give it a rent if you want to see it or if you're curious. Eva Longoria does not have enough star power to make the movie work, without offending those who love her, she only belongs to the small screen on the silver screen. Not to mention Ashley's character, it seems he's still not very nice with everything he pulls out, or his "gay" friend, Dan, just that again, it's not really nice. With just a bit of rewriting and proper attention, this movie could have been better, but instead we get the average predictable romantic comedy that will leave with an empty feeling. <br /> <br /> 4/10
