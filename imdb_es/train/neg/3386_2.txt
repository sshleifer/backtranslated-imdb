Yes, I was lucky enough to see the long original production of Michael Bennett's hit musical. It was an incredible experience and I paid to see the movie when it hit theaters in 1985. It's horrible. Almost everything fails. In the first place, Attenborough (a good actor, a good director with the right material) is a regrettable choice, almost as bad as when John Huston was hired to destroy ANNIE. The camera is always in the wrong place: they cut the songs and the CASTING! They are horrible. The power of the work was that of these dancers. These hungry and talented artists just wanted an opportunity to show what they could do and, when they had the chance, they could not take their eyes off of them. But this cast just starts dancing, does a "good" job singing but none of them shines a little. In fact, look for the cast in IMDb, none of them really did much. (OK, OK, Janet Jones married Gretzky - sheesh). So this train of the cinema train does not capture for a second the magic, the desperation, the passion of the musical stage. A total punch! (But even though they try to stifle the music, good music still gets up sometimes and reminds people how great the score was).
