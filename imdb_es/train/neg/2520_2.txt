OK, this movie had a terrible premise. Seriously, according to the movie that had just gone through an apocalyptic war, they still have money to buy huge robots and confront each other. Each country decides, instead of investing in rebuilding their country, they would prefer to fight with robots that nobody could afford. Here is a better idea, let's trust our most inept resource, the athletes, to fight our battles. <br /> <br /> Everyone says what about the director, what about him. He makes a good movie, he makes a bad movie. There's no reason to give this film a little credit just for the director, maybe he was asleep? I really enjoyed this movie, because it was so cheesy and ridiculous that I had to laugh. I really had a good time seeing him, well, except for the cowboy mentor who turned out to be a murderer (trust me, nobody would see this man as a murderer, so it's a surprise, however rare). What kind of training exercise? is? A jungle jungle anyway. I was sad to see that Mst3k had not done this. However, I have a two-star rating because nothing could be as bad as "lucky hands". <br /> <br /> The budget does not matter either, I've seen many reasonable movies that do not have anything for budgets like the cube The story was not even plausible and I've seen better performances in school plays. Surely they could have paid an eleven-year-old boy for any work in the middle school. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's a fun movie to watch.
