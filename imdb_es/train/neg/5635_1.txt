I also like Dafoe as an actor, but I wasted a few hours of my life watching this movie, I still can not believe I could see it in its entirety. Was there really a point in the movie? And the ending, well, I'm glad I've never paid to see this horrible and mindless pathetic excuse of a movie! <br /> <br /> I'm not sure without unraveling the facts but, is Dafoe married or is he seeing the horrible actress of this movie in real life? If so, was it an attempt to start your career? If I am afraid that I have failed ... <br /> <br /> I publish it with the hope that I can really put someone out of watching this movie, even if a person pays attention to my comments and decides that they would rather see how the paint dries, I will feel that I have done something good in the world, if only I had had the same Advice ...
