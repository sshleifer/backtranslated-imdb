Incredibly bad acting, a story not good, unclear, flashy images and slow movements where they are most needed: adrenaline is everything a movie should not be. <br /> <br /> Georgina Verbaan (such and such a Dutch soap actress who has not attended her English classes) plays the rich Freya, who has the habit of "looking for emotions". What basically is doing dangerous tricks, breaking things and annoying people. And not in a funny way Jackass. Then there is Dracko (Rivas). He leads the group a bit, but has other illegal activities on the side. Then there is Freya's father (Lockyer), who also plays a dubious role. And, in the end, we have Jason (the debutant Fyall), Freya's boyfriend. <br /> <br /> One day, Freya disappears and everyone seems involved, but we, the viewer, do not really care as much as anyone. The cast is nice or credible, and the story does not make any sense. <br /> <br /> Why was this even done? 2/10.
