Much has been written about Purple Rain, the apparent bio film of the "quin-essential" musician, however, I am here to tell you that the film does not deserve its great praise. <br /> <br /> First of all, let's see One thing is that Prince is a great musician and music is the area where Purple Rain stands out. Even the score is fascinating, and if it were shot alone as a concert movie, it would be a great experience, unfortunately it is not, and as such, the film has some problems. <br /> <br /> First of all it is the horrible acting / writing, it is assumed that Prince's character, "The Kid", appears as a mysterious type of a few words, unfortunately this only appears as cheesy and incensero. A good lonely character must have at least some moments of conversation, unfortunately Prince's character rarely has more than a few words of dialogue in the film and it's hard to believe that he would take care of the girl in this way. Everything seems a little strange here, which is a shame because you can say that this is a character who is terribly in conflict and lives a very complicated life, but we are never allowed to enter. <br /> <br /> A surprising aspect of this movie is how much of this takes place in concert. The lives of Prince and Morris seem to be in the background of the performances here, which I think makes sense from a business perspective, but it's exhausting to have a 2-hour movie in which apparently half takes place on stage, especially when the stories of the characters become fashionable. set aside for it. <br /> <br /> So to summarize: this is not a very good movie.
