Along with 2 days in the valley, I think this is one of the worst movies I've seen. Just another of Tarantino's long line of scams that have emerged from Pulp Fiction. The atmosphere created by the film is fun for the first five minutes, but then the filmmakers make the unforgivable mistake of allowing unnecessary and grotesque violence to raise the "modern" coefficient. You'd better skip this one.
