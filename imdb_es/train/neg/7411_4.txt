An interesting idea that implies an alternative dimension within a hospital. He recalled: Stephen Kings "Langoliers", "Kingdom Hospital" and old episodes of penumbra areas. Atmosically strong, the configuration was excellent. There were also some very smart "time loop" moments that always have that melting head appeal. The story had many vague references that led me to believe that it would explain all the rarity resulting from: slips / ghosts / a strange demon with bat wings and a ghoul in heavy metal attire rather silly. AND THAT was the Dark Floors that disappointed me severely. According to my visualization, the film DOES NOT EXPLAIN what is behind the events. Although, it is always expected / receives some ambiguity in this type of movies. The dark floors took him to new heights of vagueness. I do not expect things to be wrapped up in a beautiful film, but I should not leave feeling "Eh? ... Is that? ... I dosed myself? Maybe, I hit the chapter omit by mistake?" Dark Floors left me with a deeply unsatisfactory suspicion that "everything was a dream", which is a shame because every last roll was very on board and enjoying the movie.
