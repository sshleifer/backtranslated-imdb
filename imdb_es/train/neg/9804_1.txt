Power Rangers, the children's television program of the 1990s commercialization, has to be the most absurd and ridiculous television show ever created. <br /> <br /> What exactly is the objective of this program? To qualify children without plastic sense? There is nothing remotely remotely or interesting in this show in any way. <br /> <br /> Look at the disguises, which look like spandex that have been spoiled. <br /> <br /> The hair, the earrings and the style of red mullet. The fashion of the early 90's looks completely ridiculous these days. <br /> <br /> Avoid this show at all costs!
