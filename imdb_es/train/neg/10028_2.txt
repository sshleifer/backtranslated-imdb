I had high expectations of this film and even more because it was a Yashraj movie. <br /> <br /> Jimmy operates a call center and one day he is invited by Pooja Singh to teach his boss, Lakhan Singh, English. The two fall in love and decide to flee, but Pooja tells Jimmy that he can not do this because he owes a debt to Lakhan Singh, who is also known as Bhaiyyaji. But they decide and they rob him money, and only in that moment Jimmy discovers that Bhaiyyaji / Lakhan Singh is a Don. Meanwhile, Bhaiyyaji hires a man, Bachchan Pandey, to locate Jimmy and Pooja. <br /> <br /> Starring Saif Ali Khan, Kareena Kapoor, Anil Kapoor and Akshaye Kumar, the film is directed by the first director Viay Krishna Acharya and is produced by Aditya Chopra and Yash Chopra. <br /> <br /> "Tashan" has to be one of the worst movies I've seen. Yes! The scenery is good and Kareena Kapoor (and her much publicized weight loss) looks good. But the plot is extremely scarce in history and, sometimes, it makes no sense from one scene to another. Hence, I said at the beginning that I expected more from this film since it was a Yashraj production. Unfortunately, with respect to the songs there is not a song that I can remember now. <br /> <br /> There are times when one can laugh and that is mainly thanks to Akshaye Kumar and Saif could definitely have done better while Kareena Kapoor did her part well. But this can not be said of Anil Kapoor, since it was not suitable for him as a villain. Finally, it does not matter Aditya Chopra, who in the past has produced and directed good films like "Mohabbatein", what was Yash Chopra doing when producing such a trash movie? <br /> <br /> Conclusion: bad movie, it's not worth wasting your time and that's my first and last impression.
