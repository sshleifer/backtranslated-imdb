I watched this movie mainly to see Brooke Burke (as Jill), whom I met briefly in Los Angeles at a model show, in her first feature film. I expected to see more of her, but I thought that she did very well interpreting her role. Since she is a television presenter and model so beautiful and prepared, it was not surprising. I kept wondering why she was killed and what happened as a result. Maybe I just missed it. <br /> <br /> I was not sure about the genre of this movie, and although I liked the actors, I felt it was for a university audience. I tried to keep an open mind considering that horror was not my favorite genre, but I felt that I had overcome the gags. It seems to be lengthening in some places, it lets you guess in some places about the powers that the evil teacher had and, like many other films, had an unsatisfactory end. <br /> <br /> Having written a couple of scripts I know that a lot of this is difficult and may be due to personal opinions, how many movies you have seen and studied and with which you are related at a particular time. <br /> <br /> In a few words, I found it interesting, but it is not a satisfactory plot and it ends for me. If Jill (Brooke Burke) had come back through the portal at the end and kicked everyone's butt, it would be a satisfying ending and she would get a higher rating.
