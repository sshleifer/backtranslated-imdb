This is an abysmal piece of storytelling. He spends about an hour in the movie before we have much idea of ​​what he's supposed to be about; the characters often murmur inaudibly; Actions often seem unrelated to each other; nobody seems to worry about who really murdered the girl; a couple of spooky children go swimming in waters that seem threatening but nothing happens; The Irishman gets punched in the face by one of his friends for no apparent reason ... to continue would be as boring as the film itself. The only entertaining medium is landscape photography; but anyone can point a camera to the Australian interior to get memorable shots. In general - sad, incoherent, pretentious - and downright upset about losing so much of the viewer's time.
