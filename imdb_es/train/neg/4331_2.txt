Shortly after watching this movie, you will realize why it did not even reach the theaters! This movie does not deserve the "prequel" label. Instead, this is a common theme in Hollywood, starting previously good movies with disastrous prequels, sequels, etc. <br /> <br /> The plot of this movie bounced everywhere like a ping pong ball, and the development of the character was nonexistent. I seriously felt that I was watching a comedy at some points in the movie because the acting was very bad. P Diddy needs to stop staining the movies with his horrible acting, he actually made me laugh every time. <br /> <br /> The only good thing that comes out of this movie is Jaclyn DeSantis, who looks excellent in this movie and actually I really liked watching this movie. <br /> <br /> If you are a big fan of Carlito's Way, I recommend you do not see this. If you decide to see her anyway, treat this movie as if it were a copy of the original, because that's exactly what she did.
