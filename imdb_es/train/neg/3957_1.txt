The original Boogeyman was a silly but entertaining supernatural movie slasher. It was not in any way a great movie, but fun in the right mood. The third installment of this series, Return of the Boogeyman, on the other hand, is simply atrocious. It consists of two things. First, new cheap and lifeless images. Second, recycled bit LOADS from the first movie. The new material is incredibly amateur, but not in a funny and inept way, just incredibly tedious. These images clearly have come together quickly and without any effort. It serves as a framing device for the endless clips of the first films (and possibly the second ones). And boy, do you milk those clips from the previous movies? Sometimes reusing sequences over and over again. The only new addition to these parts is a voice that describes without meaning exactly what we can see with our own eyes. The whole experience of seeing this is really amazing. <br /> <br /> Return of the Boogeyman is an example of the worst type of exploitation film; The kind that exploits the audience in a highly cynical way. I want to keep this review brief and to the point because this movie does not deserve more. Here there is nothing of value at all. This is not worth anything.
