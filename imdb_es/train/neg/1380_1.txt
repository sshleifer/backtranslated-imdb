This was the worst movie I saw in WorldFest and it also received the least amount of applause afterwards! I can only think that he is receiving such recognition based on the number of actors known in the film. It's great to see J. Beals, but he's only in the movie for a few minutes. M. Parker is a much better actress than the allowed party. The rest of the performance is difficult to judge because the movie is so ridiculous and predictable. The main character is totally unfriendly and therefore a bore to watch. There is no true emotional depth in the story. A film that revolves around an actor who can not get a job does not seem very original to me. Neither the development of the police. It feels like one of the many direct video movies I saw in the 90s ... And not even a good one in those standards. <br /> <br />
