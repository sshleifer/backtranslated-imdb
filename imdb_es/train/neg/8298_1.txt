This movie was not very entertaining, certainly NOT WHERE it was as original or as good as A Christmas Story. The characters (except the youngest ones) try to emulate the previous actors and fail. Hillbilly neighbors come out of nowhere because they were not part of the first movie. This really stunk, could have been good with the original cast, so maybe not because the story is so weak. Skip it.
