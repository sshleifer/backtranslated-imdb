This documentary begins with an interesting premise: it presents an intriguing and convincing argument that the story of Jesus, as is commonly believed, is probably a myth. Unfortunately, however, after getting ready with this, the film completely changes course and becomes little more than a continuous attack on Christianity, and focuses on easy goals. <br /> <br /> The writer / director clearly has some problems with the Church (he is an old evangelical Christian and has a legitimate anger) and this film seems to be his way of liberation. It would be interesting to see the first 20 minutes expanded, but in general, the movie is disappointing.
