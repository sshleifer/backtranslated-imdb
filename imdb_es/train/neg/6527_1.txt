Surely no morning television program on Saturday mornings was so bad. After all, those producers had to count on the audience returning. Well, in this horrible offer, they could at least count the money they saved in games. The script could have been a rejection of a long-forgotten space opera series, with some elegant lines added for Gerald Mohr to murmur to Naura Hayden. No director could have done something decent with such a crazy story, so the action continues to advance openly. The accessories of the spaceship are absurd, for example, a Bulova wall clock and a portable typewriter, but the sets of planets have to be some of the worst in film history. Most are crude drawings, and everything is bathed in a red light that is often poorly focused. Even Mohr's bare hairy chest is used as a support. And it's a bad one, as thin as the plot. Any spectator who can reach the end of this movie will hear a message from the Martians, and will probably agree completely!
