I'm not sure why I clicked on "contains spoiler", because honestly there is not enough explanation in the movie to know what is supposed to be happening to spoil it. <br /> <br /> Visually it is delivered mostly. Well, apart from some monsters in the 80's backstroke rubber mask. Now I'll say that before seeing this, I had never seen the band Lordi, nor did I know anything about them in the bar that they won Eurovision. Apparently the monsters in this are members of the band, more or less in their stage characters. Whatever is. Anyway, I did not know this while watching. I just thought that the monsters / demons were mostly passable. Almost. <br /> <br /> I'm pretty sure there's a semi-coherent explanation behind what we see on the screen, but it's actually better not to know. It probably would have been incredibly lame to have thought about it. The action keeps going pretty well to keep the viewer mostly entertained, even if half the entertainment factor is joking about what is supposed to be happening exactly in this movie. <br /> <br /> I gave him a four Mainly because I started laughing, especially for how he explains almost nothing. It must have been the mood she was in, but I thought that hella was funny for some reason. Then I look for the movie on the Internet and discover that NO ONE knows what the hell it is supposed to be. That amused me even more, and I raised my half point score to an additional 4/10. <br /> <br /> It is not scary, nor particularly coherent, but it is quite good visual and sound. In general, far from being essential, but observable. Do not wait too long and do not expect it to make sense and you could entertain it if you are in the right frame of mind.
