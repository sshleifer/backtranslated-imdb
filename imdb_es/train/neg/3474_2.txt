This thing is horrible. The character of Ben Affleck is self-centered and blithely sadistic: sadist fratboy on the nose. And he is the romantic HERO! Your cartoon character does not change from start to finish, but your money ultimately allows you to buy happiness. <br /> <br /> If I were a socialist, I would not mind believing it, but I am not a socialist. <br /> <br /> We capitalists like a little Christmas magic from time to time. This is not magic. I do not know what it is It's just horrible. And it's a horrible waste of talent. O'Hara has made me laugh hysterically since the late seventies. Gandolfini Applegate. These people were underutilized. If Ben was out of the equation, these people could have imagined something excellent.
