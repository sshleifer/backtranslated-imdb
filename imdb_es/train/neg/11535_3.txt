Gillian Anderson is an arrogant career woman who picks up the working class Danny Dyer for a night of fun. After a stupid accident in the field, they are brutally attacked. After recovering, and after a chance meeting with one of the attackers, his thoughts focused on that of revenge ... <br /> <br /> I thought "straight heads" was terrible. Violent, brutal, misogynistic and unpleasant. If I did not dislike the phrase a lot, I would call "Straightheads" an unpleasant video. Certainly, it was the kind of movie that would have had a release without a budget directly to the video during the dark days of the eighties. Frankly, I do not know how "Straightheads" got a premiere at the cinema. <br /> <br /> I'm not an idiot. I do not care about sex and violence in movies, but they have to be married to a movie with a) a good plot or b) a good characterization or c) preferably both. The "straight heads" did not have any. There is no progression in the plot or the characters and there is much left without explaining and without saying. Luckily "Straightheads" did not go anywhere fast. It was only 80 minutes long. <br /> <br /> It was a shame, because here was the germ of an interesting movie, with an especially interesting twist in the plot of the last third. How often do I say this, but could it have been good if it had been done correctly? What a pity. I really like Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer, but they were not hiding with this movie. She, especially, is very underestimated (and is still fit). <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a good British revenge movie, rent or buy "Dead Man's Shoes" by Shane Meadows. It is a small masterpiece. Last weekend he should have seen his "This Is England" instead. Ce sera sera ...
