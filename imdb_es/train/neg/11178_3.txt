First of all, I must admit that it is not a good movie. And, I would never see this movie if Pacino was not in it. <br /> <br /> The film is about the strange 24 hours of a publicist. And he is overworked, dizzy, sick, and sometimes repentant. I do not do it. I really like the character. It's really boring, after 20 minutes you can fall asleep. And I do not understand why Pacino wanted to be part of this horrible movie. Only for money or why? <br /> <br /> Since I am an avid Pacino fan, I bought this 2002 film, People I Know. If you have not bought it yet, do not even think about it, it's just a waste of time.
