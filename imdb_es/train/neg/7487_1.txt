Unfortunately, this movie is so bad. The original of Out of Towners was manic and very funny, of course they used the script written by Neil Simon. For some reason, the script by Neil Simons is not used in this movie, so it falls flat again and again. Even the audience I was with never laughed. The direction is very slow and tedious and, when there is a joke, it is given away for what the joke dies, that is, the couple who have sex in the park. They announce that it is a lighting ceremony for New York, we all know that the lights will turn on and we will see Goldie and Steve doing a little slap in the face. The whole movie ends up being like that ... a joke is configured and given away. Why is Goldies hair not even messed up in the movie? You will also notice every close-up of Goldie (they use a very intense soft lens). I suggest you rent the original with Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis, that's if you want to laugh.
