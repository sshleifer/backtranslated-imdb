In a recent biography of Alec Guinness I could not find much about To Paris With Love. I'm sure Guinness made the movie to get a free trip to Paris. The movie has no other reason for existence. <br /> <br /> Paris, of course, is very well photographed with the wonderful opening of Guinness and his son driving through the Champs Elysees with the Arc de Triomphe in the background. Unfortunately, it goes downhill from there. <br /> <br /> There is simply no chemistry between Guinness and the young woman with whom he has a brief adventure in Paris. According to the recent biography of Guinness by Piers Paul Read, Guinness did not like the girl, considered that his behavior was not professional. As for what Odile Vernois thought of his co-star, there is no record available. They have as much chemistry as two castrated cats. <br /> <br /> Guinness has a good time in the film, which was straight out of one of his Ealing comedies when he climbs a tree trying to recover a badminton shuttlecock. But I would not wait through the movie. <br /> <br /> At least Alec got a trip to Paris out of the deal.
