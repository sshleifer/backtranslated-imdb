Clearly the ringu of Hideo Nakata (Ring, 1998) and Hongurai Mizu no Soko Kara (Dark Water, 2002), with touches of Ju-On (The Grudge, 2000), but gore atrociously made (a green corpse with red eyes) !?) weak story, and a weak theme (I find it very difficult to find a scary picture message). There were two moments in this movie that made me shudder, both with an unexpected hand, and after that Oodishon (another one by Miike Takashi, this one from 1999) made me feel tingly for hours after seeing her, and all the movies she steals from I really scared, I can not see this movie as anything more than a sale to the western popularity of the great Japanese horror movies. Two out of ten.
