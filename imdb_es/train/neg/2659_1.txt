I'm sorry but this is just horrible. I've told people about this movie and some of the bad performances in it and they almost do not believe me. There is nothing wrong with the idea, the modern Japanese troops retire in time to the days of the Busido warriors and with their modern weapons they are a competition for almost everything. When the troops realize for the first time that something strange is happening, do all the people in the back of the transport say, "Hey, my watch has stopped"? Imagine that lines like that are repeated more than 15 times before they say something else and you have the lack of greatness of the film in a few words.
