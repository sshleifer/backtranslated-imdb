Jared Diamond pointed out in the first episode that other peoples of the world had no animals to tame, but Europeans did, and that explains why we could make steel and invent complex machines. <br /> <br /> But then, in the third episode, he says that when Europeans in South Africa came too far north, they encountered Zulu people and other tribes who "harassed cattle and sowed crops." So, what explains their lack of technological, economic and artistic achievements if they had the key things that the author says are necessary for success? <br /> <br /> Diamond also claims germs in the form of smallpox (brought to North America by black slaves) were our biggest weapon. Well, if 150 Europeans can defeat 20,000 native warriors and 400 non-military South Africans can defeat 10,000 Zulus * without a single victim * in any case, then I think you should conclude that the germs are irrelevant. With or without germs, we were going to succeed. <br /> <br /> He says that malaria prevented Europeans from colonizing the north, killing "thousands" of Europeans without affecting Africans. (I would like to know the real numbers, but he does not say it). Then, in the end, he says that today malaria is killing thousands of Africans and that is why they can not reach us. So, what is it, Jared? Did malaria help Africans by stopping Europeans or hurting them? And how is it that Europe was well despite the massive plagues throughout our history? <br /> <br /> He also seems too eager to say that the reasons Europeans were successful were due to bad luck. At a time when the evidence threatens to overwhelm his theories, he is reluctant to admit that maybe the Europeans were successful because they worked for it. It is sad to see this obvious neo-Marxist contort reality to try to prove his point.
