Terrible movie with Frank Sinatra as Tony Roma. Here, he gets involved with a dead woman under the sea. <br /> <br /> Roma is hired soon to find out what happened to a woman. Naturally, it is the woman under the sea. His roommate, Lainie Kazan, soon ends up dead on the floor. <br /> <br /> An old Richard Conte plays a police officer and friend of Rome. When the owner of a local club dies, the fault falls on Rome and there it becomes an interesting scene of persecution. That's how bad this image is if you have to rely on a chase scene to provide the action. <br /> <br /> Raquel Welch interprets beauty up to her neck with intrigue. His performance has much to be desired. <br /> <br /> Martin Gabel is a retired young man whose son is trying to get over it. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, you do not know why the girl was murdered. Do not even bother asking.
