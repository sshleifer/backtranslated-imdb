This is a terrible production of Bartleby, although not, as the other critic said because it is "impossible to filter", but because this version does not maintain the spirit of the book. Tell the story, almost painfully. Seeing it, I could turn the pages of my book and follow it, which is not so much fun when it comes to an adaptation. Rather, see the 2001 version of Bartleby with Crispin Glover. That version, although fun, brings new details to the film while maintaining the spirit of the novel. The important thing is the spirit, not the minutiae of things like the stage, the names of the characters and the costumes. The difference between these movie versions is like night and day, tedious and hilarious. This version is a lesson about what can go wrong if an adaptation is mishandled, painful and disorienting.
