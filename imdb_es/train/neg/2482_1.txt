(Spoilers in abundance) This is an absolutely horrible movie. First of all, he has that kind of medium. I guess he made a career playing super-loving dads. It was fine the first time he tried to scare his son by pretending to be a monster ... but then 10 minutes later they did it again! And that's right, this movie moves in an unbearable time in real time. In a moment, I started taking pictures and it was days later, until they reminded me that the story was only the next day ... even in the afternoon! I'm not really sure who this couple is in real life. First, they present themselves as a kind of yuppie couple from Manhattan who grew up and had a son. But they drive an old blue Volvo. Those guys stopped driving Volvos decades ago. Today the Priuses are driving. But in 2002, I'm sure they still did not drive Volvos. <br /> <br /> Well, then there's Wendigo. A "mysterious Indian man" gives the boy a small magical statue of Wendigo and tells him of his powerful magic. Come on ... we keep making ancient Indian mysteries. Just to take it home, they go through every Indian statue in its tourist trap in New York City. American Indians are portrayed in a way not seen in decades in this movie! Oh, and about Wendigo. He is not really the cause of horror. It does not kill the father of the child, which is the most horrible thing in the film ... he was just killed by a common cane with rancor and a powerful rifle. The Wendigo only comes out at the end of the movie to avenge the man who killed the father ... oh, but wait, it seemed earlier that Wendigo was a little angry at the father, maybe because he killed a deer ... then Wendigo must have been happy that the father was murdered ... but ... <br /> <br /> And so it is ... insulting, boring and meaningless. There is no reason to see this movie at all.
