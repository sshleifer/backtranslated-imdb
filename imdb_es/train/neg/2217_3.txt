As the fake Russian scientist says two-thirds of the way to the movie, "I came for science". This pretty much sums up the reason why I watched this movie: anything involving a half-man, half-hammer shark definitely deserves serious empirical research from an aspiring impartial scientist. Or, as they say in the business, my girlfriend's brother had the remote control and the rest is history. To say that special effects were bad would be a detriment to the field of special effects. This is 2005, it is not that difficult to shoot a car scene without a cheesy blue wallpaper. Yes, this was charming and avant-garde when Hitchcock was filming "The Birds", but in 2005 it seems a low budget. Save me the cheap Sci-Fi try and give me the service to really try the will to suspend disbelief. <br /> <br /> However, having seriously defamed the overall concept of this film, let me tell you again, sad as it may seem, it's probably worth your time. If nothing else, it's a tour de force of bad science fiction: it's worth the education for the new movie buff and certainly deserves a refresher course for those who have seen some movies in their day. <br /> <br /> The crazy scientist who has a hunchback and a hammerhead transceiver who thinks it's a good idea to pour blood cans in the nearby water makes me question not only the intelligence of humanity, but also the ability of "B" movie writers to devise remotely plausible story lines. <br /> <br /> This movie also pretty much fulfills one of my long-running bad races: bad guys always wear sunglasses. <br /> <br /> If this were not 2005, I would. There is no doubt that this movie was an incredibly poor metaphor for the Cold War. I mean, you could also have Khan on the bridge of a Klingon bird of prey inserting leachate into Chekhov's ear. <br /> <br /> One of the most moving lines of the film is when the girl without the bra insists that Charlton Heston looks "wait for Tom" while trying to lift the escape helicopter off the ground. The point is that Tom is wasting guys in sunglasses with his endless banana clip tied to his Kalashnikov, or AK-47, in simple terms. <br /> <br /> As the mad scientist says near the end of the film, "my goal is to evolve the human species", suffice it to say that this film contributed only to the return of humanity. The weak Freudian references uttered by the mad scientist as he prepared the protagonist to mate with a hammerhead shark are a simple reminder that even in the worst of science fiction we can all find something to laugh at.
