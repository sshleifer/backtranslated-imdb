I'm so insulted by this movie, it's not even funny ... And I thought "Mulan" was amazing! As low as my Disney expectations are, I never thought they would do something so stereotyped but so dull. Here there is no respect for the true Chinese culture, only the Hollywood tradition of random martial arts. <br /> <br /> I appreciate that they tried to make Wendy a normal teenager ... But, fortunately, most of the time. Teenagers, especially Asian girls, are much less obsessed with such superficial aspects of life. And from a cultural point of view, it is almost impossible. Yes, there are girls who are involved in popularity and fashion, but they are quite rare. And even those who are still quite decent scholars. Another stereotype, perhaps, but quite true. Because that's how Chinese parents work. This is how Chinese values ​​work. If they wanted to use authenticity, they would have made Wendy an ironic girl with glasses and a relationship of love and hate with her family. <br /> <br /> This adds to my frustration with American movies. Asian culture is not about meditation and vague, nature-oriented phrases that sound sensible. We do not walk smiling enigmatically all the time, and not all of us know any form of martial arts. We are a PEOPLE, and I would appreciate it if someone wrote an Asian part that does not describe us as a sad caricature.
