I grew up watching the original television series in the sixties and one thing I can tell you immediately, there is NO comparison. This movie was totally ridiculous with a flying suit that was alive. A Martian who took different forms. Special effects that looked like something a small child would create. In contrast, in the original, the characters developed and the viewers developed a feeling for Tim and Uncle Martin. The only highlight in this movie, yes, there actually was one, happened when Ray Walston finally made his appearance at the end. He used dark glasses and referred to live on this planet for 30 years as a kind of tribute to the television series. But even the real Uncle Martin could not save this turkey.
