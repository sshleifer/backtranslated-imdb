Brief summary: This film discourages everyone it touches. That means you. <br /> <br /> First of all, let me tell you that I am not a purist, and this could have been fun for a few minutes. The imitations are not bad. But in general it is boring and unbearably not funny. Some simple jokes are repeated over and over again. <br /> <br /> It is clear that these films only exist to squeeze the last dollars of Laurel and Hardy. Producers can not have any real respect for their place in film history, or their talents. This is what most offended me. <br /> <br /> Of course, my daughter liked it, so I'm also a failure as a parent;)
