The time spent watching this movie was a waste of time. I do not dislike science fiction. I do not reject any gender per se, since you can do a good job in any genre. This movie, however, is not a good job. I can not criticize the images (when I did not involve alien makeup), and the special effects are impressive. The story was not bad at all, for a trekkish comic. But the FX visual effects were obviously where all the creators of interest / attention / money were. The direction alternated between slow and confused (one was not quite sure who was doing what and with whom and to whom at least one crucial juncture). The "performance" was mostly very bad indeed. There was no basis for most of the line readings in addition to a hint of "It was like that on the page and the director told me that he was supposed to be crazy / sad / scared / whatever." Okay, so it was a SF series driver: Since when is that an excuse for bad quality correctable in areas when it should be considered essential for a dramatic medium? I am surprised that the pilot has sold the series, or is the money also in the hands of technicians?
