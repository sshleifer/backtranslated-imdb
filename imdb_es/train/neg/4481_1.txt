I was skeptical when I first saw Calvin Kline's commercials, but I thought I would give him a chance. So I've seen it, and all I can say is bleh. This movie was so bad. It's weird that I hate a movie so much. Seeing this movie reminded me of those funny scenes in Altman's "The Player", when the writers throw their strange ideas at the producers. I'd like to know which MTV producer decided that an hour and a half of adapting the Bronte music video (but this time Heathcliff's name is Heath and he's a rock star, and that Hindley's is Hendrix) would be a good idea . /> <br /> Even that might not have been so bad, if all the other aspects of the film had not been misinterpreted. The address must have been "you're alone, puchero for me". I laughed out loud during all the "serious" scenes and got bored with the rest. The work of the camera was irregular and reminded me repeatedly that I was watching a bad movie trying to be nervous. My theory is that the sound guy got bored and went down to the beach to have some beers with his boom, all he could hear in the middle of the scenes were the waves. And in the other scenes, I wish that was all I could hear. And speaking of sound, what they did with the song "MÃ¡s" of the Sisters of Mercy is absolutely inexcusable, on the other hand, what they did to Bronte is inexcusable. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, there was an entertaining scene - specifically the moment when Johnny Whitworth licked the face of Katherine Heigl - and if you can tell me what that scene had to do with the rest of the story, more power for you
