Not only did they misunderstand the characters, not only the voices stink, not only the writers seriously need to get brides, not only are the drawings really rough, but it seems that they were created mainly for ages 1-6. The only episode I've seen of this program that kept me watching was "A Mattter Of Family", because I liked Robin's character. And sometimes I think it's just a general copy of Batman The Animated Series. Example: In BTAS, Bruce is a friend of Harvey Dent, yes? During a two-episode story, he becomes the unlikely villain, TwoFace. In the "Show", Bruce is Friends with that guy Ethan, and in a story of two episodes, he becomes the unlikely villain ClayFace. That was just a small example (which may not even be true), but in short, this is the worst attempt at a Batman series. And that is saying something.
