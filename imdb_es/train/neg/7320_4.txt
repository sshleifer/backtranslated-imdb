A show of bondage, humiliation, S & M, and not much else. The plot is flat, it's really just a banal setup for depraved style pieces. The presenter of the aforementioned program, a silly little man who sputtered nonsense while walking around the stage in dresses, distracted almost as much as attempts at artistic editing. The dream ending felt stuck. However, to credit the film, Aya Sugimoto was quite convincing as the tortured leader. Flower and Snake has been compared with Eyes Wide Shut but, apart from some minor superficial similarities, Kubrick's is easily the most layered, artistic and atmospheric image.
