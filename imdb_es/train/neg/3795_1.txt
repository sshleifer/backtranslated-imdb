I really wanted to love this show. Actually, I honestly did it. <br /> <br /> For the first time, gay viewers got their own version of "The Bachelor". With the help of his obligatory "hag" Andra, James, a handsome and wealthy thirty something has the possibility to love with 15 suitors (or "companions" as mentioned in the program). The only problem is that half of them are heterosexual and James does not know it. If James chooses a gay one, they travel to New Zealand and if he chooses a heterosexual one, the straight man receives $ 25,000. How can this not be fun? Take my hand, let's go for a walk: <br /> <br /> The most obvious problem with this show is the bachelor. James is your typical young and successful gay guy with a nice smile and body, who would probably give two glances to your local bar before looking for greener pastures. Why they chose to throw James away as the main man is beyond me. God knows there are many other hotter, more vivacious homosexual men who die for being on television. <br /> <br /> Aside from his rather normal physical appearance, James is as interesting and exciting as a chalk. Even as such, he has an arrogant and condescending aura about him. However, if James was standing against a white and blank wall, he would melt into it. Honestly, I can not recall a single interesting or noteworthy thing that James said during the course of the show. He is THAT boring and forgettable. In fact, one of the companions warned him that he did not feel any connection. I thought it was the best part of the show. In addition, James speaks with an unbearable annoyance. It sounds feminine or masculine, but do not strain the segue tones in the middle of the sentences ... it's so painful to sit down. I hated him so much during the whole show that I thought: "Please, choose a heterosexual man and humiliate yourself and your unfortunate witch" <br /> <br /> Then we have the suitors. A remarkably tasteless group of men who do not seem to care what is happening. Equally bland, they seem indistinguishable from one man to another, except, "Hey, that guy has blond highlights or oh, one has curly hair." Once again, surprisingly ineffective release decisions seem to be the goal of this program. While it may be trite to write cast roles, it would have been much more entertaining to watch than these amorphous drones. However, in all their banality, they still manage to eclipse James (which is not that hard to do anyway), a little. You know you have a problem when some of the suitors are actually more attractive and more interesting than the leader. And the fact that the suitors seem to have more fun around ANYONE else than with the protagonist? Very sad. <br /> <br /> Also, I just thought that the identification pointed to something mentioned on the message boards, which I felt was really true: heterosexual men are all hotter than gay men. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I do not say that all gay guys were ugly and bored, in fact, I found some very cute. It's just that, in general, they were just BLAH compared to the men you would see on shows like A Shot At Love with Tila Tequila or The Bachelorette. <br /> <br /> I do not know how many times I hit fast. during this show I can accept a main character as interesting as a cardboard box, I can accept the worldly and apathetic suitors, but PLEASE, the love of God entertains me a little. There is no such luck. <br /> <br /> If you expect drama, intrigue, sensuality or emotion, you will be VERY disappointed. The biggest "drama" comes from the fact that one of the suitors can still have a boyfriend in New York (how outrageous!). As exciting as it may be, I guarantee that it is the ONLY thing that resembles any conflict in this program. <br /> <br /> Surely there is a twist, but if you have something similar to Gaydar in you, I will easily discern who is who (it was not difficult at all, I only made a mistake once). This program is accumulating so many chips in the turn that it can not be delivered anywhere else. <br /> <br /> We have the opportunity to see how James & Co progresses in such exciting activities as learning to dance Western Step Dance, buy gifts, visit a petting zoo and gay karaoke. YAWN. Sure you have the occasional topless dance but who cares when everyone is bored anyway. That is one of the main problems with the program: NOBODY seems to be having fun themselves, they are just going through the movement, trying to look very fun to have fun. And you can not really blame them, since the events are very unimaginative and lame. <br /> <br /> Finally, the physical aspect is not there. No caresses, no caresses, no kisses (!), No love of any kind. It's just "Ok, that was a boring date, I'm going back to my ugly and disgusting desire to be the Sydney Opera House (peck quickly at the lips) CYA." This show is so ridiculous that it's ridiculous. I can understand that they do not want to play with the perception of the indiscretional nature of homosexual men, but that they come to shit. People who watch reality TV shows will want more than distant hugs and rough kisses. This program refuses to commit. <br /> <br /> Sorry if this was too long, but I felt that these were problems that needed to be addressed. I praise Bravo for presenting a show of this nature, but the amazingly incompetent way in which this show was handled is amazing. To summarize my three points: Bored + Bored + Bored = go do something else. You'll have more fun waiting in a doctor's office for an appointment, at least they have interesting magazines there.
