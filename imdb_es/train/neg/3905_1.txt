Forget Plan 9, this is the final fiasco, a costume drama, directed ineptly, with script, acted, etc. This movie is based on Isabel Allende's not-so-best novel. I hate Meryl Streep and Antonio Banderas (in non-Spanish films), and the other actors, including Winona, my favorite actress and Jeremy Irons are struggling to get through such a terrible script. Many mistakes (like, for example, since when does it snow at Christmas in Chile?) And very cruel, with tons of that misnamed "magical realism", stands out as the worst movie of all time. It's total shit !!!
