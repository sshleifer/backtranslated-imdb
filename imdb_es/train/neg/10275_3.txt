The premise is incredible and some of the performances, in particular Sally Kellerman and Anthony Rapp, are charming ... but this movie is almost impossible to see. The music sounds as if it came from some kind of free online site and the lyrics as if they were written with an open rhyming dictionary in the lap. Most of the singing is out of tune. I think they may have filmed with the singing actress and put the music underneath ... The dialogue is really stupid and trite. The film works best when it is really real estate, but unfortunately, it is often diverted to stratified sub-plots. I found myself checking my watch after the first twenty minutes and after 40 asking "when will it end?"
