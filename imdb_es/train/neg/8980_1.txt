I will never forget the night I saw this movie. We were on a patrol submarine in the North Atlantic and this was the scheduled movie of the night. We all surrender after the second roll. They did not even try to show it at the midnight screening. Opting for a repeat instead ... This is all I really have to say, but they have this stupid rule that my comment should contain ten lines. I'm not supposed to fill in the comment with random words, so I'll continue rambling until I get my ten BS lines. I could not find George Goble in the credits list, but I remember him in the movie. The sin was terrible and the songs even worse.
