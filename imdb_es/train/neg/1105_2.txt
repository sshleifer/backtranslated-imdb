Oh my. How can they make films of such beauty, but which are terribly bad? I mean, even Uwe Boll does not do shit like this. There is not even a hint of a decent story, multi-layered characters or attraction. It's just a random sequence of meaningless conversations put together to make a 'movie'. I suppose that only children up to 3 years of age could enjoy it, since the world is so completely dimensionless and history so incoherent, that any older person would be bothered by it. But, again, it is too frightening for anyone under 6 years of age, that there is probably no one who sees this movie. <br /> <br /> Follow my advice and stay away from this movie. Your little daughter can make a better story, and although she may not be able to draw such beautiful pictures, it's worth listening to her stories. And please, on behalf of whoever you believe, do not expose your children to this piece of shit. I will give it 2 out of 10, and that is exclusively for the graphics, because the development of the story and the character is so horrible that they would deserve a negative rating. <br /> <br /> And if you decide to see it anyway ... remember that I warned you.
