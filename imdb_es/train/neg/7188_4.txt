When I glimpsed the title, I thought we would get another hip slasher, but actually I discovered that "7eventy 5ive" is slightly passable, and a recession of almost 80 years after a tedious slowness in the middle section that picks up the momentum for the half hour final that leads to his climax outrageously sticky and downright out of combat. He will not win prizes for his originality, because it is the most systematic he can get and steals his thunder in the sense of emotions (the fear of cheap jumps), the location (isolated mansion) and the motivation of other films. The resplendent address is by-the-book and the material is quite trite with false tracks made in its elaborate plot and flimsy script. Sometimes it was laughable, but nonetheless, I entertained mainly because of his brutal and horrifying acts of violent violence towards some college students who were quite upset by a psychotic killer with a battle ax. The performances were not bad in the form of a young and brave cast, however, the characters they played were not particularly attractive. An always presentable Rutger Hauer appears in a brief supporting role as a grizzled detective. A polished fact, but a superficial and easy to forget addition for the fold.
