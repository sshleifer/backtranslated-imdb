The plot, the character development and the gags in this movie are extremely weak. All a waste of time. It is assumed that Saving Grace's conclusion is to make one feel warm and confused, as if the characters had grown through their struggles. There was no such development to make such diffuse and warm feelings possible. The gags of the drug are clich√© and a large part of the film does not seem to be real. The plot builds what is supposed to be tension, but the characters are not developed enough to worry. Then, he rushes through the resolution of all the pending problems in about a minute of screen time, which makes the viewer feel that he has just wasted time.
