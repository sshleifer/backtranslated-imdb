Some brides are mysteriously killed while they are at the altar, and then their bodies are stolen on the way to the morgue. The journalist Patricia Hunter decides to investigate these mysterious murders. She discovers that just before each ceremony, the bride received a rare orchid (supposedly from the groom) that contained a powerful drug that succumbed to them. Patricia is told that the orchid was cultivated for the first time by a Dr. Lorenz, who lives on an isolated farm with his wife. Actually, Dr. Lorenz is responsible for the crimes, by putting the brides in a suspended state and by using the liquid in their glands to keep his wife eternally young. Patricia, along with Dr. Foster (who is working with Dr. Lorenz on the medical mystery surrounding his wife) tries to force Dr. Lorenz's hand by organizing a fake wedding, which finally brings Patricia into the clutches of crazy doctor. This movie had a very good opening roll, but basically it ended up with too many set shots and other weak scenes. The cast is decent, Walters and Coffin deserved better, but that's life. Russell steals the show (including Hamming Lugosi, who does not give one of his most memorable performances, even considering his Monograms) while Countess Lorenz plays the role with the qualities of many of the stereotyped features of many of today's Hollywood premium cousins. . Weak and artificial end too. Rating, based on movies B, 4.
