There really is no reason to examine this much further because of a few very dazzling and misleading claims. <br /> <br /> A perfect example is when the filmmaker says "Saul" or Paul de Tarus (the writer of The Book of Hebrews, Affirms) has no idea that Jesus is or was a human being, this statement is intentionally false when accusing others of presenting or ignoring what "The Bible" says. <br /> <br /> First we can. Examine your misleading statement about Hebrews 8.4; which shows a quote "If Jesus were on earth, he would not be a priest", therefore, right here, he establishes the ignorant and ignorant spectator to accept his false premise ... why? He does what is most called the believing people of the Bible that he accuses of doing, the same thing ... That is TAKING things out of context. <br /> <br /> verse one of Hebrews 8 is; 1. "Now, of the things we have spoken about, this is the sum: we have a high priest, who is seated at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven" The above context clearly speaks of a Jesus who was in the earth and ASCENDED to heaven after its supposed resurrection. <br /> <br /> It has nothing to do with how the filmmaker wants the viewer to take it from the scriptures out of context. Here it offers a basis that "Paul was not aware of a HUMAN Jesus, but only one in" heaven "<br /> <br /> is it still? <br /> <br /> Let's see if the filmmaker is being honest Hebrews 7: 14. "For it is evident that our Lord sprang up from Judah; of which the tribe Moses spoke nothing about the priesthood. "<br /> <br /> Heh, the filmmaker did not quote the writer of Hebrews who tries to prove that the writer of that book has no knowledge of a" Jesus "Anyway, it's likely that Paul did not write Hebrews, but I'm not going to talk about it here, but the filmmaker says that Paul did, and that's the premise of the point that is mentioned here. <br /> <br /> It's not like this filmmaker does not make decent points in certain areas, he does, but he's involved in the same blind bias of the religion he's attacking in. Once he gets involved in these tactics, in my opinion , he loses credibility as the religion He chooses, and the film is no longer a documentary, but a personal opinion, and a bias of the filmmaker, nothing more, nothing less.
