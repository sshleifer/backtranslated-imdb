For me, this movie seemed to fall flat on my face. The main problem for me was the casting of Glover as a serial killer. I do not know if this is due to the type of casting or simply to his behavior, but I doubt that Glover could portray a convincing villain. He's a good guy, and that's always obvious in his performances. Apart from that, the movie is his story of a serial killer. Nothing very innovative.
