Weak plot, predictable violence, only semi-interesting characters. Like the writer (also one of the stars?), He was fictionalizing his own mistakes and added disbelieving fantasies about drugs and murder to make it "hot." From the predictable rap and the soundtrack of the house, to family conflicts, it is badly performed, stereotyped and, ultimately, terribly boring. Even the title has been done before - IMDb lists FIVE movies with the same name released in 2007-2008! <br /> <br /> Note: I saw it on Showtime, which included the synopsis of one of the other films. I was halfway there before I realized that nobody was an undercover cop. Even though another stereotype, I would have made it interesting if it had happened.
