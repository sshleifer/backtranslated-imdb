I went to a screening of this film and, although I had a couple of moments that made me laugh, it had some very important flaws. First, it is presented as the humorous exploits of a real-life divorcee who tries to find love in Los Angeles. In what transforms is a depressing, narcissistic and unbridled flutter in the history of the filmmaker's love and professional life. The jokes run out quickly and suddenly you do not care how the quotes from this man progress. The ridiculous thing is that the director presents himself as an extremely annoying and very flawed character and then expects us to be worried.
