In my life I have seen many great and terrible movies. I am not an expert in professional reviews, but I definitely have something to say about this. First of all, these actors are the worst I've seen ... Their performance is so unreal that you even want to shoot the DVD in the first 2 minutes. I think these actors were not interested in quality. <br /> <br /> Another terrible thing is about these dialogues, they are very boring. Sometimes you feel uncomfortable when you listen to them. It seems that your 14-year-old son could act better. I feel that this movie had a budget similar to the cost of my 14-year-old European car ... <br /> <br /> Please, if my message comes to you, save time and money.
