Dolph Lundgren reflects and frowns through this incoherent mystery / thriller that is not as cool as the box would make you believe. It's actually pretty good here, but the story is a chaos of movie B clich√©s (detectives, revenge, magnates, prostitutes, S & M) that seems to have been invented as they went along. The film recovers a bit in the second half, but for a more decent Lundgren movie, rents RED SCORPION instead.
