Adaptation of Stephen King (scripted by King himself) in which a young family, newly arrived in rural Maine, finds out about the pet cemetery near their home. Then, the father (Dale Midkiff) finds out about the Micmac cemetery, beyond the pet cemetery that has resurrection powers; only, of course, everything that is buried does not return CORRECTLY. <br /> <br /> Image of "horror" below average starts awkward, insulting and inept, and continues like this for a while, with the worst absolute element being the useless performance of Midkiff. It gets a little better towards the end, with a really disturbing end. In fact, the whole movie is really disturbing, so I can not rule it out completely, at least it has SOMETHING to make it memorable. The decent support of Fred Gwynne, as the old and wise neighbor, and Brad Greenquist, as the disfigured spirit of Victor Pascow are not enough to really redeem the film. <br /> <br /> King has his usual cameo as minister. <br /> <br /> Followed by a sequel also directed by Mary Lambert (is it any wonder that she has not had any film work since then?). <br /> <br /> 4/10
