The satire of the show world of Monika Mitchell has some laughter and some premeditated violence. I would not say soaked with blood; But there are insults and injuries. Max Matteo (John Cassini) is a character actor who has a peculiar and adaptable presence on the screen, but has a terrible history of being chosen for the parts he seeks. There is always a producer's nephew or an apparently trivial reason for not being given the role you are looking for. Well, the best thing you can do is get rid of the competition ... Max becomes obsessed with those thoughts. The rewarding race is just a swing, push and shoot. Other cast members: Rene Rivera, Molly Parker, Jennifer Beals, Frank Cassini and cameos by Eric Roberts and Sandra Oh. Well, that's a show ... or is it?
