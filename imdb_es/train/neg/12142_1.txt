Please, for God's sake, do not look at it. Now saying that, I know what you're thinking, it can not be that bad, right? If everyone says it as bad as they say, I have to see it! Do not do it. It will be like watching a horrible accident involving small babies and a gasoline tanker! They will mark you for life ... the image will never leave you! I could only see half an hour of this before getting sick violently. The acting is the worst I've seen in my life, and I've seen Barbwire! If you run the risk of getting your eyes out and renting this movie ... do not say I did not warn you! The cover and the plot are a trap! Zombies? Satire? Shaun of the dead was great! This movie must be the same ... right? DO NOT!! The writing = trash address = trash action = no action. Still not convinced? Then forever your soul will be tormented!
