Dr. Seuss would surely be angry right now if he were alive. Cat in the Hat shows that film productions can take a classic story and turn it into a bunch of nonsense. We have Mike Myers as the infamous Jack in the hat, big mistake! Myers proves that he can not act in this movie. He acts like a show girl with thousands of tricks up his sleeve. The children in this movie are fine, somewhere between the boring and annoying lines. The story is like the original with a couple of adjustments and like most movies based on other stories, never change the original story! Bringing the evil neighbor Quin was a bad idea. He is a stupid villain who would never get anywhere in life. This movie is like a comic strip rejected from the newspaper if you think about it. The movie sure looks sticky! Surely there are funny jokes for adults like for example, where the cat cuts the tail and the censor is shot before it says a naughty word, something funny. At least the Grinch had sperm, and the movie was really good! This movie is a cartoon of snot with bright colors and poor mediocre performance. Was Mike Myers even in this movie actually? And another thing, the fish. What's up with that stupid fish! The first time you see it, it's a real fish. The next time you see it, everything is animated and speaking. But it looks like an animated piece of plasticine! This movie is a total of shots off the target. Good joke, bad joke, bad, bad, bad, good joke! I'm surprised that he even had good jokes like the joke of the water park, that was good. So, please, if you have the option, look at the Grinch instead of this mess.
