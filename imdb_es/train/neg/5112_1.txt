Awwww ... yes, it is comforting and everything that some unfortunate family is adopted by ABC / Sears and has their house "renovated". That's where the humanist appeal ends. I liked it at the beginning of his career, but now this program has become disgustingly excessive. <br /> <br /> Ten families in need could receive relatively luxurious homes with many things for each family in which each episode of this program collapses. . The people of Habitat for Humanity should shake their heads in disbelief. For example, is it necessary for a healthy sixteen-year-old child to have a jacuzzi in his room or for his bed to be tricked by the "Low Rider" hydraulic system? Does mom really need her old pick-up truck in disrepair, run and rusted, to be restored and "caught" by some of California's best customizers? A new one would have done the job pretty well, and probably for a third of the price. Do people really need a sixty-five-inch plasma screen in every room of the house? And then there's the question of who pays the increase in property taxes and utility bills. Even after the zaniacs in "Makeover" are gone, someone has still made a living. I doubt that friendly people in Social Services see the humor in all this generosity. <br /> <br /> This program is nothing more than a ratings grabber for ABC and a tacit commercial for its sponsors.
