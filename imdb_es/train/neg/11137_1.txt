All the women with the naked torso of the world could not avoid pressing the stop button about a third of the way through this terrible garbage. With the derisory performance, an equally terrible script plus the poor CGI FX to match; This movie is an insult to the Werewolf genre. It's supposed to be serious, which in itself would be fun if this movie could reach the level of being a bad joke. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies in which the people behind the camera are obviously competent, but they are too lazy to do something decent, even a quarter. Avoid it at all costs and watch one of the classic werewolf movies. <br /> <br /> 0 out of 10!
