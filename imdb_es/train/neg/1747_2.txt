Start with a nice note, only to hesitate quickly and defraud expectations. <br /> <br /> The characters of Mac (Akshay Kumar) and Sam (John Abraham) are not constructed correctly before Mac's boss decides to hook him with three aerial hostesses. The rest of the drama is about how Mac, Sam and Uncle Mambo (Paresh Rawal) face situations that sometimes seem forced. <br /> <br /> About the cast, Paresh Rawal is a very talented actor, I thought it was a waste In the role of a cook in a bad mood. Akshay Kumar is tolerable, John Abraham is very bad, keeps tripping over furniture and Rajpal Yadav is the only one who keeps the grace in the film. <br /> <br /> The second half of the movie is fun at times, but in general a DUD (the songs are boring) and a big disappointment if you are expecting some healthy entertainment and comedy.
