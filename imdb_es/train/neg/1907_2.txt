This horrible and bad piece of garbage manages to be racist, sexist and homophobic at the same time, while pretending to be terribly elegant and sophisticated. Atrocious performances, a clich√© script, and a boring address make this film one of the most remote. Two scenes were especially offensive, one in which Schaech rubs his tongue after being kissed by another man (could have been so disgusting), and the scene in which Eastwood is kissed by Schaech's best friend, who pretends to be Russian. After he leaves the room she exclaims "foreign kings"! So much for being an educated artist who dreams of living in Paris!?! <br /> <br /> Jonathon Schaech can be a nice actor on the screen, and he's surprisingly handsome. It's a pity that I have not learned more working with gay director Gregg Araki in a previous film, and try to save this film from descending into a series of homosexual stereotypes and a mud of homophobia.
