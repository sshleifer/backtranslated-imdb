With this distribution and budget, you will wait more. <br /> <br /> John Cusack has made a number of movies that border on the weird, but it still works. Neither he, nor his sister, nor Sir Ben could do anything to save this spoof of badly written garbage. <br /> <br /> The film is nothing more than a series of visual and poor gags. The plot is not going anywhere, the writing is ideal, meaningless and the characters are very thin. If you think that a film is three-dimensional in which the story and the characters add depth to the images, this stinky becomes as flat as that of Steamboat Mickey. <br /> <br /> The appearance of Dan Akroyd in this brought back memories of another person. Really horrible movie, 1991, nothing but problems. Frankly, this movie is the kind of project that kills races and dismisses agents.
