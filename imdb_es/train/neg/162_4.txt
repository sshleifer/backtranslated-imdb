a film that tries to be much smarter than its creators are capable of producing. the movie turns and spins through the magic plot "surprises" in a desperate attempt to keep the audience guessing, off course puncturing the "plot" with steamy scenes that they thought would help. <br /> <br /> James Belushi is involved in this pseudo-intellectual attempt and only the dream walks through the film. The same applies to the other "actors". The plot is pretty silly and sticky. What in itself is not a crime, but towards the end, the tremendous twists of the plot become very boring and boring. <br /> <br /> However, the film manages to generate some interest in the medium. In all it's worth a lazy watch on a really boring day, but do not worry if you miss it. <br /> <br /> a pretty boring 4!
