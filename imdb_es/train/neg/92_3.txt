Actually, I can not believe I spent $ 5 on this movie. I'm a big fan of zombies and I thought the movie could not be that bad. I had zombies, right? I was wrong! To be honest, the movie had its moments ... I thought it was great when the guy was ripped off his head, but that was it. In general, I think it would be nicer to slide a slide of razor blades into my naked backpack in a vinegar vat and then watch this movie again. The movie could have been better if we could see some tits, but I had to watch the progress of the other films produced by this company to see that. The buyer be careful ... unless he is in masochism.
