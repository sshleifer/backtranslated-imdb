A fun concept, but poorly executed. Except for the pretty good makeup effects, there really is not much for that. There are obvious problems; For example, after taking what appear to be weeks and weeks to go from fat to normal size, the main character seems to go from being normal in size to being extremely thin in days ... and once he is very thin, he keeps almost as thin for what seems to be a long time. <br /> <br /> In any case, the film has much worse problems than that: the cinematography is decidedly low budget, the quality of a television show and, above all, the acting is pretty horrible all around Robert John Burke seems to be always trying a kind of strange and false impersonation of Charlton Heston and it is literally painful to watch ... the only thing that is scary is that Lucinda Jenney and Kari Wuhrer are even worse. <br /> <br /> The only reason I'm giving this film as high as mine is that once the film enters its last third approximately and the character of Joe Mantegna takes over, the film develops a country feel and fun, and the environment The crazy plans of the gangsters to torment the totally hateful gypsies are something fun to watch. The end, if predictable, is also pretty bad. Avoid it unless you are a King-o-Phile or are mentally REALIZED at the idea of ​​Fat Tony's voice of the Simpsons terrorizing a gypsy camp.
