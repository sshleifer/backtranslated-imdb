The producers made a big mistake in choosing Mark Lester, who could not act or sing, in the lead role. Apart from his very bad "acting", all the singing of Lester had to be doubled by a girl. I do not know why he was cast at all, since there would have been so many guys who could have played the role infinitely better and made their own singing too. Shani Wallis was too old to play Nancy, who was only 16 years old. The current version of the West End is much better than the movie in every way. Ross McCormack is the best Artistic Dodger of all time and he is certainly much better than Jack Wild. It was clearly political to award this Oscar-winning musical so many Oscar awards after the tumultuous events of 1968.
