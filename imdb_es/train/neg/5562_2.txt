This nasty movie has little to recommend it. Dolph Lundgren offers an interpretation that is better than what this script or his other action films allows. And there are fragments of occasional dialogues that suggest that the film might have been able to provide an idea of ​​a strange subculture. <br /> <br /> But no. The motivations are murky or trite. Most of the performance is sub-par. The script creates unnecessary confusion. And the director's unnecessary fascination for focusing on the gore distracts. <br /> <br /> It's hard to imagine who the audience is for this movie.
