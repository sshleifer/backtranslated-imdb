(First, excuse my bad English) Of course, only a movie starring Jessica Simpson can include serious nonsense like this one. I'm Norwegian and I was offended and surprised that the creators of this movie did not take the time to do it. Research on the making of this American / "Norwegian" film. Even Wikipedia is more accurate when it comes to data about this country. <br /> <br /> So I'm posting my corrections of my frustration: -The country is called Norway, not Norwegia. - "Da" is Russian, not Norwegian. -The Norwegian priests never wear those black cloaks with that white paper by the neck, since the Protestant church is the dominant one until now. It is true that we have a traditional native folk costume (which we only use twice a year), but the costume in this film is more like a German costume. -I could not understand the so-called "Norwegian" in this movie ... Jessica did not make any sense ... Neighter made the "Norwegian priests" <br /> <br /> The only thing I recognize is the Norwegian flag (and the hats Vikings, but that is so stereotyped what people think of Norway: Vikings!: My God) <br /> <br /> Well ... I guess the people who made this movie will never read this comment. but at least I clarified some things and I got rid of some of that frustration ..! <br /> <br /> I am proud of my country and would love for people in the United States to be less stereotyped and more accurate. when they talk about this country. <br /> <br /> That was it ... Lenge slight Norge! ;P
