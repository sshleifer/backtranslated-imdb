SPLIT SECOND could have been a good movie. A story about a homicide by "fury on the road" has a very young Clive Owen who is performing well; BUT ... but ... <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the filmmakers undermined their own movie with camera idiots and a really horrible edition. The camera jumps through all of creation in a failed attempt (I suppose) to reflect Owen's stress on business, family and traffic. What this really does is give the viewer a headache. <br /> <br /> As the filmmakers did not mind making a good movie, but just to impress others with their idiotic photography, you should not waste time in this parody. .
