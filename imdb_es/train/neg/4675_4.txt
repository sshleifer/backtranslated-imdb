"Washington Square" is a flat and spoiled adaptation of Henry James' short novel. In fact, the novel is very good, but far from the level of James' masterpieces. In addition, its simple and uncomplicated story seems inadequate to turn it into a movie (although William Wyler, with his "The Heiress", gave in 1949 a beautiful version of the novel). <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie completely betrays the spirit of this work by the great American writer. In the novel, the heroine Catherine is shy, not very attractive and somewhat clumsy, but nevertheless, she is a healthy and intelligent young woman, and she is not as naive as she seems. His attachment to his father is dignified and respectful, without morbid sides. Throughout three quarters of the movie, Catherine (Jennifer Jason Leigh) seems to have mental retardation, poor. In the last quarter, suddenly (and incredibly) she becomes smart, aware of her dignity as a woman and all that. <br /> <br /> Director Agnieszka Holland has added two vulgar scenes to the story. The first, when the nervous girl Catherine has, well, problems with her vesica. The second scene, when we see in the background a kind of outdoor brothel, with prostitutes who take their clients behind tents, and so on. Nothing could be more contrary to the spirit and artistic ideals of Henry James. It is notorious that the writer was extremely decent and demure even by the standards of the Victorian era. I challenge anyone to find any rudeness in the thousands of pages of James' huge literary production. These two scenes really bothered me in particular. <br /> <br /> Yes, I know that a director needs reasonable freedom in the film adaptation of a novel. But if a director completely ignores or misinterprets the art of an author (here Henry James), I do not see the point of using his work to make a bad movie. <br /> <br /> The acting is suitable for the film: poor and flat, despite the talent of Albert Finney and Maggie Smith. "Washington Square" is definitely a movie not recommended.
