I ended up watching this movie accidentally. I'm still not sure if I regret it or not. I felt like I was watching the movie made by that group of students from the film school who did not make the cut. Play with all the Hollywood clich√©s imaginable, while whipping us with the message 'corporations are the biggest evil'. Subtlety this movie does not know. As far as he goes, he even manages to provide his own spoilers. <br /> <br /> The story seems to be a computer nerd fantasy world come true. The main character is an attractive teen with girlfriend, however, he is a programming genius and an apparent hacker (I think), among many other nerdy fantasy elements that will come true for you. <br /> <br /> Also, I should have known it would be a z-movie when I saw Ned Bellamy ... it tends to be a good warning. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this one, I'm afraid
