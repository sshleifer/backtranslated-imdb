I arrived at NEW PORT SOUTH expecting a substitute film about the Columbine school massacre similar to Gus Van Sant's ELEPHANT and certainly the synopsis in the TV guide that indicates that a student sociopath rebels against the system and gave me that impression, but this is a very boring movie. where it happens little, so consider yourself warned <br /> <br /> The story is about Maddox, a Chicago high school student who decides to strike back at what he perceives as an authoritarian regime. The main problem is that the character is subscribed and the actor who plays Blake Shields can not adorn any script deficiency. You have a hunch that Maddox should have the evil charisma of Hitler, Saddam or Bin Laden, but he never presents himself as more than a petulant teenager and it is impossible to believe that he can reunite any disciple. The subtext in which you overthrow a manipulative authoritarian regime only to replace it with another manipulative regime is too obvious, which means that NEW PORT SOUTH is a totally unconvincing drama that is not worth going out of your way to see.
