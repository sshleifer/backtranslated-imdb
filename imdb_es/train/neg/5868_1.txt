Absolutely one of the worst movies of all time. <br /> <br /> Low production values, terrible idea of ​​history, bad script, lackluster performance ... and I can not even think of an adjective adequately descriptive of how poor Joan River's address is. I know there is a special place in hell for the people who funded this movie; Prolly, just below the level reserved for genocidal maniacs who rape children. <br /> <br /> This movie is a battle train. <br /> <br /> (Terrible) x (infinity) = Rabbit test. <br /> <br /> Avoid this at all costs. <br /> <br /> It's so bad, it's not funny how bad it is.
