It's funny how a studio believes it can be a sequel to what was a classic Christmas story with a brand new cast and expect it to float. Of course they used several actors for Batman, but in that case, Batman was a classic character before any of the actors put on their cape. In this case, you had a classic character in the blond horn-rimmed glasses that used Ralphy and they wanted a red rifle for Christmas ... Somehow, we're supposed to forget it and accept another child that does not look like the original . . If I had not known it was a sequel, I would not have guessed it by the cast ... except, of course, Charles Grodin tries so hard to imitate Darrin McGavin that he is constantly reminded that the original was much better ... < br /> <br /> In the end, it could work if the movie had been released better. They should have looked for a similar look or simply ignored the original and not tried to copy their appearance. This is just a cheap imitation. The Ralphy does not evoke any sympathy, only the desire to appear that his character shoots his eye or dies.
