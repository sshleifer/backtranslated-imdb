The plot of 'House of Games' is the strongest: a successful psychologist and author is deceived by a gang of grifters, but when he discovers the perverse part of himself that enjoys the emotion of what they do, he finally gets his revenge. . That's all on the pitch: but someone has to take responsibility for making them look like puppets. It has to be the director Mamet: Lindsay Crouse has had a career in television and cinema varied and quite stable, so it can not act so bad all the time. She is supposed to go from being a tense, cold and controlled professional to an evil and calculating woman who has fun, as evidenced by the change of a beige trouser suit (which she seems to wear for three days in a row, including underwear) to a floral dress with a floppy disk. But they all seem to be talking about their lines in the same trimmed and precise way; I imagine Mamet wanting to make sure he does not miss a syllable of his brilliant script. The effect is disturbing and ruins the atmosphere of mystery and suspense that, presumably, is trying to create. Sometimes, 'House of Games' loses any connection to the way human beings behave or speak, and becomes just a mechanism to develop the plot. The awkward faux-jazz vibes'n'oboe soundtrack does not help either. The end result is that the only entertainment you can have is to guess the result, and the sooner you do it, the sooner you will get bored with the robotic two-dimensional performances. And they smoke too much !!!
