This movie was made for the fans of Dani (and Cradle of Filth). I am not one of them. I think he's just an imitator in the black metal car (even so, I'm not usually a black metal fan). But while I was carrying this DVD case to pay for it, I convinced myself that the less authentic something is, the more it tries to be convincing. So I assumed that I was expecting a roller coaster of gore and DIY splashes with a sinister background. Now, that's what I like. <br /> <br /> I arrived home and placed it. My patience lasted 15 minutes. AWESOME camera work and DESGASTANTE quality. And that was then (2002), which seemed to be filmed with a Hi8 camcorder. I left it on the shelf. Maybe a good evening with beer and Bmovies would create a nice atmosphere for this ... photo. <br /> <br /> After a couple of months I returned (in the mentioned environment) and saw half. Then not only did the mentioned aspects bother me. My aversion evolved. I realized how funny Dani was (1.65m, 5'5 "tall) in his platform shoes when he tore off an assailant's head. (Yes, to tear.) Apparently, his head did not have a skull.) I discovered that this movie may have However, I have not finished yet, so I was not positive. <br /> <br /> After a few more tries, I finally managed to finish this movie, a couple of months ago .. (Yes, it took me 5.5 years.) So, Dani was actually fun as Satan / Manson / super-evil-man's ASSISTANT and the movie did not make sense ... Look, our bad person hires Dani to do things Well, I think he's very, very bad, in fact, both are and that's it. <br /> <br /> We have a couple of short stories linked by the character of Dani. a guy, who assaults someone's leg, because he wants to use it as his own, yes, exactly. <br /> <br /> The ROCK BOTTOM of the performance, the CGI is the worst I mean, Stinger overcomes him (and, boy, is Stinger's CGI baaaaad. The story does not make sense. And the quality is ... Let's say it is not satisfactory. The only thing that could make you keep looking is violence and gore not motivated. The blood and guts are doing pretty well. Because of that, you can see that the movie originated there and then moved on. (Example: Dani 'The Man' Filth takes a stuffed cat, as it may be, and destroys it ... and then eats what fell out, why, we never know, but we do know that this cat must have been about illegal substances, since their heart is almost half their size.) <br /> <br /> You might think, after my comment that this movie is so bad that it's good, but it's just bad. Cradle of Filth fans can add 3 points. I added one to gore.
