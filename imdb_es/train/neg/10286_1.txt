Fellows Sugar and Bobby Lee are abducted by menacing uncles while one day they go shopping and take them to a secluded island where the girls reluctantly tell the thugs they last visited when they were ten years old and find a fortune. Everything that simply frames a film that is almost a long flashback about the first visit of the girls to the island and the subsequent fight with a cannibal family. <br /> <br /> This is an extremely horrible action on the part of everyone involved in the event. I started to feel bad for poor Hank Worden who really deserved a lot MUCH better. As much as I did not like "Barracuda" (which is on the same DVD), I must admit that this movie makes it look like Citizen Kane. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: a pair of tits (could belong to Kirsten Baker) <br /> <br /> My grade: F <br /> <br /> Dark Sky DVD extras: ads of period for several foods of entrance in car; and Trailers for "The children of Bonnie" (with nudity), "The girls on the central page", "Part-time wife" (with nudity), "Psychic killer" and "Live food". The DVD also comes with "Barracuda" from 1978.
