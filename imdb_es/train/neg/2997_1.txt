This was filmed consecutively with the new 1992 version of the famous novel by Conan Doyle, 'The Lost World'. And looks. <br /> <br /> The film begins in a very promising way, with a ruthless organization that tries to exploit the lost world and Challenger and others return to defend the prehistoric plateau, but then things go downhill. Everyone is stranded on the plateau and we have a weak, boring and extensive rehash of the first movie. <br /> <br /> Dinosaurs (which are almost never seen) are simply ridiculous. Do you expect us to take seriously that stuffed animal that is supposed to be an ankylosaur? And the tyrannosaur seems to be rooted in the place. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and buy the silent version of 1925 from the Lost World. Incredibly in this era of CGI and other advanced effects, the twenties version is the best and will remain so until someone finally decides to make a decent renovation.
