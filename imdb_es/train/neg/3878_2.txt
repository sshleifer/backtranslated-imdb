['The plot of &quot;Astronuat returns to Earth as a mutant monster&quot; became extinct in the 1950s, mainly due to the scientific fact that traveling out of Earth&#39;s orbit does not make humans mutated monsters, and that the first film to use this plot THE QUATERMASS EXPERIMENT was the only decent science fiction movie that used the idea. So the idea of having the return of the redundant plot seems doomed from the beginning. Seeing the INCREDIBLE MAN OF FUSION, it seems that the plot is the least of his problems. <br /><br /> First of all, this is an incredibly poorly made movie. The budget is in unique figures and I&#39;m talking about lire not dollars. There is no cinematography to talk about and there are innumerable editing errors. For example, a photographer takes his model (barely legal) for a photo shoot. Cut to a plane where the sun is directly behind the model, then to a photographer where the sun is directly behind him, then cut to the model where the sun is ... <br /><br /> The lack of budget drags the film in other aspects as well. According to the question page, the budget was so low that the producers could not get images of Saturn, so when astronaut Steve West mentioned how beautiful Saturn looks, we get images of the sun. In reality, the sun gives the most impressive performance of the film, since human actors would not be employees of a pornography studio. If I appeared in this, I would not be frightened by the monster of the same name; I would be terrified of the splinters of the rest of the cast. Maybe we should be a little lenient, since the obvious lack of budget is manifested in things like actors who have to wear their own clothes. A general, for example, does not wear his nice and elegant dress uniform with medals: he wears a denim jacket and a baseball cap. <br /><br /> There has to be a suspension of disbelief for a movie like this to work, but it fails at all levels. The tone is set early in the movie where Mr. Melty murders a nurse and escapes from the hospital. Instead of the police receiving a call saying there has been a murder, Dr. Nelson simply decides to track down his patient on his own and look for a lost cat. It&#39;s also strange that a completely decomposing homicidal monster can walk the road without anyone noticing, but this is typical of a movie in which the 70-year-old horny ones stop their car on dark roads for a quick one and people mention carelessly that his wife is pregnant and he forgets to tell the police that there is a loose monster. <br /><br /> THE INCREDIBLE MAN OF FUSION is Z grade trash. I can certainly understand why people enjoy this movie because it reaches the &quot;It&#39;s so bad that it&#39;s good&quot; point, but apart from the sometimes impressive makeup effects of Rick Baker It&#39;s just a very guilty pleasure.']
