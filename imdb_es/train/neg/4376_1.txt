Well, the plot is, hope you understand me, there is not a really discernible plot here, just a series of opaque sex scenes, joined by scenes of photographers taking pictures of pretty women (Sometimes, a combination of the two) Then , a demon approaches. Men, rape and kill women, and are poetic about the meaning of life. Leaving aside the moronic special effects, the bad acting and the strange philosophy, you get what you expect from a movie with a title like this. I guess it would have to be someone's cup of tea, but not mine, since I still have to watch a good movie directed by Kazuo 'Gaira' Komizu. <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Interview subtitled with Director Kazuo Komizu Part 1 (Part 2 is on the Entrails of a Beautiful Woman DVD); and Tailer Tailer <br /> <br /> My rating: F
