In a film that follows an actor with difficulties, obviously played by an actor with difficulties, this does not favor Chris Klein. He strives to bring something memorable to the function and meanders through the superficial script he manages to show, which could only be described as, a bland leading man. The story exists, but that's it, and it does not show any basic, middle and final start, and the viewer shrugs with the feeling that nothing has happened in the last hour and three quarters. <br /> <br /> A bright light in the midst of this is Fred Durst, who manages to excel above his fellow seemingly average talent and does a semi decent job of bringing to life the backward character of Legde. If Fred can recreate this when working with a higher caliber of the cast, it remains to be seen, but I will be watching him in the future.
