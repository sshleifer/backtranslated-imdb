*** Possible Spoilers *** <br /> <br /> When I saw this today, I had some expectation of how it would be, not too loud, but not low either. However, this was nothing like what I expected, it seems to me that movie makers could not decide what kind of film to make. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film it is something mysterious. and a bit exciting, but that will soon change to some ridiculous scenes, very obvious scenes ... As I watched more, I almost fell asleep a couple of times. <br /> <br /> The ending is the most ridiculous of all. however, almost splashed / comedy ... <br /> <br /> I'm not saying I do not have some good scenes, it's just that the movie never becomes "complete". <br /> <br /> 4/10 Movie-Man
