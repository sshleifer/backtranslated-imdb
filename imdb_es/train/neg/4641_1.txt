Sometimes I enjoy very bad movies ... those that occasionally occur when people (even talented people) come together with good intentions to produce a movie and, for whatever reason, it turns out to be a disaster. Films like "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes", "Plan 9 from Outer Space", "Hands-Hands of Fate", and "Heavens Gate", etc. <br /> <br /> Then, when I heard that, this movie, "Rachel's Attic," was considered by many people to be the worst movie of the decade, naturally, I HAVE to see it. <br /> <br /> Boy, I regret that decision. This movie is beyond the bad ... it's so bad that it's not as nice as the usual bad movie. The performance, the shooting, the script, etc. they are even worse than a low budget porn movie: the sound is absolutely horrible, the "plot" is completely incomprehensible, the "acting" is laughable ... it is a complete waste of all. time and money At least the porn movie has porn to break the monotony, while this ridiculous nightmare has a boy who squeezes a rotten apple and a tea party "of mad hatters". <br /> <br /> Lighting does not exist ... Many "scenes" take place in semi or complete darkness, which is probably just as good. The "writer-director" (I use the terms lightly), David Tybor, tries to entangle himself with the bondage scenes ... but the results would be ridiculous, if they were not so pathetic. There is some nudity, but it is of such abysmal quality that it actually acts as a sexual suppressant. I could go on forever and not do justice to all the faults and shortcomings of this terrible and terrible movie loss. <br /> <br /> For God's sake, avoid this train crash. I know that despite (or maybe because of) my negative comments, I may still be tempted to see if this piece of junk is really as bad as I say ... but trust me in this ... it's even worse than what I have said, and you will regret the experience absolutely and positively (and the expenses, if you waste your money in a purchase or rent).
