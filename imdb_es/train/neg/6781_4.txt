A good cast (with one big exception) makes its way through Epstein's intelligent light satire. Mansfield was never better, or more fun, than she is here paired with Walston, who is a veteran who is determined to become a congressman to get out of the war. He and his friends, including the soft con crook Grant, go to San Francisco on leave and start the city's liveliest party while working to escape service through industrial speaking tours. The unique thing of this film that is not pleasant is the interpretation of a note of Suzy Parker like the loving interest of Grant, that occupies long time of the film and slows down the rate in the second half. Walston and Mansfield have good chemistry; the trick is that she is willing to make love with all the military (to fulfill her duty of war), but she is a married man who, nevertheless, loves his wife. They stole the movie with little difficulty from Grant (who has fun here in the first part of the movie, when he is not paired with his non-actor co-star).
