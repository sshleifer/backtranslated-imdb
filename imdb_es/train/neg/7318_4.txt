This is a depressing, superficial, naive and almost ungraceful look at a tremendously unlikely relationship between the psychotic film editor of Brooks and Harold, his insipid girlfriend. The two have chemical ZERO together, mainly because Harold is unable to do anything, besides looking pretty at this stage of his career; but also because the character of Brooks is neither interesting nor sympathetic. There are 15 static and unbearable minutes at the beginning, where Brooks, who has just broken up with Harold, runs into his apartment in a depressed and drugged, unbearable state. <br /> <br /> Sappily and unimaginatively imagined by Joe Cocker "You Are So Beautiful", there simply is not enough material here for a movie. Hardly anything happens at the periphery of their relationship to give the appearance that these people exist in a real world. I am sure that Brooks's intention was to focus attention on the issue and, in a way, to deconstruct it; but if you're going to do that, writing and acting should be much better than it is here.
