As much as I like Japanese movies, it did not just cut her off ... A movie that is supposed to be about rebels and the survival of a real bloodline turned out to be a very slow-paced movie with a dubious argument. br /> <br /> The photography is fine, although I have seen much better sword fighting scenes in other Japanese films, the fast cameras and the way they followed the characters did not convince me at all. The soundtrack is so weak that he does not even notice his presence. But the worst of all was the way the plot evolved. I have to admit that, on some occasions, it was hard for me to understand who was who and what was happening. .. Anyway, the platonic love between the main character and another was completely unnecessary and seemed to come from a Hollywood influence. <br /> <br /> In general, if you're looking for a Japanese action movie, is not it? . It is very slow, with very few scenes of sword fighting and very sentimental ... in a bad way ...
