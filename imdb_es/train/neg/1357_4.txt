* Can it contain some type of spoiler? * The mere mention of Crispin Glover is enough to send some geek panties in a pile. His historic appearance in Back to the Future as George McFly has locked him in the American consciousness forever. More recently, he has been trying to return to the cultural subconscious with Bartleby and Willard. <br /> <br /> This time, however, Crispin has made a cheap movie of 76 minutes. Sometimes he reminded me of genius, while in general he almost insulted me, but not because of its content. Content? What is it? It is a film in which, in the middle of the film, all the actors have Down Syndrome, which gives them a sense of madness. The other half of the film includes Crispin Glover, Adam Parfrey and a guy with cerebral palsy. All this had the feeling of what John Waters was trying to do with Desperate Living, and at the same time he felt more successful and failed miserably. <br /> <br /> Half of the Down Syndrome actors also have many dead snails. It is a guy who has snails, and ends up killing one. He is also tormented by a group of other people, and a grasshopper. He falls in love with 2 girls, one of whom has sex in a cemetery. He also has a fight with a friend who makes fun of him. <br /> <br /> In a strange semi-interior set, Crispin Glover is the director of this show. He is something like controlling the boy's mind, and the type of cerebral palsy is something like sexuality. Well, at least he masturbates in explicit scenes. There are other "shocking" images made humorous, such as the Nazi Swaztikas crossed with the Shirley Temple, and the black-faced minstrels who say they are Michael Jackson. <br /> <br /> In the outside world, the tormentor is still dealing with his Love for killing snails and being beaten by other people. They hit him with stones, and such. Later, they beat the minstrel after taking him to trial. <br /> <br /> Back inside, Crispin Glover is still the ruler of his set, and tries to control everyone, but fails miserably. <br /> <br /> What is it? It makes less sense than Dr. Caligari and he is robbed more than a pass style. The claustrophobic mental space is very similar to the way in which the groups without walls of Dr. Caligari felt claustrophobic. They also had some dialogue that was a complete nonsense. And, everything was wrapped with absurd images for humor. <br /> <br /> The problem is that, at 20 minutes of the movie ... maybe a little more ... What is it? it runs out of images For the next 56 minutes, we continue running in the same sets of images, only introducing new images in the form of an absurd puppet. The film seems little more than a movie that tries to push the envelope in offensive and taboo images. Try to tease and confuse the audience. But, the problem is that it only has sufficiently different images for a 40-minute movie. <br /> <br /> Even worse than that, the cinematography, set design and everything else felt very cheap and almost unplanned. He felt like "OK, this is the way we can do it and get it out of the way." It did not feel interesting, and it was pretty ... boring. Dr. Caligari, on the other hand, had incredible cinematography and framing. The difference between the two is quite surprising. Rating <br /> <br />: C
