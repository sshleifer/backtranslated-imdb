Calling a movie like "Thinner" wrong is like calling the land round or Pauly Shore without talent. There's no news, but how they got to that is what people want to know. <br /> <br /> As for this movie ... The book was good, even if it was a little derivative of other "Be careful what you want" stories of the genre. Burke plays an overweight lawyer who kills a gypsy's daughter and is cursed by his father (Constantine from "Sala 222" on television) at several pounds a day. <br /> <br /> As I said, it starts well, but why involve the mobster (Mantegna)? Why shoot so much automatic weapons? Why make it so dependent on FX? I thought it would have been much more effective if it had focused more on the subtle ramifications of the madness of weight loss, disease, death, gypsy history and so on. <br /> <br /> But no, it should not be. Remember, we're talking about Stephen King. <br /> <br /> And the end ... almost the same as the book, but a little too ostentatious. In fact, the whole movie talks too much, feeling that it has to explain each plot to us. Not that I expected "The Dead Zone", but I could have done it without another "Pet Sematary", thanks anyway. <br /> <br /> One star at least for trying to do a half decent makeup job. However, the rest of the movie is left to be ... tell me ... "Thinner".
