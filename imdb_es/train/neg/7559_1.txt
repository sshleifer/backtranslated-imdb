This has to be one of the worst reefs I've seen and I've seen some. He is slow, bored, amateur, not even consistent in his own simplistic reading of the plot. The actors do not act. I can not blame them: they have been given a script of such absolute banality that all they can do is to cross it with a pain behind their eyes that has nothing to do with the ill-treatment in SummersIsle. <br /> <br /> There is not a moment in this movie that seems true, nor an honest line nor a single moment where one moves. The character of Nicholas Cage is so badly drawn that one does not feel compassion for him through all his tribulations. I have no doubt that I was seeing a man suffering there, but it was Nicholas Cage fully aware of the fact that he was in the worst movie of his entire career.
