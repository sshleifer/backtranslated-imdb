I saw this film for the first time in the Soviet Union and many erotic scenes were simply edited by the censorship committee. But then, in Poland in the year 2000, I saw it completely. And that? The plot is incredibly reckless: two men survive the genetic catastrophe and find themselves on a planet full of strong, straight and fundamentally severe feminist ladies. Men now try to fight it and then all the extremely dumb clich√©s follow: sex drive, constant male desire for sex, feminists who show themselves as complete idiots (you can agree with them or not, but idiots certainly are not) . ), and so. The performance, even of the star Jerzy Stuhr, is wooden and, strangely, bad. She simply pulls out funny faces and repeats phrases like "I'm in the elevator with a naked girl and I have not done anything to her!" This pretended to be a comedy, instead, turned out to be an insipid farce, full of predictable jokes and insinuations below the waist. Do not waste your time on this, this is just bad.
