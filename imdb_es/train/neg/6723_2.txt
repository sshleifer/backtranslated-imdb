The deadly beauty and lethal kicks of Charlotte make the movie cooler than it would be otherwise. The story is very bad and the character of Charlotte dies in such a stupid way, that you wonder if this is the end they had thought for this movie. I would like someone to say that there is an alternative ending, but I'm afraid not. As for the rest of the cst, well, I would say that they just did not act very well; although the poor script must be blamed. This movie reminds me of Rush Hour 2, where Zhang Ziyi dies absurdly, since she was the only one who had stolen the show throughout the film. I could give this movie 2/5
