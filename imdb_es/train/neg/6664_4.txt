What begins as a gentle country thread, a harmless and slightly pleasant romantic story changes as the initially enchanting Harlan of Edward Norton gradually reveals more about himself and things change for the sinister, as the film gradually changes from a romance southern to a modern savage. western. <br /> <br /> A kind rancher (Norton) wanders around the city and loves a young woman (Evan Rachel Wood), who apparently rescues her from a dead end with her grumpy father with a whirlwind romance, but gradually It is evident that there is more to this cowboy than meets the eye. <br /> <br /> Edward Norton? a true chameleonic actor (with the change of facial hair to match) playing a field kick, with a slightly risky accent, but perhaps because he is simply trying to act, without worrying about the accent. It certainly makes it seem effortless to make all the little adjustments with nuances as we learn more about Harlan. However, with too many small changes, this means that we are never sure exactly where Harlan comes from, and what seemed to be Norton's good performance is gradually confused. Evan Rachel Wood is nice without really having much to do other than pounding her eyelids on Norton. <br /> <br /> Down in the Valley seems a slightly uneven story due to its change of pace, and never really make the protagonist's motives clarify the audience's sympathies towards the characters remain uncertain. Would we like this vagabond or not? Even after a dramatic turn of events remains unclear. This ambiguity is to the detriment of the film, as if the writer could not decide what kind of story he wanted to tell and settled for a hotch-potch. If the film had stayed one or the other, it could have been a solid movie, but as we have left, it is a disaster. Fans of the old romance will enjoy a part of the movie, but will be discouraged by the dark tone. Leaving aside the Norton fanatics (or the fanatics of the exuberant landscape of the San Fernando Valley), do not hesitate.
