I usually like comedy movies. I really enjoy them. But I really do not understand the point of "Envy." I mean, it has a boring content / theme, and it's not really fun. <br /> <br /> Although the performance is generally good, it is not enough for the film to be at least a little interesting. Stiller and Black do not show all their talent in this movie. <br /> <br /> So, if you're about to rent a comedy, I suggest you definitely do not go for this one. Unless you want to get bored, and I can see that I'm not the only one with this opinion, because even Jack Black apologized for that (see Trivia).
