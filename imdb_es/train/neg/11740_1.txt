Positively horrible vehicle of George Sanders, where he goes from being a thief to a police officer. <br /> <br /> While Sanders was an excellent character actor, he certainly was not a protagonist and this film proves it. <br /> <br /> It's absolutely beyond stupidity. Gene Lockhart provided some comic relief until a moment of anger led him to shoot his weapon with a tragedy. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, George Sanders and his co-star Carol Landis committed suicide in real life. After making a film as deplorable as this, it is not shocking. <br /> <br /> The attractive Signe Hasso is nothing here.
