I looked at Phat Beach on cable for a while and enjoyed it. The fat one is the best character, since he seems to be a good guy. The rest of the characters are just several stereotypes of young men and young black men. I like to see these low budget films that capture a period of time because they are almost like a documentary of the attitudes and fashions of the year. Phat Beach is also fun because the low budget girls in this movie are strictly home girls. Most low-budget films have that "local baby" quality, and it can be said that the babies in this movie were the models of underwear and local strippers for JC Penneys. Some of them had so much cellulite hanging out of their bikinis that it was funny to see how the "youngsters" went crazy for what was essentially a heavily used skank. There were some cuties too. That's the charm of these low budget shit movies. You'll see a lot of little dogs, and some real cuties! I checked some of them in IMDb and seven years later, Phat Beach is their only credit. Too. It would be interesting if someone ever managed to make a book of "Where are they now?" On all the beauties that have appeared in the history of the movies and never come back. What happened?? There are probably one or two young people in almost every movie who seem to have a lot in their favor and yet, years later, when you watch the movie again on TV, you ask yourself "what happened to X?" Anyway, this movie mostly blows, but it has some fun moments.
