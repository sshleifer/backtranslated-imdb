As far as I can tell it was a steal of my time that took me to see this movie and I must say it was a horrible experience. Fay Ann Lee is a terrible actress and is not convincing in this movie. Larryjoe76 is obviously a shill critic. The plot is thin to say the least, Cantonese dialogue is not fun. Watch this movie at your own risk. <br /> <br /> David Tang of Shanghai Tang should be after the movie for the little or no income that this film will generate. The banal plot tries to compete with other romantic comedies, and simply mixes with the landscape. It was like watching the paint dry. <br /> <br /> In summary, this movie was a total waste of time and space. I've seen better movies on youtube.
