I thought this was one of the most depressing holiday movies I've seen, the others are THE Christmas WIFE and JACK FROST. The three films are about death. If you like to be completely depressed, then look at this movie or any of the others. In this film, the acting is good and some of the landscapes (apart from when people are dying) are beautiful. But, I worry that a clinically depressed person could accidentally see the film and do it on its own. Despite a "happy forever" ending, most of this movie is a terrible disaster that follows another. And, for some crazy reason, I DO NOT WANT TO DEPRIVE ME when I watch a Christmas movie (I know this sounds like crazy people, after all, I'm not missing you in the eyes and feeling miserable about what these holidays are about. ?) <br /> <br /> For a more uplifting visual experience, try the forgotten HOME WITHOUT A Christmas TREE, Christmas CAROL by George C. Scott or A Christmas HISTORY instead, unless, of course, you like to be miserable.
