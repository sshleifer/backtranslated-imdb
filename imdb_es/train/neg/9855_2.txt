Let me start by saying that I am a big fan of fantasy. However, this movie is not for me. Many unlikely arguments attempt to support the claim of this film that dragons possibly existed at some time. The film mentions connections in different stories from different countries, but does not investigate them further, which could have given the film some credibility. The movie uses (nice!) CGI to tell us a fantasy story told about the life of a young dragon. This is combined with the popular flash-forwards of TV-show-CSI-style to be seen as something scientific, which definitely is not. In many cases, the arguments / clues are implausible. In some cases, the clues used to show that the dragons possibly existed, flew or spit fire are simply invalid. Seeing this only causes me to have cramps in my toes. Even a fantasy movie needs a certain degree of reality, but it simply does not. In short: it's a pretentious fantasy documentary by CSI, which is not worth seeing.
