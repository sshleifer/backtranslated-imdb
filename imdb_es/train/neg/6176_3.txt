I'm not a big fan of the Stooges slap, but his story seems interesting to me. Recently I tried to see things from every Stooge era, but the opportunity to see Joe's shorts does not seem to be easy; This is the only one I've seen so far. <br /> <br /> Some say that the quality problems with Joe's era shorts really are not Joe's fault, and I suspect that's the case. Joe as an actor is far from the worst of this. What bothers me most has been pointed out in another comment: the confrontation of the other boys against the third violates the whole spirit of team-comedy / Stooges. Maybe Joe's style was perceived, by those in charge, as something that did not really fit, although there were no real conflicts outside the camera between him and the others, and that was his way of solving it. <br /> <br /> And what about the titles of this and some of the other Stooges shorts? Definitely a lack of creativity there. Was that kind of thing the cause or effect of the drying market?
