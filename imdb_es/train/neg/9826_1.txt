I suppose this would be a great movie for a true believer in organized Christian dogma, but for anyone with an open mind who believes in free will, rational thought, separation of Church and State and GOOD Science fiction, it is a terrible joke! br /> <br /> There are some well-known actors who needed a lot of work or had the need to share their personal beliefs with the rest of us pagans. <br /> <br /> I entertained myself with this Movie in the same way that I entertained myself with "Reefer Madness". That film tried to teach drug education through fear tactics in the same way that this film tries to teach "Christian" principles with the threat of hell and misery for good people who do not share their interpretations of our world. <br /> <br /> It made me laugh out loud and at the same time it scared me to realize how many people really think our society should go back to the old days of the 19th century.
