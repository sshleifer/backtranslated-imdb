I just saw The Convent for the second time. I had enjoyed it before and I thought it would be a good Friday night movie, some blood, some style, some humor and things like that. I was sad to discover that I could not appreciate it very much anymore. It seemed that someone had proposed to see the epics of the cheese ball as The Night of the Demons for a modern audience, but lost the things that made the original worthwhile. For the record, I'm not even a big fan of The Night of the Devils, but there are some things that really interested me. The convent makes cheese but not so much goodness. Apart from the main girl (nice performance of Joanna Canton), the gothic girl and a sweet cameo by Adrienne Barbeau, almost all the characters were unbearably unpleasant, suppurating at the absolute lowest levels of offensive and absurd clumsiness. The film is severely hampered by the complete lack of free nudes, which means that, given the terrible dialogue, it is difficult to see the characters and harder to appreciate the positive points of the film. The evil nuns are original in design and have many good scenes, although they are not scary, they are certainly a bit great, and the movie also shows a fair amount of clean blood. Towards the end, when Adrienne Barbeau appears on the scene, the film becomes quite entertaining because all the odious people are dead and she is a frantic evil nun. The stylized steering also occasionally produces good results, although sometimes the camera moves too fast. In short, this was a film in which, for me, the bright spots can not compensate for the things I hated. Those more fond of this type of movie can enjoy much more, but for me it was not a good time.
