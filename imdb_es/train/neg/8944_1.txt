I saw this movie last year in the Media class and I have to say that I really hated it. I was 10 years old (and 15 years old), so I may have something to do with that. But for English this year, year 11, we had to read Animal Farm, also by George Orwell. Apart from the fact that the book is based on the Revolution, my opinion is that it is a terrible book, and I also hated it. <br /> <br /> But in 1984, I think it was the most disturbing movie I have. Ever seen, and I think George Orwell is one of the most disturbed people who have ever lived on this planet. I'm sorry for everyone who loved their work, but unfortunately I did not. The themes of the film were well represented, but the way the movie was set up and the events that took place within it did not conform to my standards. This is just my opinion, and I am sure that many other people enjoyed this movie very much.
