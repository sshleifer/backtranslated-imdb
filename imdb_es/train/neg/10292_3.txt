It has its merit; Morvern Callar is both merit and disappointment. It is so enigmatic, so original. Is it your method of dealing with the pain of a loss that is making you so distant and incomparable? Or is it like a critic called her a revolutionary? Personally I would call it dysfunctional. <br /> <br /> Morvern is separating completely. By getting rid of her boyfriend, without thinking about informing the family or using the money she gave him for a proper funeral, she selfishly goes on a trip to Spain. She seems so devoid of anything relatively human greed. The only element that allows the public to see their human side is their close friend who takes vacations with her. Although in the end her friend is abandoned and Morvern has nothing to link her to humanity. She could have killed herself too. <br /> <br /> Despite having made Spain look as gloomy and bland as the UK, the director's shots were excellent, lighting and color made the film visually stunning. <br /> <br /> It's really a pity that the movie has nothing to keep the interest. It's just over 90 minutes but it feels much longer. They manage to make Morvern look interesting to get your attention, but do not do anything with it, just pushing it away from you to the point where you do not worry about the characters or the movie.
