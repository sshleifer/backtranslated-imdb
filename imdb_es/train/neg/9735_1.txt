I tried as much as I could sit all the way through this annoying mess, but I just could not do it. Brad Dourif absolutely stank as a leader and the whole cast of support was only a little worse. <br /> <br /> All this is just ridiculous, from the horrible acting to the ridiculous FX to the stupid plot. <br /> <br /> Complete loss of time; do not bother The root canal therapy would be more pleasant. The bamboo chips under the nails would be much nicer. <br /> <br /> Watching a Uwe Boll movie would be just a little worse than this. Get the idea?
