This is really the most terrible movie I've ever seen. I just have no idea how anyone has the audacity to release this. <br /> <br /> The production standards are atrocious. There is no pretension here in cinematography. The work of the camera, the scripts, the acting and the sound are incredibly rude. I think there is a plot, but it could have been done in 10 minutes saving time to see it. The hysterical neurotic girls in the center of this article have no credibility whatsoever. <br /> <br /> I urge everyone to avoid spending time or money on this Title. It is truly atrocious. <br /> <br /> JDD - December 14, 2008
