['Well, after seeing this invigorating movie and losing an hour and so many minutes of my life, here is the basic summary: Genie comes out of the ghetto boom box, gives this boy with hairy hair 3 wishes, the boy loses his desires to forget what, shaq sucks when rapping, and I guess that&#39;s it. <br /><br /> So mainly I laughed, I cried ... but mostly I laughed at the comedy that came out of the wonderful acting skills of an NBA player / rapper and a guy with hairy hair. <br /><br /> I highly recommend this movie for college kids sitting around having a few beers with their close friends and they have a great need to laugh. <br /><br /> I&#39;m going to give you 3 out of 10 only b / c the movie is based on 3 magic wishes. <br /><br /> If I had 3 wishes, one would erase this horrible movie and have everyone pretend that Hollywood did not spend money doing this.']
