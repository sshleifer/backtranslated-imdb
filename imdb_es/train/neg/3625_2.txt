This is a film that belongs firmly to the 50s. Surprisingly, the American Film Institute has chosen it for the best 100 American films of all time. I've seen virtually every movie on that list, and this is the most disappointing of all. The musical numbers (and many, many of them) are VERY long and boring, and have no connection with the story. The end of the film has a horribly long ballet sequence, which naturally has no real relation to the story of the film. It must be admitted that it is very well done, that the music is good and that the dance is performed with the highest professional level, but there is no real reason why the sequence is included in the film. <br /> <br /> The main character of the film is extremely childish and unpleasant and behaves in a carefree way. His mental age is about 14 years. If you want to see a good musical about the "golden age" of musicals, go and see "Singing in the rain".
