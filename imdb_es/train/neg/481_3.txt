Every time a film is so myopic in its desire to present a particular ending or point of view that it simply does not bother with a real story, it is annoying. Those are the types of movies where the ending or the point of view is conceived first, and the story simply continues. For this reason, we often talk about history "jumping through hoops", as it twists, trying in vain to move towards the predetermined end in a logical way. <br /> <br /> The story on "Comet Over Broadway" does not do it. Not only jump through the hoops, it's a three-ring circus. It's so ridiculous, so ill-conceived, so nifty that, if you're prone to talking loudly on the screen, you'll have a big rant before it's over. <br /> <br /> The central theme of this cesspool script is that of a woman who chooses between family and profession. Since everything is so terribly confusing, it will end up being offensive to people of any opinion. Then, in the end, the story does not make sense, the subject becomes irrelevant and, as is the case with bad scripts, acting does not save anything.
