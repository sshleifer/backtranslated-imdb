: Spoilers: <br /> <br /> I was very disappointed by Love's enduring joy. I had been waiting a long time to see it and finally had the opportunity when it was reissued on Thursday night in Hallmark. I love the first three movies "Love", but this was nothing like I thought it would be. The whole movie was sad and depressing, there were many pitfalls, and the editing was very bad, many scenes out of context. I also think that the death of baby Kathy happened very soon and the appearance of Clarks in the movie just did not seem to fit. It seemed that none of the actors really wanted to be there, they all lacked emotion. Missie and Willie did not seem to interact at all. <br /> <br /> I think the writers should have gone beyond the book. It seems that every film that has been made so far slips farther and farther from the writings of Janette Oke. I mean, they never mentioned anything about the mine in the movie and that the two kids or Clark got hurt by that. And I think the reactions of Missie and Willies to Kathy's death could have been shown and heard instead of just being heard. <br /> <br /> Of the four films that have been made so far, I have to say that Love's Aliding Joy is my least favorite. I hope that with the next four films we will follow more of the book and if the Clarks character is in They, I hope you have a more important part and that your part is not so insipid. I also hope there's more of Scottie and Cookie and maybe even of Marty, but who knows what the screenwriters will have next.
