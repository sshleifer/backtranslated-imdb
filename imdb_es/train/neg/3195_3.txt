Two qualified front: actually I think Joe Don Baker can be good or even excellent with the right material and the right director (the remake of "Cape Fear", a small role in "Goldeneye", "Walking Tall"). And I even liked Baker in "Mitchell", because he was playing against a hero who was SUPPOSED to be nasty. Yes, the coverage of MST3K was very funny, but they took many pictures of Baker, which he did not deserve, to keep things animated and entertaining. It was appropriate for the level and tone of the movie, and it was the best part. of the movie. <br /> <br /> "Final justice" seems to be more of the same, but despite the exotic locations and the "cowboy border justice" issue, it's a bit weaker than "Mitchell." And the main reason is that Baker's character, as it is written, is an idiot. The film has the idea that because Baker embodies the machismo of the old-style border, he challenges his opponents to the old-fashioned hand-to-hand fast drawing contests. And because he is so strong and macho, he always wins, even when he is wounded, injured, outnumbered, etc. <br /> <br /> That is a conceit with a lot of potential (it worked for Gary Cooper), even if he condemns the film to the state of the movie "B". But Baker is so stupid and obsessive that he unnecessarily challenges three of the bad man's men to a confrontation in a public market, with civilians everywhere. I COULD have simply followed them to the chief of the bad guys' headquarters (so I was following them first) and they would never have noticed. Or he could have thrown them over and forced him to surrender, and had managed to get one of the henchmen to take him to headquarters at gunpoint. But no, he has to be a hot dog in the league and a male head butt, and that's why he gets a child taken hostage in the shooting that follows! <br /> <br /> This is a boy we're supposed to admire? <br /> <br /> The whole movie is basically like that. Most of the supporting actors are somewhere between OK (the henchmen) and quite good (the boss of the bad guys and their father, who are two well-known European actors, they just follow the motions, but they are professionals and even criticize them ). They are decent). But in spite of everything, Baker's character makes stupid and unproductive tricks and mistakes that kill at least two relatively innocent people, plus a couple of bad guys who could have been captured without the use of deadly force. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, since 90% of the film is set in Malta or the Mediterranean, you can see many beautiful landscapes and many beautiful and exotic extras. And really, Baker himself may be on the heavy and slightly dyspeptic side, but it's not that bad ... it's certainly not the little tub that these movie critics (like Mike and the Bots in their gracious coverage) seem to think. <br /> <br /> In summary, this movie is good for the video wallpaper, but the viewer should not pay attention to it.
