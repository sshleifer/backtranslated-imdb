This was a truly insipid movie. The performances are third class, and the dialogue is so forced that sometimes it seems that it just rolled and died. My reason for renting this was simple: find a movie with script writing. I needed visual help for my presentation, so I thought why not use a clip? Chico was wrong After looking in my local video store, I came across this, where he was suspiciously titled "Starstruck". I thought: "What the hell?", And I decided to try it. Well, I was very unhappy with my results. Maybe there was a scene I could use, and in the meantime, I was practically falling asleep due to the sheer banality of the movie. So ... I took this back and picked up Ed Wood. There is a movie that I can use as an example. On the other hand, anything would be presentable compared to the nonsense that is "Starfucker".
