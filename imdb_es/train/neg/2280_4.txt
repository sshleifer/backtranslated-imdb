It is the nature of companies trying to capitalize on the success of others. Here we have a movie with elements from the previous 'Dracula' (1931) and 'Frankenstein' (1931) - in a Germanic city, the village leaders believe that vampires (in the form of bats) have been the cause of recent Deaths of Victims without blood. Although it was filmed in Universal (and in the Bronson caves!) It is a feature of Poverty Row; it is not fair to compare it with the previous films, more expensive and superior. <br /> <br /> From the familiar and thrilling and chilling music of the main titles (which must have been from Mischa Bakalienikoff), through the talky but well done opening sequence, we anticipated the arrival of Lionel Atwill, Fay Wray and Dwight Frye to give us a good mystery movie from the 30s. Unfortunately, it does not happen. That is the disappointment. <br /> <br /> We have little more than the formulated elements of such films but with slow pace, low budget, not enough of Dwight Frye, the exaggerated presence of Maude Eburne (Aunt Gussie), and the premise for Lionel Atwill (Dr. von Niemann) requires human blood or how he shows mind control over his servant Emil (Robert Frazier) was never very clear. <br /> <br /> Do not look at the tecnicolor "Dr. X" (1932), which also stars Lionel Atwill and Fay Wray but as father and daughter, before seeing this as I did, it's an Oscar winner in comparison, so look at this first, structurally, 'The Vampire Bat' is still not so good, in addition to talking too much or unnecessary comic relief, without focusing too much on vampiric villainy. <br /> <br /> of 'Dr. X' and 'Mystery of the Wax Museum' (both in 1932 and co-starring Fay Wray), the most famous appearances of Lionel Atwill are like the gendarme armed in 'Son of Frankenstein' (1939) and as Moriarity in "Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon" (1943) Dwight Frye steals all his manic scenes in 'Dracula' (1931) As the 'young lovers', Melvin Douglas and Fay Wray have a good kissing scene, but that's it It can be seen in 'The Old Dark House' (1932), and Fay is dragged by Joel McCrea in 'The Most Dangerous Game' (1930). go is his classic 'screamer' of 1933. Pity more time, money and rewrites were not available for this film to better show the talents and chemistry of Lionel Atwill, Fay Wray and Dwight Frye. Unfortunately, then, this sadly disappointing movie only gets a 4.
