The film only has one flaw, unfortunately this failure damages all the credibility of the piece. <br /> <br /> Start with the condemnation of the Israeli occupation of the territories in dispute. It does not address the reason why the Israelis are there. Egypt, Syria, Iraq and Jordan attacked Israel. This is the reason why Israel "occupies" its land, because those countries lost it in a war they started. <br /> <br /> The movie also states that Israel has defied the UN by failing to comply with Resolution 242. The problem is, 242 was rejected immediately after its start by ..... the Palestinians, nullifying. <br /> <br /> Many films were well put together and can actually show images that change their mind, but remember, when you look at something, you do not believe anything you hear, and only half of what you see. <br /> <br /> All the participants in this film are well-known critics of Israel, and some have made many anti-Semitic public comments, eliminating any possible credibility of their words. <br /> <br /> All participants have an extreme need for a real history lesson that is taught objectively, not by any Palestinian supporter.
