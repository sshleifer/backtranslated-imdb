Is Miike like Chabrol, alternating art with dreck, sometimes confusing the two? Does any claim for Chabrol match the fifty / fifty rate? Do we see here too much or too little Miike? I do not know. I do not know. I do not know. But it could easily fill ten lines only because of the thefts, allusions and clich√©s of Chakushin ari (One Missed Call). Others here will face most of them, although it may not be Ochiai's Saimin (Hypnosis) for the sordid television broadcast causing supernatural things. Just once, when Yumi takes the zombie mother in her arms, One Called Call startled me a little. <br /> <br /> Another point of interest: Renji Ishibashi (looks like Christopher Walken) as the detective. Ishibashi in Audition's abusive storyline, and as Dead or Alive's Boss Aoki from the drowning dung vat and more, may be the most convincingly evil character actor I've ever seen. So here is a policeman.
