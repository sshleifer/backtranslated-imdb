I will warn you here: I chose to believe those critics who said that this was not an action movie in the usual sense, but a psychological drama, so you should appreciate it and it will be fine. <br /> <br /> I am here to tell you that you were wrong. Completely wrong. <br /> <br /> Well, no, not completely; It's very disappointing if you're looking for an action movie, they were right about that. But it is also very unsatisfactory at all other levels. <br /> <br /> Tom Beringer was not so bad, I suppose, not worse than normal; But what possessed them to drive Billy Zane into this? Was it some kind of death wish on the part of the producers? A way to make your movie a guaranteed failure? In that case, it worked. <br /> <br /> If you were really looking for success, why not choose someone who can act? Oh, and it could well go to a writer who knows how to write. Oh, yes, and a director who knows how to direct. <br /> <br /> As someone who sat in this mess, believing that he would shortly be redeemed, I can assure you that he never did. Too bad, it could have been a good movie.
