The "mathematical" aspect of this is simply a trick to try to establish this television program apart from the millions of other police programs. The only redeeming aspect of this show is Rob Morrow, although his career must have been (undeserved) in decline after Northern Exposure if he enrolled in this sorcerer. <br /> <br /> Laziness of the "mathematical" aspect The show is encapsulated in an episode co-starring Lou Diamond Phillips (which only confirms that this show is the last refuge of the condemned). To catch a fugitive, the "mathematician" uses some theory about "bubbles". So, give this long explanation that, if we have seen the suspect in places A, B and C, then we can use the "bubble theory" to calculate where it might be. He does everything on a blackboard, or maybe with a stick on the ground (I can not remember). <br /> <br /> Anyway, when you look at the finished product, it basically took three points and chose a point. right in the middle and said: "Ok, mathematically, this is where we are most likely to find the fugitive." At that point, another character points out "Oh, that point is also the cabin where the guy used to live." Is that mathematical? It's not even connect-the-f ** k ** g-dots !!! This program reminds me of the specialty in mathematics with which I used to work in banking and had a mathematical analysis I could do to "support" the points that everyone else had already agreed on through a less complex analysis or basic common sense. <Br /> <br /> It simply shows: when you're a hammer, everything looks like a nail. I can not wait until they put the NUMB3RS team in OSAMA ... They will use calculations, they will call an airstrike in the middle of the mountains, and they will hit Osama and they will not even scratch the five children he uses as human shields ... Cuz hey ... it's all about the numbers. <br /> <br /> TV program totally ridiculous.
