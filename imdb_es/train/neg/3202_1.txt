If you ever hear these three words ... "Joe Don Baker", be afraid ... <br /> <br /> Final Justice is the low budget action movie based on a sheriff in a Texas city called Geronimo (pronounced as Heronimo). He is an ugly, thin and rude character who is in search of a criminal in Malta who killed his partner in Texas. His partner actually collapses twice in the movie. Very bad edition. Joe Don Baker (Geronimo) ends up in jail like 4 or 5 times in this movie, making the plot go nowhere fast. In addition, he shoots everyone as if he were in the wild west. I guess nobody told him it was the 20th century. A female police officer is assigned to show her around Malta (which resembles Elaine de Seinfeld) and she is the only one who can stand the hustler. She must be crazy! <br /> <br /> The strippers in the bar are the most entertaining characters in this movie. Her dance is shown throughout the film and I began to bond with the women of bad death. Well, at least it was better than seeing Geronimo try to play the fool to get out of something. The ending is flawed and somewhat predictable, and I was glad that it was finally over. You will never forget the last line of Joe Don Baker of the movie. <br /> <br /> It's so hard to imagine how it was in THREE Bond movies ... very weird! Anyway, if you're laughing, then see this on MST3K at some point. In addition, I heard his other bad movie (among many), the "Mitchell" version MST3K is being released on DVD by Rhino. I can not wait to see that!
