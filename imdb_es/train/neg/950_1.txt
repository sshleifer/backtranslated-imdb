I picked up this movie on AZN on cable. It seemed like it would be a good movie, a Japanese "green card". I can not say that I have ever disliked an Asian movie, quite the opposite. Some of the most incredible horror films of all time are Japanese and Korean, and I am a HUGE fan of John Woo's films in Hong Kong. I am not adverse to a happy movie, like Tampopo or Chung King Express (two of my favorites), so I thought I would like this. Well, I'd rather cut my wrists and drink my own blood than see this laborious and badly acted movie once more. <br /> <br /> I think that director Steven Okazaki must have punctured the water with Quaalude, because no one is. This movie had personality. And when one of the characters tried to act, instead of muttering a line or two, their performance was forced and incredibly false. Honestly, I did not think anyone had acted before ... the ONLY person who sounded genuine was Brenda Aoki. I find it incredible that this is promoted as a comedy, because I did not laugh once. Even more surprising is that the CBS morning news called this "a refreshing comedy breath". It was neither refreshing, nor a breath of comedy. And the ending was very predictable, the previous critic must be an idiot to think such things. <br /> <br /> AVOID this movie unless you want to see a predictable and boring plot that acts on wood. In fact, I think "Spike of Bensonhurst" is a better movie than this ... and I went to the middle of that movie!
