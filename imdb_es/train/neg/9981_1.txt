['This film was cataloged like a comedy and a mystery. It fails badly in both. The only mystery here is why someone would make a movie so poorly constructed. The only comedy is the laughter I got when I saw how tall they were classified here. Could there be two movies with the same name? The movie I saw starred a girl with beautiful blue eyes and a plot that was not there. <br /><br />']
