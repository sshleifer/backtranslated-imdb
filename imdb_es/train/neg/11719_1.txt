In the words of Charles Dance's character in this movie, "Bollocks!" No plot, no character development, and absolutely incredible. <br /> <br /> Filled with things that just do not happen in the real world (since when were the British police inspectors armed with guns in the shoulder bags?). Full of errors (Bulgarian trains in London?). Full of boring and artificial dialogue. And the direction / editing is dreadful: trembling camera shots that add nothing to the movie, except for a vague feeling of dizziness; confusing jump cuts; without structure. <br /> <br /> The character of Wesley Snipes is totally unfriendly, why should we worry about what happens to him? Direct to the video? Straight to the dump!
