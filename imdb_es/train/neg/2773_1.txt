Up to this point, Gentle Rain was the movie that I found the worst in history. It has been supplanted by this Asian box office success. It has a "star" and it's John Rhys Davies. He is out of shape to be the fanatic of magic and the magical flight that is thrown here. The rest of these people could not leave a secondary work. There were no clich√©s in the dialogue, and the special effects were called as often as possible. <br /> <br /> It's pretty easy to see that someone in Asia had a few dollars and needed to create a vehicle for some actors. They wanted to throw money at Or maybe it was a director or a writer who needed a loan. I suppose any career with this movie in your credential. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a big favor and do not watch this movie. A hundred Thanksgiving could not consume this turkey. <br /> <br /> The only funny scene was not intentional. The king's brother appears at the scene. The king? A handsome, older, short Asian actor. (Bad actor.) The brother? A European six foot. (Also a bad actor.) No excuses were made for this. They just hoped that we would not notice that the brother of this poor man, Jet Li, was an aspiring Pierce Brosnan in a cheap wig "Injun", taken from an old western film of the 1940s.
