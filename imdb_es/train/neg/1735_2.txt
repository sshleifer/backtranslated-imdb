I get the feeling that the producers of this mess were going to make the most painful and ridiculous western that has ever been made. "PAINFUL" is the best word I can think of to describe it. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, she has a good color photograph and the beautiful and well-spoken Rhonda Fleming. My condolences go to Jacques Aubuchon (who played the cripple), who acted well enough in an annoying role, written so outrageously that no actor could offer a pleasant performance. The production values ​​were quite good, which only served to highlight the terrible story and the script. <br /> <br /> Things I hated: Stewart Granger looked so little like a Western figure, with his British accent, his tailored suit, and an immaculate, always white handkerchief tied around his neck. He became tired the way the city people and his son were constantly scolding and insulting Granger, and he never responded or responded. I know we're supposed to suspend disbelief and appreciate Westerns while playing symbolic morality, but it broke the spell with ridiculously unreal and predictable scenes, the worst being at the end where Granger miraculously, quickly and unaided, dynamite plant around a canyon Pass through which the bad boy's cattle will pass, and then Granger plants himself in the perfect place so that he can shoot the dynamite from a very far distance to create rock slides to bury and scare the cattle and the boy bad, apparently destroying them all, except the two bad principals. The worst is all about the plot, which is full of soap opera scenes. Nothing in the film seemed credible: I could not believe what the whole conflict was about. The bad boy led his flock to the market and wanted the cows to chew some grass on the road; I do not see why something could not have been resolved. Do you need a dispute over the ownership of the land for that? Do not bother to see it.
