I read somewhere that when Kay Francis refused to accept a wage cut, Warner Bros. retaliated by sending her to lower projects for the rest of her contract. <br /> <br /> She decided to keep the money. But his career suffered accordingly. <br /> <br /> That could explain what I was doing in "Comet Over Broadway". (Although it does not explain why Donald Crisp and Ian Hunter are also in it). "Ludicrous" is the word that others have used for the plot of this film, and that is the right thing to do. The murder trial. His sordid vaudeville career. Your success in London. His final scene with his daughter. No part leads logically to the next part. <br /> <br /> In addition, the sets and the costumes seemed like B-movie things. And his hair! Turner is showing many of his films this month. Look at any other and you will do yourself a favor.
