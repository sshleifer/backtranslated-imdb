This film began with something similar to a plot, then abandoned it for an endless series of characters and random encounters that have nothing to do with advancing the story. It was impossible to remain committed to this movie. This movie is a very cynical pile of trash made by some people with animation skills but who are totally lacking in creativity or ability to tell stories. It's a surprisingly bad effort coming from a large studio. Clearly, there are moral and motivational issues at Disney, not to mention a complete lack of supervision and quality control. That management allowed this film to see the light of day, says a lot about its incompetence and its desperation. This movie joins my very short list of "worst movies of all time".
