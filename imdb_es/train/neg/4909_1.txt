That's right, you've heard me. I'm a big fan of James Patterson. I own 10 of his books, and I've read the entire Lindsey Boxer series. In my opinion, the scriptwriter must be shot. <br /> <br /> What right did a filmmaker have to kill an excellent work of fiction and turn it into a mockery of the mysterious genre? If I ever thought that Harry Potter was killed, then Michael O'Hara has shown me that he was wrong. <br /> <br /> I can only pray that the next screenwriter who tackles this fabulous book will do much more justice. To Michael O'Hara and Russell Mulcahy: do not give up your daily work.
