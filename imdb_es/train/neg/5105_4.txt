I suppose there are some who remember Nicole Eggert from her girlish days on TV shows like T.J. Hooker, Charles in charge, and Who is the boss? You pervert, you! Maybe you remember her from Baywatch when she grew up and had breast implants. It does not matter, surely you will forget her in this supposed comedy about man-eating extraterrestrials. <br /> <br /> There are so many things that do not make sense and are never explained. How did you recognize the alien? Why was the alien hot for paprika and cinnamon? Why did not the alien eat it? You have an idea <br /> <br /> Before the alien eats her boyfriend and assumes his identity, you can see her in the body of Alex Meneses. This Mexican / Ukrainian beauty is the only reason to observe this garbage. Stay for the shower scene and the groom, and continue with your business.
