Unless you're a geek film student who has to see everything, this movie will not only be a waste of time and money and a big disappointment, it will also make you angry beyond belief. <br /> <br /> It may be a story worth telling somewhere inland, but Hopkins decided to hide it and encode it under so many incessant chaotic layers of seemingly random audio video microcuts, which makes patience of the spectator runs out after a very short time. <br /> <br /> Why? Would someone like Hopkins choose a project as heavy, difficult and highly unstable as his first script, his first score and his third film? Maybe he played with that in his mind for so long until he became unrecognizable as what he became, not even to himself. The result shows that you do not have enough experience or ability to achieve the desired result. <br /> <br /> Even the strangest films of Carpenter and Lynch, to name only two unconventional filmmakers, had 90% more coherence, 95% fewer characters and 99% more story flow. <br /> <br /> Sir Anthony took aim at the stars, but unfortunately he was lost for a couple of light years. Please continue to act, in that department you are a giant without equal and no one should ask for more, not even yourself!
