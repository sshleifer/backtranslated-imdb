This series has its occasional ups and downs and casualties, and the latter is the case, here. There is a good amount of splashing, with an inventive implementation of the Baby Cart weapons, but the editing of the film is a serious problem, the film becomes harder than normal. Sometimes, the action slows down as the camera follows the wordless tramps of the "puppy", which is almost lost at the beginning. In general, disappointment. <br /> <br /> That said, there is an oriental quality of spaghetti in music and action that can win the approval of dedicated viewers. This installment devotes much of its time to the small misadventures of the child, who begins to look towards the abyss of death that his father opened for him.
