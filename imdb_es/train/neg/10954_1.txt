If there was a rating of 0 stars, I would gladly deliver it to this waste pile absolutely horrible. The fact that the actual summary is perfectly fine and that if it had been done differently could have been brilliant, it only makes it worse. The basic task of locking up a group of people in an experimental chamber is fine, but WHAT IS THE EXPERIMENT? All I see is a group of unintelligent surfers and blondes who talk about music and culture and I do not know or want to know ... The challenges are pathetic and foolish. The whole point of reality television is to show reality. If you establish a "challenge," do not make them play with exaggerated food items and stereotyped cultural elements in the "Friday night games." Make them make a real challenge. And as for making money in prizes, that's fine, if they really win it! These people are crazy. If they only made the show better, the real idea would be glorious. But that is not going to happen!
