I have to say that I generally like horror movies that I've never seen ... however, this was just pathetic for my bloody taste. I'm used to bloody, heartbreaking types ... but this particular movie was scant. The acting was horrible (however, the cheesy (no pun intended) of a single line were cute). And the sequel to it, Scarecrow Slayer was even worse! Yes, probably, when it first came out, there was a big fuss about it and people liked it. But when films like The Ring and The Exorcist of Emily Rose go on sale, movies like these make films like Scarecrow look childish. If you want a movie to pass the time, choose this one! The special effects are cheesy as hell. But seeing as it was a low budget movie, I can see where it would come from. This will remind you of the movie "Children of Corn." Independent rock movies ... most of the time. So, if you want to see a scarecrow killing people with corn cobs, or in the sequel, 2 scarecrows, then these movies would be for you.
