I bought the DVD version of this film on the recommendation of my wife who loved the version she saw on television. But the version put on DVD was a disaster. The lighting was scarce or nonexistent and the complete scenes were simply eliminated. In one case, Adele is going to bed, and immediately we move on to another scene, entering in the middle of the sentence, where it is the next night. Characters like Grace Poole and Mason do not even show up, so you wonder if they fell asleep for a few minutes during the movie. <br /> <br /> The DVD that we saw was produced by Platinum Disc Corp and even at $ 6.32 it was a gyp. <br /> <br /> Be careful with the version of this movie you buy! We are sending this back.
