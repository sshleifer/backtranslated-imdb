The movie is actually very slow. There are some beautiful images, but it can not overcome the fact that the movie is boring. You see a sexual relationship with many watermelons and a sexual relationship while eating a melon and maybe a little more. It may seem even interesting to someone, but believe me that watching it for 2 hours is not fun at all. Although you laugh several times, but in reality it is not enough and it may be more out of desperation and disbelief than fun. To annoy the director of boredom try to put some video clips of movies in the movie. They are really colorful clips of absurd songs from the 50s, but it's hard to say exactly and they're trying to be funny so much that it's really sad. Several times you have the feeling that the plot could evolve into something, that a powerful scene is being created, but in the end it simply evaporates and that's it. In addition to the clips, there are almost no dialogues and much less music. The director tries to be original and artistic at all costs. Personally I can not recommend the movie. I think art is something that should not be boring. During the screening there was a great yawn throughout the cinema, which corroborates my brief review.
