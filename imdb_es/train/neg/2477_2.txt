If you want to know the true history of Wendigo, I suggest you buy a copy of the original story by Algernon Blackwell. This movie was not only bad, it had nothing to do with the book. <br /> <br /> I loved the book when I read it when I was a kid (in EM Freeman's "Campfire Chillers") and I was so excited to see it. A movie based on it came out. I was so disappointed when I finally saw it. Another thing is that there were too many nuances of PC (Politically Right) throughout the film that had no place in the film. When the book was written, the PC did not even exist. <br /> <br /> My suggestion is that you do not waste time or money! If you see it on the shelf of the video store, leave it there.
