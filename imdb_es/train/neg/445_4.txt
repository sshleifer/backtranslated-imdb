One thing that amazed me about this film (and not in a good way) was that Nathan Stoltzfus, who seems to be proud to be the main historian on the Rosenstrasse theme, was one of the historians who worked on this film, considering how much of it of real events were altered or ignored. <br /> <br /> Another critic said that von Trotta said that she never intended for Lena to go to bed with Goebbels, but in that case, why did she give all the impression that this was what had happened? Why not show other possible reasons for the liberation of men, such as the disaster that was Stalingrad, or the fear of the Nazis that the international press, based in Berlin, knew about the protest? <br /> <br /> Also, why does the whole story play a secondary role to a story of weak family ties that has been made over and over again? Surely something as impressive as this could lead your own story! In some places, it was as if the movie had two story lines that really seemed to have little in common. <br /> <br /> In general, this film failed in its objective, which was to draw attention to a little known act of resistance, which is a shame, because if it is done better, it could have had a great impact.
