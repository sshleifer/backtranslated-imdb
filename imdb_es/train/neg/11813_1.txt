Before Stan Laurel became the smallest half of the best comedy team of all time, he worked under contract with the Broncho Billy Anderson in a series of cheap films, many of which were parodies of major Hollywood films. After a dispute with Anderson, Laurel continued the informal parody series at Joe Rock's smallest (and most destitute) production company. <br /> <br /> Most of Laurel's parody movies were just a little funny at the time, and even less fun. for modern audiences who have not seen the original movie that Laurel is parodying. 'West of Hot Dog' is a fairly generic parody of cowboys' cowboys. It is marginally a specific parody of 'West of the Pecos', a restaurant launched two years earlier with no major actors. Since 'West of the Pecos' was never a big hit, it's hard to see why Stan's film unit chose this particular film as a goal of its lampooner√≠a, let alone why they waited so long after its release for parody it And where did they get that title 'West of Hot Dog'? Possibly because of the fact that 'Hot dog!' It was a sexual interjection favored by American dairymen in the 1920s. (As in the opening scene of the play 'Machinal'). <br /> <br /> 'West of Hot Dog' was produced and co-directed by Joe Rock. Among his many other accomplishments, Rock introduced Laurel to Lois Neilson, and later was the best man at his wedding. Full disclosure: in the last years of his life, I had the great privilege of making friends with Joe Rock and interviewing him. Almost ninety years old at the time, Rock's memory was impressively clear ... but he did not remember anything about "West of Hot Dog," and I can not blame him. This movie is easily forgettable. <br /> <br /> The protagonist's character is called Little Mustard: if it's supposed to be a parody of something in 'West of the Pecos', I do not understand it. There are a couple of 'impossible' gags here, including Laurel's method of riding a horse. For just a moment in this movie, Stan Laurel reminded me of the great Buster Keaton when he suddenly started running. "West of Hot Dog" is vaguely similar in theme and tone to Keaton's short comedy "The Frozen North," but Keaton's version is much more fun. The plot of this film somehow anticipates a situation in Keaton's feature film "Our Hospitality" but (again) suffers by comparison: here, two hard varmint brothers hope to inherit the Last Chance Saloon, but the previous owner has bequeathed it to the weak foot of Stan. However, the brothers will become the legal heirs if Stan dies. Hmmm ... <br /> <br /> Seriously, though: is such a legacy legal? As soon as Stan takes possession of the property, surely any other question of property or inheritance will become his decision, not the decision of the previous owner. I had a lot of time to consider such points of the law while watching this boring comedy. <br /> <br /> At one point, a joke involves a raw animation drawn directly on the film. It seems cheap and it's not funny. <br /> <br /> This 'Hot Dog' is not a weiner, nor a winner: it's just a whiner. My rating: a point of 10. Wait, Stan: in a few years you'll be half of a comedy legend.
