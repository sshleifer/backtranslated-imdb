This movie was absolutely pathetic. A pitiful script and the lack of any story let me see three losers drooling over bikini babies. Sometimes I felt I was watching an episode of Beavis and Butthead. I could not even sit through the whole movie. Emran Hashmi disappoints, and Hrshitta Bhatt is not impressive at all. Celina Jaitley was not bad. The only worthwhile part of the film is the parody of Anu Malik and his obsession with the Shayaris. It was pretty hilarious. The songs "Sini Ne" and its remix version were really good. You can always count on Emran's lip lock and the lip synchronization of a chartbuster. In general, it seems that Emran does not have a good script for the Bhatts to back him up this time.
