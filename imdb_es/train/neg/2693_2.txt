<br /> <br /> Although the main actress is incredibly beautiful, the plot has little chance of acceptance because too many distracting details confront the audience during the development of the story. <br /> <br /> One can believe that in the 1950s, middle-class teenagers easily gave away their virginity without thinking about marrying 30-year-olds who barely know, but I doubt it. <br /> <br /> One can believe that young high school teenagers are highly confident and self-confident when interacting with their elders in complex social situations, but my experience has been, most of the time , adolescents feel very uncomfortable and act clumsily when experimenting in the adult world. <br /> <br /> One can believe that an experienced doctor would not know the pungent odor of Stroptomycin, the malodorous fermentation byproduct of microbes from the occupied earth, and will not detect that a soft lifeless powder is false, but I think that do not. br /> <br /> One can believe that the 30-year-old rioters can enter and stay inside a public school recreation room during a social gathering and generate problems, but I think social gatherings are traditionally a protected environment and parents, parents and school personnel would be present to prevent this. <br /> <br /> One last nit, along Hey Babu Riba, the five teenage friends referred to themselves as the four. There is probably an explanation of why the FIVE were the FOUR, but as they were never detailed, each reference distracts from each scene. <br /> <br /> This movie did not seem true to me.
