And the Oscar for the most underrated classic horror actor goes to: Dwight Frye. Seriously, his name must appear with the same fear as Karloff, Lugosi and Price, and this movie proves it. Her character Herman was one of the 2 reasons why I can give to see this movie. Dwight gave this combination a little more than a little disturbed an adorable but spooky attitude that led you to expect a more important role in the entire film. <br /> <br /> The other reason is the comic relief of M. Eburne. I am in the medical profession and I have to congratulate myself for the expert performance of a hypochondriac prone to self-pity. Although other "medical errors" caused a short laugh, especially when the good doctor tests the medication to his fellow doctors ... "Well, continue giving it to him" Unfortunately, these 2 outstanding performances could not keep me awake in 3 attempts to sit unbearably movie slow The plot is predictable with only a few minor twists. Filming while getting a creepy, legitimate atmosphere was more productive to make me yawn. Yes, you can use too much shadow. <br /> <br /> My recommendation: look at this once to see Frye and Eburne, but only when you are fully awake And with a lot of caffeine.
