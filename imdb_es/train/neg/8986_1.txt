THIS FILM IS LAME, LAME, LAME !!!!! It takes a lot to exaggerate too much about a movie, but this movie stunk my house !! I have not even finished the movie yet and I had to stop to comment on how bad this movie is. I HAVE NEVER DONE THAT!! As a consumer, do not spend your money on this movie. Wait until it comes out through a cable channel or something. Barely worth the television. I REALLY HATE TO DETAIL A MOVIE, BUT THIS MOVIE IS THE TRASH! Just above porn. There should be and X rating! Good plot, some frontal nudity (if that floats your boat), but HORRIBLE high school level performance. I do not know how this movie received distribution. (It must have been a contractual matter). Actually, if you really like to watch good movies, do not waste your time with this one. From one movie lover to another. You will be crazy about yourself! Let me tell you this, too, if you have gone through something like this you may be able to relate and it will have some value for you. In that case, I say that you look at it, you can take something away from it, if not just see something that happened to you, that someone else represents it (it has therapeutic value).
