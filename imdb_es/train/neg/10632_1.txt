There are so many incorrect statements in this so-called "documentary" that I found myself screaming at the television. <br /> <br /> Bart Sibrel could produce a striking DVD, but unfortunately he can not look into the science behind his claims. <br /> <br /> Trust that it is inaccurate, that it does not tell the full story, or that the old favorite "the government always lies to us" insinuations, and that people believe what they are told and do not verify the accuracy nor the details behind the affirmations. <br /> <br /> In addition, your "exclusive" or "unpublished" images are freely available on the Internet from various sites. <br /> <br /> More The reading of the circumstances regarding the filming of this production shows that he used false pretexts to obtain interviews, and he has used the creative edition of the answers to promote his own opinions. <br /> <br /> All statements made by Mr. Sibrel about "inaccuracies", "errors" or "complaints" in the Apollo program have been comprehensive Approved. <br /> <br /> How can I recover those 40 minutes of my life?
