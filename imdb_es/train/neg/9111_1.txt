Cruel Intentions 2 is horrible, I mean super bad. Words can not explain how bad it is, but I will try anyway. <br /> <br /> The plot of Cruel Intentions 2 is very similar to the first movie. Sebastian (Robin Dunne), is expelled from a private school and is forced to move to New York. There he decides to start again and simply a life, a normal life and settle down. Unfortunately, he has to deal with his stepsister Kathryn (Amy Adams) wants to drag him down. Sebastain begins to fall in love with Danielle (Sarah Thompson), the innocent daughter of the Headmaster of the school. Kathryn wants Sebastain to just sleep with the whole school that was described as a "whorehouse." Kathryn also wants revenge with Cherie (Keri Lynn Pratt), who humiliated her during the school assembly. Kathryn wanted to turn the freshman into the biggest whore in the school, a secondary plot similar to the first movie. <br /> <br /> Cruel Intentions 2 is basically a canceled TV show, which became a prequel. There are so many problems with the movie. It is badly written, without grace, and badly acted. Luckily for Amy Adams, the show never took off because she is now a pretty big actress. While Cruel Intentions had a sense of realism and can be seen to be set in the real world, Cruel Intentions 2 takes place in the sitcom and as described in amazon.co.uk 'a randy version of Saved by the Bell ' There were some obscure themes related to sex and drug use in the first film, but in Cruel Intentions 2 he tried to make it fun and some of the ideas in the film should not be, like Kathryn had an affair with a teacher . Other ideas do not work either, like the secret society where all popular children gather to discuss the downfall of other students. The movie also had a big sexualization problem of 15/16 years old. I know that teenagers have sex, sometimes a lot, but when it is done in movies or television, it is treated very seriously. A famous sense was when Daneille encourages Cherie (who has about 14/15 in the movie) to simulate sex on the back of a horse to the point where she has an orgasm. The idea of ​​turning a girl around 14/15 into a whore is very bad for me, and should not become a comedy theme. The jokes in the movie are not good, whether it's a verbal joke like 'she gets crazy when she sees you' in a visual gag where Sebastian pushes Kathryn for the first time in the mud. <br /> <br /> There's a lot I'm wrong with this movie, in which I do not have time to get in, but I say it should be avoided. Simply see Cruel intentions, although it is not a classic, it is still a decent movie and it deals well with the subject. <br /> <br /> This movie is just the wet dream of a pervert, in which the children of the school have a lot of sex between them. .
