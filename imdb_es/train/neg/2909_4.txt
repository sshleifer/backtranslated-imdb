Seeing Tom Hanks as an assassin of the Irish Mafia is a bit like seeing Jimmy Stewart as a serial rapist, it just does not work. I had a hard time accepting this. It's not that I do not think Tom can not act. He may have been following his career since Mazes and Monsters, but for some reason I did not like it. Maybe because I'm so fanatical about the graphic novel and at the risk of sounding like a fanboy (the only way of life lower than a fanboy is a cockroach). The film as a whole fails for me. The additions Jude Law, and Subtraction everything else left me cold and more than a little disappointed. I was expecting a great crime movie in Bonnie's vein and Clyde Mendes took all the heart out of the story and left us with nothing but bare bones. There are things to like in this movie, however, the cinematography is impressive filling the screen with beautiful images. Paul Newman is, as always, excellent and I really enjoyed the score, but Tom as "the angel of death" Sullivan was completely flat.
