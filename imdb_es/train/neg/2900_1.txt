I have a 5 minute rule (sometimes I'll leave Leway for 10). If a movie is not good in the first 5 or 10 minutes, it will probably never get better. I still have to experience any movie that has proven to contradict this theory. Dan in real life is definitely not an exception. I was looking at this turkey and I thought; wow, this is not funny, or moving, or sad, and I do not like any of the characters. <br /> <br /> The story of a columnist / widower of advice that raises three young daughters, who falls in love. Love with his brother's girlfriend. I suppose the motto would be "advice columnist who could USE advice"? I do not know. The character in no way caught my attention as someone qualified to give advice. I guess that's the irony? I do not know. He goes to see his parents, brothers, sisters and their children in some kind of annual family retreat, which seems very sweet, and a potential fodder for a good comedy, story lines ... none that ever arise. The central story is basically how he loves this woman, but he can not have her. Anyone who has a pulse will realize that eventually he will get it, but you will have to suffer through the dialogue of the network of lifelong movies, painfully graceless, trivial to reach the inevitable happy ending. <br /> <br /> This is truly one of the worst movies I've seen in my life.
