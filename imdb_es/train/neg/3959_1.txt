this is NOT one of those movies, it's one of the biggest pieces of the gut I've seen in my life, the work of the camera is trying to be flashy but in reality everything looks like the red shoe diaries, but without sex, the only reason I bought this was because I wanted to try the DVD and this was the cheapest one I could find, possibly the worst purchase of my life and I could have taken away the DVD forever, the soundtrack is REALLY bad taste and most of the movie is composed of endless repetitions of clips from the first two films, why would someone want to make a movie so horrible as this surpasses me, if they had really tried to make an original movie and failed, it would be better to this revision, but not only have the rights to reproduce material of the first two and then edit it and repeat it in this film with approximately 1st original material, which is at the height of the standards For the students of the film school, DO NOT buy this movie. The only entertainment that this DVD can offer is if you put it in the microwave and look at the blinking lights! UTTER UTTER UTTER UTTER Unbelievable TRASH! 0/10 if only the voting system allowed it.
