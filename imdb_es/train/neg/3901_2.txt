The script is nice. Although the launch can not be seen, there is no style. The costumes do not look like some of the High Highbury society. Comparing Gwyneth Paltrow with Kate Beckinsale, I can only say that Mrs. Beckinsale speaks British English better than Mrs. Paltrow, although in the performance of Mrs. Paltrow resides the very nature of Emma Woodhouse. Undoubtedly, Mr. Northam is the best Mr. Knightley of all the versions, he is romantic and has nothing of sharpness nor of aspect like Mr. Knightley in the version for TV. P.S. The viewer can not see Mr. Elton-Ms. The development of Smith's relationship as it was in the movement version, so you can not understand where everything Emma tried to make an Elton-Smith match (in addition to the portrait).
