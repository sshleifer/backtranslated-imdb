Siskel and Ebert were great in this program, whether you agreed with them or not, because of the real conflict that their separate professional opinions generated. Roeper downloaded this program once or twice because he was not really a film critic and because he replaced snide with that of the critics. Now, when Ben Lyons gets going, I feel like I'm watching "Teen News", you know, that news program for children, organized by children for children? Manckiewitz is not much better. It is obvious that they have only found a steady diet of conventional movies all their lives. The idea that these two rank fans have something of interest or consequence to say about the movies is ridiculous. If you are reviewing a movie without a formula, you are completely lost. Show them something original and intelligent, they simply find it "confusing". Wait, I think I understand ... ABC is owned by Disney ... Disney makes movies for children. While Siskel, Ebert and Roper promoted independent films and were only successful with large-budget studio productions, what a surprise: these two guys LOVE the big ass of the studio and only a few Indians tolerate it. In addition, everyone knows which television group advertisers target. Brazen nepotism is the icing on the cake. In what alternative universe do these types qualify as film critics?
