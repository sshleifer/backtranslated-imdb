I greatly enjoyed Margaret Atwood's novel 'The Robber Bride', and I was thrilled to see that there was a version for the film. A woman frames a boyfriend of the police for her own murder, and her friend, a former police journalist, tries to clear her name by checking out the crazy friends of the dead woman. It is fortunate that the script of the film corrects Mrs. Atwood's clumsy conspiracy by focusing on the story of these two men, victims of intriguing women ... <br /> <br /> Heh. Ok you have me If you mention these guys in the book, and I'm pretty sure they're completely made for the movie, I'll eat the dust cover of my hardcover copy. Apparently, the three main female characters of the novel are not enough to carry the film. Zenia's manipulations are not interesting unless we see them pass to a man, and the life of a man is ruined. Roz, Charis and Toni tell their stories to a man. Because it's not important if a man does not listen to you. <br /> <br /> I liked the characters in the book. It hurts me to see them pushed aside by the story of a man. Normally I do not look for feminist angles in the media, and I tried to enjoy the film as it is. If I had not read the book, I could have enjoyed the movie a lot more. So, if you like the police and the ex-cop, and you want to read more about them, you're not lucky. Read the novel, if you want to enjoy exquisite prose and subtly layered characterization through a plot. It is the same plot: the film excavated it, ironed it and sprinkled it with male anguish. It's like Zenia's revenge against Margaret Atwood.
