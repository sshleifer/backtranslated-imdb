This is one of those movies where I would have liked to stay at the bar. <br /> <br /> The movie is downright boring. The story there is very fragile and you have to guess it. The film is pleased with pretentious camera techniques that seem to intend to cause migraines and make it look like a student movie. Did I say it was boring? If all the characters had died suddenly at the end of the movie, I would not have cared less because I had no emotional connection with any of them. <br /> <br /> There are about 4 good minutes in this movie, but that was about that. This is the first time I consider leaving a cinema during a performance, but I thought I had to improve. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> The kind of movie you could threaten naughty kids with.
