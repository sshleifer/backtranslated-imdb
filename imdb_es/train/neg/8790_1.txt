I saw this on cable recently and I enjoyed it a little. I have been reading the comments here and it seems that everyone likes the second half more than the first half. Personally, I enjoyed the first story (a pity that did not spread). The second story, I thought, was clich√©d. And that "California Dreaming", if I hear that one more time ... Chungking Express is fine, but it's not something that the general public can see, like "Crouching Tiger".
