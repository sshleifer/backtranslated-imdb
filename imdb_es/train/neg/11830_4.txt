Well, maybe a 13-year-old guy like me was too old for this movie. It's about this spoiled rat, who lives in a palace. Then a sewer rat throws him down a toilet! Finish in this rat city and meet this little rat girl who has a gem that wants a greedy frog. He will do anything for this gem; send an entire army after these two rats. Plan to take the gem and flood the city with rats! The best part of this movie are the slugs. They do all the sound effects. They sing, they make noises, it's impressive, it's also quite fun. In conclusion, it is aimed at children of 7 years. On the other hand, a great movie for a younger family member to see. However, I did not think that the animation was a true dream art, more like WAllace and Gromit. I think they relaxed a bit in that. The movie was just decent, although it's not worth spending $ 9.50, I'm sorry.
