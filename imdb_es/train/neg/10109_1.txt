BTK Killer, Green River Killer, Zodiac Killer; The man keeps throwing absolute rubbish and the irony is that he loves his shit. <br /> <br /> I've never seen a Ulli Lommel movie, but I was so amazed that everyone thinks their things are so horrible. Like the movies I said at the beginning, there are not even six when they add up! After reading the comments, I was curious to see how bad this guy really is. He is the worst there is. <br /> <br /> The credits did not end when the pathetic movie started and I quickly noticed that the audio was incredibly poorly folded. The performance was incredibly horrible and equal to the camera. . The edition is easily the worst. This movie did not make sense and, unbearably, I could not stand it anymore, since it would not end and I only had 45 minutes in the movie. I could not take it anymore. I lost 45 minutes of my life. <br /> <br /> DO NOT LOOK AT THIS SHIT!
