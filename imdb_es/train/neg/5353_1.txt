I had the "privilege" of attending a special screening of "The Absence of Light" at a horror convention in Ohio. <br /> <br /> First of all, you know you're in trouble when the director presents a movie, saying: "Now keep in mind that we did not have a lot of money ..." It's not that movies without a budget are bad, but when a filmmaker uses this as an excuse, the results are always bad. And there is no better example than this incomparable dream festival. <br /> <br /> Actually, 'Absence of light' marks the first time in the world of underground cinema: it's the only time I've seen a talented veteran, gender veterans, I really get bored. Charismatic actors such as David Hess, Tony Todd and Reggie Banister come and go at random from the film and turn out to be as uninteresting as the amateur non-names. Who are your characters? What are you talking about? Who cares? Everything is so boring, you will stop worrying about anything or anyone. <br /> <br /> After thirty minutes of this endurance test, I gave up and left the theater. Not surprisingly, like most of the cast members who attended. <br /> <br /> Any fan of the curious genre would do well to stay away from this. With a little luck, this movie will never see the "light" of the day.
