The last critic was very generous. I remain silent like the first movie, but I can not say that I really enjoy this one. The beginning is bearable, but it goes downhill quite quickly. It's just that I do not see Jon Bon Jovi as an "evil vampire hunter" and the vampire princess is neither sexy nor terrifying. Many of the scenes just do not make sense. I mean that any normal person would suspect that something is happening when a strange woman suddenly appears out of nowhere to seduce you, let alone an experienced hunter. Why is Una able to communicate with Jovi? Nothing was explained in this movie, you would not mind if it was entertaining, but that was a lot to ask for. This has to be one of the worst vampire movies I've seen.
