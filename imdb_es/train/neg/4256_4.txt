The ascension is actually a step forward in terms of what was the original movie in history and in special effects. Jason Scott Lee is a good vampire hunter looking for the counting (if you remember, he was from the movie Dragon, The Bruce Lee Story). Jason London is fun as Luke, the boy who helps the woman he loves. A distant theft of Dracula's body from the slab. Diane Neal is good as the woman who steals Dracula's body to find a cure for her dying boyfriend, and Stephen Billington is as good as Dracula himself. Giving a better performance than Gerard Butler did the recount in the original movie. Roy Scheider completes the rest of the cast in this film, and does a decent job mentoring the character of Jason Scott Lee. This is the second sequel to the trilogy, and they have had a good start. It is in the air if the last movie will close the series with a good grade.
