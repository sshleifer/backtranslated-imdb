First of all, let me say that this is not the movie for people looking to see something cheerful and happy for the holidays. This movie is cold, brutal and simply depressing. Mary Steenburgen plays a cranky mother who is at Christmas because her husband lost his job, they are losing their home, they can not buy Christmas presents for children, etc. You have the idea, happy things for the holidays. Then Harry Dean Stanton appears as Gideon, the angel of Christmas, who with his dark hat and long coat is more like a pedophile who hangs around children all day watching them. What better way to instill the spirit of Christmas in Mary Steenburgen than to kill her family and then offer her to return them if she believes in Christmas again? Santa Claus is a blackmailer and his Christmas workshop is more like a refuge for the Nazis on the street. The film makes everything so thick that you do not mind the happy ending when it arrives because the rest of the movie is so bitter and incredible. I am sure that this movie wanted to be something similar to Capra, but left aside the joy and the feeling of what a holiday movie should be.
