If you want to laugh like crazy, rent Cage. Cage is about two war heroes, Billy and Scott, who are best friends. When Billy is shot in Vietnam, he can not fend for himself, so Scott receives it. <br /> <br /> I have never seen a movie with more homosexual references to the two main characters. Billy and Scott love to "fight" and Scott tells Billy that he is "still sore from the night before", among other things. <br /> <br /> Wonderful phrases like "Shut the sh! T up" and "Ping Pang Pong, cut the sh! T" will keep you laughing for hours. The Native American boys who are supposed to be playing Mexican gangsters are also first class. As they say, it's "party time right now, Ba-ba-ba-ba ba-ba." I could go on forever, but just watch this movie and laugh your money. It was so much fun that I went out and bought the DVD for $ 5.99
