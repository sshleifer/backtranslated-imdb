I'm not a big fan of Rajnikant in the first place, but Baba was a big disappointment. In the midst of a terrible story, the action and the songs were only mediocre. The plot becomes very preached. Instead of running for a position like NTR or MGR, Rajni almost seemed to be running as the next great guru of Tamil Nadu. My wife tells me that since this movie came out, Rajni swore to have made more movies! <br /> <br /> We were lucky to have bought Babu (an old man from Sivajiganeshan) by accident when trying to buy this one. .... that was a great movie, which was composed for having bought this failure ... except that makes Baba look even worse in comparison! <br /> <br /> Bryan
