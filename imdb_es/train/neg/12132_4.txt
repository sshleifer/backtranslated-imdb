A trio of criminals of young age, led by Matt Dillon, destroys a night robbery. They flee, but they quickly cross paths with the police, who are simply chasing a terrorist. Of course, the police confuse the gang of thieves with the terrorist, the real terrorist escapes, and the thieves are forced to take refuge in a small bar in a bar, taking hostages, without knowing why the police are so determined to catch them. And guess who else has chosen the bar as a sanctuary to spend the night? <br /> <br /> Incredible? Absolutely. And it's going downhill from there. Spacey acquired a good acting talent; Matt Dillon, Faye Dunaway, Gary Sinise, Viggo Mortensen and M. Emmett Walsh, but all are wasted. Especially because after all the characters get stuck in the bar, all they do for the rest of the movie is argue. Endless and without direction. Long before the conclusion of the movie, you have stopped worrying about what happens to them.
