Very unnecessary movie with characters acting so unattractive that I really did not care who would do better (or was that the purpose of the film, portray people from New York City with a cold heart?) romance here. There is no comedy either. The performance is very flat and a very predictable plot. What bothered me most was this constant joke with quotes from classic movies. Man, can not you see that the more you quote, the less significant your own movie becomes? Try to be original yourself! A small budget is not an excuse, nor the first director. Crappy, crappy, crappy. No wonder it only costs me one dollar ...
