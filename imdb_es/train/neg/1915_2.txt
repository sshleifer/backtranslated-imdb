It's a pretty good cast, but the movie has nothing to do with the grace of the original Italian comedy "Big Deal on Madonna Street." Anyone looking for an entertaining caper movie should visit the original. William Macy may be one of our best living actors, but here he has little use. And his role in the original was played by Marcello Mastroianni, so I feel something for him when he tries to fill those shoes. He could also try to imitate Bogart or a young De Niro. The artistic direction is rich and textured, but it adds nothing to the story, the additional fragments that add to the story feel completely unnecessary and the things that they take away are lost. Even starting the way they do seems strangely free and takes away the surprise of the original. Sam Rockwell has his strange and great charm and Luis Guzm√°n has that strange charisma, but the part of the love story of the film seems awkward and flat. It's a shame no one has figured out how to make this movie as well as it did for the first time, but again, it's a shame that we live in a culture where we feel we need to remake amazing things instead of just learning to savor the originals
