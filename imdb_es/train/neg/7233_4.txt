I feel like a genius; I feel like I'm the only one who saw through this fake movie. I saw it three times, once with comments, and I found myself annoyed by all the close ups, every time the screen goes dark and, worst of all, I feel that the movie never solves anything. Yes, the priest dies, but in reality he did not seem to be at peace with the city that caused him so much pain or with himself. That and he was an idiot. If it were not for Peter Cowie's comment that explained not only the movie, but also the book from which it came, I could not have endured it at all. I like French films, but this is a completely absurd one. <br /> <br /> Diary of a Country Priest is filmed in a beautiful black and white photograph, but that alone can not save this lethal and boring gut. Scene after scene of extreme approaches in which the characters do not say anything until the camera is cut and disappears, an interesting or relevant story is NOT created. How this movie became a classic is amazing: it reminds me more of The Emperor's New Clothes. <br /> <br /> Yes, the performance of Claude Laydu is sincere and stimulating, if you are a sadist, but this movie went away. I feel empty because, in general, it is a weak impression of the Catholic priesthood, which is an ignoble and insignificant institution of corruption. The triumph of the young priest over the Countess's pride is a weak scene, but 90% of the film will drag him down with his sad introspection and his window to the melancholy thoughts of the young priest. This priest does not show himself as humble as he does simply regrettable. <br /> <br /> Being that I do not speak or understand French, I was looking forward to doing the SUBTITLES in English to help understand the film. Well, the SUBTITLE in English is sometimes impossible to see / read and the text passes so fast that there was a lot that I could not read (and I am not a particularly slow reader: I just read Dostoevsky in 3 days). <br /> <br /> I really wanted to like this movie. I try everything "chosen" by the collection of criteria, and yet I can not see why, in many ways, it deserves some kind of critical wink. However, I sat through all this longing for two hours at the cinema to feel some kind of empathy for the main character, and it never materialized. He just seemed like a victim rather than a fighter. And for that, I say it stunk.
