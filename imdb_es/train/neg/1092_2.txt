Well, I guess the good news about William Winckler's 2001 work, "The Double-D Avenger," is that he manages to unite three of Russ Meyer's mammary wonders: Kitten Natividad, Haji and Raven de la Croix, in a image. (I can only assume that Lorna Maitland, Tura Satana and Babette Bardot were busy the week they filmed this thing ... or they managed to see a copy of the script in advance!) However, the bad news (and there are many of them )), is that this film, if you can call it that, after having been shot directly on video, is a complete failure, a total abortion, a total atrocity, an absolute abomination and, in truth, one of the worst photos I've never seen. Look no further than the superhero movie ever made! The plot here, as it is, is about the fact that Kitten got superpowers after fellating the rare cockazilla plant in South America to cure his breast cancer (oy), and then fighting a trio of bikini dancers megalunged in The Angels. Pity that each tit takes. the trot joke falls completely (you must forgive the expression), that there is ZERO real nudity in the film (apart from some old photos of Kitten in its heyday), and that some shaving cream and a paper mache stone are the sum total of the special FX. The Meyer girls here are a bit long in the tooth / loose in the chest, so to speak, although Sheri Dawn Thomas, as the bikini girl Ooga Boobies (!), Achieves, eh, excel well. So, why have I given this youth, without grace, the failed embarrassment of a 2-star movie instead of a 1? To be succinct: Joe Bob Briggs. His voice-over commentary on the special features of the DVD that I have just seen is absolutely hilarious, especially when he takes out about 100 synonyms of the word "breast" from the more than 1,000 in his "List of canonical hooters" on his website. Man is a national treasure, and he manages to update this disc from a disk to the roller coaster status!
