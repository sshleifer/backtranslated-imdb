Unfortunately, one of the best efforts made so far in the area of ​​special effects has become completely useless when placed next to a heavy plot, silly and equally useless and an inappropriate script, cliché. Hollow Man is a pretty useless movie. <br /> <br /> Practically everything that is seen here has been done to death: the characters, the idea and the sequences of action (especially the axis of elevation!), with the only really intriguing element of La movie being the awesome special effects. However, it is the same special effect that is done over and over again, and at the end of the movie that has also been killed. Before seeing Hollow Man I expected the Invisible Man theme, which is hardly original in itself, to be the basis of something newer and more interesting. This is not like this. It is not long before the film becomes too familiar a bloodbath and a lot of ineffective histrionics: the pile of clichés accumulates so fast that it's almost impressive. <br /> <br /> On top of all this, Kevin Bacon does a pretty useless job and his supporting cast is just doing his best. The good points can be a passable score by Jerry Goldsmith (but not competition for his best efforts), a rather interesting use of thermal images and special effects. I was tempted to give this film three out of ten, but the effects increase the merit of Hollow Man in a notch. <br /> <br /> 4/10
