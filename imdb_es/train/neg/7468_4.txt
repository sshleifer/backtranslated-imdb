Probably, the only thing that made the movie reach four for me is the fact that I love Peter Falk. One of the great portraits of the world of clumsy incompetence. . . and yet, it is one of the only anchors that prevents this from being a chaotic disaster. Like Pops Romano, it provides a respectable mix of gangster charm and straight man to the maniacal nonsense of Chris Kattan. Richard Roundtree also offers respectable performances as the harassed boss, Vinessa Shaw as a talented FBI agent bouncing his head against a glass ceiling and Fred Ward as an adviser to Falk and Benedict Arnold. <br /> <br /> The concept of the plot actually has some wonderful possibilities and, in the hands of a young Steve Martin or Chevy Chase, it could have been a great comic vehicle. Kattan, who seems to idolize Ernest or Pee Wee Herman, only provides a tangled mess. Unfortunately, Peter Berg and Chris Penn, who portray their misfit brothers, both are far from their demonstrated ability. <br /> <br /> There are some very funny scenes, but they are very few and are separated by many. boring ones What I really miss here is what always attracted me to the films of Leslie Neilsen. There is no 'second level' of ingenuity about the slapstick. There are no cultural references that only adults have. . There is no double meaning. . It is nonsense. <br /> <br /> And, by the way, this does not mean that I recommend it for your 9-year-old son, because I hope they have a better taste and less fascination with some of His body parts and functions.
