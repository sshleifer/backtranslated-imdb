This movie is very bad. Maybe it's hard, but it is. Really is. Poor script, all the vampire clich√©s are used in the book, and there is no sympathy for the origins of the main character ... that is, the dracula. There have been some really brilliant Dracula / vampire movies in the past, but this does not even do it in the "extreme" slot. <br /> <br /> Take a selection of people who seem to have abandoned a teenage-slasher movement, add a splash of Dracula Lore and mix an intoxicating tonic of religious / surrealistic dreams ... and you'll get a confusing mess from a movie - Dracula 2000. <br /> <br /> I really can not find anything good to say about this movie, as if it was not bad enough to have been done in the first place, it seems that they made Johnny Lee Miller have an accent English ... What is the problem I hear? You cry ... Well, he's English, but he sounds like an American trying to make an English accent. <br /> <br /> In general, you can also tell your money (if you were thinking about buying it). ), or rent it, look at it and find out for yourself why it is as scary as the Tellytubbies. <br /> <br /> PS Although La La is pretty scary!
