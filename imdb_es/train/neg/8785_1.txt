I often comment on the absolute truth of really terrifying movies in the market, and unfortunately White Noise only served to reduce my faith that the film industry is still capable of such an effort. I was surprised to find myself increasingly fatigued as the plot progressed and the headache induced by static increased. I found that White Noise is absurd beyond our best efforts to suspend disbelief. Even after witnessing the terrible experience suffered by Michael Keaton, I was not affected at all by his disappearance. Until the credits, I waited diligently for something, something, of substance that connected me with the story of the characters, but that relief never came. Sure, there were occasional moments when the heart stopped, but only because loud noises tend to do that to the asleep viewer. <br /> <br /> While the performance was limited, Michael Keaton may have played his student role to date. Perhaps the only redeeming quality that White Noise has to offer is the impressive architecture in the two Keaton dwellings. In general, White Noise leaves one with the morbid and depressing idea that those who die are trapped in a world protected by three evil shadows, trying to trick the living to follow the dead to their own graves.
