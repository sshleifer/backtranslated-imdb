On his birthday, a little boy tells his mother that he is not his son, and that he wants to go home with his real mother. <br /> <br /> Somehow, the Comedy Of L'Innococencia feels like it came from another time of making movies, maybe the 60s or 70s. It certainly reminded me of the Secret Ceremony of Losey (1968) and the Complete Circle of Richard Loncraine (1977), which deal with the loss, pain and relationships between "lost" parents and children (curiously, film star Mia Farrow). <Br /> <br /> The three films are populated by unfriendly characters who behave strangely and inexplicably. All three films have a cold sensation, emotionally as well as literally. The three films focus on mother-child relationships and, ultimately, all three films pose the question: "What is real, what do you imagine?" <br /> <br /> Beautiful but faulty, it does not offer easy answers and leaves many things pending, unexplainable and strange.
