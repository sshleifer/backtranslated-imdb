with all the European studies involved in this, one would think that at least I would get a nice picture; but the local color is kept to a minimum. <br /> <br /> The irritation # 1 is that Mira Sorvino uses a Russian accent to play a Spanish policeman. WTF? The story is completely confused. There is a supposed romantic story that is intentionally confused: is it or is not it lesbian? - It's useless. The cops in the movie are the stupidest to have graced a serial killer movie in a long time. It seems that there is some message about the Spanish Civil War of the mid-thirties. But since almost everyone involved in that is dead, you do not see the point in it. <br /> <br /> Despite the backdrop of the bulls Part of the narrative (what part? Who can say it), you can never see a bullfight well. Earnest Hemingway would have hit the director in the nose, with my blessings.
