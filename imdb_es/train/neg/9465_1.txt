From acting, directing, scriptwriting and art direction, this film is ill-conceived and the money would have been better spent on shoes for victims of landmines. When we got so sad that they have to fill a movie for children with sexual advances to keep the attention of the parents. <br /> <br /> Dr. Suess is rolling in his grave right now, what about the "dirty ho"? "and false erection scenes, etc., etc. It's shameful the way they exchange the name of Suess for parents to bring their children, throw insults to teens and some sad parents who are not going to watch a movie with your child if there is no T & A. Greed greed and more greed. <br /> <br /> Compare this to classic movies for children and we can get a disturbing view of the world that is becoming. From MTV, how the hell this movie got more than 400 votes as a perfect 10, it surpasses me (unless it's the family of the directors)
