Based on the recommendation of a friend, my wife and I invite another couple to this movie. I really apologized to them, the 4 of us hated it and spent all our time looking at our watches waiting for the movie to finally end. Half of the vignettes are strange, with very little entertainment value. There were few scenes from Paris, for example, I expected to see some photos of the Latin Quarter, but I really could not recognize anything. Most of the scene was inside a bar. No one in the theater laughed at anything, nor did he react in any way. If you like bizarre, pretentious, pseudo-intellectual movies, do not miss it. If you are on earth like me, you will regret having seen it.
