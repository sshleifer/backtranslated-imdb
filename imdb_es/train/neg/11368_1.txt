This film was more effective in persuading me of a Zionist conspiracy than a Muslim one. And I am Jewish. <br /> <br /> Does anyone go to journalism school? Read an editorial? First year rhetoric? These alarmist statements, presented in an acceptable manner, can be persuasive. But by not offering recognition of possible opposing arguments, or viable solutions (or none at all), few sources and each of dubious origin, makes the argument an ineffective diatribe. <br /> <br /> And thank God for that ... I would not want anyone to leave the theater BELIEVING something of this racist trap. <br /> <br /> A good lesson for me, and I hope it is a warning to you, to really read about a movie before you see it. .
