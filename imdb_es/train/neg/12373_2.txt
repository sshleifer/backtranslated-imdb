The script is so ridiculous ... this, in turn, makes the lines of the actors sound rigid and unrealistic and can not be believed. There are repetitions of phrases: "my sweet and little daughter, the god" and small variations of that line that come to my mind ... and it is simply a dialogue of sloppy telenovelas. <br /> <br /> Worse still, the music is so INCORRECT! In addition, the main "theme" of blues is horribly picturesque and totally wrong for this. And it feels too much because the instrumentation, texture and disposition of this theme never change, even when the emotional context of the scene does. <br /> <br /> Subsequently, each time it appears, it protrudes like a sore thumb as the main transition from one scene to another. <br /> <br /> The music is corny, and it's as if the writer wrote music for a telenovela or a comedy, a low-budget Canadian comedy from the 80s, and that makes it feel like we're always on the verge of throw us to a commercial. <br /> <br /> This is a mistake, there is an overabundance of overexpression and it is a real effort that many of these characters are using a single type of NY accent - a thick Bronx accent. I do not know if it's a matter of the limited ability of the actors just to know * a * NY accent, or if it's the director's ability to notice such an obvious anomaly. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's the amateur script with its lead lines that makes this whole "movie" ... jump. When any base is unstable and unstable, it is impossible to develop it without its defects being revealed in an exponentially more damaging and unflattering way.
