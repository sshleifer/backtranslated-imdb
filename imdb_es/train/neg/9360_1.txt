My score for this crap: 1/10 1 just for the technician. Everything else is very bad. <br /> <br /> Another movie that does not make sense. Clearly, it seems that creating a good script for film or television is almost an impossible mission. <br /> <br /> While it is easy to understand why politicians never tell the truth, they are among the biggest liars on the planet, it is difficult to understand how to make such pathetic films. <br /> <br /> We must believe that you take people for idiots. Maybe it was reason to believe, since 99% of movies are garbage. Because the very bad scenarios are stupid and ridiculous. <br /> <br /> When you look at the price we give to the Oscars, we understand better why we keep making the movies more ridiculous than others. <br /> <br /> And oddly enough, it was always money for nonsense. But it was not for education and health. <br /> <br /> If you still want to listen to this s ** t, press the Super Fast Forward button (at least 20X).
