After a series of blackouts in a remote zoo on the island, the genetically engineered saber-toothed tigers are loose and harassing the island's residents. Man, the science fiction channel has made some bad "original" movies, but I think this could be their worst yet! This poorly written and targeted scam from the "Jurassic Park" offers all the usual clich√©s (mad scientists who think that people killed by monsters are "expendable losses", characters who walk through long dark corridors alone, brain-dead adolescent characters they only have function The movie is to die a horrible death, etc.), and, as expected, there is no suspense at all. The special effects are atrocious: the puppet heads in the close-ups of the beasts of the title are pretty bad, they look like rigid plush dolls, but the CGI that makes the dinosaurs generated by computer in "Walking with dinosaurs" seem real. In comparison they are simply horrible. There is some blood, but most seem unconvincing. Oh, and the scene of the scientist's death in the end is really one of the worst things I've seen in years. I could not even laugh, it was so bad! <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time, this is simply very bad. <br /> <br /> 2/10. <br /> <br /> Oh, and here are some interesting trivia for you: this movie took musical tracks from the sci-fi movie "Alien Hunter" from 2003, which was far superior to this piece of shit.
