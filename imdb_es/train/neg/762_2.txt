Loyalty to Peter Falk is all that kept me from giving this horrible image the (1) it deserved. (In fact, loyalty to Mr. Falk was what kept me watching this movie from beginning to end.) Even if you forgive all obvious mistakes, this was simply the poorest excuse for a program made for television. "Columbo" the movie never. I'm glad I saw it on free TV; I would have hated to have coughed up the dollars for an impression.
