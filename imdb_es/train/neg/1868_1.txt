This movie is terrible. Each line is stolen at 8MM (the bent Italian version, at least). If you like garbage ... real garbage, try it; But beware: this is not the kind of "so bad that is good". In the cheap, it may look like a porn movie but, believe me, if you're looking for "snuff", s & m, hardcore, softcore ... or even a common erotic thriller, go find something else in the store! I'm telling you this, because the shots, acts, plots, dialogues absolutely boring and unconvincing (the only good lines, as I said before, are the ones stolen from Joel Schumacher's 8MM) will bore you to tears. Few minutes and the "happy ending" is absolutely disgusting! I'll give you a star: a half for the sudden shot in the back scene, after the monologue "the eyes of the victim" (also stolen 8 mm) and a stocking for the sexy bodies of mom and daughter (who did not manage to keep me wide awake while I see this turkey!
