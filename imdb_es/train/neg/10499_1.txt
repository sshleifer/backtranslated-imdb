Okay, first of all, Steve Irwin, rest in peace. You were loved by many fans. Now ... this movie was not a movie at all. It was the television show "The Crocodile Hunter" with bad acting, bad scripts and bad direction between Steve capturing us or teaching us about animals. It was entertaining as an animal seeker / specialist. Millions will miss him. But the whole idea of ​​the movie was a big mistake. The plot was so broken, it was almost nonexistent. The casting was horrible. The performance was not even worthwhile for the actors in the primary school. The address must also have faults. If you can not get a decent average performance from your actors, no matter how bad the script is, it should not be so good in the first place. I could have written a better script. I wish I had never been to see this movie. Of course, I saw it for $ 3 ($ 1.50 for me, $ 1.50 for my son) while hanging out with friends who insisted on seeing this instead of Scooby Doo Live Action. My son, who does not discriminate so much, liked the movie, but still never asked to see her again. If you want good memories of Steve Irwin, buy his series on DVD. Avoid this movie like the plague. If I were Steve, I know I would not like to be remembered for this movie. Respect it: avoid this movie!
