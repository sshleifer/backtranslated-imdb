Interesting? Barely. The 'scientific evidence' that the film provides for its point (which is basically that the Jews are a cancer) is so stupid and lame, it's almost ridiculous (if we did not know what happened in that era). <br /> <br /> Important? Nah I can not imagine the Germans (even in that horrible moment) would like or believed in this movie. Compare it with the Trieff des Willens de Riefenstahl. Now that was the movie that impressed me. This is just silly garbage. <br /> <br /> The 'best' part is a scene from M (one of my all-time favorites) where (the Jew, as the announcer reminds us so often) Lorre plays a child-Matero and assassin. In the eyes of these filmmakers, only a depraved mind can do it. UH Huh. I did not know that M was Hitler's favorite movie, right? <br /> <br /> No, it's just STUPID. Even for its Nazi propaganda genre. 2/10.
