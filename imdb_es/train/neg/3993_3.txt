This movie was exactly what I expected, not excellent, but not so bad either. In my opinion, PG13 movies are not terrifying enough, that's why I knew that I would get bored throughout the movie. Of course there were scary things in the hotel room, but nothing that we have not seen. I guess I did not like it because I thought there were too many twists and turns happening; He became old and repetitive. I also did not understand if all the things that Cusack was experiencing in the room were real or not. There is no explanation for any of the events that occurred. The film is prolonged and, when it finally comes to an end, he wants it to continue, because he is still waiting for someone to tell him what the whole movie was about. What I liked was the special effects. Apart from that there was not much enjoyment of it. Maybe it's just me, but I thought it was below average.
