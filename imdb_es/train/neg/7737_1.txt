Who in the world told Harrison Ford that this was a good role for him ??? <br /> <br /> And Josh Hartnett ... how does a 19-year-old who can not shoot a gun become a cop? More clich√©s used plus zero character development and about 15 cameos from the music industry meaningless equals a surprisingly bad movie !!!
