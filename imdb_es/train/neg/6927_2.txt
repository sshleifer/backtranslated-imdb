Although I rated this movie with a 2 for showing a total lack of effort when trying to create a quality horror movie, it was a 10 on the involuntary funny scale. I could not figure out what was going on in the movie or who the people were, but I did not care because I knew that every scene was going to have something that made me cry with laughter. The dialogue is minimal throughout the film, but I think this is because they started filming without a script. The fact that there is no plot makes the film extremely versatile. It does not matter if you sit down and watch the movie from beginning to end or if you see it in rewind, you will be confused with the fun. I particularly like the scene where the inmates take turns running out and hitting each other with sticks. I think the doctor refers to this as a treatment. Genius!
