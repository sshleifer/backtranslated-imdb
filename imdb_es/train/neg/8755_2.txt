This movie was terrible to say the least. I expected much better after seeing "High School Musical". The whole movie was a complete scam of "The Simple Life", only it was not a reality show. <br /> <br /> The performance was not good at all. Amanda Michalka had her moments, when she was not so terrible. On the other hand, Alyson Michalka was bad at all times. Chris Gallinger, who played Amanda's love interest, was a Frenchman, but he had a horrible accent. Something good about this movie was the adorable Michael Trevino, who played the love interest of Alyson. Just something to keep in mind, if this movie had been aired before "High School Musical" it probably would not have looked so bad. But it was not a comparison. <br /> <br /> In general I give it a 2.
