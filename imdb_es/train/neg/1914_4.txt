Not bad, but not good. It is simply entertaining. <br /> <br /> as a comedy that is supposed to be, it is terrible. There is not much laughter at all, since every joke in the movie has been done a million times before. <br /> <br /> It's a shame, since all the actors in the movie are usually great, but none of them really does that much. and the end stinks.
