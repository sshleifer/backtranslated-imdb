I almost drowned in CHEESE watching this movie. In fact I could not even finish it. I want my money back. One more of the weak attempts of Hollywood to propose a new idea. Good thing I keep a bowl of lemons in the fridge. Just in case. They should have given Nic Cage a hat and a whip. Swashbucklin '. Cage's performance in Raising Arizona or Leaving Las Vegas outperforms this "lemon." People who are fully commercialized (and most of them are) should love this movie. If this movie had been animated, I would have taken it more seriously. I would have preferred to pay to see a completely stupid movie that did not try to hide it. In my opinion, this was an incredibly stupid movie and he made an even more incredibly sad attempt to hide that FACT. <br /> <br /> However, it seems that all SHEEP love it.
