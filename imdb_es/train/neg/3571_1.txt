The super sexy B movie actress has another important part as the future girlfriend of the "Goodfellas" star, Ray Liotta, in this box office bomb. She plays Marion, she has only one line of dialogue, well, a word of dialogue in reality. She screams "Joe!" how the character of Ray is raping poor Pia Zadora with a plastic garden hose sprayer. This movie is so bad, although it becomes funny, sometimes hilarious. The guys from Mystery Science Theater 3000 would love this! Take a look at the hysterical scene at the end, where Pia has a nervous breakdown and all the cheesy editing and the effects they do to try to show how badly Pia's character is going crazy. Pia plays an aspiring Hollywood screenwriter in this. Pia Zadora as a screenwriter? Yeah sure. Pia can barely talk, let alone write! Pia is absolutely and absolutely wrong in this foolish role. But who cares? The real star is the hot and fresh Glory Annen in her small part in the opinion of this cat! Rock on Glory!
