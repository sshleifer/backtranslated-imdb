When I was 11 years old, Grease 2 was like crack. It was an experience without class, shameful, euphoric and powerfully addictive. My sister and I would see it, rewind it, and look at it again and again and again until we faint or become confused and hostile. Therefore, if you are an 11-year-old girl, and you reviewed this movie as "bright" or "fun" or "better than the original Fat", it is to blame for your early teen hormones and you can be sure that this is inflexible. the fixation with the total waste will pass. <br /> <br /> If, however, you are not a child, you have absolutely no excuse to suggest that Grease 2 was anything other than an inane, naive and careless shame to all who participated in its production, distribution and / or consumption. <br /> <br /> For the sake of criticism, I will dignify the film now explaining why it blows ?? <br /> <br /> 1. In a well-executed musical, the songs must advance the narrative or develop the characters. In Grease 2, with some debatable exceptions, the music is obscenely useless. Most of the songs seem to relate simple insinuations about sex in an excessive and general way ("Score Tonight", "Reproduction", "Do It For Our Country" and "Prowlin '") without making a concrete statement about any of the Characters or themes of the movie. In addition, all music is uncomfortably stupid and no one in the cast demonstrates even the crudest appearance of an ability to sing or dance. <br /> <br /> 2. The T-birds should be rude, and if not at least somewhat pleasant, but each of them is an annoying loser of wussy-dufus. In the end, when Johnny Nogerelli offers Michael the Sacred Sacred T-bird and starts him in the gang, Michael must kick her to the ground, spit her out and sneak away to fervently clean any part of her body that has been touched by her. . But, of course, he accepts it as if it were gold because, despite the fact that they are a clumsy group, there is no greater honor than being one with the T-birds. <br /> <br /> 3. Since Michael is beautiful, intelligent, kind, witty and above average in every way (despite his musical impotence), Stephanie may embrace him when he reveals himself as the man behind the mask. Stephanie, on the other hand, is a chewing gum loose, loose jaw, with a dirty sweatshirt, a dingbat blatantly nasty and rude. So aside from being beautiful (I suppose), she does not have nice characteristics, therefore, audiences have no justification for the depth of Michael's attraction to her. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on, but did not want to mention the gross inferiority to its predecessor, since apparently there are so many whims that seem to feel that such a comparison is unfair. However, I will tell this to those of you who think you want to revisit this mess for the good old days: Grease 2 is a similar experience to reliving your first kiss. Only now you're 32 years old and you kiss a 13-year-old boy with snot and acne and braces. The magic is gone and they leave you feeling dirty and disturbed. Trust me.
