"Dracula II: Ascension" is the story of a group of medical students who meet Dracula's body. When a mysterious stranger appears and offers students $ 30 million to harvest the body and steal their blood for the auction, it is an offer that can Almost the students also find themselves relentlessly pursued by a Vatican killer vampire! "Dracula II: Ascension" is a somewhat entertaining horror movie that has many flaws. The characters are one-dimensional and the acting is quite normal. There are some good gore effects, like a really great scene of double decapitation, but there is not enough violence for my taste. The film quickly becomes boring and forgettable and there is absolutely no suspense. So if you like modern vampire movies, take a look. I prefer atmospheric vampire coolers from the 60s and early 70s, such as "Lips of Blood", "The Brides of Dracula" or "Lemora: A Child's Tale of Supernatural", to name just a few.4 out of 10.
