I recently had the pleasure of watching the funny comedy Bachelor Party, one of my new favorite comedies, which burst out laughing until the kind of movies hurt me. So, naturally, I wanted to see the sequel, hoping it would have the same laughs, but instead, Bachelor Party 2: The Last Temptation is made by the American Pie generation, where it has no flavor and defeats the purpose of the first movie. Yes, the first movie has nudes, but it is not shown in all the scenes. Also, the plot is exactly the same from the beginning, it's not always a complaint, but it could have been a little more original. The only thing is that I'm glad that at least no old actors of the original appear in this film, because it would have been corny or really ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Ron and Melinda are committed, after only 2 months of dating, everyone is against it. Melinda has a rich family, but they are very happy with Ron, and Melinda's brother, Todd, is afraid that Ron will accept his job. So they go on a weekend to Miami for a bachelor party and Todd will make sure he catches Ron in an image that makes Melinda change her mind about marriage. <br /> <br /> Bachelor Party 2: The Last Temptation has a couple of laughs here and there, but above all it does not achieve what the first movie achieved. These guys, Ron's friends, were more unpleasant than friendly, except for Seth, he was a little funny. The only nice characters that are not Seth are Ron and Melinda, all the others more or less make you nervous. Do you want to see this movie? Just look at Girls Gone Wild, it's the same, but do not try to pretend it's a movie. Stick to the original Bachelor Party, that's the movie that will make you cry with laughter. <br /> <br /> 3/10
