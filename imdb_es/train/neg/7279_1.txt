I just watched this movie on a local TV station ("Big Chuck and Little John" on TV8 in Cleveland, Ohio) I had never heard of this movie and decided to watch it. <br /> <br /> I do not know any thesaurus that can even come close to helping me describe how bad this movie really is. The script is horrible. The performance, in addition to one of the two exceptions, does not make sense since there is nothing in this material that deserves a real effort. <br /> <br /> It seems like a lot of small ideas, left over from several writing sessions, than where thrown in a blender. It's not just funny. The "parody" aspect is tense at best. Some references were almost outdated (even at the time of its release). No wonder you've never heard of that, it's really bad, worse than nothing Saturday Night Live, MAD TV or even In Living color in your worst days. <br /> <br /> If you watch it on TV, it's a great example of how NOT to make a movie. Whatever you do DO NOT WASTE A CENT. <br /> <br /> Adam
