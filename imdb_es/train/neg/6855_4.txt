Why is it that a woman can not be a strong character in a movie without sleeping with the protagonist? The campaign manager in this movie dreams of taking Tom Sellick to the White House. It's all she can think about. So why the hell should she have had an affair with him? He did not add anything to the plot and it only served to degrade the successful women. The only value of that tidbit was the beautiful scene of "we all sleep with your husband". <br /> <br /> Also, could not the people who made this film see the national conventions they were faking? Transmitting between the two main political conventions only served to highlight their total ignorance of the nomination and selection process.
