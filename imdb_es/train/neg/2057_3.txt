I regret going against the flow, but I thought that this movie was not realistic, boring and too long. I got tired of seeing the hard and arduous battle of Gena Rowlands with herself and the crisis she was experiencing. Maybe the film has some cinematic value or represents an important step for the director, but for pure entertainment value, I wish I had omitted it.
