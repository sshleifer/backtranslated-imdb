One of my best friends brought this movie over one night with the words "Do you want to see the worst horror movie in history?" I always like to laugh at a bad horror movie and I said yes. I expected your typical cheesy b-slasher but this was beyond B. This is Z-slasher, the lowest of the basses. With an obviously low budget, an extremely bad performance, a bad ray, a plot, the really bad 'special effects', tremulous cameras and a horrible soundtrack, this makes films like House of Wax look like winning masterpieces. Oscar The only good thing about this is that after about 15 seconds one of the characters went topless: he had very nice tits. Most of what I said during this movie was about 'Wow, this is actually SO BAD', 'This is the worst movie in history' and 'I'm not drunk enough for this'. So in conclusion: do not waste your time (or money).
