Where to start The movie started quite well, but after 30 minutes I was surprised watching the clock. The horror at the beginning of the movie was good, but then the story began. He became more stupid and stupid as time passed. <br /> <br /> The actors gave an average performance in this movie, however, I got a bit boring from Vinny Jones with a constant frown in the movie. <br /> <br /> As the film went on, and I took my word, it went on, it got more and more crazy. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER ALERT *** SPOILER ALERT *** SPOILER ALERT *** Just when I thought the movie could not get worse, towards the end, if skeleton-like monsters appeared , just to eat the dead What did not make sense at all. It turned out to be a kind of meat cult and the good die at the end. The ending, in fact, only made me laugh at how bad it was. Once the lead role gets rid of Vinny Jones, he becomes the new killer. <br /> <br /> In the end, this movie made Creep look like the best horror movie ever made. I gave her 1 star because the female lead did a pretty good job, but even she could not save the shock of a train from a movie!
