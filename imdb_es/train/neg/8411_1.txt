We were expecting something great when we went to see this bomb. It's basically a Broadway play on film. The music is simply terrible. There is not a memorable song in the movie: have you heard any successes from this movie? You will not do it because there are none. Some of the musical numbers last so long that I got up to go to the bathroom and buy some popcorn, and it was still going when I got back! If they were good songs well, but they suck. The pace is slow, terrible development of the character. The leadership was praised for its singing, but it sounded like screaming every song, it was almost impossible to stop. This movie has NOTHING to offer to anyone but enthusiastic Broadway enthusiasts. This is undoubtedly the most overrated movie I've seen in my entire life. A full waist of time and money. There is nothing memorable in this movie, except Danny Glover, who was not on screen enough and whose character was not sufficiently developed. Rent the video and you will agree: this movie was an expensive dog, too produced and polished.
