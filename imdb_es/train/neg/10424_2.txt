I should love this movie. The acting is very good and Barbara Stanwyck is great, but the film has always seemed very trite to me. The movie makes working class people look low and cheap. The fact that the daughter is ashamed of her mother and that the daughter does not rise above her has always disturbed me a little. Barbara Stanwyck as the mother worships the daughter, but the daughter renounces a love of the mothers to find happiness with their good to the family of the parents. I wonder how many others who have seen this movie feel that way. Once again, the performance was very good and worth seeing. I really do not like the story line. only a personal preference. Thank you
