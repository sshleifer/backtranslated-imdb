"The possibilities are" a big mistake to see. You could meet director Emile Ardolino from 'Dirty Dancing' and 'Sister Act' and you should expect something fun from him. But I guess I have to disappoint you. He made a really bad movie. <br /> <br /> According to the story, Christopher McDonald dies to be reborn when he was a baby. The baby grows Robert Downey Jr, and Jr returns to his old hometown where he meets his old daughter, Mary Stuart Masterson (complicated, huh?). <br /> <br /> They fall in love with each other. Then Jr's ex-wife, Cybill Shepherd, appears and Jr falls in love with her too. I guess I do not even have to mention that she loves Ryan O'Neil. <br /> <br /> In one of his first roles, Robert Downey Jr is at his worst. Copy to Michael J Fox. <br /> <br /> After 'Moonlighting' Shepherd shows that he is not suitable for acting in films. <br /> <br /> Anyway, there is one thing this comedy without grace can be used: As an antidote to insomnia.
