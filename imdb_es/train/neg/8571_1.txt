Penn takes the time to develop his characters, and we almost care about them. However, there are some real problems with the story here, we do not see any real motivation for the behavior of the evil brother, and the timeline is ruined. Supposedly set in 1963, the music is from the late 60s and early 70s. The references and dialogues are 70s / 80s. The potential for a powerful climax arises, and Penn allows it to escape. But even with all these difficulties, it's worth looking, but it's not great.
