"Nacho Libre" (2006) <br /> <br /> Directed by: Jared Hess <br /> <br /> Starring: Jack Black, Ana de la Reguera, Héctor Jiménez and Darius Rose <br /> <br /> Classification of the MPAA: "PG-13" (for rough action and raw humor, including dialogue) <br /> <br /> Say what you want about it (I know some people who despise it until the end ), but I have always thought that "Napoleon Dynamite" was a funny movie, however, it is not the brightest brick on the wall, but a fun movie. Jack Black is also a very funny man, irritating at times, yes, and massively overrated by the adolescent audience that practically adores him, but fun. Rarely has there been a Jack Black comedy that I did not enjoy to some extent. So, I was very happy to know that Jared Hess, the writer and director of "Napoleon Dynamite", and Jack Black would join for a film about a Spanish friar who becomes a fighter to save an orphanage. My only reservation was that the plot seemed a bit too thin. Unfortunately, my only reservation turned out to be the fall of the entire movie. This plot, if it had been done like a sketch in a show like "Saturday Night Live" or possibly even "Mad TV", would have worked perfectly. Unfortunately, the plot is too thin in the approximate time of an hour and a half and this comedy of a joke does not work. <br /> <br /> Nacho grew up in a Mexican monastery and became a devoted man of the Lord. Feeling rejected by the entire monastery, Nacho (black), now the monastery's cook, decides to follow his dreams to become a professional wrestler. As the monastery's finances reached an all-time low, Nacho decides to join a wrestling tournament so he can win the prize and provide good food for the monastery's orphanage. This plot sounds so sweet and loving. It looks like the perfect movie for Jack Black. Look what he did with "School of Rock" after all. Well, to my dismay, this plot is almost completely ruined by the offensive and rude humor that only moves away from the heart of the movie. Again it's the way Hollywood shows that they feel that the teen audience will only understand jokes and stupid jokes, of course, as far as I know, maybe that's the general thinking of teenagers, as many seem to enjoy this movie. Seeing an obese woman running like a mouse on the floor will certainly make people laugh, but do not expect to receive a prize for including it in your movie. A boy of seven could make the same joke. <br /> <br /> The performances in "Nacho Libre" are really good. Jack Black proves once again that it is absolutely hilarious and that it can make even the most idiotic and useless lines get comical on a piece of paper. Unfortunately, this movie was not enough for him. He did not give her anything to follow and the only reason why any of his jokes worked was because of him. I had never seen or heard of Ana de la Reguera, but now I can say that not only is she quite talented, but she is also one of the most beautiful women who have seen my sight. She just clicked on the paper and it worked wonderfully well. Héctor Jiménez, who plays Nacho's clumsy partner, Esqueleto, made me laugh continuously. He did a very good job and was very effective when he partnered with Jack Black. Darius Rose, who plays an orphan named Chancho, did not have many lines, but, what can I say, I just enjoyed it. He was adorable The rest of the cast did his job. It is unfortunate that they are wasted in such a bad movie. <br /> <br /> "Nacho Libre" simply does not work. Its plot is stretched too thin. The heart of everything is stained by moronic humor and sickly jokes that simply do not work. I rarely laughed and, if I did, it was because of Jack Black or another cast member. And that brings me to the positive side of "Nacho Libre": yes, to the cast. This cast was just good, for want of a better word, they were in. They all clicked, they had excellent chemistry and they pumped as much life as possible into the flat script. After "Napoleon Dynamite" by Jared Hess kept me entertained throughout the film, I was surprised to find myself often bored with "Nacho Libre". Something was lost here and I still have to understand what it was. All I know is that "Nacho Libre" is not a good movie and, however, due to its cast, it has no value. There is a small reason to look, if only to see Jack Black work. But, if you're not a Jack Black fan, avoid this movie like the plague. I like Black, but I'm done with this movie and with this review. <br /> <br /> Final Thought: Oh! This is the surprising and disappointing follow-up of Jared Hess to his hysterical "Napoleon Dynamite". <br /> <br /> Overall rating: 4/10 (C +)
