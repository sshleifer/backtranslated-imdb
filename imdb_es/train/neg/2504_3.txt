Having finished the in-laws for the weekend? So, this is the movie to accelerate your departure, and failing that will induce a catatonic state to provide a welcome relief to the constant scolding. <br /> <br /> The film is supposedly on board a luxurious cruise ship, which is more an elderly car ferry; the plot has more holes than the average colander and a cast dredged from the depths of the celebrity list D. An interesting piece of added fun is playing "Spot the Villain" when the passengers join the ship. You will not go wrong !!!! With a script that sinks faster than a brick, clich√© pieces and copious amounts of raspberry jam that double as blood, this film tries to cover the genres of thriller, action movies and gore-fest and, at the same time, does not meet any of them. <Br /> <br /> You must see the movie, if only to laugh at how bad it is.
