As a big fan of horror movies, especially J-horror and Gore, I thought that Nekeddo Burâddo sounded pretty good. I researched the plot, read reviews and even looked at some pictures to make sure it looked like a good bloody and terrifying movie before downloading it. So excited that he was finished and ready to be scared and recoiling in horror at the incredible blood he was expecting, he was terribly disappointed. The plot was ridiculous, it did not even make sense and it left too much unexplained, the blood was hilarious instead of horrifying, and what about the sound effects of cartoon style? The acting was probably the only slightly frightening thing about it. I did not understand the idea of ​​the cactus and the way the mother's husband disappeared in the middle of the sea after following an intermittent light, they left the two quite inexplicable, or maybe I missed it because my mind could not understand what was really seeing. I appreciate the way it was supposed to be; Surprisingly and some scenes (the strange cannibalism and the mother kissing herself?) Certainly, I think they went a little far and not even in a horrible way, they managed to convince, which made it more credible to be a comedy. that a horror in my opinion However, it is a very entertaining movie and I laughed a lot with a couple of friends, but unfortunately we expected horror, not comedy, so it's worth seeing the value of entertainment, but do not expect it to be dark, scary and terrifying movie; You will simply be disappointed. If it were a horror / parody comedy, you would probably rate it with a nine, the climax is the strange scene when the husband got into his wife's stomach and closed his wounds, but as a horror, unfortunately, he I gave one.
