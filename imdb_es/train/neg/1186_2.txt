Walerian Borowczyks La Bete (1975) was obviously received in different ways: Some were horrified, others were surprised, others applauded the courage. However, I am completely intact, bored and I can not help but wonder why the visualization of incoherent and incoherent images that wander around a central theme is considered an intellectual journey. <br /> <br /> What was this movie about? Growing sexuality in a woman? I have seen great movies on this subject, but this is not one of them. How can one try to portray a growing sexuality in a girl without at least trying to characterize her as a person, not just as a narrative device to dream (naked) with beasts? Where there are no characters, there is no study of characters. The woman pursued by the beast was not adolescent, the girl who has sex with the black butler (is also characterized by being a beast?) Has a very adult attitude towards sexuality, then, where is the consistency? Is it a movie about religion? If so, we would need a little more thematic material than a priest without function, character and charisma, but with a strong desire for two young children. <br /> <br /> Is it about bestiality? The metaphorical feel of the film prohibits any realistic examination of bestiality, especially when the realistic exam requires realistic characters. So there is no real bestiality here. A mythical beast and two priests talking to each other about the sin of bestiality. Enough for a university essay on the subject? I do not think so. <br /> <br /> Is it about sex? Is it something? I do not know. I just know that showing a gun does not make a movie a war movie. Treating a topic must mean more than showing your own associations with the subject. <br /> <br /> Then look through the controversy. Do not be scared by the bestiality, the nudity, the ejaculations, the masturbation and those things. I am not. Look at it while you watch any other story and you may discover that this is a badly made, poorly edited, badly performed, very badly written (well, some photos are quite beautiful and the main character is a very pretty girl) Brain masturbation of a director who think that walking through the branches in a hypnotic and slow way will make a story intelligent. It does not. It makes it boring.
