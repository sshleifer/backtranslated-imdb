A slasher movie, made in the early '80s, has a curse that makes anyone who tries to finish it go dead. Years later, a group of film students tried to complete the film, also resurrecting the film's deadly curse. Great idea for a movie, but unfortunately 'Cut' is just another missed opportunity. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Australia has not had the best record in the world when it comes to horror. 'Razorback' (1984) was a failure and it was 'Holwing III' (1987), which was anyway half of an American movie. As for our incursion into horror comedy, it is better to leave 'Body Melt' (1993). The problem with 'Cut' is that the creators try to create a satire of intelligent terror to the 'Scream' (1996) but have no idea of ​​the genre or what makes it work. And although this sounds strange to me when saying this about a Slasher movie, but what is really missing in 'Cut' is any "heart". Of course, he follows the basic "rules" set by "Scream", but he does not want to play with the formula, instead he looks for a cardboard copy of the previous one. <br /> <br /> The killer, Scarman, is probably one of the most boring and uncharismatic villains in the history of horror movies. His endless bombardment with clumsiness, lame in a single line would make the dialogue of a porn resemble Shakespeare. The cast never seems to be completely involved and it seems that they are just waiting for a shoot to finish so they can collect their paychecks. And the feeling of the movie is as if it deliberately tried not to be creepy; Looking more like an episode of 'Neighbors' or 'Heartbreak High'. By the way, those attempts by the MTV style, the hypermicema during the sequence of "research" simply seem unconvincing, outdated and out of place. <br /> <br /> If Australia ever has the chance to do the horror again I hope we still do it) Maybe we should take out a sheet of the book 'Mad Max' (1979). Instead of trying to copy the US, we should try our own version of the genre.
