This movie is just bad. It's not even worth looking to make fun of it. The lunatic teacher is simply annoying. Even suspending disbelief to allow invisibility (which I would love to do for the sake of bad bad movies) and allow extremely stupid victims in a horror movie, this movie calls for even more than that. If you are looking for scenes of showers in women's clothing and random sexual encounters, get a porn, if you are looking for a good or bad movie, get something else. If you want to just waste your time on a bad annoying movie, rent this.
