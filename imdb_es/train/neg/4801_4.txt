I really wanted like this movie. It has a nice setting in prison, conspiracy theories, bloodthirsty zombies, a touch of the 80 perfectly horrible and it is an effort directed by the actor John Saxon, who also plays a bad (you guessed it) as a bad guy. It reminds me of some (beloved) Italian horror movies. But the direction is very wooden and there is not a nightmare / fear moment in that country. It just goes on and on and on, and then (logically) it has to end. More suspense and more daring visuals and their destiny as a cult classic would have been sealed.
