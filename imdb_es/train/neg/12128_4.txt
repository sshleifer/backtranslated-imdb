In case half of the images in this movie look strangely familiar, it means you look too much at this bloody Italian cult shit! As you can see, the notorious demigod Lucio Fulci not only produced this film, but he also took the liberty of reusing the most sadistic killing sequences in his own "Cat in the Brain" (and more easily traceable). The initial scene already, in which a prostitute is brutally beheaded with an ax, appears in Fulci's later film and so does another handful of murders and moments of sordidness. The "Massacre" of Andrea Bianchi fails miserably as a giallo, since the search of the sadistic murderer between a film crew that films a horror movie is quite convincing and suspense, but it is still a good entertainment if you like the garbage of the horror. . The incoherent script features a bunch of disgusting characters who are all potential maniacs, but none of the false leads that Biachi comes up with is plausible and you can point to the killer almost immediately. What remains to be enjoyed are the really misogynistic make-up effects and the hilariously horrible performances of the cast. When there is no bloodshed on the screen, such as between the first and second murders, "Massacre" is a slow and almost intolerable process with its inane dialogues and a totally uninteresting photograph. Fortunately in the second half, there are women impaled on fences and men are repeatedly stabbed with rusty spikes. The music is crap and the use of the filming locations is very unimaginative. My advice would be to skip this puppy and go directly to the aforementioned "Cat in the brain". That shows ALL the great moments of "Massacre", and then some.
