This really should have been a star, but there were so many, clich√©s, predictable turns, I saw it all before the parallels appeared, that I actually gave it an extra star for the fact that it made me laugh ... although this was never Intent of the directors I'm sure. <br /> <br /> I do not often write comments about movies, they have to be sensational or, in this case, very bad. <br /> <br /> To be honest, as soon as I saw Jeff Fahey in him, I knew he was going to be poor, since he has a unique nose to choose the worst movies. <br /> <br /> Somehow, the farce of all this made me see everything. through, possibly by the hilarious voice of MR T, (does not retransmit Mr. T, but you will know what I mean if you bother to see this), if you observe it, make sure you do not pay to see it. This could have worked if they had really put the intentional comedy on it, but I'm sure you'll find a funny laugh here and there in the farce of everything ...
