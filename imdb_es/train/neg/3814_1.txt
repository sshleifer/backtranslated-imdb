I can see little girls enjoying this show, but calling this a family show is ridiculous. It surprises me how well it is remembered after all these years. It is an extremely funny and stupid show about the widowed father of three children who live with the brother of his dead wife and his stupid friend from school, and others over the course of the seasons. All the lines of the plot usually have a really silly lesson. In the middle of each episode, someone is angry with another person and each episode they invent and ends with a light joke. As for the actors, I did not like them either. Bob Saget was painfully inopportune like the dad with mom's responsibilities. Dave Coulier is a 30-year-old joke that makes cartoon voices and acts like a child, and it's horrible. John Stamos was the most tolerable character, but it was so clich√© that it was hard to see. The older girl, DJ, on the show was a really bad actress and showed no emotion. The middle child, Stephanie, was too cliche like the annoying little sister. The youngest girl, Michelle, showed the bad actresses that were the Olsen twins. You can always know when they are turning them off. The lines of the plot of too many lines of history were so stupidly unrealistic that they are worth it. This is a "family" program that tried to replace any good substance with tenderness and love, and although they are needed for a program about a family, they overestimated it. This will be remembered as my least favorite sit-com of the 80s and 90s. <br /> <br /> My rating: Terrible show. TVG 30 minutes.
