I saw this film at the Toronto film festival with pretty solid expectations. The movie has a great cast and it was closing at the festival, so it must be good, right? how wrong I was <br /> <br /> I knew we were in trouble when, before the movie, the director was talking about how, when he directed an episode of Wiseguy, he met an unknown actor named kevin spacey (a director / writer of wiseguy who makes his movie). debut = bla) ... well, Edison's director / writer must have some incriminating photos of kevin spacey killing a homeless man, because I can not see how he (along with the other actors in the movie) would agree to be in this disaster. <br /> <br /> This movie is absolutely frightening! It's a mix of all the tough police clich√©s. There is nothing new with Edison. The performance was bad and the direction was even worse. It seemed the mentioned wiseguy episode. This was the best direct video movie I've seen. <br /> <br /> some examples of stupid bad moments in Edison ... Morgan Freeman dancing in his apartment without any reason to do rock and roll ... justin timberlake receiving creative criticism of his beauty while his apartment is surrounded by the candles ... llcoolj driving a vintage fire bird ... 3 guys who get shot in the head ... <br /> <br /> this movie is the opposite of the good one. <br /> <br /> Stay away from EDISON!
