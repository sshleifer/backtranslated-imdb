The worst collaboration of De Niro Scorsese in this horrible and agonizing and violent disaster. Scorsese is totally out of his element in this film with horror suddenly cliched loud phone ringing and slamming doors that look ridiculous and embarrassing from a master craftsman. The cast is totally lost here and the southern accents are very annoying and forced. Nick Noltie plays the best lawyer in history who would have ever believed that he could defend anyone! De Niro's psychotic Bowden is just the typical psycho killer of the 90s. The scene with De Niro and Lewis from the beginning is very uncomfortable and the climax goes on and on, and we should all be more than tired of the psycho harasser that never dies. One of my most horrible cinematic experiences. Renting the original is 100 times better. <br /> <br />
