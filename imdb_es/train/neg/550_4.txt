After the superb AANKHEN (2002), which was a remake of a Gujarati play, he comes with WAQT, which also looks like a play. <br /> <br /> In the plays, we have characters who scream, exaggerating here too the same <br /> <br /> The first half shows Amitabh almost joking with the 40+ Akshay Kumar who behaves very funny way as a little nerd <br /> <br /> The movie has a good message of how not to ruin your child, but unfortunately the way. Amitabh wants to make Akki absolutely false <br /> <br /> Even her reason for hiding her illness, her execution in the hospital and Akki's melodramatic speech is a disappointment <br /> <br /> Some emotions touch you , but most are too exaggerated <br /> <br /> Rajpal's comedy is hilarious but it is widespread in the second half <br /> <br /> The direction of Vipul Shah is too exaggerated, although some scenes are good The music is good <br /> <br /> Among the actors, Amitabh exceeds in the first half, but is excellent in emotional scenes. Akshay Kumar also does his part well but he looks uncomfortable in some as well. scenes of py His chemistry with Bachchan is incomparable Rajpal is a highlight, he makes you laugh without exaggeration and only his presence and his stupid behavior and expressionless humor is a riot. Boman is good in some funny parts but too loud in places where Priyanka is the heroine so there is nothing to do, this is her last film with Akki. So far, Shefali is amazing, although she seems too young for Bachchan.
