This movie was amazing. It is beyond the atrocious. I often meet with a group of friends and go to the movie store to find horrible movies to see their comedic value. My friend suggested this, but as we looked at it, people started to leave. I really wanted to finish it, just to be able to say yes, but I could not. It's so bad Horrible gags running, acting lame. The main characters are an annoying klutz dinosaur and Whoopi Goldberg. I would rather see The Postman of Costener twelve times in a row than see a fraction of this movie again. I think they try to deal with some dinosaur discrimination problems, but the part of the movie that really stands out is that the dinosaur constantly hits things with its tail and then laughs. It hurt. Look at it if you are an aspiring masochist, otherwise, leave this alone.
