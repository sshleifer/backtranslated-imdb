Fairly average, even by the standards of Monogram, this mystery (a remake of The Sphinx) has a plot of weirdos that is not deciphered to a large extent, you'll see it after about ten minutes. The two protagonists have a nice dialogue from the beginning, but John Hamilton is irremediably boring as the villain (the perfect cast of Lionel Atwill originated the role) and the imbecile Warren Hymer is quite annoying. However, it's worth sitting down for a five minute appearance by the incomparable Mantan Moreland as Nicodemus, the concierge, gets the best of the defense attorney during a hilarious appearance in court. You have to give it to Bill "One-Take" Beaudine; He was not a great director, but he always attacked a routine programmer with a bit of vaudeville.
