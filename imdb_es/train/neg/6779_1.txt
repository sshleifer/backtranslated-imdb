There is a high level of expectations when you sit down to watch a comedy with a cast headed by Cary Grant, Jayne Mansfield, Ray Walston and Werner Klemperer. Those expectations are further encouraged when the film is directed by Stanley Donen, whose comedic touch was so evident in, among others, DAMN YANKEES!, BEDAZZLED and CHARADE. During the first five minutes, more or less, it seems that these expectations could be fulfilled and then ??. Nothing. What is supposed to be a light comedy, is submerged in the lead, the hard-handed melodrama, without the slightest laugh. <br /> <br /> Relative newcomer Suzy Parker has often been criticized for her performance, or lack of one, in this movie, but in a movie in which even the great Cary Grant appears frequently flat and wood, attacking Parker seems unfair. Not even a light as bright as an Audrey Hepburn or Doris Day could have changed the fortunes of this meandering, lugubrious and totally meaningless screenplay, which drags and drags the interest and patience of the viewer. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast, especially Ray Walston, is still trying to bring the process to life, but the horrible script is beyond reanimation. The desperate and insane effort to drag a half laugh between the numbed audience in the final moments of the film only serves to add insults to the injuries. <br /> <br /> This movie is nothing but a big disappointment at all levels.
