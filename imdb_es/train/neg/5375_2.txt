Having seen this movie, I almost feel that I have lost 2 hours of my life, but I think there is something good in everything: <br /> <br /> If I had to qualify this as any other movie, I can only Receive 1 or 2 tops , but if I qualify it as a low budget ind. movie, you can get 3 or 4. That is, a film is supposed to be 'complete' and without too long passages of boredom or loss of time. This movie is not. But I suppose many independent films are about showing cinematographic abilities, and considering this, this movie has some highlights. If I should comment on what the directors should take with them to their next project, I suppose the distorted sound effects had a certain quality. They also manage to build some characters, however, this brings me to what they should put aside in their next project, because the construction of the character takes too long, since it is largely irrelevant to the plot of the film. Nor should the long periods of time dedicated to walking in the next project continue, what is the point? I guess this movie tries to be a bit of everything (building characters, suspense and a plot), and ends up being nothing (not much) <br /> <br /> This movie is too much and too hard, and I guess I should have been cut to a short film. I could easily find a time to walk or a meaningless dialogue to cut out of the movie. <br /> <br /> There are too many irrelevant things in this movie. The story should have been more simplified. I know there's supposed to be some mystery in this movie, but a slight surprise for whoever is the killer does not make it a mystery. The story behind the "mystery" receives almost no attention during the film, which leaves the final "point" as a quick and unsatisfactory summary. <br /> <br /> Therefore, I would like to say that this movie was a good attempt, but I can not. I hope that managers learn from their mistakes and produce a better product next time. <br /> <br /> If you have no interest in learning from the production of low budget films, there is no need to see this. I do not even see why everyone thinks it's bad. <br /> <br /> As others have said, I'm pretty sure that the 10 that are given to this movie are from people who are somehow involved in the film. This movie could not receive a "10" judging from a remote objective point of view.
