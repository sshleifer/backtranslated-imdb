This movie seems to start in the middle, presents the peripheral players as if they were meaningful and presents the main characters without any substance and thin and / or impenetrable back stories. Almost no one has a credible or discernible motivation for their actions in this film. The plot rambles and finally does not go anywhere, the dialogue is clumsy and trite and the director has little concept of how to get the best out of his actors. It almost seems that there is a first half of this movie, but it was never made. <br /> <br /> We are told that a mysterious pyramid appeared over New York City and that Central Park has inexplicably become an arctic desert. However, none of this seems to have caused much commotion among the general population and is only a minimal concern for the government. <br /> <br /> We are introduced to the "evil corporation" in Eugenics, but that is really fair. A convenient concept to populate the universe with a couple of henchmen who shoot power. All the double meaning of "Eugenie-is-bad" is hard-line and never really hurts here. We're supposed to worry about the central characters, but we never learn enough about them to know why. So much about this world is underdeveloped or completely underdeveloped that it presents itself as a fatalistic rationalization of 1 hour and 40 minutes for rape. <br /> <br /> In the innovative digital world created here, all I can say is that almost at the same time this movie was made, other directors did the same thing with more reliable and credible results. <br /> <br /> After spending time to watch this movie, the hottest question remained in my mind was, "so what?"
