This adaptation positively destroys a classic loved by its subtlety. Timothy Dalton has absolutely no idea of ​​the different nuances of Rochester's character. I get the feeling that he did not even read the book, he just walked around on the set with his pants too tight and gave me a summary of the character that said "Grumpy, relative, dark past". He plays Rochester not as a character or as a real person, but as a grump who never smiles until, after committing himself, at that moment he miraculously transforms himself into a thought. There is no chemistry. The only feeling that this adaptation excited me was disbelief and also sympathy for Charlotte Bronte, who is definitely becoming her grave. Go and read the book again. ROCHESTER HAS A PERSONALITY. AND ON THE WAY: A SCENE OF LOVE "PASSIONATE" DOES NOT MEAN THAT YOU HAVE TO EAT YOUR FACE.
