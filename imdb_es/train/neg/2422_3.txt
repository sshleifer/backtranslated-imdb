This film does not really promote that children are kinder and have better attitudes, as a family movie should be, and this would not be considered familiar anyway because it has some things that children should not see. It's not the best ABC Family movie if you ask me. If there were less sexual themes in the movie, maybe it would be better. Hollywood is not doing anything to improve a movie by adding sexual situations. There really is no reason for them. At least this is a television movie. I would not like to spend my money on this trash for renting it. If you have other things to do besides watching this movie, please proceed with them.
