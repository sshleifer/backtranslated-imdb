This is one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. However, the little slave, Alice and Jared Harris imitating Christopher Walken is what makes this movie entertaining. Smoking, drinking and Alice's strange way of appearing when she is called that is strange and interesting. I have to applaud Jared for his impersonation of Christopher Walken, and Christopher Walken for allowing this to be in the film.
