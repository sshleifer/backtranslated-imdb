This budget-hungry action / science fiction Italian hybrid presents David Warbeck as a Miami reporter chosen by the ghosts of the people of Atlantis (!) To stop an evil entrepreneur (nominated for the John Ireland Academy Award ) of using a telepathic fetus Using spores of an asteroid to rule the world. Do you have all that? Despite such a far-fetched plot, this is actually quite boring and the RAIDERS OF ATLANTIS make fun of him with contempt. Honestly, the most creative (intentionally) of this film is the reworking of Herbie Hancock's BEVERLY HILLS COP theme for the opening titles. The most unintentionally creative bit involves a scene in a lab that inexplicably shows up twice in a row. Maybe the director Alberto De Martino wanted to make us all the avant-garde in the twilight of his career? I was going to declare Ireland's worst movie on their résumé, but then I saw SATAN'S CHEERLEADERS on the list. I would also like to state with certainty that I am probably the only person in the history of the world who does a dual function of this and of Hitchcock's VERTIGO.
