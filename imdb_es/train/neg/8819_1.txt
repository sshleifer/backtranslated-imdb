Without a doubt, this is the worst fucking movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> This movie plot is that a guy goes crazy and dresses up as Santa Claus and kills people because he saw his mother. He gave his father oral sex while he was dressed as a holy clause. WHY WAS IT IMMEDIATE? Is it me or is it the worst reason for someone to go crazy like NEVER? And that is not the only thing. I'm serious when I say that NOTHING HAPPENS IN THIS DAMNED MOVIE. nothing until they have passed like 1 hour and 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> There is a whole scene in which he beats Santa Claus's beard. IT IS A MINUTE OF FRIGGIN LONG. WHAT HELL WANTS TO SEE THAT? However, I must say that the end of this movie made me shit with laughter. So if you watch this movie on television or something comes back in 1 hour and 20 minutes to see, without a doubt, the worst ending of the whole film history. And i mean it. <br /> <br /> It's not even so good, it's bad, it's tedious, it's idiotic, it made me want to break the vcr. It's just not worth your time, I'm also sure that all the other reviews mentioned this, but the actress who played the mother in Home Improvements was in this movie for a fraction of a second. DO YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW BAD THIS FILM IS? I would be fine at home improving sixty-six hours, and then watch these movies once again.
