I love all types of movies, especially horror. That said, Survival is not up to NONE of the exaggerations that surround it. <br /> <br /> I can not give you any point about originality. There is nothing wrong with exploring the same issues or remaking what others have done. It has just become an indie movie to take us on a slasher trip through the woods, a crazed killer and, lately, to include a crazy family. In those lines I have to compare it with the likes of Texas Chainsaw, Wrong Turn (although the twist in that is obvious), and others. Survival falls short compared to comparable movies. The plot was not original in any way. Some movies can cope with a weak plot (and too exaggerated) with excellent performance, special fx or a number of other factors. Survivial has nothing to bet on. If you wish, consider the following: The acting in the movie never took off. I do not hit or blame the actors for that, or the director. The dialogue was, at best, mediocre, and the actors involved never showed (they did not say they DID NOT have) the talent to achieve it. I mention 2 highlights. The protagonist of this movie certainly has the appearance, but I think he really needs to consider more training before he's ready to take a movie. The actor who played Greg also had potential, but we could never see any of that (watch the movie to see why, you will not believe it ...). <br /> <br /> The granular aspect of the film. Oh yes, that little tid of magic movie designed to take us to the glory days of the "Grindhouse" movies. In making movies today, that has become a trick. Either it works or it does not work. In this case it simply does not work. There are too many other flaws in progress, so he ends up distracting himself from the movie, without adding more. That said, I think they did a good job of adding that grain. That's a good quality grain. I think with a different script, a better direction and possibly actors, they should try another "Grindhouse" attempt. They will probably succeed. <br /> <br /> Regarding the technological aspects, in my opinion, they are not quite right for me either. You could have been more careful with the audio (sounds like it was introduced directly into the camera, but there is nothing wrong with that) and being filmed in DV, it was too soft for my taste. <br /> <br /> That's all I have to say about that .....
