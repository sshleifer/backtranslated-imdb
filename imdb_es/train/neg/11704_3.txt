One of those, "Why was this done?" films. Romance is very difficult to swallow. It's one of those romances, which, suddenly, "click" - are in love. The film is full of long breaks and uncomfortable moments: the drive-in restaurant is the most notable. Charles Grodin does a credible job, but for most of the film it's just him and Louise Lasser. Ask yourself, do you want to see Grodin with his neurosis and Lasser with his neurosis together for an hour and a half?
