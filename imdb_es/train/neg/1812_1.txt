Go immediately and rent this movie. It will be on a lower shelf in your local video store and it will be covered in dust. Nobody will have touched it in years. It can even be a $ .50 special! It's worth ten dollars, I swear! Buy it! There are not many movies that can be compared to this: the celluloid version of that substance that forms at the bottom of a trash can after a few years. Yes, I gave it a '1', but it really deserves a lot lower. The scales 1-10 were not designed with this kind of thing in mind.
