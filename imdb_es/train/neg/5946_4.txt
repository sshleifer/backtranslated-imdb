There is absolutely no plot in this movie ... there is no character development ... there is no climax ... nothing. But it has some good fighting scenes that are actually quite good. So there it goes ... like a movie in general is pretty bad, but if you like a brainless movie that does not offer more than a good action scene, then watch this movie. Do not expect anything more than just that. A decent performance and a not so bad address ... A pair of cameos by Kimbo and Carano ... I wanted to see Carano a little more in this film ... she is a good fighter and a very hot girl ... White He is a great martial artist and a decent actor. I really hope I can get a better movie in the future so we can enjoy their art ... Imagine a movie with White and Jaa together ... that would be amazing
