Perhaps one of the most supremely overrated horror classics ever made, Halloween features the memorable Michael Myers and some of Jamie Lee Curtis' great performances. <br /> <br /> However, its recovery capacity factor is very close to zero, since there is an unforgivable amount of time devoted to the attenuation / culmination of real events. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of film that can get away from microwave popcorn and not miss anything. <br /> <br /> How many sequels were generated, I will never understand. <br /> <br /> Thank God, Rob Zombie is remaking this. And, in general, I hate remakes. <br /> <br /> It will surely more than make up for all the random time gaps with some extravagant points of interest that the original seriously lacks. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that we think we should like, very similar to the way they taught us that we should enjoy Dickens. <br /> <br /> Do not assume this is a classic.
