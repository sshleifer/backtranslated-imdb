You get 5 writers together, have each write a different story with a different genre, and then you try to make a movie with that. It's action, it's adventure, it's science fiction, it's western, it's a disaster. I'm sorry, but this movie sucks absolutely. 4.5 is giving you a tremendously high rating. That said, it's movies like this that make me think I could write movies, and I can barely write.
