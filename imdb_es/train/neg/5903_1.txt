I live in Salt Lake City and I'm not a Mormon, so why did I rent this movie? Well, because I live in Utah and I thought it would be good to see places I know in a movie. I really knew that I was not going to get the inside jokes, so I was not surprised when I sat with the deer's gaze on the headlights. What surprised me was the Mormon antormoneras actions that were placed in this movie. <br /> <br /> I know it's a Mormon movie, aimed at members of the LDS Church, but I found it offensive because of the typical stereotype of people who are not of their faith. All those who were not Mormons, who were not many, drank, smoked and had an attitude of incredible selfishness, why? <br /> <br /> That really pissed me off with this movie, they made the Mormons so pure, but the rest of the state of Utah I guess is full of punk psychopaths just because they do not follow the LDS Church Scriptures. <br /> <br /> I can understand that the arguments revolve around all the LDS members, but you would think Salt Lake City was 100% Mormon, which is not even the truth. And as I said, the non-Mormons in the film were portrayed as drunken idiots, please! <br /> <br /> I guess I do not understand it because I do not belong to their faith and I guess it never will be.
