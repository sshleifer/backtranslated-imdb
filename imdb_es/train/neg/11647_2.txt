CRIME BOSS is directed by Alberto De Martino; An Italian criminal drama filmed partially in Hamburg, Germany. A movie easily forgotten. Even in spite of a good sequence of car chases, this movie seems to continue almost aimless. A new Don takes over a powerful mafia family and finds himself fighting for his own life. The unwritten laws and ethics of the mafia code make it difficult to trust someone, especially when there are millions of dollars at stake. Brutality and violence breed the same in return. This can not be put on a shelf with the epics of real gangsters. Only the look of the film brings back memories of the American drive-in rate. Even the popular American actor Telly Savalas can not improve the caliber of this criminal drama. Antonio Sabato also stars: Paola Tedesco, Guido Lollobrigida, Serio Tramonti and Piero Morgia.
