The movie is almost ridiculous with Debbie Reynolds and Shelley Winters forming a couple as mothers of convicted murderers. With the horrible notoriety after the trial, the two women form a team and move from New York to California to open a singing and dance studio for girls like Shirley Temple. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, it becomes clear that Reynolds has made a mistake in taking Winters with her to California. Winters plays a deeply religious woman who seems to be losing her balance every time. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, women living together receive threatening phone calls. Reynolds, who puts on a blonde wig, soon loves the rich father of one of his students, very well played by Dennis Weaver. <br /> <br /> Agnes Moorehead, in one of her last films, is briefly seen as Sister Alma, of whom Winters is a faithful listener. <br /> <br /> The movie really belongs to Shelley Winters. She is heavy here and the heaviness seems to make her act even better. Winters always did well in the roles that put his nerves to the test. <br /> <br /> The end is of the macabre and who can forget Winters on the piano playing with a completely insane look?
