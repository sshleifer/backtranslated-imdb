You do not need to write a script for this trash outrage! Just sit down and watch a couple of plastered women and guests fall asleep before a rampant audience display on "The Jerry Show"! Violent and unpleasant, this cash in the real program of Jerry Springer reveals everything that the overrated exaggerated talk show does not show you on the air, unless you have a collection of uncensored videos made by the producers of "Cops. " Even the outer world of Springerland reveals the most amateur performance of the decade! This is to show him that THE GONG SHOW MOVIE had a central character in a turkey movie. Change the channel! REJECTED <br /> <br />
