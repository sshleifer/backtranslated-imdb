You probably should have called this movie The Map because most of the whole stupid movie revolves around a map of a cemetery. Not to mention how many of the same boring photos on the map there are. The only thing that shows more than the map itself is the small drops of sweat that constantly accumulate on the forehead of our main character. This was, of course, the way the filmmakers showed us how incredibly tense things are getting up in the Immortal Hills cemetery. Come on, could not you have shown us just one of the scenes of death? We hear a lot about how everyone on the map falls like flies, but we can not see anything. Somehow, I bury The Living to keep my attention, so I was quite generous with the rating I gave him, but I will not recommend this movie to anyone. Unless you have a deep fascination for maps or sweat, I recommend renting a better movie, like Spit on your grave or Drink your blood.
