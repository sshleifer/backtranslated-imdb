In Pinter's name, all knees will bend, especially after his acceptance speech by the Nobel Prize for Literature, which did little more than regurgitate canned anti-Americanism, by numbers, in the sixth form. But this is even worse; Not only is it a journey through lack of talent, an excellent example of how to get away from its decades-old reputation, but it also represents the carnage of an excellent piece. The original Sleuth was a masterpiece of this kind. Yes, it was a theatrical confection, and it's easy to see how your central plot device would work better on the stage than the screen, but it still worked very well. This is a piece of vanity by Michael Caine, but let's be honest, Caine is not Olivier. Not only can not he fill Larry's shoes, he can not even fill his bath shoes. The proper name of Caine is, after all, a clearly average actor, whose only real recommendation, like so many other British actors, is his longevity in the business. He was a good Harry Palmer, excellent at Get Carter, but that's a lot for you, buddy! Give this a very wide berth and stick to the excellent original. This is more than a half pinter.
