* WARNING * Contains MANY SPOILERS! <br /> <br /> Let me start by saying that I have great respect for the incredible talent of Gillian Anderson as a varied and versatile actress, so I can not understand her reasons for agreeing to do this. movie once he saw the script (or the lack of it). <br /> <br /> The premise of the film was, in my opinion, a great idea and there were some genuinely stimulating themes, but it ended up like a collapsed souffl√©. It is an example of why I hate 99% of British cinema. It feels too long, it's tedious, for the most part, and not much happens after the first twenty minutes. Just when you think there is a possibility of it accelerating, disappoint Paula Radcliffe running a marathon. With little imaginative direction and a minimalist plot, there's not much to keep the audience from falling asleep in their popcorn. As for the script, I can only assume that the writer was trying to save some trees, with the average scene reading something like "Alice: F *** OFF!" (Adam stares, Adam runs into the woods) (Alice continues) Alice ADAM! ADAM! "I suspect that, word for word, the actors probably paid them more than Kate Moss paid for her Virgin Mobile ads. The few lines there were not much variation with the frequent use of the word f that would make Bridget Jones's friend, Shazza, feel proud. There is little establishment of the main characters before the main sordid event that leaves the audience without much sympathy for the characters beyond an automatic reaction of "Oh, that's terrible". <br /> <br /> Alice is not the kind of woman who cuts sympathy either. She has a great job, an expensive apartment in London with a ceiling space to die for, but she shows up on the screen as presumptuous, bitter and dissatisfied before her life takes a turn for the worse. After the attack, a few layers are removed, which explains why she is like that; she grew up with a soldier in old boots who believed that teaching her to shoot her weapon was the ultimate expression of love, so, instead of following in her footsteps, she went to the big city in search of something to make her feel that her life is worth the sorrow. Instead, he found a group of middle-class Toffs stereotypes who despise anyone who is not rich enough to drive a Lexus and the luxuries that come with an integrated security / entertainment system (ie, become Mrs. Robinson in an aspiring Cockney electrician). ) Someone hands me a handkerchief. The only salvation of this character is that she is played by Gillian Anderson. In the hands of a minor actress, she would have been intolerably one-dimensional, but Mrs. Anderson actually manages to inject some fleeting moments of humanity into this otherwise lifeless human being, especially when she sincerely apologizes for her fury on the road in a vain attempt. to prevent their attackers from continuing their assault. <br /> <br /> I can not say that Adam has fared much better. Danny Dyer played it well as a Jack the Lad of fish out of the water, but a good performance could not save him as much from the lack of a script as from the total lack of background of any character. <br /> <br /> This movie was mainly based on the impact value, but the time was off and it felt too designed from start to finish. In terms of impact, the most shocking thing about this movie is the unashamed demonstration of how painfully thin Ms. Anderson has become; It was almost as disturbing to see as the brutal attack scenes. On a side note, only in a British film would a gang of violent sex offenders take the time to offer each other contraceptives before continuing to cheer on their partners. Talk about the rigid upper lip taken to the extreme! If this is the kind of movie the National Lottery is donating to do, then I'm not surprised that fewer and fewer people choose to spend their pound each week. <br /> <br /> To say that I hated this movie is to give it too much credit, I did not care enough about any of the characters to guarantee such a strong emotion. I want those hours and hours of my life to return, please!
