With a Bo Derek movie, the audience gets exactly what they expect. A thin web of paper and a few pictures of Mrs. Derek without clothes. 'Ghosts can not do it' is just that. The first fifteen minutes is a normal television drama, as long as Scott [Anthony Quinn] is still alive. He is a very good actor with a long experience in many different roles, but it seems that even a famous actor needs to work only for money at times. Bo Derek is the opposite, always playing a surprisingly beautiful young woman with or without clothes. The movie is a complete waste of time. If you want to see Quinn, rent Lawrence of Arabia or La Strada. If you want to see naked women or with bad acting, rent any porn movie.
