Four Eyed Monsters follows the relationship of a shy and lonely videographer and a struggling artist, equally detached, who, both living in the Big Apple, develop an improbable romance with the help of a dating site on the Internet. This in itself is not so unusual, but what is its method of communication. Before the verbal, they take notes to write and then communicate through a video. <br /> <br /> The film is based on the relationship of the creator (Arin Crumley and Susan Buice), who in addition to writing and directing, takes the role of the main characters as well. With avant-garde elements, antiparrama and docudrama, the film disperses to the wind with an indecisive structure nested between narcissism and self-indulgence. <br /> <br /> As the film progresses, a brief description The separation and deterioration of their once intriguing form of communication age as the couple faces the difficulties of reality. Focusing solely on internal conflict, or on relationship problems, the film struggles through a stagnant narrative that is neither original nor moving. This could have been easily avoided with the addition of a secondary plot and an external conflict, and a third act, for which there is none: just a melodrama montage that leads nowhere. <br /> <br /> What is even more aggravating is the descent of the film from history to reality that ends abruptly with an open and unsatisfactory ending. This would have been very good and elegant, but there are no questions or a meaning to be discovered or meditated on. <br /> <br /> (On a side note, the film contains a beautiful animation and a vivid and moving soundtrack, One of the most interesting aspects of the production.) <br /> <br /> But as always , look at the film and decide for yourself.
