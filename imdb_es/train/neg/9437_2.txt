I have never considered myself a "student" when it comes to watching movies, I see them, I form an opinion and that is all. But Deranged changed all this. This movie is undoubtedly the most inept attempt to make movies I've seen. All the children who arrive at the university thinking that they will be the next Spielberg or Tarantino need to be given this film with a manual entitled "How not to make a movie". Not only is there no story to tell, but the filmmakers were not competent enough to make it worthwhile to watch a movie. It's been a while since I saw it, but all I can say is watch the shots from above in the opening scenes. They never end! It's almost like taking out your teeth, but it's not so much fun.
