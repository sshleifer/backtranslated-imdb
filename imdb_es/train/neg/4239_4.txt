This was a better movie than average, I thought, because it was on the wire. I had expected something like melodrama with cheese and the special bad effects seen in classics like Christmas Rush or First Daughter / Target / Shot, etc. <br /> <br /> The cast was well chosen ... I especially liked Ron Livingston as the pressed SWAT Commander. It is good to see him reviewing the same material with which he had so much success in Band of Brothers. The producers and designers did their homework because all the scenes and shots seemed to have done that day in 1997. <br /> <br /> So, if you have the chance to see this movie, I'm sure that since FX returns it to Run all 50 times ... take 2 hours and enjoy it.
