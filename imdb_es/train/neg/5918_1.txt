Carl Panzram lived an incredible life and wrote his memoirs on pieces of paper for possibly the only person who ever did anything disinterested for him. The book "Panzram: A Journal of Murder" by Thomas E. Gaddis and James O. Long, which emerged for most of a century after Panzram's death, gives the historical context to the first generation of the story of the Americans to run away from home go to the west and be a cowboy, get caught, thrown in the child's house, escape repeatedly and incarcerated again and again all the time being tortured and sodomized. As Panzram grew huge and strong, he sought revenge for the evil that had been done while traveling to South America, Europe and Africa, and it did not matter which people raped, robbed or murdered because we are all equally useless. . <br /> <br /> This movie shows the skinny James Woods as the rough, miserly neck, son of a bitch Carl Panzram, who in the film is a "drunk", too dramatic and emotional, and who never mentions The Joy of sodomize men and boys. The film is not based on anything else, especially the note on this world traveler and career prisoner (like stealing former President Taft or being released from Oregon prison whenever he gave his word to return). In short, I do not think Carl is very happy.
