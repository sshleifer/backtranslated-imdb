The Maysles brothers reached a low point in human interaction with this movie. Remember, you, who used words like "masterpiece" when you reviewed this movie, that these fears of Maysles did not occur to them simply to drive to the Hamptons and film some eccentric people. No, when they found these two poor and pathetic people, they had to finance their project (and imagine what they were told to people with money to sell the project). Then they became friends with the two extremely vulnerable women. There is no meeting of minds here or real consensual participation. These wretched Maysles smiled, kissed his ass, did everything possible for the Beales to cooperate and then exploited them as brutally as ever. One would like to think that these scammers had occasional thoughts of remorse and guilt. But the filming process, given the previous planning, the actual filming and then the editing, took a lot of time and its objective had no dispositions to really relate to the Beales as human beings. A film of exploitation perpetrated by the vilest people. As time gathered, his cinematic reputation was overshadowed by what they did here. His reputation as human beings is execrable. This is how people will remember them. Grotesque hustlers.
