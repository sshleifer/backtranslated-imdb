I expected the film based on Grendel, the book written by John Gardner in the late seventies. It was based on Beowulf's epic, but told from the monster's perspective. <br /> <br /> Regardless of what you think of Gardner's book, a film based on Beowulf's epic should not be titled Grendel, when it says nothing more about the monster beyond the few pathetic scenes in which the CG monster is shown as nothing more than a modified Predator. <br /> <br /> In addition to this, writers should also be punished for ruining the original story and contributing to the continued ignorance of television audiences throughout the United States. <br /> <br /> Typical Hollywood to get this so badly. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing and a complete waste of time.
