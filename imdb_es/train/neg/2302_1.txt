Some of the interesting things are our combat hero, the faith healer Pat, his son Gordon (the television ministry looks like a family business) and Terry Meeuwsen (Won Miss America in 1973, wearing a swimsuit and showing off his Legs, Oh my God!) Say when our poor viewers are sick and need help. <br /> <br /> 1. Someone with a "right abscess tooth" has just been healed.2. Someone with "crooked intestines" has been healed. Then, Terry said there was a person with a "strange condition", (do you mean that God does not know?) A burn in the legs, which has just been healed.4. Then Gordon said that there is a man (that reduces him!) With swelling of the sinuses on his right cheek, with a lot of pain behind the right eye, but now he is healed.5.Someone with a problematic right hip, with limited mobility from a Stroke, now he is able to walk. 6. Terry said he saw someone with severe stiffness in the neck bone, but he did not know the exact disease (God does not know?) That the person is now cured. 7. Someone paralyzed on the right side, particularly (not exactly ?!) The right side of the face has now been healed.8. A man (who reduces back to the world population) with a plate in his skull has continuous problems and doctors simply do not know what to do. Terry said he saw that the bone was forming around the plate (the funny bone ?!) and that the man's pain disappeared, which had now healed. <br /> <br /> It explains how our war hero Pat helps our sick and poor people. 1. There is a woman in Kansas City (Missouri or Kansas, but that is much reduced.) That has a breast that the Lord is now drying, thank you Jesus. 2. There is a man with a financial need, I think a hundred thousand dollars. (I think your god needs to go to school or something!) That need is being fulfilled at this time, and within three days, the money will be supplied through the miraculous power of the holy spirit. Thank you Jesus. 3. There is a woman in Cincinnati with cancer of the lymph nodes. <br /> <br /> I do not know if he has already been diagnosed (Ask your vengeful god Pat!), but you have not felt well, and the Lord is dissolving the cancer right now! (What?!) 4. There is a lady in Saskatoon (I suppose Canada) in a wheelchair curvature of the spine. The Lord is straightening that at this moment, and you can stand and walk! (If you have this condition, ignore Pat). It is and it is yours. Thank you Jesus! Amen, Amen! <br /> <br /> When Pat Robertson had prostate cancer, was it Peter Popoff?, Oral Roberts? Benny Hinn? Terry or Gordon? Do not! On February 17, 2003, Pat went to a REAL DOCTOR to have him operated! (Does he mean he does not trust that his faith healed his friends, Terry or his own son Gordon ?!) <br /> <br /> When LT Pat Robertson was in the Marine Corps during the Korean War , was an officer of alcoholic beverages, responsible for keeping the officers provided with liquor. It was known that he drank himself and frequented prostitutes and feared that he would come into contact with gonorrhea. (I should ask a healer for help!) <br /> <br /> The reason why Pat left the fight was because his father Absalom Willis Robertson (D Va (1946-66) was president of the Committee of Military Appropriations of the Senate. <br /> <br /> Terrorist attacks, September 11, 2001 We have imagined ourselves invulnerable and we have been consumed by the pursuit of health, wealth, between 150 and 200 million dollars, friends!) Pleasures materials (a mansion in Virginia Beach, Virginia, with a helicopter launch pad!) and sexuality (he had had sex with his future wife before marriage, and they had a child!). (Terrorism) is happening because God is lifting his protection from us. (Declaration published on September 13, 2001). Pat Robertson reminds me of Burgermeister in Santa Claus is Coming To Town and his vengeful god reminds me of Venger in Dungeons And Dragons. <br /> <br /> Bratty brat Gordon does what Daddy Pat tells him to do and Terry is a paid woman who has no mind of his own. <br /> <br /> This will really catch you! The September 5, 2005 issue of The 700 Club included a report by Christian Broadcasting Network correspondent Gary Lane from outside the New Orleans Convention Center, which has housed mostly impoverished black disaster victims throughout the Weekend. "Several possessions left behind suggest the mentality of some of the evacuees" said Lane "include this voodoo with the saying" May the curse be with you. "On the screen appeared a photo of a plastic cup of remembrance of one of the innumerable New Orleans candy stores, Guerrilla Warfare title and Thugs 'R' Us, "Lane said, pointing to a pile or rap CDs scattered across the floor. (Your fanatic father Absalom has taught Pat well enough racism!) <br /> <br /> If any of you, good people always think about donating these sexist and fanatical people, please, in the name of God , do not! Sponsor a softball or basketball team, deliver to a food rack, be an older brother or sister of a child, but please do not give to these people because they have been around for more than 40 years and I have not resolved anything. <br /> <br /> If you still do not believe me, the guy who listened to Pat Robertson listened during a commercial on the web and clicks search and once you hear what he really likes, I know for sure that he does not Give a penny to these liars! And, by the way, Terry divorced once and Pat has spoken many times against divorce in his programs. <br /> <br /> I like to say hello to the people of Dover, Pennsylvania, Orlando, Florida, and the nice people who were hit by Hurricane Katrina and I hope it's a nice day. Has Operation Blessing been useful for New Orleans? (I doubt it!) Please let our readers know! I make! By the way, friends, if you're sick, go to a real doctor and let everyone laugh at these liars, and someday Burgermeister Pat, Gordon and Terry can go somewhere else and take their angry god Venger.
