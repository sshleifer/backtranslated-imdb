Slaughter High The revenge story of a nerdy boy who was the victim of one of the coolest and coolest jokes in film history. Unfortunately, after the promising opening, the movie went straight to hell. A very tedious and redundant disaster with mediocre cuts and a final half hour that absorbed a whole new level of suction. The guy who played the nerd actually committed suicide shortly after the movie was released. If you want to rent the movie, stop it after the joke and remember, choose life.
