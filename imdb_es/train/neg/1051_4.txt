Although Frank Loesser's songs are some of the best that Broadway has to offer, they are baffled by the lethargic staging of Joseph L. Mankiewicz and his uninspired presentation. When it's over, it looks like you have not seen a musical. Mankiewicz does not seem to know how to present the challenging but melodious melodies of Loesser to achieve the maximum effect: for example, one of the best numbers, the 'Adelaide's Lament' showstopping, concludes when Adelaide (Vivian Blaine) wears the belt at the end while sitting a chaise lounge; and Stubby Kaye's spiritual fake `Sit, you're Rockin 'The Boat' has his supporting chorus sitting on folding chairs while he just stays there. Mankiewicz eliminates all the fun of everything by letting the static scenes go on for too long and his dialogue (adapted from Abe Burrows' stage book) has nothing of the wit in his films like 'All About Eve'. Part of the blame has to go to the drivers, almost all of whom are wrong: Marlon Brando seems baffled as to why he is in a musical, Frank Sinatra plays a guy too nice and does not have the advantage that makes him so essential. (The songs do not suit his style) and Jean Simmons barely registers the way Shirley Jones would. Only Blaine, like Adelaide's charming crush, catches our attention like a Broadway professional. The colorful artistic direction is by Joseph Wright and Howard Bristol created the striking ensembles.
