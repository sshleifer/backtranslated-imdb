The American Humane Association, which is the source of the family responsibility disclaimer "No animal was harmed ..." (the trademark of the AHA), began to monitor the use of animals in film production more than 60 years ago. years, after a blindfold. The horse was forced to jump to his death from the top of a cliff for a shot in the movie Jesse James (1939). Needless to say, the atrocious act kills for me all the entertainment aspect of this movie. I suppose it could be said that at least the horse did not die in vain, since it was the beginning of the audience waking up to the cruel and frightful pain that the animals caused for the glory of the film, but I can not help but feel it. that if the poor animal had a choice, this insurance would not have been the way it would have taken!
