I never saw the original film in the series ... I hope it was a much better movie than this one or the sequel made in the 1980s as if that were not how these terrible sequels were justified. This movie had a very good advantage when it was announced to be shown in one of those old independent stations that are now a thing of the past. Anyway, it seemed like it would be a pretty good scary movie. However, it was a movie that would make some Walt Disney films look dark. Actually, this movie was just a lot of light fluff with virtually no boggy creek creature to be seen. The only real sighting is near the end when you see its shape during a very strong storm, apart from the fact that there are practically no signs of the creature that was really disappointing as a child. The story is basically that the old evil hunters must kill anything they see and chase the boggy creek creature and the children are willing to help him or just a random hairy guy in the woods who likes to throw boats randomly through of the water. However, it's not worth seeing. However, I would like to see the original, but the creator of this character would be the evil creature of the 80s, but he also made a very good movie in the 70s "The Town the Dreaded Sundown".
