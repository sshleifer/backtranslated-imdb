I just watched this movie on DVD last night and decided to review the reviews this morning. It seems that "I, Robot" has polarized the critical viewing community here in IMDb (and has also led to many insults and insults). <br /> <br /> I find it somewhat surprising, since The movie is not great (or even good), but it is not terrible (or even really bad). What this movie really is ... depressing. Depressing that the population of filmmakers in the United States is so willing to become insipid, clich√©s reheat and hail them as spectacular new works. This film as "retread" written on it, from the plot (an uncomfortable mix of Asimov and today's super action) to the character of Smith (a cynical intelligent mouth with a titanium spine), to the effects specials (taken from Matrix and some others). <br /> <br /> "I, Robot" is, unfortunately, possibly the perfect action movie for today's audience: superficial argument, insipidly nimble dialogue and lots and lots of adrenaline. Smith is mediocre, but we already knew that (it seems to be the last failed attempt by Hollywood to create a black Bruce Willis). The story has many holes, of all sizes, but I do not think that most of the people attracted to this film are critical enough to realize it. Maybe a blockbuster by today's standards, but very B-movie compared to the real winners.
