Ok, I like B movies ... I know what B movies are supposed to represent. But this is just awful. I am surprised that you have obtained such a decent global score. The only redeeming qualities of this film are the (mainly) marginal splash effects. Do not get me wrong, the gore abounds in this movie, but few effects really leaped on me (like the "anal probing" ... it was great!). <br /> <br /> I think this movie was shot on a camcorder. Come on, rent a Betacam at least, I've seen pornography with better production values ​​(and better acting too). <br /> <br /> Acting - it stunk! But not in the form of Troma or the Full Moon. <br /> <br /> History: invented! But that's what you get from movies like these. Very loose! <br /> <br /> Sets and accessories - vacuum! My 16 year old brother makes more elaborate games for our house on Halloween. <br /> <br /> Dubbing and dialogue: stunk! Horrible voice acting (I should not even call it acting) and every word is "S ** t" or "F ** k". <br /> <br /> There are a lot of good classics and horror ratings. / splashes of movies out there and they are not that hard to track. Do yourself a favor by not wasting time on this shit!
