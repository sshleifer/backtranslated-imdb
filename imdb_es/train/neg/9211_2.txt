This movie reminds me a lot of the anti-drug movies of the 50s and 60s due to the fact that it was made by people who, obviously, have never experienced the social evil they warn us about. Tom Hanks and his friends are "RPGs", but there are no dice, many candles, and then you are simply dragged by a bad montage that shows Hanks falling in love with the group's lady. Pretty funny but wrong. I wonder how many poor children destroyed their D & D stuff, and they told me that the use of their imagination was the way to destruction. As a movie, it's basically a special after school, bad acting (although Hanks shows some of his talent) and relationship conversations, and nobody seems to be having fun. It seems that these films have a psychological focus on teens who start on the road to adultism, which is more serious, apparently, and requires you to put on your seatbelt and do what others do. Despite my vote of 2, it is worth seeing because of its unique genre, scary movies, which I personally find quite funny.
