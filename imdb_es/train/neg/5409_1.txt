The Christmas secret was touted as a wonderful movie, but I was really disappointed. They even sold VHS and DVD copies of the film when it was finished, which leads me to believe that the producers were really proud of this project. As a film actor, I felt that most of the performances were called by phone, although Beau Bridges, like Nick, had a moment or two. If I were Richard Thomas, I would not put this movie on my good resume. It was a shame. He had been a fan from his days in Walton, but I found myself not trying to see any of his subsequent works, because of how poor this offer was. <br /> <br /> In defense of the actors, the direction was forced, mechanical, and completely amateur. <br /> <br /> I hope this is not considered a spiteful criticism and negative assumptions about my qualifications as a critic. I turned on the film because I had a good cast and I was ready to enjoy the movie. However, I would challenge anyone who was there to watch this movie and I did not want their money returned, even though I was on T.V.
