The fool is so stupid, in this supposedly uninteresting black comedy. Essentially, what starts when Chris Klein tries to keep a low profile, eventually transforms into an uninspired version of "The Three Amigos," but without any laughter. For black comedy to work, it must be outrageous, and "Play Dead" is not. For the black comedy to work, it can not be mean, which is "Play Dead". What is really "Play Dead" is a city full of crazy people. However, Fred Dunst does a fairly fair impersonation of Billy Bob Thornton's character from "A Simple Plan," while Jake Busey does a fairly fair imitation of, well, Jake Busey. - MERK
