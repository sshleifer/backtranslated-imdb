Oliver Hardy wakes up with a hangover and soon learns that his uncle comes to see Ollie's new wife and baby. The problem is that they do not exist, it seems that Ollie invented them! Then, it's up to him and his friend to find a lady with a baby who agrees to pass herself off as her family. <br /> <br /> This is not a particularly unique idea of ​​history, as I have seen at least a couple of other silent shorts with this exact plot. The best of these was Bobby Vernon, "Do not kill me." It's much better than ONE TOO, probably much of this was because it was made a decade later, when comedy became a bit more sophisticated and relied less on slapstick without meaning. Now I'm not against physical comedy, but in some slapstick movies, people start firing guns, they kick and choke each other, etc. with little provocation. Unfortunately, at the end of ONE TOO MANY, that's exactly what they do. None of that makes sense and it was as if they had run out of ideas for the story. <br /> <br /> In general, it is not exactly a milestone in entertainment. There just is not enough reward to deserve it unless you're an obsessive and silent fan like me.
