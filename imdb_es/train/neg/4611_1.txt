I suppose it is Jack's great capacity for empathy that makes him the powerful actor he is, but empathy has a price like all things: when surrounded by mediocrity, he instinctively lowers the standard and becomes one with the. He is a joke like a mafia hitman (also because the part does not suit him in the least, since he is very extroverted) and only herding avoids making a fool of himself. Kathleen Turner had a long career. because she is tall and blonde, because her ability to act is limited to what she does with her eyes, when she opens them wide, which she is convinced is incredibly sexy and Anjelica Huston is the same (to whom she is given interesting) in everything, just like Robert Lodge <br /> <br /> The film is an unconvincing draft (and this will be the only mention of the rag they call script) of a gangster movie, with a cast that probably only I was interested in getting to the later party. Faster (they certainly gathered the party elite in this). What, they fired in 1 day? -Because that would be the only explanation.
