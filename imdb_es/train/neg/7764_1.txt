What is this ? A low-budget sex comedy? Anyway, it perfectly describes the people in Spain. They could have a better idea, I mean they make this type of movie since the 60s ... and people like it! This is not a comedy for teenagers or a family member (you can not let your 12-year-old children look at two guys kissing in bed, never want to go to Spain). This should be qualified as "R", because only people over 35 seem to laugh seeing: S I'm really disappointed, maybe I do not like gays (which is a very important part of the movie). <br /> <br /> Foreign humor is horrible in movies (except Kusturica), stay dramas! If you want a new comedy try Talladega Nights.
