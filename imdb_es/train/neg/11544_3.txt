I really wanted to see this, I love Danny Dyer and I think Gillian Anderson is a talented actress. The beginning was interesting. I liked the relationship between the two stars. Soon it jumps quickly to the main plot, that is attacked by a group of strangers and Dyer is beaten extremely badly while Anderson is violated. Then they decide to go for some revenge. It sounds good, right? Well, it is not. History becomes boring and is in the background, and certain things become really strange. I will not give any details, but things happen that, for my part, I do not want to see. I like to give all movies the benefit of the doubt, and I really wanted to like this one. It just did not work. I give it a 3 out of 10, mainly for the performance.
