I rented I AM CURIO-YELLOW from my video store because of all the controversy that surrounded it when it was first released in 1967. I also heard that it was initially seized by the US Customs. UU If you ever tried to enter this country. A fan of the films considered "controversial". I really had to see this by myself. <br /> <br /> The plot focuses on a young Swedish drama student named Lena who wants to learn everything she can about life. In particular, he wants to focus his attention on making some kind of documentary about what the average Swede thought about certain political issues, such as the Vietnam War and racial problems in the United States. Among questions to politicians and ordinary citizens of Stockholm about their opinions on politics, she has sex with her theater teacher, classmates and married men. <br /> <br /> What kills me from I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is that 40 years ago, this was considered pornographic. Actually, the sex and nudity scenes are few and far between, even in that case it is not filmed as a cheap porn. Although my compatriots are shocking, in reality sex and nudity are an important element in Swedish cinema. Even Ingmar Bergman, possibly his response to the good boy John Ford, had sex scenes in his films. <br /> <br /> I congratulate the filmmakers for the fact that any sex that is shown in the film is shown for artistic purposes and not just to surprise people and earn money to be shown in pornographic theaters in the U.S. I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is a good movie for all those who want to study meat and potatoes (they did not intend to play a word game) of Swedish cinema. But in reality, this movie does not have much plot.
