This is the story of two guys who found a copy of 'Funky Monkey'. Upon finding it, it seemed strange at that moment to think that there are still posters for the film at the local Cineplex Odeon. After seeing classics like 'Every Which Way But Loose' and 'Project X', these two guys imagined that movies with monkeys are amazing. <br /> <br /> These guys were on a long journey while watching this movie. There was a monkey that was replaced by a Stunt MAN when action sequences were required. It was evident that the monkey was not trained in Shakespeare's acting school. Maybe replacing the monkey with Ben Affleck could have helped the kids think. <br /> <br /> Maybe a strong partner would help like a Jackie Chan or maybe even Hulk Hogan. Fortunately, this movie had an amazing martial artist and Jet Li style, Matthew Modine. While some might argue that Matthew Modine does not approach Jet Li, the camera tricks show he is as good as he is. When it becomes obvious that an untrained chimp can not handle the film, the film relies on Matthew Modine to make it the real star. <br /> <br /> Did I mention that there is a foolish child who develops a link with Modine? and the monkey Is there a chance that the child will learn confidence and even choose a girl in this movie? Even Matthew Modine should be jealous of this (because the use of the 'I'm second fiddle to a monkey' pick-up line does not seem to work with the ladies). <br /> <br /> Shortly after seeing this In the film, the two boys received a call from Matthew Modine telling them 'Seven days'.
