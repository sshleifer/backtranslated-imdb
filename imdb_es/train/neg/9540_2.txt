The only reason to see this movie is for a brilliant performance by Thom-Adcox Hern√°ndez, who is underutilized in the film within the film. As usual, Tom Villard is also good. Otherwise it is c ** p. The possessor does not even exist, how does he magically change the letters in the marquee of the theater to spell "The Possessor"? Lame.
