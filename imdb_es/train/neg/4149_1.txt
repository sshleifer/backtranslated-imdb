Poor me. Where do I start? The father is not old enough to be the father of the girl. Corpses on camera in the first 5 minutes of the movie. The exclamation favored in this movie is "Jesus Christ!". Zombies are agile, stupid and few and far between. The reasons are completely incomprehensible and there is no narrative. People 'run' to their destination in jeeps driven at 3 MPH. The world seems to continue to function normally, but these are supposed to be the last days. The breasts appear for the sake of the breasts. Normally, this approach would provide some redemption, but the rest of the movie actually made me disinterested in the breasts or the future of humanity. There is a dog without reason and thin orange blood that stirs the stomach. The general and his slogan of "Shut up the f ** k up!" It is the only characteristic that redeems. As for the rest, I sincerely hope to hear that they did the right thing and committed suicide.
