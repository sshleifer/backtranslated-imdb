This is a piece of s - t !! this looks worse than a fact for t.v. movie. and I began to think that a sequel was even achieved and the results ... the war is prettier than this. jean claude van shame has done it again and wonders why his career is where it is now. No script, no story and no time should be wasted on this. I want to say that. 1 in 10 is too high, too high. Goldberg should be killed for this. Van Shame is not an actor.
