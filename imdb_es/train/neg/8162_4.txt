Your attitude on Prom Night II will determine how much joy you take away from the movie. If you are waiting for a masterpiece of terror, look elsewhere. If you like popular movies that are quite fun to watch, you will like this. Lisa Schrage has the best moment of her life playing Mary Lou and Wendy Loyd over Schrage's rage to perfection during her "possessed" time. <br /> <br /> It's not a classic cinema, but a fun way to kill a couple of hours. with a wicked ending. <br /> <br />
