Plot = Melissa is a new girl in the city, she is fifteen years old and her birthday is approaching in a week. Since Melissa is beautiful, all the children of the city want to connect with her, but the few who manage to capture her interest die mysteriously. <br /> <br /> To be honest, the real reason I wanted to see this movie is because Dana Kimmel from Friday The 13th pt 3 was on it, which is not a good reason to hurry up and watch a movie. When I started watching it, I realized that "Sweet Sixteen" is not a good slasher, it's really boring and boring and it just is not going anywhere. After more than an hour, only three murders have occurred and the story has not really developed in any way possible. <br /> <br /> The film is very well shot with a pretty good photograph and a good direction, but as with many other slasher films of the 80s, the film suffers from being too dark at times. However, the acting is quite good and it is easy to sympathize with the character of Melissa, even though she is a complete bitch. <br /> <br /> The story line is not completely silly, but it's too boring to keep you interested. The only thing that kept me interested was Melissa, she was awesome and Dana Kimmel, who is really sweet and cute in this movie. <br /> <br /> In general, a pretty boring slasher movie that is not going anywhere. I definitely would not. I do not recommend it to Slasher fans.
