I thought I read somewhere that this was the last Monogram production, but if that is true or not, it does not matter, because if it was not, then it should have been. It is a lethal and boring affair involving John Carradine with a bit of gray hair in his hair to appear as an older scientist who is experimenting with the help of his young apprentice (Robert Shayne) to give life back to the dead. Each time their subjects are revived, they seem to have a whitish face like marble, since they are tied to the laboratory table (great thing). Carradine manages to return his faithful dog to life after he is dead, and the mutt gains an unusual ability to walk through the walls in a ghostly way (wooooooooohhhh). That's all she wrote. <br /> <br /> For an ultra-cheap Monogram quickie, this thing at least actually uses a fancier lab setup more elegantly than what is normally assigned. The funniest joke of the movie is that "old" Dr. Carradine constantly refers to his "young" assistant Shayne as "m'boy" when, in fact, Carradine was 40 and Shayne 45 when they did this.
