I saw this film two weeks ago at the "festival des nouvelles images du Japon" in Paris. Although I did not expect much from that, I must say that I was disappointed as many people in the audience ... if I wanted to summarize how I felt, I would say that I have been comparing it with Princess mononoke and Nausicaa from the beginning to the end. Of course he is stupid But I could not help it. The stories are quite different, but the worlds represented are very similar. And from this point of view, "a palm tree" definitely can not stand the comparison with Miyazaki's masterpieces. Even if it's technically good enough, boredom remains ... in the end, its complete lack of originality makes me advise you not to worry about seeing it. I rated it 2 out of 10 (a bit hard, I guess it deserves 3 or 4)
