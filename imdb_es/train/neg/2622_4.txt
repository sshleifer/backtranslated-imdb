102 Dalmatians (2000, Dir. Kevin Lima) <br /> <br /> It is believed that Cruella de Vil (Close) is released from prison and intends to make a new start in life. Things are going well for Cruella, who is busy helping homeless dogs out of the street. When the clock shows Big Ben, things go wrong. The hypnotic cure was reversed and Cruella is back, and this time she is determined to make that mottled coat she always wanted. <br /> <br /> Glenn Close returns to play his role as Cruella de Vil and once again is the highlight of the film. It's worth watching each scene with her in this boring sequel, which feels more like a replay of the previous movie, rather than a new story. <br /> <br /> She has changed. ?? Ken Sheperd (Ioan Gruffudd)
