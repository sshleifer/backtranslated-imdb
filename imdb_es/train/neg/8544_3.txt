I was never quite sure where this was going. These people seem interested in what is happening on some mountain. They investigate, they have narrow escapes, they leave, they come back, they go, they put each other in danger, they walk asleep, they are attacked by witches who have consistent closets, etc., etc. The boy likes the girl, but leaves her unprotected many times. . She takes it off, he recovers it, abandons it again. You understand. The whole thing seems to be a kind of sacrifice, I think, but I'm not sure, or turning people into witches, but I'm not sure. It's just boring and endless and not worth the time. There are some atmospheric scenes, but the impression is so bad that there are times when twenty seconds of darkness are not unusual. It is caused by age or by the excessive use of night filters.
