Predictable, told a story a thousand times with the usual drama in between, a couple of pretty obscene sex scenes interspersed with a certain paranoia, 70's style of incidental violin horror music that is funny at times, I could not help but laugh. /> <br /> Usually, I like Defoe, and you have to say that the acting is not so bad, the "plot" develops at a reasonable pace and keeps you guessing from time to time. It's just that it's too predictable, I felt like I was watching a drama made for television instead of a new movie. Maybe that's the style the directors wanted, but it must be said that the review I read here before watching the film could only have been written by someone involved in its production. <br /> <br /> Do not wait too long, and if I could turn back the clock I would not have gone to see him at the cinema. I would wait for the bargain containers in your video store, I'm sure it will not take long.
