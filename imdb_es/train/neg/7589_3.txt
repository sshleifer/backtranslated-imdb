What do you expect when there is not a script to start and, therefore, nothing that the director can work with? Hayek and Farrell, and Donaldson and Kirkin are good actors, they just have nothing to say or anything to react to. Even the earthquake was quite poor. And I do not know how close the movie follows the novel, but two make the Jewish girl appear out of nowhere, so show that Arturo has a nice warm heart, but some stereotypes do not amount to anything. And even buries Camilla in the desert, instead of returning her to L.A. for a nice Catholic burial where he could at least bring his flowers from time to time. Pathetic. And the set of L.A. It was created ridiculously graphically. Anything good? The window of his apartment felt real, the curtains, the sounds, the wind. And Donaldson is always great. It has been from the body snatchers or the night of the living dead, whatever.
