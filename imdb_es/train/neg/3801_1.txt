Warning! Spoilers! <br /> <br /> This is your typical Disney movie. <br /> <br /> 1. Correct the problem with the adoptive home that has a uniform division of races. <br /> <br /> 2.Insult the intellect of the spectators with its simplistic lines. <br /> <br /> 3. The child's sleeping father is almost directly taken from the story of Never ending 2. <br /> <br /> 4. In a world full of crime, disorder, corruption, starvation and other problems that must be attended to, only a losing team is worthy of divine intervention.UGHHHH !!! <br /> <br /> 5. Did you know that angels do not? Do you like to swear? Where the hell did that come from! <br /> <br /> 6. By helping the team, the angel causes pain and humiliation in the opposing team. In fact, very angelic! <br /> <br /> 7. The team The angels are helping, they are called ... Can you guess ... LOS ANGELES? Disney at its worst. <br /> <br /> 8. "I only have his training wings".
