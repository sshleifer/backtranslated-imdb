Looking at Smother was perhaps the longest, not the 90 minutes of my life. There was not a laugh to be had; In fact, I do not remember ever breaking a smile. Diane Keaton was horribly unhappy as a chain-smoking middle-aged dog hoarder, the textbook that dominates the mother, a relentlessly irritating woman who clearly suffers some form of personality disorder. She is manipulative, deceitful, melodramatic, childish, narcissistic and, what is worse, boring. <br /> <br /> I guess I should briefly mention the other characters, but why bother? It was just a long chain of film clich√©s: the distant, socially inept and sociable relative who is trying to penetrate "The industry", the abrupt and long-suffering father, but somehow still kind, the wife of good manners who can only "I no longer take it (but eventually it moves beyond discord and returns home with resignation), the herd of undisturbed dogs who like to chew on pillows while everyone is away, etc. <br /> <br / God, what a snore, I've never been a fan of Diane Keaton and Smother just reminded me why, overacting is exaggerating, no matter how many photos you did at your best, your attempts at physical comedy were especially humiliating. director? <br /> <br /> While I like Dax Shepard and even sometimes I can tolerate Liv Tyler, her performances were so dull and boring that it was clear that none of the actors gave a curse on this film. That was fine, because I did not either. Keaton's endless self-absorbing chatter was intolerable and, at times, Shepard's dislike for her seemed genuine. At the end of the movie, I wanted to slap her myself. <br /> <br /> It's horrible.
