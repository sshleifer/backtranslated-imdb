After seeing only half of the film at school in November, today, I saw that I was on the Flix channel and decided to see it to see the rest and write a new review about it. <br /> <br /> The book on which the film is based, Hatchet, is fine. However, this is a terrible adaptation of it. <br /> <br /> The horrible performance, and I mean the horrible, the bad dialogue and the average cinematography make up this terrible adaptation of Hatchet. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Brian, who is the cliché image of a late-80s teenager (sporting a red mullet, banging his head with cheap rock music from the '80s) and his mother driving in a car to to get on a plane to fly and see his dad estranged (his parents are divorced ... now they take a dramatic break.) Now Brian said goodbye to mom and his dog and is flying to see his father. a fat, ugly and rude man (it was not like that in the book) that after 2 minutes in the air, suffers a heart attack and dies, the book goes into more details, the pilot has more pain and it seems that they were in the air much longer before the pilot suffered his heart attack. <br /> <br /> The plane (within another two minutes).) remained empty with the fuel (leaving us, the spectators, assume that you have been there for hours even though the sun has not changed position and the scenario looks exactly the same.) Now it has crashed. <br /> <br /> This is the point in the movie where everything is very different from what was in the book. In the book he said that his jacket was in shreds, but in the film he is perfectly fine, without tears or tears (it seems that he just bought it), he never said that he climbed a mountain, saw a wolf and fell asleep there. on the mountain, he never said he was attacked by a bear (he said an elk but not a bear), he never said he ate the various insects he does, he never mentions the second tornado or he learned to catch those sparrows, cut them and cut them, or eat them or the small trap for fish farms that he makes (which is destroyed by one of the tornadoes), or mention it by injuring his ribs from one of the tornadoes. <br /> <br /> Do not even think you can call tornado what was described in the movie. All that was was just a wind storm that knocked down several of his things. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of this camp festival were Brian's boring flashbacks (which are never mentioned in the book) especially the cliché scene of Brian waking up, walking to the window and watching his dad (with all his things packed that can fit perfectly in the back of his truck) coming out and shouting "DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADDDDDDDDD" (but, of course, his father did not hear him even though he was right outside) and he hits his fist through the window (wtf?) <br /> <br /> The end is the only thing that is close to what happened in the book (I said close) In the book, I think one of the key things that the rescue pilot he said to Brian when he landed was "you are the child you have been looking for!" They stopped months ago ... "however, they left that line in the movie. <br /> <br /> There is a pathetic epilogue with Brian (somehow without counseling or therapy) going back to normal with his family. I think we were supposed to assume that they were getting together for Thanksgiving (because they had a turkey on the counter). Then he shows his temporary home (so, in the movie, it looked like three days, but in the book it was for several months) and his ax, still in a tree where he left it (it did not happen in the book) showing where he recorded a message , so perfectly done: "HOME" (where we are really supposed to believe that he recorded it. What perfectly with just that ax?) <br /> <br /> No date can summarize this movie better than when Enid from Ghost World said " This is so bad that it is not so good and it has become bad again. " Perfect description of this movie. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend it to anyone (who has not read the book) and I'm just looking to see a movie, or someone who has read the book (because they will be disappointed and bored to death. < br /> <br /> For those who have read the book, leave what your imagination created as a movie.This is horrible and will make your thoughts focus on the book. <br /> <br /> 1/10
