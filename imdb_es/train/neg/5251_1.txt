This self-proclaimed "very talented artist" has easily directed the worst Spanish film of the 21st century. Lack of emotion, coherence, rhythm, skills, humor ... repeats the same situation over and over again. It does not show character development. It does not even show any violent and / or sexual content, and does not add anything new to the psycho-killer subgenre. Therefore, it should be shown in film schools as an example of "what not to do" in a first film. <br /> <br /> By the way, where the hell is the "talent"? There are scenes that have been filmed almost identically; there are scenes that have two or more master shots and it's pretty horrible to see the action jump from one master shot to another without a reason. The camera almost never moves, as if the "very talented artist" feared to show his lack of visual skills. The actors who play the leading roles act as amateurs, and the cast of support is hard to believe. There are more holes than plot in the script (if there ever was one) ... <br /> <br /> A really daunting movie, and a talented director.
