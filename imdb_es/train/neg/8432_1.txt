Let geniuses like Ventura Pons, the Spanish director, convince the top brass of his country to subsidize this wrong attempt at a film. The sad state of the film industry in that country is the product of trying to make a film with such thin material. Most of the images that are made in Spain are divided into two categories: those of the Spanish Civil War, which love to present the past history as the writers consider it. The other type of movies shows the viewer with a lot of free sex because the "creators" have nothing interesting to say. <br /> <br /> When the movie starts, we can see Pere's penis when he tries to cut it and place it in one of the trays of a party. Later, Sandra will show everything that has been given to the audience to admire. The story of Pere's attraction to Sandra, a married woman who seems to be happily married, is false from the start. <br /> <br /> Our only interest in seeing the film centered on a previous and better photo made by Mr. Pons, "Amic / Amat", but, unfortunately, it has nothing to do with the disaster that we are punished for seeing in this company. As for the comments presented in IMDb, all the negative votes come from Spanish viewers, which says a lot about them!
