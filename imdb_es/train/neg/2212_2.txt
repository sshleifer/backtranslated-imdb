The low-budget horror B story comes with all the comforts: a mad scientist with a partner, a malicious corporate greed from the pharmaceutical industry, eccentric engineering and extreme genetics, and information technology ... you can not leave that sideways. <br /> <br /> Start with a strange sequence unnamed sailors who foolishly decide to look hot take a dip in the waters near an uncharted island and end up in group enjambrar hammerhead sharks ..... <br / > <br /> Cut to weak back story involving the decline of the shares of a generic pharmaceutical corporation that motivates his evil CEO of Shakespeare to quote an unsolicited bid by a former employee / scientist who was fired from his job as head of research and that also turns out to be a Nut ... of course (total Herbert West wannabe). It is offering a new stem cell technology that could generate tons of cash ... or so it seems ... This attracts several employees to their island Moreau-ish (it must have been an impressive package departure from the company when they let it go so that he could pay for an island) to validate his scientific findings, including the CEO and, by chance, the ex-fianc√©e of the crazy scientist's son now transformed into a human shark (convenient) ... <br /> <The plan, more or less, is to rekindle the love lost between previous nuptials while taking revenge on former colleagues for their dismissal. (Sheez, how can this guy be bitter? After all, he has his own island of friggen ...). <br /> <br /> Soon, everyone is fleeing (from the endless amount of guards armed with heavy weapons security, does mutant plants? There may be an uncharted island without man-eating plants? Sharky appetite Son for the carnage, Quack Daddy's reproduction plans and the lack of a cell phone signal) ... and everyone must learn to work. Together to leave the island alive! <br /> <br /> Will someone escape? Will a new species be created? Look at it and find out. <br /> <br /> There is an entertainment value in this movie, but do not expect much ... for the real Combs fan, this is not to be missed. <br /> <br /> Do not say I did not warn you.
