This is a truly miserable little movie. It is true that the original sacred (in) holy trinity was governed by the law of diminishing returns, while the "Final Conflict" degenerated into a ridiculous plot in the middle of the film, apparently only to provide the necessary unnecessarily complicated deaths that had now becomes the whole raison d'Ãªtre of the series "Omen". But then, to prevail on this skipped television movie (be careful with the buyers of the Omen box on DVD, do not be fooled by the widescreen ratio of the transfer, this was and is strictly small screen material) in the back of a series. In general, fine demonic coolers were unforgivable, particularly, backed up as they were, by the producer and producer of the first three films Mace Neufeld and Harvey Bernhard. I would give the plot if there were any, in addition to the usual scenes of death (without toning the sensitivity of television) and some of the worst performances I've seen. Everyone involved in this project even the food service people should be ashamed to have been on the screen, let alone masquerade under the name of Omen. If my opinion convinces a person to avoid this disorder, I will feel better.
