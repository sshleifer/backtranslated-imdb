I have seen many horror shows over the years, such as Nightstalker, which is about the Wendigo legend, so I expected an angry spirit to cause chaos to add flavor to the Halloween season. The man was wrong. The whole movie creates this sense of events that are going to happen and that will be frightening and scary, but then they offer a very simple story of revenge and murder for the loss of some property. Ve-ery fear - no! This movie has a lot in common with Cold Creek Manor, another total loser. <br /> <br /> It's getting harder and harder to believe anything that Hollywood presents about horror movies, as they rarely come up with something original and spooky. . What idiots pay to make a film so false? Go back to the drawing partners and do something useful with those millions of dollars that you have to throw away.
