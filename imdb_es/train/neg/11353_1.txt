Today, I visited an Athenean Cinema with my two children (6 and 8 years old), I paid 3 x 12 euros (approximately 45 US $ in total) without mentioning the gas, popcorn and soda, I was asked to return my 3d special glasses after leaving the theater and was "forced" to see what could have been a great masterpiece of the 3D movie, but it only proved to be a sick "cold war" propaganda movie, like no other seen for the last 20 years ... AND THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE A MOVIE FOR CHILDREN ... IN THE NAME OF HEAVEN! <br /> <br /> PS 1: The average Greek who works does not earn more than 850 euros per month (approximately 1050 US $) <br /> <br /> PS 2 My children liked it ... but then again they are just babies> in Greek: mora, imbeciles> like the one who wrote the script and the others who made this "3D mishap" happen. <br /> <br /> The 3D animation of PS 3 is fantastic, but who do you ....!
