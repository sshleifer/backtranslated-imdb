Let's see ... I'm trying to practice finding the positive in everything, what kind of things can I say about the bearer of clubs? <br /> <br /> I know! The performances were, no, that will not work, since they managed to drain the whole personality of Gwyneth Paltrow, generally so vibrant, and ended up creating caricatures of Carol Kane and Barbara Hershey ... <br /> <br /> Oh, what there's history? No. That's not going to fly either, since it was numbing. What was the genre anyway? It was not funny, that rules comedy. It was not interesting enough to be dramatic. Was that a romance between Schwimmer and Paltrow? I have to ask, since I can not be sure, let's call it "losers in like". I am sure that the people behind this movie started with a vision, I mean, they must have had one to launch the studio suits, but I need help to find it. <br /> <br /> Even if it were a patient person Who could forgive the pure stupidity of the story, could not, with good conscience, recommend a movie that would allow a man to conduct a professional job interview in a windbreaker and a messy hair, fluffy and stupid. Speaking of hair, should we have fun with the deliberate black roots and platinum locks that Hershey uses? <br /> <br /> What am I doing? I already lost 97 unrecoverable minutes in the actual visualization of the movie, I can not spend more time with this loser.
