Bad actors, terrible scripts, a totally incredible ending: this movie had everything. After watching movies like this, you wonder why the manufacturers were bothered at all. This movie has absolutely nothing to say, all the methods used to create a scare have been used again and again in previous horror films. A total loss of time.
