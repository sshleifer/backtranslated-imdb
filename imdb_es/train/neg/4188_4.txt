I am a great brand for the music of Neil Young, and with that and the praise that the film received in many alt-indie press circles, I came to the first Greendale show I could find. My enthusiasm was short-lived, as this turbulent history and weak lyric impulse left most of the audience asleep or disappointed. <br /> <br /> Neil says the movie started as a soundtrack, and the characters came to life so much that they just filmed the soundtrack. It is not the best way to make a story. No character really has a bow, and when "significant" events occur, the viewer does not care, because the annoyance levels of film technique are so high at that point. The film is the whole song, and to that end, the characters from mouth to mouth sing the lyrics as they are sung ... the technique works for the first verse in which it is made, and after that the nerves roar. It does not feel real or false, it just feels uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> Terrible performance, with the characters finding a state of mind and playing everything. Bad lighting sometimes. The only congratulations I can give to the film are in relation to several scenes filmed as news, but the technique is so used in today's movies that this film did little to promote it. A good soundtrack, but nothing that buys quickly. A bad movie
