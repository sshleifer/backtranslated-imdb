I looked forward to the Kathryn Bigelow film with great anticipation after the endless publicity and the 6 Oscars that were awarded. Unfortunately it is not a good movie. The description of the situation certainly seemed to be accurate and credible in all respects, but beyond that, the story simply turned out to be incomplete and the direction of the film seemed uncertain and random. The actors made a good effort, but for me I really did not understand what the movie was trying to be. It's not as atmospheric and captivating as Full Metal Jacket, nor as epic as Band of Brothers, nor as action-packed as ... well, nothing. I certainly can not see why he was nominated, therefore, or why people are "promoting" these epic proportions. Of course, given the caliber of the films in recent years, I guess there is not much to choose from.
