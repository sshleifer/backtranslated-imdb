Let me tell you first that I enjoy watching "bad" movies. It's funny how some of these movies leave a more lasting impression than the truly magnificent ones. This movie is bad in a disturbingly malicious way. This vehicle for the delirious ego of Sam Mraovich not only rubs ineptitude without talent, but has redefined the meaning of words. This should always be the barometer for bad movies. Type of the Mendoza line for the cinema. Mr. Mraovich writes, directs and stars as a forceful object Arthur Sailes fighting despised wives and Christian forces of evil while he and his partner Ben "dead behind the eyes" Sheets fights for conjugal equality. As a libertarian, I believe that homosexuals should have the right to marry. Ben and Arthur do more harm to that cause than an army of homophobes. The representation of all Christian things is so ugly and with the clenched fist, trademark Mraovich, that possibly you can not take any of them seriously. Victor, the brother of Arturo, the bible that carries the monster of Jesus, is so terribly evil / effeminate homosexual that you have to ask yourself how he was chosen for this role. That's because Sam "multitasking" Mraovich was also casting director. The worst of all is the same Sam Mraovich. When do you think the leading man makes the words doughy, bald and chubby come to mind? Sam also offers lines like domino pizza, cold and generally incorrect. The final bill: you stink of writing, directing, acting and issuing. That is the fourfold crown of Ed Wood. Congratulations, horrible little man.
