If you want to make a movie like this, make the threat real. Do not surround your friend with a bunch of bonzes. There is no credibility here. The plot is boring and incredible. The acting is even worse. I thought I was watching Arthur Lake (Dagwood), one of the worst actors in history, when I saw the main character. Oh, well, at some point he has to face music and get angry in the fight. I do not care, do you? There are all these long scenes set in this austere office (furniture made of cardboard or masonite). People talk and smoke and do nothing. Most of the action occurs in a sequence of five minutes. After that, it's over. Do not bother yourself
