Second movie in the boxset. Originally titled Bloodsuckers, this movie was quite normal. It's a bit boring in parts, but there are some good gore effects, but they're not very good. <br /> <br /> The movie takes place in the year 2210. Vampires have taken over the whole world. The V-SAN Squad (Vampire Sanity), which also has its own spaceship and is led by Churchill, who is captured by the vampires, receives a message from Earth and the team, formed by Quintana (played by the very hot Natassia Malthe.), The rookie officer Damian and the rebels Rosa and Roman (Roman played by Aaron Pearl of Wrongfully Accused.) V-SAN is later found with the leader of the vampires Muco, played by Michael Ironside of Total Recall. He has no plans to live in peace with humans, since he is determined to dominate the world. <br /> <br /> While this movie was not a waste of time, I doubt I'll put it back in the DVD player soon.
