I personally hated this movie because it was predictable, the characters were stereotyped and the whole idea was a scam of "The Cutting Edge" and "Cadet Kelly." <br /> <br /> The main character is a brat who is sent to a place where he does not belong. The whole place hates it, and to make matters worse, there's a sexy guy who apparently does not like it (well, the damn school can not stand you). Surprisingly, he finds a way to adapt and make everyone like him more, makes the boy fall madly in love with her. Then comes the choice, where she must choose between figure skating and hockey. She chooses hockey, then goes to the national figure skating and gets to be in the Olympic team. It is not a real surprise. <br /> <br /> This whole movie was so predictable. You knew what was going to happen before you saw it. This was so horrible that I almost vomited, and when I finished seeing it, I had a terrible headache and the desire to shoot me for seeing so much shit. Do not look at this unless you are less than ten years old, or actually like interpolated movies.
