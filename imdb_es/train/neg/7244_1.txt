I wish I had recovered the money from renting this garbage so I could donate it to the Home for Actors. Total garbage !! Five people watched this movie at the same time and there was not a single laugh to be heard, however many yawns. Paltrow is a beautiful woman and it was the best that could be seen in the whole so-called comic movie.
