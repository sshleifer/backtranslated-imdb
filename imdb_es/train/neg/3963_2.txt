How many friction times do we have to see a ghost walking through the bottom and reaching a peak through the reflection of a mirror? It has been done in two dozen movies in recent memory and four dozen times in this ragged and poorly made movie. There were only two strange moments to appreciate ... when the ghosts invaded the personal spaces of two characters. Speaking of characters, the performance was as flat as Diet Coke at 64 ounces. cup of the one who was drawing it. The secondary characters could have been extracted from several Scooby Doo cartoons. There was the kind, old Sheriff. There was a weirdo who lived in the woods with the Alabama accent. Many characters without development. The most disturbing image was that of a child killed at the beginning. But instead of exploring the murder of the girl, which would have been interesting, they only informed us that she was dead and that it was difficult for her parents to reconcile her death with the community and with others. When they arrived at the cabin, the scenes rarely flowed together ... with intermittent images of the dead daughter interposed here and there. Oh ... and the strange sounds were also exaggerated. You know what I mean ... squeaking doors that open themselves, crickets in the forest, yada yada yada yada. Ooooohhhh I have not seen that before. Once again, you will see the amazing automatic opening door in the movie over and over again. NOTE TO THE DIRECTOR: a scary scene is only scary if it is not repeated every 5 minutes in the same movie. Think about these things before saying "it's a wrap!"
