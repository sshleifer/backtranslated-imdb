In fact, I went to see this movie in a theater, but what a waste of time and money! We regret to say that the bad performance did not help to enjoy this rather sticky script. <br /> <br /> Some friends told me to go see this movie, since James Redfield, the author of the book, was very involved in the script. They really enjoyed the book, so the movie had to be perfect. Well, maybe I had my hopes too high, but I hated this movie! It was predictable, too sweet to the point that I really left, I had to throw up and, worst of all, there's going to be a sequel! Do the world a favor and stop this abominable crusade.
