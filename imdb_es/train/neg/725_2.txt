This was a horrible movie! Not for the subject, but for the delivery. I went with my girlfriend at that time (when the movie came out), hoping to see a movie about the triumph of the human spirit over oppression. What we saw was 2 hours of brutal police oppression, with no uprising at the end. Previews and announcements made no mention of this! Also, for all that whoopi goldberg played, my memory is that she was arrested and killed in the first 20 minutes. Again, the previews do not say anything about this! (Not that you expect that, but it's more of the problem). If I had known how depressing this movie would be, I would never have seen it. Or at least, I would have been prepared for it. This was a bait and change advertising campaign, and I will NEVER see this movie again!
