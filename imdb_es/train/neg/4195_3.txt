Given the people involved, it's hard to see why this movie should be so messy and boring. The writer, David Ward, wrote the incredible movie "The Sting" two years later. Jane Fonda had just won an Academy Award for Klute, and Donald Sutherland had done an excellent job in films like "Klute," "Start the Revolution Without Me," and "Kelly's Heroes." In short, the film is a caper tale, with a small band of misfit idiots planning a big heist. At the same time, the film wants to be a modern satire, a series of comedy sketches of the kind that the NBC television show "Saturday Night" would do well two years later. The bad result is that the plot makes the comedy bits seem uncomfortable and forced, and the disconnected comedy bits destroy any type of suspense that the heist may have. It is, literally, a movie that breaks itself, just like the cars in the cars in the demolition scenes collide with each other. <br /> <br /> The only real interest for me was seeing Jane Fonda. Her "Iris Caine" is supposed to be a lighthearted version of her dramatic prostitute character from Bree Daniels in "Klute." However, one does not believe it for a moment. We are always seeing Jane Fonda pretending to be a prostitute. It is a performance as terrible as his performance in "Klute" was excellent. It would be a good lesson for the acting teachers to run the two films together to show how the same actress in the same kind of role can be excellent or pathetic. It suggests that the actors are as good as their writers and directors.
