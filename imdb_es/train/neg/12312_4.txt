For 50 years after the Second World War, the United States was in a state where key segments of the economy were dominated by military interests. At the same time, due to recruitment and wars, all members of society had served or were connected to someone who had done so. <br /> <br /> This allowed a minigere based on the notion of American cunning in the midst of an inflexible military machine. Sometimes that machine was not military of the United States, for example, in situations of prisoners of war. Once eliminated, there are stories in other machines: science fiction and companies, but they always refer to this military genre, and in fact, testosterone action shots even refer to their comic brothers. <br /> <br /> You can trace it, I think, maybe starting in the comic, which means Amrican, sections of "The Great Escape", which immediately spawned offspring of TeeVee in "Gomer Pyle" and "Hogan's Heros". Then, a second wave triggered by "Catch 22" and "MASH", both were real life, then books, then movies, and in the case of MASH, then TeeVee. <br /> <br /> But before all that, there was the "Phil Silvers Show", about a sergeant Bilko and this was followed by "Mister Roberts". A happy scammer, who only committed harmless crimes, and then only in response to a too crude system that tried to limit his life. This was on the day that TeeVee shows important. You absorbed them instead of simply taking them to work to chat. He was not particularly smart in any way, except in finding that crack between what we wanted in control and freedom. <br /> <br /> It's a large area where Americans discovered how they think about what is forgivable, even endearing is in a military context, an area that has been appropriated by one of our political parties here. <br /> <br /> Because it's great, sometimes it's worth it in laughter. "Stripes" was pretty fun, I thought. It had the turn of the misfits who actually defeated the serious enemies, something like a bit of "Dirty Dozen". And the sexual adventure. <br /> <br /> Now this, long before the cultural wars intensified. Try to touch that sweet spot, like other remakes that mistreated Steve Martin. It's so funny, you actually support the Army to be the strongest player. Another way of tracking how societies resolve the controls of military power. <br /> <br /> Evaluation of Ted - 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.
