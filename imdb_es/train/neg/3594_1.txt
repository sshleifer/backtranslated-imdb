This is not a horror movie, but a boring sex movie. A very bad movie, which should be avoided by any fan of serious horror. No plot, horrible acting and annoying music. If you only watch the trailer, you will know enough ... It's a shame that it's available on VHS or on video, while there are so many good movies that are not available. If you like vampires try Hammer Productions or Italian Gothic by Mario Bava and Antonio Margheriti. Those are masterpieces if you compare this with this garbage. Rating = even "1" is too much! And believe me, I'm not the only one with this opinion.
