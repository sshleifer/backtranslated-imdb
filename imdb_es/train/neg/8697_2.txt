Carnosaurus 3: Primary species (1996) D: Jonathan Winfrey. Scott Valentine, Janet Gunn, Rick Dean, Anthony Peck, Rodger Halston, Terri J. Vaughn, Billy Burnette. Why bother to review this movie? Another stupid dinosaur movie in which the top secret military discovers those deadly (and very fake-looking) prehistoric monsters that run around killing people in bloody ways. The original was bad enough, the sequel was even worse. This falls somewhere in between, although it is not related to any of CARNOSAUR's previous films. QUALIFICATION: 2 of 10. R rating of graphic and bloody violence, creepy images and blasphemies.
