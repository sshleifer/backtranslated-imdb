First of all, I agree with something that escapes Mr. Chomsky's mouth. Its impeccable delivery of interesting counterpoint is what makes man a success in the circus of the university campus. He is friendly, simple, pragmatic. It does not take care of the current political style (disgusting bipartisanship) and it is fixed in the extreme left and in the extreme right, punishing both and for a good reason. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the movie itself is a failure. In fact, I would not even call this a documentary but rather a collection of discourses. Seeing "Rebel without pause" is no different than looking at a speaker in a segment recorded at 3 a.m. in CSPAN. There are no camera movements, no edits, no stylistic touches. There is no history, there is no narrative. <br /> <br /> Technically speaking, the production is strictly amateur. The audio is terrible and inconsistent; Sometimes we can not hear Noam speak, other times we can not listen to the questions the attendees are asking. When Noam is speaking, we are rarely allowed to see the reactions of the audience, except when we are given a quick snapshot of his wife who apparently attends each of his speeches and smiles with pride every time we see her. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this movie and I'd say it's probably best if you check your recorded cassette or CD discs to listen in the car. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 stars ... and I'm in a good mood today.
