This is one of the dumbest movies I've had the misfortune to watch! I should have expected it, after seeing the first two, but they continue to cheat me with this type of movie with the idea of ​​"Maybe they did it right this time". No, not even close. <br /> <br /> Where do I start? How about special effects? To give you an idea of ​​what happens with SFX in this movie, at some point, a soldier is shooting a "Raptor" as he runs down a corridor. Even with less than a second of screen time, the viewer can easily see that he is just a man with a tail that seems to be attached to him running. Bad bad bad bad <br /> <br /> What about the acting? If that's how you can call it. There is a character that, I suppose, is supposed to be from the south. However, after living in the south for six years, I have never heard this way of speaking. Maybe he has some kind of strange disability: the inability to speak normally. I find it fascinating that the character does not do anything that requires him to have that accent; therefore, there was no reason for the actor to try to make one. <br /> <br /> How about the argument? It's pretty basic: the kidnappers escape, people with weapons must hunt them down. I'm beginning to wonder why the dinosaurs in these movies always seem to meet the closest tunnel system ... would not they stay outside to hunt prey? Oh, well, at least they have the good sense to appear very little in the movie that supposedly revolves around them. <br /> <br /> Other things - Let's say you're in a building and you know there are men eating. The raptors run around him. Would you decide to take a break to discuss who is better: the Army or the Navy? And then decide to have an arm wrestling contest to solve it? What about the idiotic idea that they have to track raptors? They are divided into groups of two. Did not you ever see horror movies (or at least an episode of Scooby Doo)? In short, this is one of the dumbest movies out there. You miss it unless you want to moan through a movie.
