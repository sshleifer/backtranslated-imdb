They really can not be more stupid than this film about 3 losers who try to capture the spirit of college during the annual spring break festivities in many of our higher learning schools. The problem is that these losers try to do this 15 years after their college years when they are assigned one to watch the daughter of a senator who is prepared to be the next vice president. <br /> <br /> The problem is that her daughter is anything but popular, but of course she gets out of all that. The girls go through drunken rages, exotic dances and other absolute nonsense. <br /> <br /> It really can not be much worse than this horrible movie.
