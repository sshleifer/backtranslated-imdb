This movie was worth five hits on my "hurter card". I saw this while I was stationed in Virginia in the mid 70's. I saw him alone, so he was not distracted while looking at him. It sucked It was the most ridiculous waste of celluloid I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I know that others who have reviewed this movie have thought it was amazing. I offer you this: if it was so amazing, what was your box office take? End of discussion.
