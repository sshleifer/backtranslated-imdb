I mean, I thought I heard this dialogue in the movie, but it was so bad and out of place that I really can not believe it. I laughed so hard at what should have been the worst writing and acting in the history of mankind, I seriously worried that I might have a heart attack and die right there in the theater. <br /> <br /> So this is the In the scene I'm talking about, the "hero" just saw his brother crash and his brother's car exploded just steps away from him (the hero) . The "hero" was launching the expected "attack" to see something so tragic and people were trying to prevent him from getting into the burning car. <br /> <br /> In the midst of her attack and her uncontrollable anger / emotional breakdown she says "I'm so sad" - she said that, right? I'm crazy?
