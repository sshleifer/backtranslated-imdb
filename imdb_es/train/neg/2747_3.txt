I knew it would be, but I gave him a rent for some laughter and maybe a little pointless fun. Anyone who has read some of my comments can see that I am very easy to please. I did not really think that I would end up feeling this negatively towards him. <br /> <br /> The plot is about an ancient army of dragons led by a huge snake that will destroy the world unless some chosen heroes who inherited the responsibility can ?? become one with ?? a good dragon? or something?? I do not know. It was so stupid, I did not bother trying to hold him back. <br /> <br /> It presents a really silly story full of ridiculous moments and ridiculous concepts. Many of the events felt totally random and sudden. <br /> <br /> I guess there was interference in the studio or something like that because the biggest problem I have with the movie is the fact that the story seems to be trying to be like that. Great and epic, however, everything happens so fast and happens so fast. I feel like I've just been hit with a million plot points and action sequences in a big ball. The movie is like a punch in the face. It does not take long to establish characters or drama. Can you imagine the trilogy of "The Lord of the Rings" in 90 minutes? You could have most of the epic battle sequences, but there would be absolutely no buildup and you would hardly care about the outcome of those battles. That was the case with Dragon Wars? 90 minutes of me without giving a crap, waiting for it to end. <br /> <br /> Fantastic CGI with some good direction, but a horrible performance, a fast pace and a stupid story made this very difficult to enjoy for any reason. . I probably would have loved it when I was 6 years old.
