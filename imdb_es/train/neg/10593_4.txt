The famous "classic" Plan 9 of Ed Wood's outer space features an outraged alien who calls the human race, "... Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid!" I would have to say that Exhibit A in that essay is probably this movie, a ridiculously silly sci-fi movie. <br /> <br /> The fall action star Jean Claude Van Damme returns to a successful role for him in the original film, Luke, a former universal soldier who now works making really good universal soldiers. While Van Damme was too big to repeat the role in the first two sequels, he was too small to do much more by the time the fourth movie in the Universal Soldier series appeared. Then, probably cursing quietly all the way, he kicks and growls and frowns through ninety minutes of explosions and karate kicks. You will find a lot of senseless violence, but I would advise you to check your brain's coat when you begin to see this. Otherwise, you probably forget where you left off when it ends. <br /> <br /> Luke is called into action against more Universal Soldiers after a really REALLY evil computer named Seth (makes HAL look like Ghandi) turns all other universal soldiers into evil killers without remorse. Of course, for that these things are programmed, but in this case they are killing their creators, not the "enemy", so it is a problem. <br /> <br /> I love the silly logic of this movie. Logic that believes that a supercomputer would create a body for itself that seems as embarrassed as Michael Jai White does to be in this movie. Logic that dictates that the creator of Seth is a geek of cybernetic stereotypes of blue hair that emits clich√©s more regularly than Old Faithful. The logic of a climate karate fight includes two characters who kick each other through ten separate panels of broken glass within three minutes of screen time. <br /> <br /> The movie also features an endangered daughter, wrestler Bill Goldberg as a warrior disguised as a Universal Soldier, and as such a romance, I have to think that the writers thought the romances were GOOD. And when this movie ends, it ends. No more than a minute after a gigantic explosion of final style, the credits are running. There is no epilogue, not where they are now, there is no final kiss, only explosion, hug, end. Even the creators want to get out of this as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> While it's not a Plan 9, US: TR is a silly little action movie that would be fun at parties full of troublemakers. Van Damme fans who enjoy watching their hero really reaching new depths. Not to be seen in a serious stomach.
