This movie is a 90-minute Ramones concert with brief periods of stupidity and absolute boredom. Anyway, what kind of high school is this? <br /> <br /> Unless you are a Ramones fan, DO NOT do it and I repeat, DO NOT waste time like me. This is completely unappealable from beginning to end. This movie should be called Ramone fever. It seems that everyone likes them in this movie. There is not a plot that is found in this movie. With regard to teen comedies, you're scraping the bottom of the barrel with this one.
