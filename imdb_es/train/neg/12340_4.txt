"Transylvania 6-5000" is an insignificant but sometimes funny and charming parody of the mid-80s with some very familiar names in the cast and a handful of genuine opportunities to laugh at the script. Two bozo journalists from a gossipy sensationalist newspaper are sent, very much against their will, to Transylvania to make a story about the alleged return of the mad scientist Frankenstein. There are some adorable tricks and details to discover left and right in the movie, such as a small guillotine for hard boiled eggs and laboratory test tubes that are used to put cream and sugar on the breakfast table. However, the good of the film is not as successful as it could and should have been, with jokes and parody situations too extensive. The production of Roger Corman "Transylvania Twist", which came out four years after this, is much more fun and much more recommended. The film is parodying particularly the classic universal landmarks of the early 30s, so be sure to see them if you want to capture all the small gags and references. There is a quite original twist that indicates that Frankenstein's character only behaves like an evil scientist when he enters his laboratory. It is also revealed that in reality it is more a messiah of Father Damien who only cares about the condition of the exiled monsters. Michael Richards, the strange guy who plays Kramer in Seinfeld, plays a psychotic butler who appears and disappears at the most inappropriate moments. I'm pretty sure Richards' role here inspired the character of John Turturro in "Mr. Deeds."
