This revision may contain some spoilers. <br /> <br /> The remake of the classic 1974 Gone in 60 Seconds car chase movie starts well. Actually it is well acted and the plot moves quite well. But even a big Hollywood budget does not change the fact that the original plot was more credible. For those who do not know, the original plot had the thieves working as insurance inspectors. Who would suspect them? But even with a change in almost every aspect of H.B. Halicki's original, the remake is a very good movie, until we get to the final scene of the chase, the part of version 74 that made it great. The one of this version is diluted, only 10 minutes, and culminates in a special monster effect that eliminates all credibility of the persecution. Where the original chase was very credible, the star was a trick driver who did all his own trick, the new version falls flat in the last 15 minutes. My advice, if you want to watch a classic car chase movie, grind the original in the bin of your local rental location and stay away from the new remake.
