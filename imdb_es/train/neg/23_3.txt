I rented this on DVD without any prior knowledge. He suspected that Michael Madsen appeared in a movie he had never heard of, but it was a freebie, so why not take a look? <br /> <br /> Well, I guess Mr. Blonde would like very much to forget that he has ever participated in a shame of a movie. <br /> <br /> Apparently, if your script and dialogues are terrible, even good actors can not save the day. Not to mention the amateur actors who flood this movie. Too many non-native speakers of English interpret parts of native English speakers, read lines from a script that should have been thrown away and have not become a movie. It's amazing how amazing all the lines of the movie sound. The music is horrible and totally out of place, and everything seems and sounds like a bad school work. <br /> <br /> I recommend that you see it just so you can appreciate other better films. That's why I gave him a 3 instead of the 1 he deserves.
