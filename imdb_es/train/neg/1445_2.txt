IN AGREEMENT. It is not wrong to make the film if it was from an original script. BUT IS NOT! <br /> <br /> What part of "in this story are there no women, with the exception of Foulata and Gagoola," Haggard's introduction that producers, directors and writers did not understand? I mean, it's pretty simple English. I understood it at 10 years old! The beauty of KSM is that it contains a spectacular description of three different worlds, colonial Africa, the implacable desert and Kukuanalandia, a hidden and isolated kingdom. That should be more than enough for even the most mediocre producers to work. But, nooo, they have to throw "romance." Pathetic. Suggestion for all of you, poor souls who really thought this would be close to the book. Surrender. Until an aspiring Peter Jackson appears and "you do it right", you can continue reading the tome. By the way, there is a continuation book (actually a pre-quel) called Allan's wife. Gives background to the story of Quatermain. It's a bit creepy but good.
