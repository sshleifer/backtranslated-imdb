I was faithful to my respect for Mr. Glover and Mrs. Goldberg. I watched the whole movie with my family and some friends. I have no idea what the movie was about. After much discussion, we all agreed that this was not one of their best efforts. <br /> <br /> It is not very well attached. It's too choppy, and there's little comedy. I'm disappointed. It could have been much better. <br /> <br /> I waited months to see this movie based on the notes of the line. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your money unless you are a completista and you simply want to see all the films of Mr. Glover and Mrs. Goldberg. <br /> <br /> It was a bad way to spend the night.
