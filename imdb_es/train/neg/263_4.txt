After a day at work, I sat down to relax and turned on the movie channels. The movie appeared in the guide and it sounded interesting, so I tuned in just before it started. The first 30 minutes were enough to interest me, but the lack of ability to act on Jamie Foxx and the slow movement of the plot made me want to get up and look for food during the movie. If there is any credit for acting in this movie, you should go to David Morse, who at least tries to make the movie interesting. In general, do not plan on impressing your friends by selecting this as a tenant for a movie night.
