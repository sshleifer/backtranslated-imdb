I've grown up pouring myself into the intertwined stories of Wrinkle in Time Chronicles. My dream was that one day a screenwriter would meet his son sitting on a big sofa reading A Winkle in Time, and he would think, what an incredible movie this movie would make. Unfortunately, the screenwriter failed, changed character, launched a bit of humor and destroyed the plot. I know it's a difficult task to change a beloved novel for a movie. But why can not you be faithful to the book? Why should you change the way the characters think and act? For those of you who have not read the book, collect them, find a soft sofa and let your imagination run wild.
