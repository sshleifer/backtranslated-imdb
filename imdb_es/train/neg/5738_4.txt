"Darkness" was entertaining to a certain extent, but it never seemed to have a plot, and it lacked one more than other films that have been accused of this detriment; that is, "bad taste". It started really well, with a man running away from something. It was very creepy during these first few minutes, but after a while, the film became entertaining at the blood level, which was difficult to distinguish in some spots due to the low lighting and horrible recording quality. The film was hard to believe because of the youthful performance, which most of the time, it seemed that some friends were talking to a video camera, forming lines as they went along. That, without a plot at all, made it look like the movie started without, and ended without, a script of any kind. As it was said before, Gore was the only drawing point of this film, which most of the time was difficult to understand.
