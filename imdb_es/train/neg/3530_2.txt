When Ritchie first appeared on the scene of the film, his films were described as funny, witty, well directed and original. If one could compare the hype that he had generated with his first two attempts and the almost universal hatred that his last two exits have created, one should consider: has Ritchie been discovered? Is he really that talented? Do you really have any genuine original idea? Or is he simply a pretentious and selfish director who really wants to be Fincher, Tarantino and Leone, all in a colossal and disorganized bunch? After watching Revolver, one could be excused for thinking if everything went wrong. What happened to your great sense of humor? Where did you get all these mixed and complicated ideas? Revolver tries to be intelligent, philosophical and succinct, tries to be an intelligent psychoanalysis, tries to be an intricate and complicated thriller. Ritchie makes a gigantic effort to fulfill all these many objectives and invests large chunks of a script in existential reflections and numerous twists in the plot. However, in the end, all that is useful is to build a very disjointed, unstructured and, ultimately, hostile film for the public. His plagiarism is so sinful and flagrant that, although Ritchie tries at least to give his own turn, he should be punished for even trying to make him go through his own work. So what the public ultimately gets is a terrible script intertwined with many pretentious linemen and clumsy elements. <br /> <br /> Revolver is ultimately an unoriginal and soft film that has stolen countless masterpiece themes such as Fight Club, Usual Suspects and Pulp Fiction. Aim high, but, inevitably, blank shots abound. <br /> <br /> Revolver deserves to be criticized, it is a truly poor film that masquerades as a masterpiece aspiring to an aspiring author. However, he falls flat on his face and simply fails in everything he wants to be and achieve.
