This movie did not have big stars, but it had a very good cast with excellent supporting actors and Gene Tierney before it became a big star. With George Sanders, Reginald Gardner, Harry Carey, Bruce Cabot, Jospeh Calleia and Cederic Hardwicke, one would expect more from the film than it actually did. I suspect that most of this is due to a second-rate script, since director Henry Hathaway was a competent and well-established man in command. <br /> <br /> The film is set in East Africa during World War II. -Just before the Americans entered the war. The British are trying to control their African colonies, while subversive Nazi elements are trying to create problems among the locals. One of the white men in the film is a double merchant, working for the destruction of the British Empire! But, the lovely Tierney, who plays the daughter of a Sultan (!), Is willing to help save the day for Great Britain. <br /> <br /> American filmmakers have supported the Empire for a long time, and the 1930s and 40s saw a plethora of pro-empire movies. Today, with changes in sensibility, the idea of ​​seeing happy black natives dying for the Queen and the country seems ridiculous, and it would be difficult to encourage both sides! Still, in its day, this piece of propaganda was effective in increasing support for the British, although when seen today, the film suffers from a long script and a silly casting. The only bright moment in the movie is the final showdown between George Sanders and the enemy agent. Pity after such a powerful scene, the film seemed to speak and talk, losing some of its power.
