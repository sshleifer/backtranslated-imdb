Oh, to scream out loud, this must be the SMALLEST movie I've seen all year, and I'm sorry that the normally amazing John Cusack was involved in this brainless stupidity. Where Sleepless in Seattle delivered what amounts to the same message, though on a more subtle and somewhat more mature level, Serendipity delivers it with a hammer, and then proceeds to punch it in your psyche for the next tedious hour and a half. (and that's an hour and a half of my life, I'll never come back, thank you very much!). It's bad enough that the main characters in this film have the level of emotional maturity of the fourteen-year-old children (actually, I know them better than the fourteen-year-olds ...), except perhaps for Jeremy Piven, who was enough nice. Just the first 15 minutes of the movie in which the character of Kate Beckinsale plays that annoying nonsense of a game about throwing all sensitivity to the wind (literally) had my best friend and I irritated beyond belief. I told my husband that Rockstar had more intelligence, and at least the characters in Rockstar were not as dysfunctional as the idiots in this "Serendipitous" mess. It is annoying to see the protagonists who seem to have no idea of ​​the choice in their lives, and feel that they are nothing more than puppets of fate and the vagaries of fate. How absolutely exhausting. I am sure that this film will be more likely enjoyed by those who prefer not to participate in the chaotic mess of making more complex life decisions and then live responsibly with the consequences. After all, here is a movie in which our hero and our heroine live happily ever after only after causing havoc and misery in the lives of two other people (ie, their respective girlfriends), not to mention other relatives and Friends, just to get there. <br /> <br />
