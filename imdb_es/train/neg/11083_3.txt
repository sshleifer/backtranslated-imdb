This movie was in the night when I saw it. It was interesting at first, but it did not convince me in general. I'm not a fan of Tyson. In fact I do not like boxing at all. It is barbaric, obscene and double-sided (by society) that some get money for hitting each other. <br /> <br /> However, I felt that the beginning of the movie was fine. The actors are fine, especially George C. Scott (as Cus D'Amato). I do not know how reliable the movie is. I have not read books and books about boxing or Tyson. I do not know anything about man, but it was quite entertaining. <br /> <br /> As the movie progressed, I felt that I had lost a bit of charm and I also lost interest. I managed to stay awake, but the last hour was not good enough.
