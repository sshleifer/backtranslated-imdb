Minimum writing, minimum character development, minimum stable camera. Maximum stretched scenes, maximum headache provoking staccato approaches, maximum characters walking through the forest doing nothing. Until the time flashes on the screen at 12:01 pm, you can move forward and not lose anything, since there are three hunters who know nothing about doing nothing. To be fair, the movie has some string music that was interesting, so maybe a music video would have been the way to go with this. Unfortunately, that was not the case, and what should have been a short twenty minutes extends beyond belief. Forget about "Trigger Man", I know I'm trying. - MERK
