This movie has a weak plot, a weak characterization and really weak special effects that I question why I lost a valuable life to see it. It has random characters that do not add anything to the story and seem to be excuses for the director to get his girlfriend in the movie. The robots are sad and the main "hero" bot is turned on by a huge knife switch. If this movie was not so bad, it would be ridiculous, but it's not funny at all. The main antagonist is one of the only redeeming characters, and he is killed. It is sad when you defend the bad, because it is the best to encourage. When all is said and done, it is better to leave this film on the floor of the cutting room, or never finance it at all.
