Wow, it was definitely one of those sleepless nights in which I surfed the channels and I came across this stench of a movie. For some of the names in the cast, I would expect a much better movie. I'm almost ashamed to see Oscar winner F. Murray Abraham reduced to such a horrible part. I hope the money was worth it. And the students talked about fencing as if they were talking about survival in a war or horrible disaster. I mean, I've fenced in, it's a fun sport, but I've never been so intense. The only reason I even saw this whole movie was because the remote control fell under the sofa and I was too lazy to get it back.
