The latest version of Rumor is that Vh1 is starting to broadcast calls for I Love New York 3 in mid-2008. Does this mean that Budah or Tailor made New York leave or does this mean that New York abandoned the winner? <br /> <br /> I know that Flavor of Love is approaching its third season, so now with Flavor of Love 3 and I Love New York 3 ... will there ever be a true winner ??? <br /> <br /> I also heard some rumors that Chance will be back for the 3rd season of I Love New York. I have also heard rumors that New York will be presented in a special way in Flavor of Love 3. <br /> <br /> Hopefully this was not too hard for the end of I Love New York 2 ... I'm just saying the last rumor.
