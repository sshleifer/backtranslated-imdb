I read comments that this is the best Chinese movie in history. Maybe if the only Chinese movies you've seen did not contain long and protracted dialogs, looks and silences, and hacker editing, then you're right. <br /> <br /> Complicated story? Barely. Youth and amateur test. Exquisite moods and disturbing memories? Barely. Test boring and trite. <br /> <br /> This was horrible. I could not wait for it to end. Particularly when the best lines of the film are "How are you? I'm fine. Are you sure? Yes." Woohoo! What depth of character. I suppose the incessant habit of smoking was supposed to speak for them. <br /> <br /> As a big fan of many Chinese, Japanese and Korean films, I felt totally disappointed. Even Zhang's sentimental sentiment "The Road Home" was better than this.
