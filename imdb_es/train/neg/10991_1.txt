My brother is an avid DVD collector. He took one look at the cover (two models in toilets) and had to add it to his collection. I stayed with him to see what turned out to be probably the most credible film (I use that term in a relaxed way) in which I felt compelled to sit down. I did not dare make eye contact with my brother, pretty sure he must have been cursing the receipt in his clenched fist. The biggest name in the whole movie is Michael Clark Duncan, who appears in one scene, and the "filmmaker" decided to show each shot of (approximately four in total) throughout the film. In fact, the whole movie practically follows this costume. The fact that the DVD contained deleted images was a shock. (I went to bed without seeing it, however). Without any surprise, I found this disc without its case behind the TV a week later.
