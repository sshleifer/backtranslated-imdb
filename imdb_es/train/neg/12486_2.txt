The rich and luxurious Joan Winfield (unfortunately unlikely Bette Davis) is committed to marry the stupid and selfish Allen Brice (Jack Carson looking lost). His father (Eugene Palette) is determined to stop the marriage and has been kidnapped by pilot Steve Collins (James Cagney, seriously). They crash in the desert and hate each other, but (sigh) they begin to fall in love. <br /> <br /> This seems to be getting a high rating from critics here just because Cagney and Davis are there. Both were brilliant actors, but they were known for their NO comedy dramas and this movie shows why! The script is simply horrible: there is no genuine laugh in the whole movie. The joke about this causes Cagney and Davis to fall from the rump first into a cactus (this is done THREE TIMES!). Only their considerable talents save them from being completely humiliated. As it is, both do the best they can with the lousy material. Cagney does the best he can with his lines and Davis screams with all the lines with all his strength, but it does not work. Carson has his "what the hell" look on the whole movie (probably because the emotions of his characters change in seconds). Solo Palette with her distinctive voice and over the top readings manages to spark some smiles. But, in general, this was boring and lacking in laughter, a real task to sit down. This gives him two stars just for the performance of Cagney and Davis and a beautiful picture, but in reality it's not worth seeing. Cagney and Davis hated this movie in later years and can see why.
