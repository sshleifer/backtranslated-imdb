I feel totally cheated Someone has to reimburse the $ 4.95 that I spent in Blockbuster to rent this home disaster. This is NOT a musical, it is a complete waste of time and my evening. What I do not understand is why was this distributed in the first place? ... someone MUST have been taking some heavy drugs the night the deal was made. I've seen better films that come out of film schools and I've been to film school, so I can say that as a fact. The quality of this work is also VERY bad to see ... recorded in DV? Nuff said. The songs are not songs but jokes that sound the same in each section. Do you want to see a good musical? THEN DO NOT RENT THIS MOVIE.
