WARNING! Do not even consider watching this movie in any way. It's not even worth downloading from the internet. Every bit of porn has more substance than this piece of lost celluloid. The so-called filmmakers apparently have no idea how to make a film. They could not tell a good joke to save their lives. It is an insult to any human being. If you're looking for a movie full of fun, go somewhere else. <br /> <br /> Let's hope that this Mr. Unterwaldt (the "Jr." is a good indication of his evident lack of experience and intellectual childhood) dies a slow / painful death and NEVER makes a film again. <br /> <br /> In fact, it's even a waste of time to WRITE ANYTHING about this shit, that's why I'll stop now and see a good movie. .
