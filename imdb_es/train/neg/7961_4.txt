Five years after the original Creepshow, another sequel to inferior horror is written by George A. Romero and Stephen King: Creepshow 2. This time there are only three stories instead of five. None of the three stories is really original or distinguished either. The first story is a basic element of terror, a story formulated about an Indian wooden statue that seeks revenge on the killers of their owners. The effects are really sharp in this story, but it's too familiar to be convincing enough. George Kennedy and Dorothy Lamour play the old shop owners. The second story, "The Raft", is a story by Stephen King. These are four teenagers who, without knowing it, spend the day on a wooden platform in the middle of an isolated lake. Soon, children are screaming for their lives like a water stain that causes each of them to enter without any apparent reason. However, instead of having suspense, children are charged with a bad dialogue and stupid behavior, which prevents us from really worrying about what happens next. There is also some involuntary humor in this segment. The third and final story is "The Hitch-hiker", which is actually a retread retread for Creepshow 2. The original story, by Lucille Fletcher, was filmed in 1953 as a black film thriller. Then it was adapted for a famous episode of Twilight Zone with Inger Stevens. "The Hitch-hiker" works the best of these three offers, but it does not stop having its problems either. Lois Chiles plays an unfaithful wife, who ends up running over a hiker, or so she thinks. However, we do not know whether to sympathize with it or condemn it. As in many average stories of this type, the characters exist simply to tell the stories with their twists and turns. The wraparound story with the thugs seems a little out of place. Tom Savini appears as the "creep" in this installment. The good thing is that there have been no more sequels. * 1/2 of 4 stars.
