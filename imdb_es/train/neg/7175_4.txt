This could have been based on historical events, and we know that the creators of this dramatic television documentary took liberties to make it more dramatic, I can live with that, but it was so badly done! I was surprised that, in the event of a crisis in the air, how calm they all seemed, surely someone would have been frightened, and what a smooth flight, without discomfort for the passengers, come on! I'm not sure about the regulations, today some of the airline's safety stuff does not seem to make sense, but why take off your shoes before the emergency landing, common sense tells me it's not a good idea? The shots of this massive passenger plane that went down on this remote airstrip were not convincing and false. Actually, it would have been a breathtaking view seen from the nearby floor, in this film it was out of proportion and seemed the model it probably was. The escape slides appeared in the front and middle emergency doors, however, no one seemed to come out in front, even though the fall was much smaller. The captain returned to the plane after landing, why? this was never explained. We know that the emergency landing was due to a lack of fuel, but even so there must have been some fuel spill on the bottom of the tanks, and the risk of explosion must have been a very real danger, however , the evacuation seemed almost paused, and everyone is standing at the foot of the escape slides instead of getting away as much as possible, as I'm sure he would have done. There were too many inconsistencies, mistakes and false actions in this. I would have preferred to see a representation of the drama in real time and with the realistic movement of the represented plane. It had the potential to be quite exciting, but certainly because budget constraints failed, and it made a plane that lost all engines really not a big problem, and you would slide safely until a full landing bumpy, but not real danger - Reality is of course different!
