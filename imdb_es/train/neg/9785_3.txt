This movie, for a special after school, is not that bad, and that's the problem. Nothing happens. You feel like you're still in class. A boy teaches a group of young losers how to be good paintball players. We never get to see these underdogs doing wrong, since the good player is training them. Suddenly they become good players when meditating. There are too many characters and there is no character development. Too much time is spent on the main character and his sexy sister and not enough on some of the other children. This could have had a 'Bad News Bears' feeling (the original) as there was a girl in a boys' team, but this movie did not have any feeling. It has no sensation and leaves a dull pain in the bones after seeing it, it is not fun to bag it, it is not fun to look at it and it is simply ... there. Plain. Boring. Something you would see after school before your nap before night. As boring as the day is long and it has been a long and long day watching this movie.
