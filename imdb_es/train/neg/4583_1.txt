If you want to see a philosophical and intelligent discussion about the possibility and potential of the human being, see "Wake life", which is brilliant. "What the # $ *! Do We Know" is all over the place in its focus, misdirected, poorly written, badly acted, totally devoid of art direction and completely annoying. It was not to suggest or entertain in the least. The inclusion of this phenomenon "Ramtha" in this movie is reason enough to avoid it. Is not it strange that the filmmakers decide to consider the fact that this woman worships an Atlantean god of 2,000 years or something? What a scum is that old girl, and what a waste of my time and money was this movie. Those responsible for this film should not be allowed to make another film ever again.
