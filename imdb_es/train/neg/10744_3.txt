['In the first they were mainly giant rats, but there were also some wasps and a giant chicken. This, however, is only the period of giant rats, very giant rats and a growing young child. This is about this growing boy and a scientist who is trying to help him accidentally create giant killer rats ... you know how he is. This movie has some murders and its moments, but I think it&#39;s on par with the original, I prefer some variety in my movies of giant creatures. Well, that&#39;s not true ... I actually like &quot;The empire of the ants&quot;, maybe I&#39;m not interested in giant rodents. In general, a rather monotonous movie, although it has a rather strange turn of events in this sequence of a dream that is truly strange. I just can not recommend this one.']
