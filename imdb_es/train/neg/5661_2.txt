In real life, Tritter would have been arrested for harassment, the episode of the rectal thermometer would have been exposed in court, providing motivation and opportunity, and the hospital lawyers would have done mincemeat with Tritter and the particular department in which he worked. . He would be in prison like any accomplice in the harassment of House, Chase, Foreman, Cameron, Wilson and Cuddy. The lawsuit would have won House a tasty arrangement, enough to keep her supplied with Vicadin until her old age. While Tritter ended up somewhere driving a taxi, he tried to rehabilitate himself doing the people's good for two years before people stumbled over the fact that they had seen everything before.
