"Gone with the Wind" is one of the most overrated movies in history. It is a movie loved by mothers, grandmothers and inmates who go to the movies once every five years. Like a zombie movie, it blows. There is not a rickety corpse in sight, and it is terribly light in the blood department. "Zombie 3", on the other hand, is large in the disorder of the corpses and quite generous with its bloodshed, therefore, it is better than "Gone with the Wind". Nor is it overrated. Most critics have no illusions that it is garbage. It is, however, not boring garbage. After a terrorist steals a virus, he drops it while being chased by a helicopter, and the chemicals filter to the ground. The terrorist, who has been exposed to the unpleasant mixture, hides in a hotel room where he slowly becomes a zombie who eats meat. One of its first victims is a cleaning lady. Once it is bitten, the mark of Lucio Fulci's hell breaks loose. As usual in a Fulci movie, the acting is atrocious, the story is full of holes in the plot, and the blood is plentiful. It turns out that the film was directed by Fulci and Bruno Mattei, so it explains its rather schizophrenic nature. It is also badly filmed, poorly edited and the sound design is flat. Still, he is saved by his joyful adherence to the most boring murders and his impatient pace. Definitely worth buying if you are a complete undead. Or you do not like "Gone With The Wind", undoubtedly the worst zombie movie of all time.
