I'm starting to write this review during a break while watching the movie. It's the first time I've tried to do that, but I have trouble getting through this without occasional interruptions. That is not because it is intense, but because it is bad. <br /> <br /> It is painfully tedious and unbelievable, especially when the dying preternatural and robust brother Ryan (Colm Feore) is on the screen being tragic and malicious, self-indulgent and selfish. -pitying. This would have been a much better movie if they had left that character out of the story. <br /> <br /> Do not add anything other than mawkish, maudlin, a very irritating melodrama. Maybe someone decided that if they could not make Ryan credible, they would hate it. The problem with that is: who cares if an annoyed, whining and hateful jerk is dying? Not me. <br /> <br /> The ONLY thing this character has in his favor is the fact that he's dying, and I'm sorry, but that's not enough. Dying does not make anyone special. We are all dying, sooner or later. It does not give anyone the right to expect sympathy while acting like an imbecile. <br /> <br /> The other two characters, and the actors who play them (David Cubitt as Theo and Chandra West as Sarah), are very good most interesting, and their story, without Ryan's self-pity, would have made a much better movie. But it's not over yet, and it's time to play PLAY again. Maybe something big happens before the end ... <br /> <br /> No. I'm sorry. This rented turkey returns tonight!
