I can not understand how someone can get a budget for such a bad movie. It's as if the television station was desperate for anything, for anything. They are buried under a pile of snow, the electricity is turned on and off constantly, but magically there is a backlight that stays constant. Where does all this (false) light come from? That, and all that stupid dispute between the characters. It seems that they are more interested in complaining to each other than in trying to invent ways to survive. Try to create that feeling of emergency and people helping. But because it's such bad direction and acting, you will not do it with Florence Nightingale's correction with this movie, I'm sorry. I join the negative comments, and I agree that this is one of the worst movies in history.
