Released on DVD in the UK as Ax, The Choke is a teenage slasher that fails in almost every department: the story is almost non-existent, resulting in a film that mainly comprises people who roam around a dark building; with the exception of two characters (who are obviously destined to be the survivors of the film), they are all completely objectionable, which means that the viewer does not care about anything when they are killed; the deaths are not bloody enough (unless a short swallow of a pound of minced meat covered in fake blood spins your stomach) and the free sex scene presents almost no nudity (an unforgivable mistake of committing a slasher punch! ). <br /> <br /> The plot of the thin wafer sees members of a punk band locked inside what appears to be the world The biggest nightclub (there are endless corridors and abandoned rooms, unlike any club that I have seen) where they are assaulted by an invisible assailant. For a low budget effort, the production values ​​are fine, and the cast seems to be a fairly capable actor, but without genuine fears, a reluctance to become really messy (this is a bully, where is the graphic splash?), a too frightening dialogue (especially by the drummer who is not very dead) and an ill-advised use of sticky video techniques in an attempt to add a bit of style, the film becomes extremely boring quickly.
