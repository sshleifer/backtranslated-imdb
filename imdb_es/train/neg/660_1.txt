Good grief, I can not even begin to describe how poor this movie is. Do not get me wrong, I did not expect much to begin with. Let's face it, a slasher movie PG-13 is predestined to miss the ummm ... trimming, so no one should be surprised by the lack of blood. But it was the level of incompetence and clich√© that shows up in all the other aspects of this movie that really impressed me. <br /> <br /> We have a protagonist who is simply so useless that you find yourself encouraging the bad guy. And here is a change of books ... NEVER CHANGES, therefore, breaks the fundamental rule of basic screen writing: the development of the character. If you think that at the end of this movie, the poor girl will turn around and finally kick a little and then think again. <br /> <br /> In addition to this, we are probably presented with the least intriguing (and definitely least frightening) killer who has honored the genre. I'm not kidding when I say that Dora the Explorer has more terrifying villains than this movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, because all the tension potential or tip is eliminated by the inept (and apparently he is thirteen years old). ) Director, what could be left to fill 2 hours of screen time? <br /> <br /> Cabinets, that's what. <br /> <br /> A lot of closets: large closets, small closets, mirrored closets, Narnia wardrobes, so many cursed wardrobes that you will not want to dress for another year. In fact, this movie should have been called "CLOSET", and had an image of a large changer in the DVD case. In the back I could have had a photograph of the sleeping public and a quote from Roger and Ebert, something to the extent of: "what the hell we just wasted our time watching!"
