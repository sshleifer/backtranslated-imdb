This Italian semi-horror movie starts out as a soft core porn movie and becomes a mystery that has some loose ends to be good, that and the fact that it's pretty boring just makes this movie pretty hard to See for my tastes. The only thing that is really worth seeing are the many breasts scattered throughout the film. The story has a guy who at the beginning of the film attracts the girls to his castle, where he proceeds to take them to his dungeon, he goes crazy and apparently kills them. They show nudity, but in reality they never show the murders at this point in the movie. Then the boy finds a pretty redhead at a party and proceeds to kiss her and marry her. He loves the red heads, since his beloved ex-wife Evelyn was also, she also died in circumstances that should not have been the subject of the audience. After many crazy scenes, murders begin with snakes, foxes and others. At this point, it's pretty easy to find out who is responsible for the murders and what the motive is, then you have a senseless ending where everything is wrapped up not so well. This movie just did not work for me, it left me with a lot of questions and the last third of the movie just did not have the tits of the first two thirds of the movie. Explaining Evelyn's death would have helped the film, as it would have some kind of ending where Evelyn rose from the grave. Granted that the title is not totally deceptive, since she left the grave, but not under her own power. The blood is very light for the most part as there is a scene with the foxes and a scene at the end with quite a lot of blood too. I thought that for the most part this movie was a bit boring.
