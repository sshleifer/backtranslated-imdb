After reading the comments on the site, I feel compelled to write for the first time. It seems that this film is like Marmite and has divided the audience. I must say that while I agree that movies do not have to make sense to be nice (see MULHOLLAND DRIVE), they still have to get involved with the characters. Now, while I was totally absorbed in the issue of the murderous lesbians in Lynch's opus, I must say that I could not say anything about Mr. Green or the other cardboard gang members who inhabited this daytime world. <br /> <br /> Also, while many people seem to try to say that you did not enjoy it because you did not understand it, I would have to disagree, I did not enjoy it because I was bored. I wanted the movie to end and constantly listening to those quotes again and again did not help. Call it clever if you want. I think it's repetitive. <br /> <br /> However, my main reason for writing is to ask a question to all the other reviewers: there were no final credits in the printing of the film I saw. . Only music on black. Have I seen a printed copy or is this evidence of GR's claim? Or, did everyone involved in the film see the rough cut and have their names removed?
