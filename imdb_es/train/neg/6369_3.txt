The only reason I rented this was because of the article in Fangoria magazine. The article made this movie seem interesting. Well, it is not. This was a very boring movie, written and directed by amateurs. All the actors in this movie are horrible, except Faye Dunaway, which is always a pleasure to watch. But too much time was focused on Gina Phillips and her ridiculous encounters with the crows and Duilio Marzio. Marzio has an Argentine accent so dense that you can only understand every couple of words he says. Nicholas Pauls is also at hand, who plays Gina Phillips, an ultra-soft love. The conclusion: this movie is not scary. There's only one good scene and it's the last five to ten minutes of the movie. I would have given this one a star, but I gave it three just because I really like Faye Dunaway. But even she was not so good at this.
