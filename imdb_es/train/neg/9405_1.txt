I just finished watching this on TV and what can I say, but this is the worst movie I've seen! I'm ashamed to be from Melbourne, where the movie was made. Diabolic action, amateur makeup effects and a REALLY bad soundtrack. As for the plot, well, that's even more stupid! Some of the scenes left me stunned as to how bad it was. There's a reason why they put these kinds of movies on television at night, because they're absolute rubbish! Avoid at all costs.
