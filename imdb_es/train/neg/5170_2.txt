Wow, it could have been a good movie, Start with Brittany Daniels tied, I think it's great that we're going to retrieve a flash, but nothing, the movie starts again with the filming of the child. This movie would probably have been better if it was not for the acting. I mean, the performance was mostly horrible. Although with the lines the poor actors had to deal with, I guess they did the best they could. Still, it really ruined the movie for me. The twins were the only ones who seem to have some acting skills ... The film is too long for the supposed shocking conclusion ... In general, I've seen worse low-budget films, but considering that it was an exaggeration with the 8 movies to die for, I was very disappointed. By the way, were they? Some reviewers said that there were gore and those things. Did I see the same movie? Well, this is 4 of the eight, and so far only one has been good.
