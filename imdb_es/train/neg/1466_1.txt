<br /> <br /> As usual, I really wanted to see a new TV / movie about one of my favorite songs. It makes a nice change from a strangely familiar * documentary about Kursk or Stalingrad on the History Channel. <br /> <br /> Avidly awaited Pearl Harbor and Enemy at the Gates, but I was lowered to earth with the realization of the malevolent and stupid power of Hollywood, and its ability to spend an absolute fortune on tripe. <br /> <br /> Once again, I was thrilled with 'The Rise of Evil', especially when I heard that Ian Kershaw was involved, as I enjoyed his books. I can see why he resigned. <br /> <br /> To quote a man responsible for this garbage: <br /> <br /> "Kershaw's book was an academic piece," he said. "It was <br /> <br /> quite dry, we needed more incidents." <br /> <br /> Incidents? Are they totally crazy? You can not say that Hitler's life is without 'incident'; Yes, Hitler's biographies in two volumes by Kershaw were long and detailed, but they were supposed to be. <br /> <br /> The thesis behind 'Rise of Evil' seems to be: <br /> <br /> Hitler was a very bad man, no, he was a VERY bad man who hated Jews and, in In case you miss it, we will emphasize the fact in EVERY scene of the film. <br /> <br /> There was no effort at all to try to explain the mood of the time, and why Hitler could have adopted the views and the strategy he did. Needless to say, unlike the excellent 'Nazis - A warning from history', this film omits to point out the fact that almost all the leaders of the communist uprising in Munich were Jews, and that this may have influenced their opinions about the topic. - and its axiomatic link of the Jews with Bolshevism, an absolutely crucial aspect to understand much of the Nazi era. <br /> <br /> But there was not much understanding to do - the filmmakers were not going to see it there, so we have all the things we knew anyway. We certainly do not understand the fascinating fact alluded to by Kershaw, which makes Hitler a socialist / communist for a short time after the First World War. That, of course, would be too complex for the film to handle, and could even downplay the relentless mantra "it was so bad" that it hits incessantly. <br /> <br /> We know he was a bad man. However, we also know that he was a fascinating figure both as a public speaker and in more private situations. He could be educated and even understanding, and of course he defended some points of view such as vegetarianism, anti-alcohol and anti-smoking with which many readers of The Guardian could agree. He was also famous for animals, so that totally invented scene of dog flagellation was so absurd. <br /> <br /> It was also, for all the accounts I've seen, a brave soldier in World War I. While we saw him with his Iron Cross, we never got to see how he won it (it goes without saying that acts of bravery were not in the script). We also have no idea why he was so excited about his war experiences, while Sassoon, Owen, Brook, Remarque and many others considered it such a repellent experience. And again, as in the previous point regarding the Jewish / Bolshevik link, this is vital for anyone to understand the subject. Why did he love war so much? Why did you think it was always a good idea, despite the massive evidence to the contrary? Why did not he care about his colleagues who died? Or maybe he did, but still came to erroneous conclusions. <br /> <br /> This movie certainly did not have anything interesting to say about this either. <br /> <br /> As very often these days, the film is a classic example of "making history relevant to the present" and inventing things or leaving uncomfortable facts to fit with "the present", which too often it is to attend to the lowest common denominator, where you do not trust your audience an inch, so you will simply ram your throats, knowing (unfortunately correctly) that you will always get away with it because there are many fools in the world. <br /> <br /> History really is about making us relevant to the past and seeing how it colors our present, for better or for worse. This garbage was a great opportunity, lost again. They spent millions on it, and the locations and the great scenes were impressive, but they told us nothing at all that we no longer knew, and they did not promote the understanding of this dark period in human history. <br /> <br /> WT
