I'm a good guy, and I like to think I'm tolerant of gender. And, I guess with that, I mean I try to consider a movie in the context of the genre in which it resides. If nothing else, that prevents me from feeling that I should be saying really unpleasant things about people or movies, which I do not like to do. <br /> <br /> The plot in this one was clearly obvious, the production values ​​very low and the sets, uhm, simplistic. The performance became "good for a secondary school" territory from time to time. My feeling was that it was filmed in a day; Please, tell me what it was. <br /> <br /> Worst of all is that sex, although quite abundant, was quite mundane, hampered by, at least in my copy, a "sound on" that was inconsistent with the action (climatic moans and squeals while lying on a bed getting rid of a bra ???). There was definitely no "advantage", nothing distinctive or interesting, and with surprisingly fast cuts. <br /> <br /> My vote is a "1", with the following summary statement: it would have been better if the material of the filler separator in the club was expanded and the rest of the film was condensed.
