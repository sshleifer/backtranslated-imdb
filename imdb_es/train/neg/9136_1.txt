When the movie started, I was surprised to see that it was shot with a cheap video camera. In fact, the camera shakes and looks worse than the average home movie. Even direct DVD movies should have better production values ​​than this! Hell, a large percentage of home videos uploaded to YouTube have better production values! Too often, it seems that the film is made seriously by sticking the camera on a tripod and turning it on, without anyone! Close-ups and anything that resembles camera work are absent in some scenes where they might have worked and in others there are too many or poorly framed close-ups. Yecch! <br /> <br /> The film is about two gay men who want to get married. As if it had been done almost a decade ago, his only option was to get married in Vermont: times have definitely changed. However, the recent acceptance of gay marriage can not be attributed in any way to this film; in any case, it delays the supporters of gay marriage instead of helping the film stink and never really try to address the problem seriously. According to the film, religious people are one-dimensional idiots who carry Bibles EVERYWHERE and shoot at people, as well as wives who have homosexual husbands when they understand that their spouses have been living a lie. I am sure that it gives me an honest opportunity to both parties on the subject. <br /> <br /> The final result: nothing in the film shows any professionalism and I even hesitate to call this a movie. It's more like a home movie and does not even deserve a listing on IMDb or even an inclusion on the Bottom 100 IMDb list of the worst rated movies of all time. The acting is horrible, the writing is horrible, the direction (if there is one) is horrible, the camera work is horrible and the plot is horrible. It's a home movie! There's nothing positive I can say about it, except that it makes Ed Wood's films look like the Oscar contenders in comparison, and I'm sure Mr. Wood's ghost smiles every time someone sees this disaster. <br /> <br /> I do not care if you're gay or straight: this movie is not worth it and I do not know how they managed to create DVDs of it. I assume that one of the actors burns them on his home computer during his free time! Seriously, this gives a new meaning to the word 'bad'! <br /> <br /> By the way, if the only lady in the movie was a true lawyer, would not it be the ability to read an important prerequisite? I'm just saying. <br /> <br /> Finally, since gay marriage is such a serious and important issue, can not we have a movie that IS BETTER than THIS that addresses the problem? This, sadly, only invites laughter.
