1st Seen 2/2/2003 - 4 of 10 (Dir-Jim Kammerud and Brian Smith): Supposed monotonous and unspectacular of the classic animated classic "101 Dalmatians". Yes, the movie continues where it ended up in the first, but the problem is that it plays like the original. One of the great things about the original was the rhythm of the story, which it does not have. The animation is also very little spectacular for Disney and the only thing we get is that the same characters review the same kind of story. When will Disney stop bored with sequels and re-tasks, etc.? Probably, when we stop renting or buying this mediocre fare that they have taken out.
