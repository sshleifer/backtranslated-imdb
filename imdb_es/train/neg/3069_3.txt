That's disgusting And again I'm telling you ... how disgusting! The original version of this film was a well-directed story of a man who was already dead and was driving through purgatory. The original movie had a lot to say and did not do everything possible to say it. And, I had a naked girl on a motorcycle. <br /> <br /> This version seems to me something in which a producer bought the rights and then left it out of disinterest. It seems as if a group of individuals decidedly adjusted to the nineties and changed ethnicities and genres just to be cute. The film is not about exhaustion about to commit suicide in a last act of defiance. This is a man trying to go to the hospital to see his wife. <br /> <br /> There was no reason for this film to be made other than to get angry ...
