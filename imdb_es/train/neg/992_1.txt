This movie was disgusting. They should be a warning that some sadistic and unpleasant writer is trying to make a name for himself before being held hostage for an hour and a half looking at garbage. What is garbage? The misuse of people's time, the misuse of energy and the waste of any type of educational system that taught him to read and write. Talia, you are a sick and insane loser. Your psychiatrist should prescribe stronger medications for your problem. <br /> <br /> The performance and the plot did not give me any choice but to move through the trash. I ended up in a scene that was out of place. If you want to learn to surprise, people watch a Larry Clark movie. I lost all respect for the entire cast of this film "no more support from me". How could actors or actresses sit on a set while those gross representations of human behavior are manifested from the mind of a psychopath? I'm sorry for all the actors who took part in that scene. I think the devil now knows who the writer of this movie is; Congratulations you won your attention.
