I rented this in the 80s and honestly I can not remember anything specific about the movie, just that it is the worst movie I've ever seen. This is not one of those "it was so bad, it was fun". This is not one of those movies "it was so bloody, it leaves you with a bad feeling". It was not even one of those "what the hell was that?" films. I can not remember the performance of the actors, but it was badly shot, the story was disjointed and did not have a definite style. When it was over, I got angry for having wasted my time. <br /> <br /> I have seen many films that I did not understand due to unknown cultures, styles and / or narrations, but it was clear that those films had some of those properties. The incubus has none. <br /> <br /> I did not really think about commenting on this "piece" for fear someone might see it out of curiosity, but I am obliged to warn anyone who appreciates a movie to skip this movie. .
