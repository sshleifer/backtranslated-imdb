I've already seen fantastic stories, but the premises of this are so incredible that they come close to being ridiculous. A rich, young man undergoes a heart transplant the day after his marriage, and is somehow witnessing his own surgery and his surgeons' plan to kill him. Even if there is a medical explanation for such a phenomenon, what happens next is a mixture of dialogue between ... let's say ... souls? ... perhaps and in real life, where the dedicated mother will do everything possible to save her son's life. There is no shadow of suspense or emotion, only a combination of a bad and simplistic plot with a series of coincidences that can never happen in life. <br /> <br /> This does not mean that the film completely lacks quality. - Actually, the first time that director Joby Harold does a decent job in directing a good team of actors that includes Hayden Christensen in his first important role after having removed the costume of Anakin Skywalker, the fabulous Jessica Alba and the super endowed Lena Olin. All would have deserved a better story.
