Final score (an average of several classic cinematographic qualities: acting, images, creativity, reward, humor, fun, etc.): <br /> <br /> 4.3 (out of 10) <br /> <br /> Have had "Atlantis: The Lost Empire" came out a few years ago, would have seemed a bold and serious new direction in Disney animation. However, a year later comes the innovative and almost genius "The Emperor's New Groove" and takes a step back to free Disney from its repetitive "Disney Formula". I'm a big fan of Disney animated movies. You have to see them all love him or hate him. "Atlantis" is an animated flashback of "20,000 leagues under the sea" and similar live science fiction adventures of the 50s and 60s. The problem is that this version barely contains an original idea. It feels like a remake of something, even more than the real Disney remakes (Tarzan, The Hunchback of Notre Dame). The characters are little more than a walking clich√© of the usual suspects who usually populate this type of movie (the strange mechanic, the gung ho general, the shameless woman). Beyond Milo Thatch (Fox) and Rourke (Garner), the cast of support is totally unpleasant. The film also suffers from its succinct rhythm. Instead of turning it into an epic story, Disney gets stuck a lot in the brief execution time, which usually takes place in opportunities to develop ... the suspicion, the characters, anything really. They put us in this new and wonderful world and they barely allow us to obtain our discoveries. The uncomfortable rhythm sometimes confuses what is a relatively simple story. The animation is dark, sad and cheap. This thing looks like a Saturday morning caricature. Hopefully you have not forgotten that traditional 2D animation can still be wonderful. "El Gigante de Hierro", among others, proved it. <br /> <br /> Negatives: images, rhythm and pure lack of originality. <br /> <br /> Positives: possibly the best death scene for a Disney villain in a long time. It is the creative highlight of the movie.
