"Extreme Makeover: Home Edition" is another "feeling to feel good", the so-called "warm-up of the heart", and the "out-for-ratings" program that ABC has had time to put together. <br /> <br /> I Understand the problems that these families go through. That's why, I'm sorry. But do not you think that placing four wide-screen plasma televisions, three flat-screen desktops, a buried pool that occupies half of a backyard, and cabinets full of expensive designer clothes is a bit too much for ANY family? ? Of course, these families have gone through a lot. Sure, they deserve more beautiful things than they had previously. <br /> <br /> But honestly, the things that Ty Pennington and his team put into these houses are enough to fit an entire neighborhood. <br /> <br /> Another thing that really bothers me about this program is that Ty and his team always have something good to say about everything that relates to the family or the condition of the family. Telling a person in a wheelchair that is "so strong" or "very brave" really ages after a while. That may sound rude, but believe me; Look at this program and you will see what I want to say. <br /> <br /> In general, this program is overrated. If you want to see it, go ahead. This comment is just a warning for what you would be seeing.
