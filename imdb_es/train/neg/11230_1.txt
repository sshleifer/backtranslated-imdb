In sixth grade, all the teachers that I decided would be a great idea to make this movie the curriculum for a whole semester. Each class had something to do with this terrible show. We saw it in English and we wrote in magazines as if we were one of the characters. In mathematics we talk about letters and other marine garbage. In science we talk about whales (which was really interesting, so it was not a waste of 100%). All day every day was torture. Not only that, but they would subject us to this horror twice a day by making us see it in the study room as well. I could see if it was a new series or something, but it was, like, '93. I'm still trying to block this.
