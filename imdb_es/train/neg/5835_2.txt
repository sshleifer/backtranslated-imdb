Ah WINTER KILLS, based on Richard Condon's novel about a conspiracy that killed the president of the United States 20 years ago. I knew that Condon also wrote THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE, which dealt with a similar theme and I expected to see an intelligent thriller. <br /> <br /> WINTER KILLS left me cold. It is not a thriller. It's a worthless piece of junk, possibly the worst movie I've seen this month and many bad movies in June. The problem lies in both the direction and the script and, since William Richert was responsible for both, he must be completely blamed for this fake farce. <br /> <br /> There are two things that are wrong with this movie. First of all it is the way in which everything is presented in a totally superior way. It is not as OTT as saying something like the James Bond movie with David Niven and Peter Sellers, but everything has a touch of farce with actors who completely assault their performances. This could have been justified if there was an entertainment value for the movie but there was none. As a satire it is very silly, so silly that it becomes almost imperceptible. Second, the scenes seem to have been cut out so much that they make no sense. Take, for example, a scene in which the hero confronts a militia leader named Dawson. Dawson tells the hero that he has a start of 30 seconds and then it comes down to the hero being on board an airplane. The scenes begin and end without rhyme or reason <br /> <br /> A terrible movie that is a test to sit down.
