It was 1 o'clock in the morning and I had nothing else to do. Do not judge me ... please. <br /> <br /> We have returned on time in the Spanish settlements. A group has headed to an island. It is not long before they meet a great "reptile", who swallows his horse. Soon they are captured by the natives and to obtain freedom they must kill the "reptilian gods". The CG stinks; It reminds me of the CG of the first console games. The meetings were lame. The only positive thing I have to say about this was the native hottie running in a small outfit. Otherwise, it is only a medium effort.
