Actually, I really did not expect this kind of film outside of the United States. How someone can take the issue of child sexual abuse and turn it into a "thriller" is simply sick. Auteuil (whom he had previously admired) walked around as a kind of child savior that Rambo ignored and insulted all sexually exploited children around the world. <br /> <br /> What is doubly depressing is that the astonishment and the terrain The innovative film "Happiness" came out the year BEFORE this movie. Menges and his companions should be ashamed of themselves. It is admirable to read some of the comments from the smartest viewers out there. They could see the ridiculous and ridiculous handling of this subject. Those of you who think that this is a great cinema show an unpleasant amount of ignorance and need to see "Happiness" to open their minds to the true horrors of pedophilia. <br /> <br /> Do you think your child is more likely? be kidnapped and sold into sexual slavery or be molested by a neighbor, teacher, friend or even a relative? Hmm ... I wonder. If you are going to make a film about international child slavery of any kind, you owe it to everyone to be realistic and emotionally involved instead of this shitty bellboy. 1/10
