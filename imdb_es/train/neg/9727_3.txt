Another of my adventures in the gangue bin, this movie gave me exactly what I expected: a load of trashy horror with screaming women. <br /> <br /> Everything started very well. I liked the little introduction with the "newscast" about the exposure of the young couple to a nuclear explosion, and it was completely absorbed until the first person caught fire ... <br /> <br /> Thereafter, the film descended to absolute stupidity, and at times it became almost embarrassing to watch. When it turned out that the heroine was afflicted with the same condition as the main character (the ability to light her own farts without the help of a match) it seemed almost as if someone had thrown the idea at the last moment ("that's fine! "You can almost hear it say ...) As for the almost psychic link between the main character and the nuclear power station, well ... <br /> <br /> The movie proved so cheap tat - if you pay more than Â£ 1.50 for what you have done
