Cornel Wilde and three dumbbells search for a sunken treasure in the South Atlantic. <br /> <br /> The treasure hunters led by Wilde fight against a group of territorial sharks with small taunts on their hungry faces. Wilde and his cheerful men must find a way to retreat from the menu so they can start digging an old Spanish galleon full of gold bars. <br /> <br /> After the crew gets involved in a small eternity of pushing, pushing, arguing and listening to Wilde's annoying health tips, 5 crazy convicts board the ship and complicate things. Now it's a battle of wits as to who gets the treasure and who can see what the inside of a shark's stomach looks like. <br /> <br /> At least Wilde is in shape and uses exactly the same as he used. 'The Naked Prey' 10 years ago and has been in excellent condition. <br /> <br /> Done with a budget of 75 cents.
