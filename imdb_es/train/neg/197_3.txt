Although it is a great Western by James Arness, this film has become the worst Alamo movie ever made. The story was terrible, the inaccuracy of all this, and simply an absolute lie to boot! The continuity was thrown to the four winds. Does someone catch the cannon sequence? The Mexicans were foolish enough to fire cannons that obviously had mud and sticks protruding from the tubes. Come on! Then there's the ridiculous hat of Brian Keith! The client must have been away or something like that. Or simply out of your mind!
