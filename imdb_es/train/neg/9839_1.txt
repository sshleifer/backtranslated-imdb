The beginning of this movie was good. He started to become really stupid after he told people he wanted to kill himself. I think if I come from a small city like that would offend me after watching this movie. They made many of these people look foolish and crazy. How could these people have so little to make them follow him all day long? Many times these people told him ways to commit suicide as if they were urging him to do so. How can so many people have little respect for other people? I also think that they could have made a much better ending to this movie. This movie also had some good parts. Some people may like it, but I would not recommend it to anyone.
