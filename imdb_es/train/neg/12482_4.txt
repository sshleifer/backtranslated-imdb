The Deathstalker is directed by John Watson and is starring Rick Hill, who is a kind of bodybuilder and famous for that, if I understood, right? The plot continues while Deathstalker (Hill) tries to recover something from the evil lord, and he has to travel to the Lord's cave. He meets many dwarves and monsters during his trip, and the settings are very close to Tolkien and, of course, to Conan the Barbarian. This is a scam of the huge success of Conan, and although this is a very stupid movie, it has many nice garbage merits and is recommended for junkies and to tolerate movie addicts. <br /> <br /> There are not many cinematics Merits in this movie. A couple of scenes are almost atmospheric and fascinating, but what Deathstalker concentrates on showing, are the naked females and the huge muscles of Hill. The females are often helpless victims and also very stupid, so this is a very macho film and, therefore, can not please many feminists! The fight scenes are nothing special and quite boring, and the monsters are nothing special either. And all the other aspects of the movie are also very unprofessional and badly done, but what did you expect from a low budget effort like this? This tries to be as big as Conan, but it fails very miserably. As I said, this may please fans of Turkish cinema, but no one else. This belongs to the category that is so bad that it's great! <br /> <br /> The Deathstalker is not as bad as it could be, and like a turkey movie, I appreciate it almost as much as other turkeys, nice of course! If the bad movies are your cup of tea, try this and have fun, but if you do not understand the "bad movies", get away. And if someone can not stand a lot of nudes, then get away too. Here there are more nudes than violence, and because of these scenes, the film has a rating of R. Otherwise, this could be a family-friendly PG movie. <br /> <br /> 4/10
