I hate this program: not only is the concept ridiculous, but it strives to be feasible (something that was left out of similar "I confess" ending programs, like Muder: She Wrote). <br /> <br /> I sigh. Why is it that writers can not be smart enough in this program to present evidence that they adhere and win a decision in court? <br /> <br /> Come on: after X years of years of unsolved cases, why EVERY SUSPECT, EVERY EPISODE * CONFESS * (damn!) to a murder that would not otherwise be resolved. <br /> <br /> I bet all the cops want the criminals to be such good athletes: "Aw Shucks, officer, you're brilliant, I guess if you've found out enough to convince yourself that I did, it's better Let him admit it and make it easier for you in court What can I say? Fair Cop. " <br /> <br /> Absolute dog s ** t and an insult to those of us with enough brain to have heard about IQ
