The comparison with American Graffiti is inevitable, so save time and money by renting that timeless classic. Speaking of punctuality, there was an episode of Cheers where Norm and Cliff competed on who can find more anachronism in a movie. They would have loved this movie from some of the songs and some of the clothes were wrong. There were astute references like "they paved the paradise to build a parking lot". The filmmakers hoped to get some smiles from us, but basically they made me moan. <br /> <br /> The characters in this movie are incredibly political and socially astute for teenagers. Almost as smart as people who were between thirty and forty when they wrote the damn movie. Very little of what the characters said was credible. It combines the bad writing and the bad performance of this film, it just totally fails. Although, there were two exceptions, Kelli Williams encouraged things like the future flower girl and, despite what another critic said, Rick Shroeder was quite good. Show that inveterate characteristic that would come to boil in his eventual appearance in "N.Y.P.D. Blues".
