My first review of 2010 is "Into The Blue 2: The Reef". The story is about two divers played by Chris Carmack and Laura Vandervoort who love to explore hidden treasures at the bottom of a local reef. One day after a day of exploration, they are approached by a couple played by David Anders and Marsha Thomason. They tell the young divers that they want to hire them to explore the reef and find a rare artefact about the hidden treasure of Columbus that is reported in the lower part of the reef. <br /> <br /> The next day, the four of them dive into the reef at the bottom of the reef and after a full day of diving they find nothing. A few more days passed and the two hired divers discovered that they were part of a major deadly plot in which they can not escape, otherwise they will be killed. They were hired to find two large containers. One contains a nuclear reactor and the other contains a nucleus. <br /> <br /> The movie also has a back story about another person (brother of the main character) trying to fix things with his girlfriend, I think this part The story was a waste of time, this also includes a scene of very torrid sex between the couple, which for me is a complete waste and it was not necessary to show it. <br /> <br /> However, apart from that, this movie has a good underwater photography and the colors combine well, so it receives 4 stars. Into The Blue 2 is a sequel only by its name. None of the actors or original characters returns, has a silly plot, stupid characters and a boring climax.
