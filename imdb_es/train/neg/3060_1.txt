This has to be the most twisted and twisted Christmas movie I've ever seen my eyes on, and that's saying something. I know that Mexicans have some strange ideas about religion, mixing ancient Aztec beliefs with traditional Christian theology. But his Day of the Dead is not half as scary as his taking Santa Claus. <br /> <br /> So, Santa is not a happy, fat, red alcoholic (look at those pink cheeks). some time!). Rather, he is a skinny sociopathic pedophile who lives in heaven (or in heaven, whatever it may be), with a group of children who work harder than Kathy Lee Gifford's sweat shops. They sing very nice traditional songs from their countries of origin while wearing such stereotyped clothes that I was surprised that there was not a black-faced African-American boy singing 'Mama'. This Santa Claus is a pervert pervert Tom who watches and listens to everything that everyone does from his "eye in the sky". This is so that he knows who has been naughty or kind (with an emphasis on those who are naughty, I would bet). <br /> <br /> No Mrs. Claus, no elves (why do you need elves, when do you have child labor?) And reindeer are mechanical rope toys! This floating freak show floats on a cloud, presumably supported by its silvery lining. <br /> <br /> Is Santa's nemesis ... the devil? What is this, Holy our Lord and Savior? Strange. In any case, Satan sends one of his henchmen, a spicy and gray-haired demon called Pitch, to try to ruin Christmas. Let me clarify this: are the forces of the purest evil trying to ruin a totally commercial and avid holiday? It seems a bit redundant, right? <br /> <br /> The tone is totally ineffective. Try to convince some children that they are bad, but you do not have much luck. I was very impressed by the story of the holy girl Lupe, whose family is very poor. All she wants is a doll for Christmas, but the parents can not afford to buy one (they spent all their money on the cardboard with which they built their house). So Pitch tries to encourage her to steal a doll. Actually, that's the only way that a poor girl would get a doll, because being holy and praying to God and saint does not work. But Lupe resists the temptation and tells Pitch to put you behind her, so she is rewarded for receiving such a spooky doll that you only know is Chucky's sister. <br /> <br /> On the way, Pitch gets Santa to leave. trapped in a tree (uh-huh) from where he was rescued by Merlin! Merlin? You got to be kidding! Since when do Druidic mythical figures appear in Christmas stories, or do they have something to do with a Christian religion? And does not God disapprove of magic? They would have been burning Merlin at the stake a few hundred years ago, without asking him to come to the rescue of one of the Aspects of God (or that's what I suppose must be Santa, go against Satan). This movie is a long HUH? from start to finish, and it will make you wonder if that eggnog you drank had no spikes or something like that. Probably it was, since this movie is like a long giant DT.
