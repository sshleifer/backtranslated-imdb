(Spoilers) <br /> <br /> I was very curious to see this movie, after hearing it was smart and witty. I had to stop halfway because of the unbearable boredom I felt. <br /> <br /> The idea behind the film would have been acceptable: to describe the way in which the relationship between a man and a woman evolves, through all the problems and difficulties. that two people living in a big city can live. What made me not like the whole movie were two things. <br /> <br /> First of all, the film was so realistic that it seemed as if, when describing the problems that a couple must solve in a day. In the day, it became something ordinary and boring. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the general neglect of production, with barely comprehensible dialogues. <br /> <br /> Pity.
