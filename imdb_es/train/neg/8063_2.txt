I have anticipated several sci-fi movies and thrillers this summer, but I was very disappointed in this particular movie. While some people left the film, I decided to stay, only to laugh with the other spectators for the performance, the lack of suspense, the ridiculous end and the difficult story to follow. I found myself almost as confused as the main character in the movie. The only redeeming quality of the film was the soundtrack. This is one of those budding star movies that they later regret having made. In retrospect, I would not even rent this one, let alone pay more than $ 5 to see.
