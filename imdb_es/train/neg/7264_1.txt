Just another movie that exploits free frontal male nudity; horrible acting, in addition, the scenes of love are the sexiest I've seen (and it's not that I do not link the idea of ​​two young people making love, since I'm gay). <br /> <br /> Again, as in A Thousand Clouds of Peace, Julian Hernandez directed an incredibly pretentious film with a story that is enough argument for a short film of about five minutes, but manages to make a 2-hour movie with him. .. And this time, there is not even the issue of racism and commercialization in the Mexican gay community to talk about! God, have mercy on us!
