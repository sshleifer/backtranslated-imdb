The story is very reliable and powerful. The technical side of the movie is pretty good ... even your address. The main problem is with the castings, which turned that film into almost another local and regular clich√© with a great lack of impact and even greater lack of impression. In addition to the small role of the father, Rafael (played in an impressive way by Asi Dayan), all the other actors were unfortunately not at their best. The role of the elderly Ciega, played by Taly Sharon, was recent, but without any intensity as the main role. therefore, the figure that acted had become soft and low profile. There were moments and episodes that seemed more like an essay than a real movie. But after all, it's a good place to start and to make big improvements in the future.
