Well, first of all, if you consider Revolt of the Zombies as a very early movie of Night of the Living Dead (1968), forget it. It's about "zombies" in a more psychological sense, where that term simply denotes someone who does not have control of his will, but who, instead, must follow the will of another. The "zombies" here, as little as they are in the film, are largely metaphors for submission to the state or authority in general, as in wartime. It is quite exaggerated to call this a horror movie. <br /> <br /> The film takes place during the First World War. A "French Cambodian" contingent had heard strange stories about zombification: supposedly, Angkor Wat was built using zombies - and there are stories of armies of zombies that easily outfox enemies. Armand Louque (Dean Jagger) brings a priest who supposedly knows the secret of zombification, but does not speak. So Louque and an international military contingent head to Angkor Wat on an archaeological expedition designed to uncover the secret of zombification and destroy the information before the zombies have a chance to "take down the white race." <br /> <br /> One of the strange things about Revolt of the Zombies is that it seems that perhaps writer / director Victor Halperin decided to change his game plan while recording the script. The film begins as if exploring the zombie / military metaphor, and perhaps even has elements of adventure, but after about 15 minutes, changes gear and becomes more a story of love triangles. <br /> <br /> Halperin sticks with a subtext about will and power (and a Nietzschean "will to power"). The film is interesting at that level, but the script and the editing are very choppy. This is another older film for which I would not be surprised if there are missing pictures, especially because some scenes even fade or cut while a character is making a dialogue. <br /> <br /> In the middle of artificial romantic history, Halperin tries to keep referring to the thread of zombies, but little of the material of zombies makes a lot of sense. Louque discovers the secret of zombification, but does not mean much to the viewer. The mechanics of the zombie material is vague and confusing. Halperin even resorts to the use of superimposed images of Bela Lugosi's bulging eyes from his 1932 movie, White Zombie, but he never explains what it has to do with anything. There are big gaps in the plot, including the love story. Promising and interesting characters of the first scrolls disappear for long periods of time. A potential villain is eliminated without ceremony before he can do much. <br /> <br /> If you're a big fan of old and squeaky B movies, Revolt of the Zombies may be worth watching at least once: acting is not that bad, and if you have a good imagination, you can Rebuild an interesting story in your mind to fill all the gaps. But this is the second time I've seen the movie, since the first one was about five years ago, and I could barely remember anything about it, so it's not exactly memorable.
