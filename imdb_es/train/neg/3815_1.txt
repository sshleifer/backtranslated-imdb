The acting is bad, all the jokes are superficial and the target audience is very small children, assuming they have an IQ below the average. I realize that it was for children, but so is Malcom in the Middle, but still present situations and humor for adults. <br /> <br /> What should we expect from a show by Bob Saget, the only comedian? in existence, which is less fun than a ball hitting a man's groin, and is probably why it stopped hosting the funniest Home Videos in the United States. <br /> <br /> Parents, do not let your children see this show unless they want to save money in college Expose your children to stupidity and grow more foolish.
