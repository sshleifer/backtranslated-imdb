The guy did a lot of title design for a lot of movies and I guess one day he said: I should choose a cheap stage, try to put as much title as a can (because after all I'm a title designer) and try to persuade people that this is actually a movie. One of the worst I've seen, that's for sure. If you felt the need to see good titles, go see some posters, do not waste time watching this. <br /> <br /> It's a bit ironic, do not you think you saw the poster? The only part of your project that SHOULD have title work done almost does not have!
