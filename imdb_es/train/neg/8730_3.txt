What stands out in my mind in this film (sadly) is the introduction, where John Berlin (Andy Garcia) is driving towards the city. You see your Mercedes go through a winding road through a forest that looks like it's loaded with Redwood trees. It's pretty beautiful <br /> <br /> As for Andy Garcia playing a character with the last name of Berlin, well ... Andy is too Hispanic / Latino to be acceptable. Maybe a Caucasian father married his Spanish mother for this story? Who knows. But I can tell you that when you put him in a village of farm people and healers, he stands out like a sore thumb, especially with his accent that turns on when he gets angry. Yes, I know, great thing, right? He is still a good actor. <br /> <br /> The title refers to a serial killer who nicknamed his victims Jennifer. All the victims are blind and he dismantles them. Helena Robertson (Uma Thurman) appears suddenly when a blind witness appears (do not ask). To my surprise, Thurman does a good job playing a blind person. When I saw Lance Henriksen playing the Sergeant. Freddy Ross, I was worried. Henriksen played in some rather strange films, especially in recent times. I still can not forget it in the blood bath movie, Pumpkinhead. <br /> <br /> The Berlin movies in a small town of L.A. as a detective. Start investigating Jennifer's murders after finding body parts at the local landfill. His brilliance at discovering that one of the victims was blind seemed implausible. So did the irony of * SPOILER * Freddy's murder, with the recording and name similarities. I got very confused as to the logic of how eight "Jennifers" became. And the reason for the simply deranged killer did not have much impact. In retrospect, this film is probably more faithful to life by showing an innocent person as capable of killing simply because she became a little crazy over time or maybe they were born crazy. <br /> <br /> John Malkovich does a great job In his interrogation of Garcia! Although no policeman would be legally allowed to put pressure on someone so strong and challenge him without, by right, being eliminated. As for the end, it's a bit of a surprise, but it's very questionable, like the sergeant. The murder of Ross. The killer chooses to walk after his victim, and opts instead of playing, I suppose. <br /> <br /> And there are so many opportunities that killing her is ridiculous. I will not ruin the end because despite the jolts, it's a good surprise. Afterwards, however, you will probably say, as I did, "boy, he was lucky!" 4/10
