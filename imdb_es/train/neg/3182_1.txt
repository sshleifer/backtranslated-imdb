Final Justice has the great Joe Don Baker running through Texas, shooting people who shoot people. Then he goes to Malta where he shoots more people. He is locked up many times for shooting people. Then he gets into a shootout with the bad boy, who is dressed like a monk. There is a boat chase, and Joe Don ends up in jail again. Finally, Joe Don, with the help of Elaine from "Seinfeld", kills the villain, blows a boat or two and someone is shot with a flare. All this and a catchy themed song, like Mitchell!
