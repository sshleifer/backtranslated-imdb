This is the second British Rank film that adapts the stories of Sommerset Maugham to the film. All but a history of 'Quartet' do not travel well in the contemporary era; and the actors' discourse is decidedly "cut", as only British actors before 1950 can do. In any case, 'Trio' seems stricter and more filmic than the first film adaptation. <br /> <br /> One of the problems that these two films can not overcome is that their source material was written 25-30 years before the movies. . Consequently, for the 1950s, Maughm's (pre-war) popularist popular discourse of "small morality" seemed quite strange, if not downright timid.
