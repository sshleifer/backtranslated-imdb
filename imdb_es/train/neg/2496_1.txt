I would list this movie under the horror movie genre. I did this because I do not know a genre called horrible. Since the horror genre is the closest to the horror, I have decided to put it in this category. The performance was amateur. You know who the villains would be in the first scene. The heroine is as ugly as the movie. Filmmaking students should take this film as an example for the lesson of what not to do in a movie. It's so bad Man, the word bad is an understatement. The villains hijack a transatlantic and want 10 million dollars. They want the money to be delivered to an Isla Rosa inhabited in the middle of the Pacific. They would be sitting ducks after getting the money. No escape plan? What a fool. The cruise director is a former police officer, naval seal, kung fu. I'm scared. The fun part is the way the time bomb is deactivated. He says he knows what he's doing and keeps pulling all the wires one by one. Then he saves it in his pocket and according to the movie with all the connections in place. Is he crazy? How we were crazy about those who saw him RIDICULOUS. If you have an M-i-L that you do not like. To bother renting this movie and pretend that you enjoy it. I assure you that you will definitely tell your spouse that you have such bad taste and that your child has married a person below the standard of your family.
