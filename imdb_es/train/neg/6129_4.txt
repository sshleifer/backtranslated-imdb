Judging by this movie and THE STRONG MAN, the same year, would not put Harry Langdon at the top of the list of great comedians of the silent screen. There just is not enough there. Maybe he was on the way to developing his style, but he sabotaged himself by taking his first big hits very seriously. In any case, all his tricks are reminiscent of great funny men, but he lacks the acrobatic skills of Keaton and the prodigious wit of Lloyd. He also undermines his own person by dressing and walking like Chaplin's vagabond. Their trademarks are childish innocence, the shyness of focus and the tendency to react badly to seemingly perplexed calamity, to beat their eyes or touch their pursed lips with the tip of their index finger. The comedy in Langdon's films is the result of fate throwing several obstacles in its path that tries to overcome naively or with a minimum of physicality, such as throwing stones at a tornado that approaches to drive him away, prop up a collapsed building with One by two or dodge rocks by lifting one leg so they roll under it. In this story, about the son of a shoemaker who joins a foot race around the country to publicize the shoes of a rival company, he manages to win by sheer luck. There is nothing here that has not been much better done by the Big Three.
