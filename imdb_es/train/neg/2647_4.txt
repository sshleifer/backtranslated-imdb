I'm going to say one thing to Jeanette and Nelson: Even when you're stuck in a joyless musical, witty and painfully inept like this, there's still a sparkle in your eyes. Yes, the chemistry between the famous duo is there even when the material is thin as paper. Even when the score is practically disposable, it does not exist, it only depends on a couple of catchy melodies. And even when the circumstances are so incredible, yes, even for a fantasy. <br /> <br /> The truth is that she has more chemistry with Nelson than with her own husband in real life, Gene Raymond, in SMILIN 'THROUGH. That, however, was a considerably better movie. <br /> <br /> Sorry, I love Jeanette and Nelson as much as the next fan, but this is the bottom of the pile. Jeanette is more than embarrassing in her "hep" number with Binnie Barnes, and Nelson can only have a blank stare when faced with the most ridiculous situations. <br /> <br /> One can only wonder what this was. as on Broadway in 1938. Surely, it must have had more ingenuity and style than is evident in this weak MGM production. Edward Everett Horton vanishes in a funny role and none of the players who support him can breathe something similar to life in this mess. It's like an amateur night in the studio, even with the few professionals scattered among the cast. <br /> <br /> Summing up: Painfully clumsy representation of a musical by Rodgers and Hart. I can not recommend it, even for fans of MacDonald and Eddy. And even if Jeanette's close-ups still shine with her gossamer beauty, this movie is amazingly bad.
