Well, I have to say that this movie was so bad that I would have left if I did not have to review it to work. And the worst part is that I wanted to see it so bad that I drove all over the city, I paid $ 10 for the parking lot twice because the newspaper lists were wrong. Vince Vaughn plays the boy he always does, the only time I've seen him play someone else was in that movie with John Travolta. Anyway, the plot has potential: it sounded great in the preview, but it's full of totally ridiculous, predictable and weak plot turning points. And I was hoping that this was a Christmas movie in which Christmas would NOT have to be kept, and Santa Claus would not need a replacement, but no. The only great part was the sleigh rides, and the little boy bladck was the Best character. I am sure that this film would be great for small children, but for adults it is so boring that it is a difficult task to sit down.
