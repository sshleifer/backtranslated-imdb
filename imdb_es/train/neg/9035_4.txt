I was born in the 1960s. I grew up watching "Movies of the Week" in the early '70s and I loved the creepy movies that were shown routinely, like "Crowhaven Farm", "Bad Ronald", " The girls' school of Satan "," Kolchak The Night Stalker ", etc., but this is simply silly. Obviously, this is the writer who tries to take advantage of Manson's horrific murders some years before. The film stars Dennis Weaver, from "McCloud" and "Duel," as a father who takes his family camping on a beach. The family meets some hippies who for some reason decide to terrorize the family. The reason for this is never explained, and Weaver's pacifist stance is hard to swallow. For God's sake, call the police, beat their hell or something, just do not sit there and regret that. The acting is pretty boring, the story incredible, etc. Susan Dey looks cute in a bikini, but that's it. Ignore this if it is ever broadcast on television.
