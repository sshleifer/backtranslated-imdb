As a relative who gives you a bad gift, Soul Survivors has his heart in the right place, but stumbles on a bad execution. Stephen Carpenter's writing / direction effort is freely borrowed from other best films, such as Jacob's Ladder and Open Your Eyes. For those who have not seen any of these movies, I will not give up the premise; Suffice it to say that it is not as well handled here as in those two films of superior quality. <br /> <br /> Melissa Sagemiller is the protagonist of Cassie, who is about to go to college. Her current boyfriend Sean (Ben Affleck) and her ex-boyfriend Matt (Wes Bentley), both friends, and Annabel (acronic Eliza Dushku) are in a car accident after being chased by two assassins (?) Wearing transparent masks. She survives the shipwreck, but while attending university she has visions of the hospital test and the dead reappear and disappear, leaving her in a state of total confusion: who is dead? Who is alive What is real? <br /> <br /> Soul Survivors has the look of a bad movie of exploiting stacked teenagers, filled with blood, spattered with blood, which is stacked in the blood. It is true that it has its share of murderous scenes that stalk the victim (abundant, repetitive and numbing), but at least try to create suspense through ideas instead of clich√©s, unfortunately without success. It generates confusion much more often than cohesion, as the story becomes confused, incoherent and incoherent near the key points of the mystery (predictable as it is). <br /> <br /> Horror fans who choose a copy will have no idea what awaits them is a film that is more concerned with building an uncomfortable facade of reality than with telling a body. The credit is for Carpenter for trying to create something more than a horror movie derived for teenagers; Too bad he created a psychological thriller derivative. Sagemiller also deserves congratulations for showing strength in the core performance, really developing his character and evoking a certain sense of emotion like unraveling Cassie. It's great that the filmmakers try something different, but the film ends with a mix of experiences and a failed experiment. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
