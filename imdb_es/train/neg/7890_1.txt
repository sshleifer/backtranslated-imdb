How sad it is that there is not an option to publish a mark lower than 1. I saw this nonsense and could hardly believe what I was seeing. Every part of the movie was horrible. Music, acting, direction, history, everything, just everything. In fact, I found myself laughing at several points in the movie. In particular, I loved the part where our hero is running through the hospital in slow-motion, soft focus, and he takes the clipboard out of the nurses' hand, because ............. good. Just because. Product placement? Crucifix (crucifi?) Everywhere. If you are of a Christian persuasion and very easily satisfied, you may like this movie. If you like this movie, you really need to get out more.
