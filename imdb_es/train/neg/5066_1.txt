This is the worst show. Buntch of adults acting like children, nothing of humor. Even Sesame Street has a better mood and more adults than friends. "Friends" may be the worst thing I've seen on TV and I've been sitting in front of the tube observing that friends "just do not compare themselves with others, contemporaries." Series lacks the intelligence of "Seinfeld" and the wonderful self ridiculous of the pomposity that is the hallmark of "Frasier." The characters of "Friends" seem designed to make them repellent.This incestuous group of neighbors causes my flesh to wrinkle. <br /> <br /> The show does not Smart is completely without an edge of any kind.The characters are caricatures of caricatures and the writing is sophisticated, although intentionally. (It could be interesting to observe a writing session since the writers may have to be slaves to aim below their abilities so as not to confuse the loyal friends of "Friends".)
