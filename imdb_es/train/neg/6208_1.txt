There is only one word for this movie. Appalling. The director clearly has talent, but like his character Robert Carmichael, he throws everything away. <br /> <br /> Carmichael has potential, but like Cray, you can not be bothered to use it. Cray's vision of young Britons is to be dragged into petty crime and then fall into depravity. Like the British tabloids, this film portrays young people without aspirations or respect. Cray cries out for attention, but does not deserve any. <br /> <br /> I was appalled by the act of violence that Cray chose to push on the faces of the audience. It assumes that the audience ignores the atrocities of the world. Like a piece of obscene graffiti on the wall of a toilet, it shows us male depravity with adolescent elation. <br /> <br /> Some quality actors have small parts in this movie. Danny Dyer and Leslie Manville make short appearances. The performance is otherwise amateur, young Joe and Ben are making faces. Carmichael played by Daniel Spencer is creepy. Miranda Wilson plays Monica, the attractive wife of the famous chef Jonathon (Michael Howe); how she was able to undergo such an ordeal is incredible. The film is never subtle and Monica receives the most gratuitous violence that is cut with the war. War images are used to convey the idea that young men can not help themselves, that acts of violence will occur even in "civilized" countries. This is certainly true and is symptomatic of our altered society where men have an increasingly less important position, but Cray descends to the level of barbarian men he seeks to expose through his use of such brutal and violent images. The female characters in the film offer no relief. They are victims or, in the case of Manville, a destroyed mother. The community is represented as dysfunctional. <br /> <br /> This is Cray's first movie. I heard what he had to say during a question and answer session in Edinburugh and he's not unintelligent, he simply lacks experience and his film exposes his naivety. The film will be released later this year, but I hope the company falls apart because the public does not really need this kind of messy material.
