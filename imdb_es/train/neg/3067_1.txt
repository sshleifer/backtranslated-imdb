This is simply bad. Sometimes, the remakes, even if they move away from the original, are good by themselves. They can provide another point of view and achieve a certain interpretation that makes them unique and enjoyable. This was as badly thought and carried out as it can be. This was not good even to stand on its own. Viggo Mortenson is a top-level actor, but some of his selections of roles and projects leave much to be desired. The original "Vanishing Point" was such an exciting psychological adventure; This is not an adventure at all, and it is not enjoyable or entertaining at all. This was made from a focus on numbers for film making, filling in the plot points that someone in Hollywood believes will please what they consider the current audience of the film. Basically, they see us as a group of idiots. It's insulting for someone to take this out as a feature film, and even try to remake a neglected cult classic. The devices of manipulative tracing, the aspects "make it obvious so that the point is not lost", the ridiculous dialogue, the stereotyped characters, the amateur direction ... <br /> <br /> This is simply wrong .. .
