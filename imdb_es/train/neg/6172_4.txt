I'll get to the movie in a minute. First, someone wanted "evidence" of Clinton's comments in Georgetown, where he claimed that the United States "deserved" 9-11 attacks. Well, this is what Clinton said: <br /> <br /> "In the first Crusade, when the Christian soldiers took Jerusalem, they first burned a synagogue with 300 Jews in it and proceeded to kill all the women and children They were Muslims on the Temple Mount, I can tell you that history is still told in the Middle East today and we are still paying for it. " <br /> <br /> Are we still paying? What does "we" mean, pale face? The Marines did not take the Temple Mount. <br /> <br /> But in truth, Clinton never really came out and said flatly that we "deserved" 9-11. Like all his statements during his presidency, he IMPLIED that we deserved 9-11. Just point to the "fact" A, B, C and maybe D, and let the listener infer that he must come to conclusion X. When in fact, most of Clinton's "facts" were added to the guacamole. <br /> <br /> But that is irrelevant. We are here to talk about movies, not politics. Unfortunately, when Oliver "Captain Conspiracy" Stone makes a movie, you can not escape his twisted politics. It was only a matter of time before he focused his paranoia and bitterness on the Reagan Era, and what better time than when Stone's dreams almost came true, the day Reagan almost bought the farm. Unable to find conspiracies or infamous plans in the attempt of murder of Hinckley, invents one with Al Haig. From a simple misunderstanding of the chain of constitutional authority, Haig transforms himself from a public servant who really should have reviewed his civic recovery in a large megalomaniac. You almost expect Haig to rub his hands like Montgomery Burns and tell Cap Weinberger to "free the dogs." Stone even recruits the most elegant person in Hollywood to play our former Secretary of State, Richard Dreyfuss. A boy you love to hate at a glance. <br /> <br /> In general, the movie is fine. Average, hovering below average. Do not bother to rent or buy. Try to catch it in the cable. 4 out of 10
