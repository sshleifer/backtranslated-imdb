This movie reminds me of how university students used to protest against the Vietnam War. As if listening to some children ignoring the cheeseburgers at Cow Dung Collehe, the President would immediately change all US foreign policy. UU <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that, although dangerous, the concept of a policy based on which if the USSR and the United States went to war, it could mean the end of the world, WORKED. USA UU And the USSR NEVER WENT TO THE WAR. <br /> <br /> If only we had conventional weapons, the notion of one more war, a "winnable" war, in Europe and Asia was not unthinkable. <br /> <br /> It's not that I think you should get rid of this movie. Film students should see it as a splendid example of "How NOT to make a movie." <br /> <br /> It should be 0 stars or maybe black holes ...
