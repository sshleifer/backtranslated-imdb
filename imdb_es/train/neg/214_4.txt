Considering that this film had a serious and quite successful launch campaign, I would have expected something to be worthwhile ... from the initial scene (in which the two brothers caress each other "sensually", lying naked on a bed) quickly down ... nothing to get attention, is not something that attracts attention throughout the plot, baaad baad acting (some minor exceptions, but artificiality is at its best). Incest and lesbianism are promising themes, but the script does not analyze in depth either (keep in mind that a possible excuse for the creators, saying that pointing to a subtle movie would be hilarious, unless the subtle and superficial mean the same ...). Too curious onlookers will not get any interesting scene ... at this point, I could have saved something from the movie ... so you can imagine how bad it is. You could say many other things ... but, please, watch the movie yourselves ... I am selfish and I would like as many people as possible to waste 1 1 / 2h of their lives ... as I did :(
