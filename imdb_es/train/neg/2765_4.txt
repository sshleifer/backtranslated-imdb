How this movie was made with a budget supposedly of $ 70 million and without being completely redesigned is beyond me. The plot and the dialogue are beyond the amateur. The characters say things that no real person would say and almost never react to things that were said before. Nobody seems to be grounded in the real world. The performance of potential clients is fine, since writing is a failure ... but several actors in support roles really delay production. The hero's hair probably should have got his own credit, it was so oddly flashy ... not to mention that he gave one of the best performances in the photo. Finally, for a movie about how L.A. is being besieged by giant reptiles, this movie is surprisingly boring. What a pity! If you see it, your mind will be constantly competing, thinking of ways you could have taken SFX scenes and created a much better movie around you. Unfortunately, I would not have taken much.
