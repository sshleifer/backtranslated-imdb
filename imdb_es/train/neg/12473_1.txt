This is probably one of the worst movies I've seen, everything is weak and incoherent. The performance is absurd, the costumes are even more disheveled and the story does not exist. This "swath of poverty" swords and adventure film was destined to capture part of the success that "Beastmaster" and "Conan" enjoyed, but it does not give us any reason to follow it. The main character is lukewarm and boring, he can not even fight with a sword and the sword is from the 16th century. All the action sequences are like that, slow and unrealistic, not to mention the castle and the horribly old-fashioned music that plays every time they ride horses. Do not even bother with this shit.
