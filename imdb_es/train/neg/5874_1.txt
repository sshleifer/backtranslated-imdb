One of the worst movies I've seen to date. The scene of pathetic action and really bad acting does not help either. The only positive point is the Gary Busey parts, but this does not raise the movie much. It lives up to its B movie rating and passes the test with great success. A waste of my money, although I found it entertaining, to begin with, it becomes annoying after some watches. I do not recommend this movie unless you see it for free or it is a gift. (A gift you can request the receipt and return it for a full refund). <br /> <br /> Really BAd. <br /> <br /> 1/10.
