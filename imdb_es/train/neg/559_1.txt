I saw this movie at the London premiere, and I have to say that I did not expect much, but I expected something that was at least somewhat entertaining. <br /> <br /> The original "Basic Instinct" was not It's a great movie and it's still something of a "little classic" but it was entertaining. I can remember countless times that I have flipped through the channels on television on a Friday or Saturday afternoon after having found the film and started paying attention to it. <br /> <br /> However, this foolish brain, waaay-late sequel has nothing. Sharon Stone is still beautiful? Well, let's say it this way: for a 47-year-old girl, it's very good. Is it as beautiful as it was in the original? No. She also clearly underwent plastic surgery on her face, and her haircut in this movie is somewhat unattractive. She does not look as soft, genuine or innocent as she did in the original, which is kind of a point of being an evil seducer, and all that. <br /> <br /> The rest of the performances range from bad to terrible, and Michael Caton-Jones (a typically safe director, one who does not always do a great job but manages to make worthwhile films) has delivered officially his first real turkey; a film so bad that people laughed at certain moments that pretended to be serious. <br /> <br /> I heard that the movie went through several editing sessions, and it's very clear from the beginning. Nothing makes much sense. The whole plot is a cosmic disaster and the end, oh! Talk about stupid and incredible. (However, it's still predictable.) I saw "Gigli", I saw "Son of the Mask", and although I'm not looking to "smear" this movie, I can say with my own authority (which is not true) I have to be agree, in any case, that I prefer both films to this catastrophic failure. <br /> <br /> By the way, Stone left five minutes before the movie started and people in the theater started throwing things off the screen during a particularly outrageous and insulting scene inside an orgy-type nightclub. <br /> <br /> "Basic instinct 2" - basically, it also stinks.
