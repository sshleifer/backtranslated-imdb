I have read some of the other comments and I have to agree with those who did not get the final. I thought it was going pretty well ... until the end. He kept his mind running and then splat. I have no idea what happened in the last two minutes of the movie, except for a complete disaster. It is as if they had run out of money to find a good ending, so they improvised. First they had a mysterious thing that made people disappear, then they had a guy who talked about Area 51 (what makes you think of aliens) and then, after they went to hell. I thought that the actors and actresses did it well, only that the script got sour. Anyway, if you watch this movie, be prepared to disappoint yourself in the end.
