I'm still trying to decide if this is really the worst movie I've seen. A very disturbing problem with this film is that the real scientists are interviewed, but their images are edited to make it appear that they support the ideas of the many BSers that populate this film. The BS ratio for reporting from the interviews is approximately ten thousand to one; In the end, the interviewees seem to be saying: "We want you to think _ !!", but they themselves are too lazy to do a simple investigation about the things they affirm. as a fact. <br /> <br /> If you feel that you have an open mind and want to expand your consciousness, have an open mind to read some real books about quantum theory: "The universe of Einstein", Nigel Calder (a thin volume, not a challenge), "The Cosmic Code", by Heinz Pagels. If you can not read a book, do not complain to critics for being "open-minded". <br /> <br /> To summarize, this movie is incredibly bad. <br /> <br /> Do you know what a really good movie is that questions the nature of reality? "Thirteenth Floor", directed by Roland Emmerich, with Craig Bierko, Gretchen Mol, Vincent D'onofrio. Intelligent, sexy, stimulating.
