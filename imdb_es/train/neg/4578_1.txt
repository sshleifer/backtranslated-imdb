Another cult attacks again. This is not a spoiler, because the REAL ending comes after you investigate the people who brought this pseudo-scientific infomercial too long ... Ramtha's School of Illumination. <br /> <br /> When any religion / philosophy needs To hide behind a cheating screen like OZ's, I walk away. Thanks to Ramtha, I saw a borrowed copy of this movie on the recommendation of a "friend" ... having wasted precious resources with this New Age lobotomizer would have been tragic. I can only hope that they "really believe they can walk on water" enough to take that guide to its "logical" conclusion ... in other words; walking, drowning ... or shut up :-) As a movie ... it deserves a strong "1" in its entertainment value, especially for creating the most unpleasant character in the history of cinema (the photographer's roommate ... Eeeeeek!). If you must see this movie, borrow it from one of the people who brainwashed it and recommended it.
