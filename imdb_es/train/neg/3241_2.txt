This movie had potential, but what makes it really bad is the performance of Lindsay Crouse. I've never seen her before in anything else and maybe there are some Crouse fans who like her in something else, but her acting in this movie is bad. <br /> <br /> Your presentation is robotic. When he pronounced his lines, he seemed to be trying to make sure he had the correct lines and that he was simply reading the list in his head. Then, his voice has very little inflection. I can not believe that someone so bad at acting has received a leading role in a movie. She has to meet someone in the business. <br /> <br /> Now I hate to be so mean to her, but the comment has to be "this" long and her performance is what stands out more than anything else. <br /> <br /> However, I liked where the story was going, so I continued to look at it. The first part of the script has the ingredients of a good movie. But the end was also disappointing. Maybe if his performance had been better, I would have liked it.
