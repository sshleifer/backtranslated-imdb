A different look to horror. The differences in style between American and Russian films are interesting. However, from my American perspective, this movie was not so good. The protagonist, Marie played by Anastasia Hille was not a pleasant character and I had a hard time identifying with her. She was unpleasant most of the time and was confused for much of the little time she had left. It also took too much time to take her to the main location of the movie. Then it was a long time before there was a real suspense. Once that happened, it seemed that the volume was used as the main effect, which was more annoying than anything else. The concept was more original than most Direct-to-video films and did not use sex to compensate for a thin plot. In general, I would recommend it for rent, but not for theater lovers.
