This movie is outrageous. for outrageous, I mean horrible. I had more fun seeing the dry painting at my local hardware store on a day in August while suffering from a migraine and heat stroke. the performance progressively worsened as the "movie" progressed, and the use of drugs by the directors became evident as the final scenes approached. when misty was shot, she decided it would be prudent to blink after death. That was not smart. honestly, stevie wonder could have captured that with his eyes closed. If you are deciding between playing with a nail gun while you are intoxicated and watching this movie, keep in mind that the nail gun will probably give you a better story to tell your friends.
