The reviews for this film were lukewarm at best, while the expectations were very high: a big budget, a lot of popular faces, a pretty funny idea and a main actress that everyone loves. The final result is a disaster. The supposedly humorous journey of Alice Tremblay in the fantasy world fails in every way to entertain her audience (I did not hear any laughter throughout the presentation), reviewing her story line and the one-dimensional characters without a single spark, not a sign of the magic I wanted to have. The 90 minutes of film here are sterile with a clumsy direction and some good actors do everything possible to be professionals in a show that certainly could not seem such a good idea on set, let alone on paper. 'L'Odyss√©e d'Alice Tremblay' is a collage of comic sketches, linked together with a (very) thin layer of good ideas. Avoid or boredom will chase you.
