"Her Cardboard Lover" is the latest film by Norma Shearer. He resigned from the movies and, I think, joined the MGM Board of Directors. That was a good move on his part. "His cardboard lover" was talky and boring in parts. It was obvious that there were only a handful of actors with oral parts, so they had a lot of dialogue to talk about to keep this turkey afloat. <br /> <br /> The story was a good idea about a wealthy woman (Norma Shearer) who hires a man (Robert Taylor) to make her fiancee playboy (George Sanders) jealous. I am surprised that the director, George Cukor, has not cut many of the scenes of madness between Mrs. Shearer and Mr. Taylor. Mr. Cukor served Mrs. Shearer well in "Women", but not in this movie. <br /> <br /> The best performance in the film was given by Robert Taylor. During Taylor's career, he was given his best comedy roles in this film and "When Ladies Meet" in 1941. In 1942, he gave his best comedy performance in "Her Cardboard Lover" and, until then, his best dramatic performance. in "Johnny Eager". He had a busy year. I think of all the MGM actors, Mr. Taylor worked with all the main and secondary actresses in the lot. In addition, MGM gave Mr. Taylor all kinds of films to make, most of them were successful. That's why MGM kept it for 25 years. <br /> <br /> Mr. George Sanders was very good as a social heel. He played a similar role eight years later in "All About Eve" for which he won an Oscar for a supporting role. As for Ms. Shearer, this was one of her worst performances, it was not funny or dramatic for this comedy. It is strange that she did a great comedy in 1939, "The Women", and gave her best performance. It was obvious that she was too old looking for her younger and more prominent men in "Her Cardboard Lover". Also, it did not help that some of his clothes were horrible. <br /> <br /> Too bad that she and Mr. Taylor did not make another dramatic movie like their last movie together, the excellent "Escape". The same comments about this film can be said of another film, "Personal Property" that Mr. Taylor made in 1937 with Jean Harlow. It was too boring, boring, and the actress looked old. Ms. Harlow was ill throughout the film and no one in Hollywood noticed her telling him to see a doctor, so in 1937, she died at the age of 26. What a waste! She was becoming a good actress and getting better roles.
