I saw this movie when I was much younger and I found it funny. I saw him again last week, and you can guess the result. Some funny parts in it, very few and too long. The beginning is the only thing that is fun if you ask me. <br /> <br /> If you want a total B movie, this is a good option, but do not expect too much from the dwarf aliens.
