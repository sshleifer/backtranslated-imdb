Man To Man strives to be a good film: he has his heart in the right place, he aspires to be epic and he has a message that everyone will undoubtedly appreciate. But some of the problems of this image are also found. He strives to be good and transmit his message, which sometimes the viewer should feel challenged. Therefore, it is only appropriate that the images used in this image are simplistic: Man To Man does not let the viewer decide what he thinks is right, but he is hammering his message into his head. Joseph Fiennes exemplifies this in his role: he does everything possible to appear concerned, genuinely moved and all the other emotions he can express with the only facial expression that his repertoire has to offer. Add that the film is too long and that it loses its speed towards the end, it would be easy to come to the conclusion that Man To Man is not worth watching. But there are enough points to defend it: it is entertaining, it has some humorous scenes and the show I steal from Kristin Scott Thomas. Of course, you should not compare it with humanistic masterpieces like The Elephant Man (David Lynch), but you will be leaving the theater satisfied. Try to grab your heart (even if your brain thinks it's too obvious) and it succeeds most of the time.
