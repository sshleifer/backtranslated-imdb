Although Bette Davis did a WONDERFUL job as Mildred, I felt that the movie was not the best I had seen. At the end of the movie, I was left with the feeling that something was missing. <br /> <br /> Bette Davis did a perfect job, however, it made her hate and pity her all the time. Leslie Howard did it very well as Philip Carey, who loved me so much, and I sympathized throughout the film for being in love with such a horrible lady. It is something so sad when one finds oneself in love with a bad seed. And especially if it's about someone like Philp Carey, who is a sensitive, though pathetic person. <br /> <br /> In the end, the performance was what came up and not the plot. The final scene was particularly good, but I'm not someone to give it away. Although others may think that this movie is good, I also found it. I should recommend this movie to those who like a bad seed so they can see what can happen to them if they fall in love with that horrible person.
