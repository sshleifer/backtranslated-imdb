I agree with most Columbo fans that this movie was an unnecessary format change. Columbo is a unique policeman with unorthodox police methods. This movie seems like a new version of other common detective dramas of the past. And that is the disturbing point, because Columbo is not a common detective. <br /> <br /> There are two parts in this movie that left me intriguing. First of all, I can not figure out the title of this movie. It is deceptive. Maybe a better title would have been "The Missing Bride" or something similar. Second, Columbo hides a piece of evidence without offering the reason (at least to the spectators) why he does it. <br /> <br /> I do not feel betrayed, just disappointed. I'm glad Peter Falk has returned to the usual Columbo. <br /> <br />
