I wanted to love this movie. How could I not love him? Cary Grant, Jayne Mansfield, Stanley Donen; All icons in their own way. However, the train crash that was Suzy Parker ruined the whole experience for me. His performance was so frightening that I sat there with my jaw open, not believing in my eyes or ears. I could barely make it through a view, so horrible is she in this. <br /> <br /> Cary? Beautiful and in good dramatic shape. Jayne? Adorable, endearing, and obviously having a ball. The supporting cast does it well, and the city of San Francisco is captured in all its stunning retro elegance. <br /> <br /> Then you see Suzy Parker trying to talk about his lines with a wood, a death, a lack of idea that simply defies belief. Who told this creature that she could ACT? Oy VEY, people.
