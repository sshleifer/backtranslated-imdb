This movie is a rewrite of Warren Beatty's 1978 film, "Heaven Can Wait," but it is written for the comic style of Mr Rock. The premise remains the same: Lance Barton, (Rock) is taken before the end of his life and makes a deal with the representative of God, Mr. King, to return to earth as another person. As in the Beatty movie; he chooses the murdered Charles Wellington, a rich white man, all because he likes Sontee Jenkins (Regina King) who appears in the Wellington house during the murder. The role of Mrs. Wellington and her lover suffers in this remake and the idea of ​​turning an elderly white billionaire into a black comedian who tries to seduce Sontee simply does not work. Also the intercalations used to show Rock as Wellington and then as the true 'white' Wellington, fail miserably. Improvements could have been made to the original Beatty plot, which in itself did not masterfully reflect the idea of ​​life after death, but certainly could not be found in "Down To Earth".
