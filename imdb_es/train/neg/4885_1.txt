I should have listened. I was warned, and still, I paid money for this, after reading all the reviews, after knowing that the original is "so bad that it's good", and that part 2 does not fit that category at all, even so, still, I could not resist Exactly what happened here? The first part was very funny, had much political imprecision, and another Crazy, Fat Entertainment, and this, there could be a worse sequel in the green earth of God, or in Case 2, hell, not even in Troll 2. This is really the worst sequel to the story and it really says something that takes into account the innovative qualities of the original. Part 2 of Criminally Insane was simply a completely different brand of bad. Recorded on video, zero score, zero entertainment, 1/3 consists of flashbacks of the original, and on top of all that, the crazy and fat Ethel has lost a part of its circumference. I mean, honestly, is this a kind of sick joke? Thank you very much, Nick Milliard. 1/1
