1st seen 5/26/2002 - 4 of 10 (Dir-Michael Almereyda): strange story about a druid witch trying to capture eternity by inheriting the body of her granddaughter. At least I think that was the relationship. Throughout this film a kind of strange quality is carried out, unlike Stephen King's The Shining. The difference is that there was an enthusiasm in the performance of Nicholson that is not at all in this movie. All this is taken very seriously until near the end, when some of the bad words and attempts to clear the mood do not work at all. The performances are not the problem here, but the story is. It does not seem that everything comes together very well and the viewer is left a lot of information and does not really understand what happened in the film. Christopher Walken is the granddaughter's little uncle who, of course, gives him maximum billing in an attempt to sell the movie. Do not buy into this trick and avoid this movie. <br /> <br />
