My wife and I have just finished this movie and I came to IMDb to pity the critics who found this film less than satisfactory. However, of the 10 pages of reviews, only a few are negative. I think this movie is a great concept that is terribly wrong and I want to warn those who are looking to watch the movie in the future. <br /> <br /> I admit that I feel more inspired to write reviews when I do not like a movie than when I do, so my handful of criticisms are all negative. Still, that does not mean that I am predisposed to not enjoy a movie, but I often find more eloquent criticism of films that I do enjoy. <br /> <br /> Paris je t'aime is the most pretentious movie I've seen. I have seen in years. By using an "intelligent" concept and associating some great talents to a couple of WAYS to many short stories, the film ends in the worst of all worlds. It is art for art, but something that a 2 year old could imagine and fulfill. Giving the director a reign of 5 minutes of screen time demonstrates why there is a division of labor even in entertainment. Directors can not write, writers can not direct. (I would also like to include that Clint Eastwood is overrated, but that's because it's an actor in turn, the director (which rarely works)}. <br /> <br /> What ends up on the screen is A confusion of short stories that do not make any sense, do not complete in 5 minutes and, in total, they spoil me Paris, why call it Paris je t'aime when a more appropriate title is cluster f * ck? couple of stories that you can see, especially the piece by Alfonso Cuar√≥n, but everything else will fall in the dark.The Coen brothers short is passable, but can you name a movie of them that does not contain a scene with a guitar It's as if all the directors decided to do what they wanted and chose Paris as the place to do it.As we all like Paris, including the current company, we are blinded by the fact that this movie SUCK. they put the names of the directors in each of the short films because the directors saw how poor this film is and decided to make sure that they were only blamed for their 5 minutes. Seriously. SERIOUSLY. <br /> <br /> People, Natalie Portman is NOT a good actress. She is not a dreamy girl who hopes to be yours. And Maggie Gyllenhaal, why? Are you acting or simply regurgitating performances of other films? I'm watching you Natalie Portman (Garden State, Closer), Elijah Wood (Sin City) and Catalina Sandino Moreno (Maria Full of Grace). <br /> <br /> One last comment on the performance: I give double Congratulations to Nick Nolte for acting and looking more human than you have done in years or maybe you will do it again. Find his short on YouTube since his 5 minutes are quite nice. <br /> <br /> Writing stories is very difficult and only a handful of authors have understood it well. I'm thinking of Ernst Hemingway, Raymond Carver, F. Scott Fitzgerald and John Cheever, just to name a few. It is much more difficult than writing a complete novel and only the truly talented can achieve this. The same can be said of the short films. It seems that only one director will live in the annals of history. <br /> <br /> If you defend Paris as a jewel to discover and reflect through your own lenses with your own story, then do not wait. Enjoy this movie at all. The directors did not care or were lazy. In either case, by the time you are reading this, it means that you rented it. I praise you because you did not pay 10 dollars a head in theaters for that.
