I'm not a fan of horror movies, but my wife's nieces and nephews do. Then, I saw the first movie. It was frightening and tense, but not my taste. Still, good. For similar reasons, at this very moment, I am being exposed to a sequel. <br /> <br /> The premise itself is more than absurd. I can buy that disasters happen in the desert. I can buy that there are mutants. I can even buy that the events are so strange for the military to decide to get involved. It is unlikely, yes, but I am willing to suspend my belief. <br /> <br /> HOWEVER, under no circumstances am I willing to believe that the military squad assigned for the recognition of such an area can not defend the mutants. Being a member of the United States Army, I can assure you that while the new recruits may lack the experienced eyes and experience of combat soldiers, these recruits will be integrated into a capable squad. <br /> <br /> A squad of armed The soldiers are not about to be taken out by a few mutants with knives. Is that how it works. The squadron movements, the much higher firepower and, of course, the radio support, would guarantee nothing less than total victory. I'm not saying you would not have casualties, but as soon as the area was verified as hostile, military training would have priority, nobody would go to the bathroom alone. <br /> <br /> And if it were discovered that the area was so infested with hostiles that the squadron was unable to handle the danger, they would send radio for backup. And believe me, your radios would not get stuck, if there was a possibility that normal radios would not work, the squad would have a satellite phone with a military problem. It is likely that, if they could not register every hour, a search will be conducted. <br /> <br /> In order to accept this film, you must accept that our soldiers are incompetent fools, with incompetent leaders and an incompetent chain of command. While it may be true that the most dangerous thing in the world is a lieutenant with a map and a compass, our military forces are full of intelligent, well-trained and competent soldiers. The mutants with knives are far below our ability to treat. <br /> <br /> With all the execution of the film depending solidly on the impossible to imagine, the film is not delivered. Instead, we are expected to believe that our soldiers, sailors and aviators are unable to deal with the most mediocre threats. <br /> <br /> As a combat veteran, I find the film insulting.
