(Avast, little spoilers ahead) I received this tape from my local library, which keeps a copy for obvious reasons. <br /> <br /> I once went to the city of Matewan, West Virginia, and in a small museum there. I saw the schedule of the citra municipal theater in May 1954. The films would change in the theater every day. Since there would be no television for a decade or so in those parts, this was a lot of the entertainment available in the city. "The assault" seems to have been done for cities like Matewan in the 1950s. Although it was not on the list for that month, I'm sure it showed up there on a Monday or a Tuesday night for an audience that probably was not too demanding. The historic incursion, bold and remarkably successful, does not seem to have been well researched, so the film is full of Hollywood ornaments, including a loose cannon played by Lee Marvin. Marvin takes the opportunity to practice being Liberty Valance. And it seems that St. Albans had more Yankee soldiers coming and going through the city than Washington DC. <br /> <br /> What really made me laugh was when the assailants changed into their Confederate uniforms. Only in the nuances of the Civil War, rebel uniforms look so pristine. When Anne Bancroft's son catches Van Heflin in his uniform just before the raid, he expected the boy to think it was Halloween. <br /> <br /> And then there's Anne Bancroft herself. While watching the movie, I actually looked at the IMDb to see if there was a second Anne Bancroft. The then actress hired in the studio is nothing like her later films, and does not have the presence she would later have in "The Miracle Worker", "Agnes of God" and, of course, "The Graduate". <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing if only 1). You live in St. Albans and 2). You have a couple of hours to kill in a Hollywood fiction of the most important story of your hometown.
