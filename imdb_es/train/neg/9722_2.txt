I really did not like this movie ... mainly because of the main characters! Both are immature, selfish and self-centered people. They hurt ALL of them around playing their silly game. The visual effects were good, but what good are they if there are no characters that you connect with or an interesting story line? Am I supposed to be happy when these two psychic people FINALLY consummate their mutual love? <br /> <br /> After watching this movie, I was thinking: "Is this supposed to be France's No. 1 success?" ........ <br /> <br /> * spoiler * <br /> <br /> Regarding the end: GOOD RIDDANCE! Both deserve each other! <br /> <br />
