How is it possible that no journalist or critic reminded us of the similarity with that other Flemish film "Congo Express (1986)"? There are also some characters in Congo Express together without really having a relationship between them: Jean, (from Congolees), the worker, the two taxi drivers, the street singer, Roger, Guy, Lucienne and Gilbert. Of course, Tom Barman is a star and Luc Gubbels was not. That should not be a reason to forgive the flaws in the script (if there is a script) anyway, the wind blows. The joke (the only one!) In the party on the ice in the refrigerator comes from the great Flemish film "De Witte (1934)" where De Witte is putting too much salt in the potatoes. Some accidents happen in the movie, but there is no explanation later. Tom Barman gives us here a film that is more like an experiment to see on television than a movie for theaters. Another missed opportunity for flamenco cinema.
