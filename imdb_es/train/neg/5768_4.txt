Well, at first I was excited to download an animated open source movie, but it ruined a demonstration roll. The animation is excellent, lip syncing is horrible, and you keep watching the movie in the hope of understanding what is happening, only to realize that nothing is happening. You do not feel emotion for the characters, only pity for the creators for wasting time. I've seen short films with twice the excitement in half the time! This could have been an excellent short film, if they had taken the time to hire a real director. I'm sure everyone at Blender is excited to show their software and their representation capabilities, but what makes a story is what a movie does.
