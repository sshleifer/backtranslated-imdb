First of all, let me start with a quote that a friend of mine said while watching this movie: "This whole movie had to have been a challenge, you know, like, 'DOUBT, I WANT I CAN NOT MAKE THE WORST MOVIE OF EVERYONE'" . With this movie, they have made a good effort to achieve that title. The effects are, of course, poor. The plot / dialogue is like a collage of fragments stolen from all B horror movies ever made. The actors, I suppose, are supposed to be in the university. However, some parts (especially at the beginning) make it look like they are supposed to be in high school or high school. Has no sense. The scarecrow circling around killing people is not at all pleasant. (SPOILER: In the end, when they chant Lester's name and he reappears, the black man and the Scarecrow are laughing, probably for relief in their last scene, and in the cheesy dialogue).
