I think this movie was supposed to be shocking. But the only way it's really shocking is how shocking it has been ... and it just is. It's an hour and a half of torment. More so for the viewer than for the characters in the movie (the five girls). <br /> <br /> Surely the main characters get their bloody piece in a bad way, which is basically fine, since it's a horror. movie. And I (normally) like horror movies. I do not have any problem with violence in this type of movies per se. However, all the violence in this movie has no end at all. It is not another show more than that, it is simply grotesque. It's so boring that it even gets boring, and really fast too. <br /> <br /> The worst thing (if the above was not bad enough for you) about this movie is that they tried to copy the Blair Whitch Project, filming with cheap handheld cameras. But (again, this too) has no purpose at all. In the "Blair Which", of course, there is an explanation, namely that they are with a camera looking for the witch Blair. In this film, there is no other explanation other than: "Hey, we wanted to SEE AS ​​THE Blair Whitch!" The sound in the movie is also something to be depressed. The girls scream so hysterically that many times you can not understand what they say. Also, no effort has been made to make something better, in terms of sound or otherwise. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is the soundtrack, which is as bad as the rest and varies according to the cheap euro. home to the worst dirty hard rock ... <br /> <br /> My advice: Do not look at this under ANY circumstance.
