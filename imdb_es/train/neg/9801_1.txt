I remember that this show was on television when I was a kid in the early 1990s, and there was a rage for kids with dumb leotards doing kung fu to each other and riding on plastic dinosaurs. It was called power rangers. I remember that young children would stick to each other and then T-shirts and things from the program were banned in many school districts across the country because this program taught the children how to fight each other to resolve their differences. <br /> <br /> I never really thought of this as a show, especially when better shows like The Tick were playing on Fox Kids. Most older teens always looked at the ranger in a ridiculous and disdainful way, and it is not hard to ask why. The images are ridiculous at best. The colorful ranger costumes look like things you would work with and the dinosaurs look like plastic nonsense. Then you get into acting, and of course those really ridiculous haircuts. All the boys run around with earrings, half of them wear mullets from the 90s, and they always wear the same clothes every day, and then they change into leotards using ranger. <br /> <br /> The toys are also especially ridiculous, and it was the joke of many evening show hosts. And, of course, two of the worst films that have ever been made, and I mean that two of the worst movies that have been made were based on this program with almost all the critics destroying both films, and the programs in which they based. /> Power Rangers is nothing more than a bad TV commercial for the marketing of especially bad toys. As an adult, I do not see him with affection, but rather as another shame of the children's shows of 1990, the fashion and earrings of men.
