Of course, I'm not the connoisseur of horror that is my partner, but a good combination is worth it. My questions, in summary: <br /> <br /> - The dialogue is often weak and, sometimes, incredible, comes from the given character. <br /> <br /> - Unconvincing acting. <br /> <br /> - History never really caught fire. <br /> <br /> The writers selected fragments of choice from half a dozen mainstream films, threw them into a kettle, did not simmer enough and tried to feed the poor taking the resulting disaster , al'dente. <br /> <br /> Long and short, although it's not quite terrible, it definitely was not worth absorbing one of my NetFlix rentals.
