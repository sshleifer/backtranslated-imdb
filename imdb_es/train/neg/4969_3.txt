First of all, this is not as bad as the rest of the trash that the Sci-Fi Channel has produced; That does not mean that Grendel is a good movie, in fact, it's very bad, but it definitely has the potential to be much better. The shortcomings of the film come from the design of characters, characters, absurd additions to the story, visual effects, music, and for the most part: acting. <br /> <br /> When talking about character design, I, of course, means the way our heroes and villains look. Beowulf and the other Danes seem ridiculous Vikings, instead of brute force warriors: the helmet that our protagonist wears is too stupid. Grendel looks like Hulk but with strange tentacles on his elbows. <br /> <br /> The characters are very limited. Beowulf is the same from start to finish, however, Finn, a useless companion, achieved some bidimensionality, thanks to his romantic subplot, and Unferth also has a certain notion, since it becomes less presumptuous. <br /> <br /> Like Finn, there are useless additions to this story to make it yours, while maintaining the source material. The crossbow that is awarded to Beowulf is so ridiculous, I am surprised that the plaster has not left the set. In addition to the additions, there are omissions, such as the underlying themes of Christianity and paganism, as well as the consequences of lying. <br /> <br /> Special effects are terribly terrible. Grendel and her mother Hag are ill-conceived, and as such, their interpretation on the screen is less than credible. <br /> <br /> Music is dominant, especially when a character dies. <br /> <br /> In short, this is not the worst science fiction movie to date. No. Actually, it's one of the best movies, although the trash still is, it's a good rubbish, so it's a guilty pleasure at best. The only thing that works is the dialogue, which is still made of wood here and there. <br /> <br /> I recommend you skip this movie and see Robert Zemeckis Beowulf's old story, simply because this movie (Grendel) is only half the story, and not all, which gives him this movie a review of three stars.
