The Broadway success of Ira Levin comes to the screen with almost no flesh in her bones, a mysterious plot with only a few tricks and twists, but nobody is worth worrying about. The frustrated writer Michael Caine plans to steal the work of a brilliant young man and pass it on as his own; his devious plan may include murdering the talented child, who holds Caine's flying wife in his arms. The first act in which everyone shows up is terribly dead, with Caine doing everything an actor can do to keep pace. Dyan Cannon is a villain as his wife (she is too smart and intelligent to be interpreted as a ditz) and Christopher Reeve (in the middle part of the film) seems extremely uncomfortable in the role of the best writer. These three characters, and the annoying neighbor of Irene Worth, are so undefined that what happens after the setup is barely recorded until long after the second act has begun. The direction of Sidney Lumet is stagy and fuzzy, the design of the set is not convincing and is poorly lit, and the end is a total disaster. The actors struggle to give something of importance to the script, but with so little material, all we see are their laborious efforts. * 1/2 of ****
