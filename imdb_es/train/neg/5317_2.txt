For the first 20 minutes or so (I was watching it on a PS2, so I really have no idea how long it took) Alienator sets an interesting premise. I do not think I've seen a slasher movie with an extraterrestrial from another planet like the bad guy before. However, the interest soon turns into a stunned disbelief, since you realize that the "alien" is a huge bodybuilder in a steel bikini. Yes, Alienator is obviously ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Do not think I'm against that. In the world of shlock-horror, ridicule can be a good sign. However, the blatant stupidity of his premise is all that the film really has going for him. Alienator is fun as hell, but it is also a shambolic suckfest of the highest order. The actors pile up before the unsuccessful attempts of seriousness, the potentially great lines of the dialogue of the pure cheese are met with a disconcerting incompetence and the direction does not summarize not even one or two decent pieces. When the movie is over, you can barely see the original concept through the pile of guts the team accumulated. <br /> <br /> Add to this the fact that the "Alien" simply kills people by vaporizing them. instead of doing any "clipping" as such and you have a lot of good giant ideas that are rotting. You will laugh at Alienator, but ATENT, not with that. If that's your thing, then go and take a look.
