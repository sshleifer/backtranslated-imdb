The images of Republic arrive late in the game to the genre "werewolf" and the genre Werecat. The plot has a writer who returns to Paris after a long trip abroad during which he developed the fear of the jungle during which he had blackouts. He is coming to great success as his novel that parallels an infamous essay is a bestseller. The French government wants to know if it had access to secret documents, something that seems more likely when an officer is killed by a "cat man". Suspicion really falls on the writer when his fianc√© ends up dead. What complicates things is the return of the blackouts, so the writer does not know if he is the killer or not. <br /> <br /> Well, the thriller is too pleasant to be enjoyed completely. There are too many musical numbers from the beginning and too much downtime when things are spoken in the middle and later sections. The acting is fine and the stages are pretty good, but there is a reason why most people I know only remember the killer with a top hat, it is the most interesting thing in this movie. despite its short execution time (just over an hour), I think the reason why this movie was seen on television on a few occasions was that after 20 minutes you began to lose patience with it. As good as the conversation is, I just wanted someone to do something. When it finally happened, in the last few minutes, it was too little too late ... Take a pass.
