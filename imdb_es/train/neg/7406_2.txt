Well, how was he supposed to know that this was "the" fool's ass "Lordi Motion Picture"? I mean, I realized this when the "dinosaur" costume appeared and by the time the lead singer made his appearance I was humming "Hard Rock Hallelujah" for me ... although I hate that song. "Dark Floors" is about an autistic young woman who is in the process of being taken out of the hospital by her father over protector when they, and the rest of the people in that particular elevator, are momentarily trapped ... When they arrive on their floor it is A surprise to find that there is no one else around. The hospital is empty ... Except for a variety of monsters that seem to be stalking them for no apparent reason ... They run down the corridors and stairs, finding all the members of the heavy metal band in their extravagant surprise. - rock outfits ... Nothing really memorable here, except the bad acting, the lack of blood and nudity, and the totally brazen promotional edge, which reminds me a lot of "KISS Meet the Phantom of the Park". Yes, do you remember that? I wish I had not done it ... I would just recommend avoiding all these Ghost House movies like a mushroom and not listening to Lordi as they are a Gwar scam band!
