A good big guy falls in love with a delicious blonde; She also likes it, but not for the reasons you might think. The little black comedy of the writer Pat Proft presents very good performances by Joe Alaskey and Donna Dixon, but it does not have a lasting impact. It's just a quick, disposable effort, led by Norman Bates himself, Anthony Perkins. Even at the level of comedies B, something like "Eating Raoul" is a better bet. There is definitely a fun setup here; unfortunately, the image has nowhere to go in its second act. An interesting attempt, but it fails. <br /> <br /> ** of ****
