Although I recently put this on my list of the 10 worst movies, I must say it's probably no worse than Burt Reynolds in "The Maddening" or in any of the sequels of "Look Who's Talking." Still, it's pretty nauseating, even with the sexy Drew Barrymore playing a horror movie response to Holly Golightly, who moved from New York City to Los Angeles, but discovered she's being harassed for a homicidal aspect. Poor Sally Kellerman, a peculiar actress of great success in the 70s, is here reduced to an insignificant supporting role, and Barrymore's protagonist, George Newbern, is the worst kind of comedian, always pausing to laugh afterwards. each line. The image is great, but the bloody Drew rain scene boasts of skill for the show, and the identity of the psychopath (although fresh out of an episode of "Scooby Doo") is interesting. But as for the end ... become real! Who had to clean up that mess? * since ****
