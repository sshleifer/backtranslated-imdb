In this short, an urban man and his wife have their strange lives put in check when the man puts on the suit of an old red trousers of his mother-in-law. <br /> <br /> I kept seeing this in the hope that I could see why it had been done, or why the other reviewers found it funny. For me it was a total waste of time. <br /> <br /> Not all tastes are the same, but this clearly was not mine.
