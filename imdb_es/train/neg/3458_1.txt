I'm usually not motivated to write reviews. But this movie was so terribly painful that I feel I should do it. I cringed at the terribly predictable plot, the lame acted and I laughed at times that were supposed to be tense. In fact, most of the audience seemed quite bored and talkative even at the "most tense" moment of the movie. Molly Ringwald stood out as the only performance of any merit in a tortured production. Even the "turn" in the end was not. I have heard that the film was not taken seriously; but I could find little evidence of that in the movie. <br /> <br /> The cut should have been left on the floor of the cutting room. Do yourself a favor and spend your time and money on something else!
