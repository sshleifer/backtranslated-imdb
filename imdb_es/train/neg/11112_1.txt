Wow, how bad can it be. This was very bad. Not in terms of the gore, which was mainly CGI laughing, but in the acting, the atmosphere and the direction. <br /> <br /> The story was terrible, the character arc of the main character was a total joke. A few nights after harassing Vinnie Jones, he begins to "torment" himself to the point of crying when photographing his girlfriend. Are all New York photographers so childish, suggestive and weak? The development of his character had absolutely no justification or any point, and in the end you will laugh out loud at the wholly predictable and totally absurd twist his character takes. <br /> <br /> The bloody moments were clearly a weak and little self-esteem effort to jump to the modern MTV-style GTV: all cgi, blood and yet no real emotion. These parts were involuntarily fun, and distracted by their self-consciousness, extravagant camera angles, etc. <br /> <br /> In general, this film commits the crime of blowing up another potential idea. What the atmosphere might have had (until the stupid monsters at the end) was ruined in favor of 'looking at me' in the self-conscious style of direction. This film was not made for an audience, but for a CV, a deeply selfish motive.
