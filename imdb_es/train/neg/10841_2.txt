It was everything it was not: it had rhythm, pop and actors who were not afraid to chew the stage. I also had a decent script. This one was scratching my head. If Farrah is not really "serious" about a career, why does she have a manager (and why is she wasting time)? If Kate and Barney are "artists," why do they sign up for The Mother of All Jiggle Shows (like the movie "Brady Bunch" where Robert Reed wants to make Shakespeare, only to find himself in BB)? They were not names of the industry, but neither were they starving. And while they achieved the right story (the poster was published before Farrah got the show), Silverman rejected the releases of "Funniest Home Videos" and "American Idol" and Spelling promised his baby Tori that someday he would create a show to She, obviously. it did not happen <br /> <br /> What bothered me was how the role of Spelling is distorted. He shows himself as the show-runner and creator when he was neither one nor the other. And how "it occurred to him" the "idea" for CA was ridiculous! <br /> <br /> How were Spelling and Goldberg allowed to enforce Farrah's oral contract when the others were signed? And why did not Farrah or Bernstein tell them he was leaving, because he discovered his Internal Diva, but why Majors wanted him to do it? This is the reason why, when she tries to create conflict and tension by establishing Farrah as the "bad girl" (like Suzanne Somers), she fails because the bases were never laid, that's where the photo of the "Company" was published. of three".
