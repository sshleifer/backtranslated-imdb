Although I certainly consider The Exorcist a horror classic, I must admit that I do not consider it as tall as many other horror fans. As a result of that, I have not seen many of The Exorcist scams, and if the Exorcism is something to pass, I have to say it's a good thing since this movie is boring and not worth spending. ninety minutes in it! To be fair to the other exorcist swindlers, it is often considered one of the worst, and perhaps it was not the best place to start. It is not difficult to guess what the plot will be: basically it is the same as in The Exorcist and sees a girl possessed by a demonic spirit (which is the spirit of her dead father). The village priest is called to perform the exorcism. Like many Spanish horror films, this one is starring Paul Naschy, which is the best of the film. The exorcism was directed by Juan Bosch, who previously directed the Spanish derivative Giallo 'The Killer Wore Gloves'. I have not seen any of his other films, but based on these two: I think originality was not one of his strengths. There are not many good things I can say about the film itself; For the most part, only heavy progress is made and the exorcism scene is not worth waiting for. I certainly do not recommend it!
