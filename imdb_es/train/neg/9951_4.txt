Johnny and Jeremy are kind of vampires. Except the fangs, of course. They are dark and bitter creatures who have nothing better to do than spread their own misery. Through their charms (namely, a sharp tongue and a fat wallet, respectively) seduce the desperate souls, whom they proceed to torment and victimize. That is more or less the basis of this black comedy, as I understand it. <br /> <br /> It's not a mixture of black humor that I can easily subscribe to, partly because it bothers me to imagine the audience encouraging the audience. Sleazy, main character. However, I enjoyed the sound and melody of the quick-fire comments (and supposedly very clever). I was very impressed by the strong performance of the cast, particularly David Thelis; Only Jeremy's character seemed too two-dimensional. Photography and music, both dramatic and somber, work very well together. <br /> <br /> What really disappoints me about "Nude" (and the main reason why I would never recommend it to anyone) is the way in which it repeatedly seems to present misogyny as a valid way of venting anguish. In other words, in a world that sucks so much, what difference does it make if one inflicts some pain on girls, right? Suggest (as some have on this website) that Johnny is not such an unpleasant person because he is not as rough with girls as Jeremy, it seems completely absurd to me. Both are terrible, unpleasant people. And they are particularly interested in hurting women whenever they have an opportunity. You could argue that Johnny finally gets what he deserves, as if his bad karma suddenly turned back and bit him in the ass. But still, his sadistic behavior and that of Jeremy are treated to some extent as a matter of laughter. And I could be wrong, but I guess most people who love this movie also find that aspect of the movie very funny.
