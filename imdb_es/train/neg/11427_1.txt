I do not know who Sue Kramer is, the director of this film, but I strongly suspect that A) she is a lesbian and B) somehow she embarrassed everyone involved in this project to participate to prove they are not homophobic. <br /> <br /> I can imagine everyone thinking: "My God, this is horrible, it's not funny, it's pedestrian, I'm totally lame." But keeping your mouth shut for fear of being labeled as anti-gay or "do not understand" the gay lifestyle. (Probably, this is the reason why Kramer did NOT choose homosexual people to interpret them as homosexual people). Anyway, it's not even worth checking. All actors are directed to reproduce all scenes completely above, so there is no sincerity or credibility in anything they do. It is full of clich√©s and there is nothing in this movie that is the most fun, much less fun. <br /> <br /> I hated it and I'm not afraid to say it. Too bad the ruthless people who gave Kramer the money to make this bomb were not so impartial in his trial.
