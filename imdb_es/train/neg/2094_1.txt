I had to endure the anguish in high school and family conflict for almost the entire show. I really do not care about high school girls who care about their relationships. I have spent my time in hell dealing with such problems and I am not worried that fictitious teenagers go through "small" versions of the horrors I endured. I want science fiction. That is the only reason why I am here. There were a few seconds of science fiction at the end of the program. FINALLY we see a proto-cylon. It was good but with a problem. His red dot in the eye would be fixed on an object of interest. We all know that Cylon's eyedots always scan from one place to another, giving the machine a map of the world. The red dot of the eye never stops moving from one side to the other. <br /> <br /> I really hope the writers will solve this abuse before the second episode.
