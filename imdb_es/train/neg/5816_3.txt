From the acclaim of the critics, I expected more from this film and from Tamara Jenkins. The story just meandered and did not seem to have a point or a plot. And I find it hard to believe that a 14-year-old girl (mature for her age or not) would be so upset by the loss of her "with" virginity. Maybe I'm too young to relate (I was four years old in 1976), but I had no problem connecting with the stories of Shakespeare in Love or Life is Beautiful and I was not alive in any of those scenarios. The cast is very good, but unfortunately for them the script did not allow them to get involved with the audience. In general, Slums had his moments, but unless he is willing to recall the blouses and tube socks, I would say that he skips this one.
