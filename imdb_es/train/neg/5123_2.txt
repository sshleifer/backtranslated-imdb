It is interesting how 90% of the high vote reviews are composed of "* random username *" from "United States" (no state pride?) That say more or less exactly the same with the same grammatical style and all with the same complete lack of taste in the movies. I would like to delve deeper into this suspicious trend, but unfortunately, this is a review of the film, and not the criticism itself. <br /> <br /> Let me start by saying that I am a Christian film and an authentic avid one. fan. This means that I have seen many films, from good to bad, and I can affirm with all my heart that Facing The Giants is not, in fact, a good movie. It has good intentions, but it does not meet many (if any) basic standards that I associate with a quality cinematographic experience. <br /> <br /> The performance: mostly terrible, acceptable at best. To hear that most of the volunteers were apparently volunteers does not surprise me at all. <br /> <br /> The Dialogue: Clumsy, cheesy, the script appears as a long version of some corny work that you would see performed in the Sunday School or youth. group function. The Rave Review Robots revel in the absence of "meaningless words", but the truth is that those words are part of the real world, and the total absence of it is palpable. Let's say that the head coach of a team in a State Championship game would have much more to say than "OH NO!" When things do not go your way. <br /> <br /> The argument: surprisingly predictable. It has been commented that this movie "is not a Hollywood clich√©" and yet, it is as if it had been taken directly from Making An Underdog Sports Movie For Dummies (including the almost romantic obligatory secondary plot for the ladies) and only had one Christian theme. The coat of paint slapped him. I am not lying or showing off when I say that I had almost all the important details, both in the plot and in the secondary plot, fixed immediately at the beginning. Only someone who has never seen a decent sports movie in their entire life would be emotionally moved by the story presented here. <br /> <br /> The Directing / Editing: It was also modeled almost exactly after the generic Underdog Sports. Movie template Still, acting on one side, there were not many notorious errors, so at least Frente a los Gigantes was technically competent. <br /> <br /> The Message: Ask Jesus and He will grant all your wishes. A part of me hoped that this film would end in the eventual defeat of the team to really emphasize the part of "If we lose, we praise you", because in the real world, you will fail at one time or another and it is good to be prepared for that. But in the world of Facing the Giants, if you fail, it is clear that someone has screwed up or is cheating. Another interesting question is, what would happen if the Eagles met another team that had acquired religion? Would they be trapped in endless miraculous plays and last-minute saves, or would the universe simply have exploded? <br /> <br /> The Bottom Line: for the staunch and conservative crowd of Christian Parents who lament the evils of Hollywood, Facing The Giants will be another mediocre Christian movie to stand on a pedestal as the preferred model for the modern . make movies For everyone else, the effects range from boredom to a burning desire to be watching something else. And a warning: any attempt to show this to non-Christians will not lead to conversion, but to mockery. I give these two stars, one for the scene that did not roll my eyes and one for the basic technical competence with a low budget.
