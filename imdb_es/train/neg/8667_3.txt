This looks a good and deep cast, but for a thriller is better to offer more than naming actors and talks. The first third of this movie was just talking, and more talking. Most of that was a group of women who complained about everything to each other. <br /> <br /> The first five actors listed here are women, so check that it really is a "movie for girls" and little else. This is probably played on the Lifetime network. <br /> <br /> There was a quick scene of murder and then more conversations. Halfway through, they had lost me. <br /> <br /> By the way, Sally Field seemed to be about 15 years old here.
