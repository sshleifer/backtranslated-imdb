I saw it for the first time when I was about 7. I remembered what I thought was a vague outline of what happened. It turns out that, 15 years later, I remembered everything with great precision because it seems that the writers never went beyond making a summary of the story. There is no argument for this movie / caricature. There is no character development, no background story, no character arcs, nothing. The good do things because they are good, while the bad do things just because they are bad. A part without hilarious grace is when someone dies who you think is important and nobody cares in the least. They just shrug and move on. There is hardly any dialogue either. If you cut out the fight scenes and the scenes in execution, you lose 70% of the movie. <br /> <br /> Look at this because you want to see a good animation and for no other reason. Or if you like to look at hot cartoon girls with little clothes (or hot cartoon types with little clothes).
