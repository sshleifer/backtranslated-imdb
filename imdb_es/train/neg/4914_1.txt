I love a good love story (and I'm a boy) but when I rented "Love Story" I prayed that the ending would come as quickly and painlessly as possible and just the opposite for the character of Ali McGraw. <br /> <br /> Ali McGraw as Jenny was alienated and irritated by me in the first 15 minutes. When we found out that she had been diagnosed with a life-threatening illness, I could not help but wonder if her death would be such a terrible loss to poor Oliver or if someone watching this movie would care. If she had not died, her overwhelming personality would probably have pushed Oliver to the limit and finally brought them to the divorce court. <br /> <br /> People love this movie, but it's one of the worst of the 70s.
