Actually, when it comes to that, this movie is not funny. Josh Kornbluth is the antithesis of the funny, and yet he thinks it's funny. The plot about sending the 17 letters was fine at first, until Josh's "Look at me, I'm crazy" approach started to infest each and every scene. The joke of Judas Priest may have been the least fun thing I've been aware of, and that's quite significant, as it has a tough competition from all the other jokes in the movie. And as for the incredible use of "Debaser" by the Pixies, I only have one thing to say: What did the Pixies do to deserve a destination like this? What did someone do to Josh Kornbluth to write / direct / produce / star in such a terrible film?
