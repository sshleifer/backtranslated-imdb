The subject seems pretty outdated today. Adapted for TV from Rona Jaffe's book; We stumbled and stumbled upon a fantasy existence. Four college students are deeply involved in playing a live version of the board game Mazes and Dragons (based on Dungeons and Dragons). A player, a young Tom Hanks, enters the fantasy world too deep. His playmates must come to his aid and save him from self-inflicted damage. <br /> <br /> David Wallace, Wendy Crewson and Chris Makepeace complete the game quartet. The cast of support consists of veteran actors such as Murray Hamilton, Vera Miles, Anne Francis and Susan Strasberg. <br /> <br /> On this date, it seems to be heavy and docile. But the highlight of seeing it is to see Tom Hanks between his days of salads of "Bosom Buddies" and his great touch in SPLASH on the silver screen. The younger viewer will enjoy it to the fullest.
