This could be a strong candidate for "The Worst Flick Ever." Perhaps without the presence of John Hurt, it could be tolerated as a children's film. However, the TRAGEDY of all this effort, is that John Hurt, one of the best actors on the screen, diminishes himself in this ... I gave him two points just because Mr. Hurt SHOWED UP ... I take FAR 8 points, because it did not escape fast enough. As for the rest of the cast, they are simply terrible. Janine Turner, however beautiful she may be, can not act to save her soul. And the main actor is, for all intents and purposes, horrible. If you can save this embarrassment, please do so. It's so bad, it almost hurts.
