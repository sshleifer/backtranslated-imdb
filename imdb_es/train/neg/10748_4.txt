Nothing to say, but wow! Has anyone really had someone who snuck into them in an open field? Well, this happens about 25 times in this movie (clearly the director's favorite scare tactics). In one of the initial scenes, the producer of soft speech / hot shot has to travel in the back seat so that the cameraman can sit in the front to shoot. Shortly after reaching the field, the 5 contestants appear and, although it is clearly at 2 o'clock in the afternoon, everyone is convinced that the sun will set at any time. After about 30 minutes of garbage without privileges, we have the privilege of remembering the story of the clown in which we see some of his previous victims. If you see this movie, take a look at the chest of the ladies ... their ribs reach up to the neck, it was disgustingly disgusting. Most horror movies happen during the night, but without a night vision camera, chaos is forced to happen during the day. The few nocturnal shots that came to the film seem to have been stolen from the Blair Witch Project or random shots from the directors' backyard. In the end, the film redeemed itself when there was a matrix like that of a shooting with the clown that we rewind and we observe again and again laughing hysterically. <br /> <br /> We ALWAYS RENT THIS MOVIE IF WE HAVE ALREADY DONE AT AN OPEN FIELD. <br /> <br /> SIGNED, THE ANSWER
