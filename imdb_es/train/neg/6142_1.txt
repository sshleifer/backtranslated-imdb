Gymkata is undoubtedly one of the worst movies that have been made. But not the bad kind of bad movies. This is so horrible that it's fun to look and laugh. Kurt Thomas clearly does not have a lucrative acting career. I should go back to gymnastics. But who can forget such memorable scenes as the high bar with chalk, the stone knob or the five minute chase scene through the town of the crazy people in slow motion. I do not think he was meant to be so bad, but who can say it. It's not art, but if you want something light and fluffy to make a good conversation, rent gymakta. He does it for a night of fun.
