The horror movie about a good suburban family that deals with the death of their parents and the "thing" in the basement that continues to feed the people they pick up from the street is just fine. Of course, there is something more than that, but saying more would be interesting. <br /> <br /> For me, this did not come together because it tries to have it in two ways, as much as a family drama as a horror. movie. The film tries very hard to walk to the vanguard between the two genres, but it seems more tripping on all sides as it tries to be shocking, something that never really is. It does not help that the final revelation is less of a scare than an "oh", as in "Oh, that's all?" Maybe if I had not been watching so many horror movies recently, this could have been better or I might have looked like it since I would not have compared it to that much. <br /> <br /> I would take a pass
