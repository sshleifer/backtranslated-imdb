This is definitely a stupid movie, in bad taste. Eddie Murphy stars in what is written as a sitcom. He is surrounded by his perfect family, full of good family values. If you are looking for politically correct entertainment, this movie is for you. But if you hate the idea of ​​being the only one who does not laugh at obscene jokes in a movie theater full of pop-corn addicts, just run away.
