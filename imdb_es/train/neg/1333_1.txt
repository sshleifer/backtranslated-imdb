I was completely disappointed in this movie. I had read some of the other comments here and had much higher expectations. I expected a drama with more intense character development. But that never happens in the movie. Daniel-Day Lewis is a good actor, but not as good as some critics would make us believe here. I told him he repeated the same set of 4 or 5 movements in the movie. I would rate your performance 6 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Acting: 6 out of 10 The address is 5 out of 10. The script is the worst: 2 out of 10. <br /> <br /> I deleted the movie from my DVR at 70 minutes. in the movie Much better movies out there than this ...
