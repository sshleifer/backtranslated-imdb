This is a complete Hoax ... <br /> <br /> The film was clearly shot in the state of Rajasthan, in northwestern India. Look at the scene of the chase - the vehicles are Indian; The writing is in Hindi, language used in India. The road through is in the typical streets of Jaipur. In addition, the palace is in Amer, about 16 km from Jaipur, Rajasthan. The filmmakers in his (about the movie) DVD Bonus seem to believe that they risked their lives filming in Kabul and its surroundings. Almost all of his action scenes are shot in India. The scene in which they see a group singing around the fire is so false that they did not even think about changing it to the popular song of Afghanistan. They just recorded the popular song of Rajasthan. How do I know because I have traveled that area extensively? They are only in the band's car to make big on the subject. I challenge the filmmakers to deny it.
