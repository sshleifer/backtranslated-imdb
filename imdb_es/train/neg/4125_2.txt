My God! What a terrible, terrible Spanish thriller! I've had it for about four years and finally I started it the other night. I saw an hour or so before going to bed. I was pretty intrigued by the whole thing. I finished it last night and I could not believe where I stopped it the night before. Literally, I stopped him the second before the movie was completely downhill. <br /> <br /> As I said, I was quite intrigued and curious about where this mystery was going but I stopped it just as Simon receives the package at the bar. I picked up when he opens the package to reveal a laser gun and then plays a "threatening" game of laser tag. Phew! So, the great revelation is that everything is a terrorist plot by role-playing nerds. PHEW! It can be said that the Spanish industry was definitely behind the director Mateo Gil (co-author of the two previous great successes of Amenabar). There is an excellent score and a great photograph. But this scenario stinks of nonsense. How someone sat for the last 40 minutes with a serious face overcomes me.
