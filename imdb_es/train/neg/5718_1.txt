There was no characterization in this film and it really shows how much you need this talentless trick that led this to learn your craft. All his characters in this movie were so unpleasant and I did not care. The best thing about this movie was the final credits and the rain of an hour after this cause, I felt so dirty that I wasted money on this stinking load. Hey genius ... the triads and yakuza are from two different places that learn something about Asian culture. The dog's scene in this felt so twisted and useless. This DVD is useful. I love my new roller coaster. <br /> <br /> So that children do not waste their money on this garbage, buy the Hostel instead.
