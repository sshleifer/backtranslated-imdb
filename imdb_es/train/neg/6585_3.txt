In reviewing this film I can only go through my experiences as a weekend warrior doing my basic training in July, August and September of 1971 at that place in the garden of the land, Fort Polk, Louisiana. Take the High Ground was not like I remember a basic training. <br /> <br /> But one has to remember that at the time this was after Korea, which ended in a stalemate, but it was a conventional war as we knew it. It was not Vietnam, a guerrilla war in the jungle where we kept throwing recruits into an endless well. The draft at that time was not welcome, but it was accepted as necessary for the defense of the country. <br /> <br /> Richard Widmark is a Korean veteran who is now assigned to the state side to train troops to go abroad. The film is about one of its training cycles and the men of the squad that has to train. They are the usual type you would find in almost any war movie of the previous decade. <br /> <br /> One thing I will praise Take The High Ground for is the fact that MGM recognized that our army was now integrated with the presence of William Hazard as a black recruit in the squad. It was in keeping with the spirit of the times that changed. <br /> <br /> But I will say that a recruit like Russ Tamblyn would have been cured from his intelligent mouth from the first day. Richard Widmark would not have risked dying or becoming a eunuch to give Jerome Courtland confidence with a weapon. And in no way would he have worried so much about Robert Arthur deserting. He just let parliamentarians deal with him. <br /> <br /> Of course he was shot at Fort Bliss and in El Paso, Texas, he gave Take the High Ground a good authenticity. But consider it an army recruiting film and you can certainly understand why the government provided such eager cooperation on the day. <br /> <br /> I remember the drill sergeants who have their little conflicts, which I could detect when I was not worried about being put in their case for something that was 95% of the time. But there is no way that Karl Malden has beaten Widmark outdoors during training in front of several witnesses among the recruits. Both would have realized that they would have undermined authority, something that the military simply does not let happen. <br /> <br /> I would like to have said something better about Take The High Ground because I certainly like their talent. the talented director Richard Brooks, including the stupid theme of Dimitri Tiomkin and Ned Washington, fresh out of his Oscar a year earlier for High Noon. The film actually received an Oscar nomination for Best Screenplay and Story by Millard Kaufman. It must have been for the vivid imagination of Kaufman.
