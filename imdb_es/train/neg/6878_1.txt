I'm Puerto Rican and this is one of the worst documentaries I've seen of any kind. You can see that the people in him have no idea. They do not know much about Puerto Rico and its culture. They claim to be Puerto Rican because they are of Puerto Rican descent, but they probably know less than others who are not from Puerto Rico. You can see while they are talking that they are contradicting themselves. If you want to see a real and genuine documentary of Puerto Rico, you should see "My Puerto Rico". That is a serious, real documentary. I do not like this piece of scrap metal. Rosie PÃ©rez based this documentary on herself. I thought it was supposed to be Puerto Ricans. They keep repeating that I did not know. Well, that's the only thing they have in this so-called documentary. I hate to see how a piece of garbage is made with the name of the island. They lower the standards.
