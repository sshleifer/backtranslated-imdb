On the islands of Fiji, the greedy and unscrupulous owner of the Valalola Resort Primal Park invites investors and guests to an opening party at their complex consisting of a hotel and a zoo with the aim of finding partners for their discoveries. When a group of small university thieves put a virus in the security system to participate in a treasure hunt, are the zoo's biggest attractions? sabretes from the prehistoric era developed from the DNA found in fossils? Escape, killing the hosts and the guards for pleasure. <br /> <br /> The incredibly unconvincing and cheap "Attack of the Sabretooth" is one of the worst movies I've seen recently. The characters are terrible and they are not funny or pleasant, and the story is a scam of the Jurassik Park with a bad collection of clich√©s. Basically, all the lines and situations are poor and stupid, but the winner is when the guard explains that the sabretes are bulimic and they like to kill for pleasure. My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Attaque do Dente de Saber" ("The attack of Sabretooth")
