METAMORPHOSIS I am working on the collection of Chilling Classics 50 movie packages and METAMORPHOSIS is the seventh film of the set. Released in 1990, METAMORPHOSIS appears to be a remake of "The Atom Age Vampire," which also featured a scientist looking for similar results. Set in modern times, METAMORPHSIS is not my horror movie type. <br /> <br /> A university researcher is working to decipher the human genome to create a serum that prevents aging. Pressured by the administration to publish their works; and, by producing some results (or risking losing funds), the scientist decides to use it as a guinea pig. At first, thinking that he suffered no adverse side effects, he finally discovers that the serum has altered him in the most unexpected way! <br /> <br /> The action is forced; and, the performances left me with a much less interest in the film. The score is complacent. And, the science behind the experiments and their findings is not only fallacious; is absurd is ridiculous ?? maybe. <br /> <br /> As others noticed, the ending becomes a gag of more than 30 minutes, which seems to have no end. Without revealing too much, he would call this one: "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde meet the Creature of the black lagoon and the Solo at home."
