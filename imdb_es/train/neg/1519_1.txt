I only lasted 15 minutes before the self-preservation took me out of the stupor of drooling with the empty eyes that this movie induced without effort and prompted me to shout back to the video store armed for the bear. <br /> <br /> To say that the movie was bad would be a missed opportunity to use words interspersed with the characters on the upper keys of my keyboard (just to keep these comments clean). <br /> <br /> One that should be avoided. <br /> <br />
