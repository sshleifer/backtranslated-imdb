They have served us: a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> Well, I admit it, since I am white and I do not have practical experience in the "competitive world of dancing steps", it might not be like that. To be exactly an authority on this type of film. On the other hand, I do know a bad image in motion when I see it. <br /> <br /> And, boy, I just saw her. <br /> <br /> Filmed in Low-Budget-Vision and directed by Ian Iqubal Rashid, ("A Touch of Pink"), "How it moves," tells the importance of following dreams, even if those dreams include to play loud and irritating hip-hop music and spoken dialogue that the average person would not understand if they had an international translator. <br /> <br /> I will try to give a small synopsis of the "plot". First, there are two actors who look like LL Cool J who work in a car shop in Toronto (the mecca of racial diversity), but still have time to practice dancing for eight hours a day. <br /> <br /> There are some other guys in this "team", including a white guy and a guy who looks like Denzel Washington in "Malcolm X". There are also two women in the film: one looks like Serena Williams and the other looks like Geraldine from the old "Flip Wilson Show". One of these women was expelled from a private university because her parents spent all their tuition on a brother addicted to drugs. The other girl, member of Salt N Pepa, no doubt, is simply not good. <br /> <br /> There is another guy who looks like Eddie Murphy's Buckwheat, while another actor who is a Huggy Bear impersonator. These guys are rival step dancers. Obviously, this activity is very hard on the 'hood, and everyone is practicing for the big jam "Step Monster" in Detroit. <br /> <br /> Since I could not understand 90 percent of the dialogue (maybe some subtitles would have been useful, like in a Bergman movie or in that Snow music video), it's hard to explain what happens, apart that there are many discussions, the girl Serena Williams (who, by the way, never smiles) becomes a step-by-step independent (moves from one group to another), there are some dance steps and a lot of hip-hop music irritating . <br /> <br /> It's a typical story of rags-to-riches; something like "Rocky" with a really bad soundtrack, "Rudy" with annoying rap music in the background, "Cry Freedom" without the laughs. <br /> <br /> But, why would a movie, which could have had a huge impact on the black audience, have to contain drug addiction, bad parents and a title that sounds like a student first? grade that says "How does she move"? <br /> <br /> However, this movie "moved" me. He moved to leave the theater as quickly as possible.
