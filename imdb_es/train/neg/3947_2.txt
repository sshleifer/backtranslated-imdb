In the comic, modesty is strong. Alexandra Staden, who plays Modesty Blaise, looks more like an anorexic fashion model. She also does not have the morals or the personality that Modesty has in the comics. Modesty would never give a woman advice to show more skin to earn more money. I can not see any similarity with my comics with Modesty and this movie. It's as if a Mission Impossible movie was about Ethan Hunt locked in the high school detention room talking to the janitor about when he went to high school and Hunt would have been played by DJ Qualls (in Road Trip). So, if you're a Modesty fan, do not watch the movie, you'll just get mad. If you do not know much about Modesty comics that rent another movie, do not dwell on it. I can not understand how Quentin Tarantino can put his name on it. I'll ask for a refund at my DVD rental shop tomorrow.
