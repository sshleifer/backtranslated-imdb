Renowned writer Mark Redfield (as Edgar Allen Poe) tries to conquer old addictions and start a new life for himself, as editor of the magazine Baltimore, Maryland. However, blackouts, delirium and rejection threaten to thwart their efforts. He would also like to rekindle romance with an old love, a significantly flawed perspective, as things turn out. Mr. Redfield also directed this dramatization of the mysterious last days of Edgar Allen Poe. Redfield employs a lot of black and white photographs, color and gimmick to create the mood. Kevin G. Shinnick (as Dr. John Moran) performs well, relatively speaking. Is not sufficient.
