As usual, I'm going crazy to see the movies that I have not seen before the Oscars. I really wanted to see this movie, as it seemed to be right in my alley. I can not, for my life, understand why this movie has received the enthusiasm it has. There is no history !! A group of boys meander around Iraq. One day they are here spreading a bomb. Tomorrow they are touring the countryside, on their own and start firing snipers. Do not wait here they are back in Baghdad. There is no cohesive story at all. The three main characters are so characterized that they are mere cartoons. By that I mean, we have the sweet child who is afraid of dying. We have the hardened military man who is practical and only wants to return safely. And then we have the reckless cowboy who does not follow the rules but has a weakness for the small, precocious Iraqi boy who tries to sell DVDs of soldiers. What do you think will happen ??? Well, do you think the cowboy soldier who does not follow the rules is going to make the sweet child hurt with his renegade ways? Because if! Do you think that the Iraqi boy for whom the cowboy soldier has weakness has to kill him and drive him crazy? Because if! There is no history here. The script is youthful and predictable! The camera is shaken a lot so that it looks "artistic". And for all those who think that this is a great image of war, go rent "Full Metal Jacket", "Deerhunter" or "Platoon". Do not waste time or money on this boring movie!
