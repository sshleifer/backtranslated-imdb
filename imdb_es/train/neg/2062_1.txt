I read all the reviews here AFTER seeing this piece of cinematic garbage and it took at least 2 pages to discover that someone else did not think that this terribly funny montage was not the moment of humor in the 70s or anywhere else. another era! If this is not the funniest comedy game * I've seen, I'll do it until it appears. Half of the scenes had already been done (and infinitely better) with acts like Monty Python and Woody Allen ... If I had to say that a good piece of animation that lasts about 90 seconds is the highlight of this movie, it would still be Do not come close to summarizing how carefree and wasteful this waste of 75 minutes is. Seminal comedy? Only in the world where seminal really means semen. The eschatological humor? Only in a world where excrement is actually excrement. Jokes precursors? Only if by that we mean that this is a manual of how NOT to do comedy. Tits and vagabonds and the strange beaver. Nice ... if you're a pubescent guy with at least one free hand and you have not heard that Playboy exists. Give him a break because it was in the early 70's? No way. There was comedy of sketches that goes back at least ten years before. The only way to forgive this movie, even if it is done, is if it is at gunpoint. Retro? Barely. Sketches about clowns that subtly pervert children can be edgy in some circles (and could actually have been funny), but in reality they are very sad. What kept me going for the entire 75 minutes? Pure belief that they may have saved a genuinely funny skit for the end. I gave the film a 1 because there was no lower score ... and I can only recommend it to sleepless or comatose patients ... or maybe to people suffering from blockage ... their jaws would finally open with disbelief.
