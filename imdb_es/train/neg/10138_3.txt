Over the years I have seen many of these Segal films on video, and they all have the same amount of entertainment; unfortanetley, the level of entertainment is at a low level. Sure, the action sequences were fun, but that was it. Seagal was really at his best when he made films like; Under Siege, Under Siege 2, and Executive Decision (at least from the point of view of the action), but during the last ten years, this type of films that star Segal really do not meet their previous ratings. <br /> <br /> On the more positive side, the film made good use of time, as some of the action sequences and the use of ingenuity. Just when the movie seemed to crawl, a very interesting action scene got him out of the gutter. I honestly think that more of Segal's films would do better if he were not the only one fans recognize in the movie. Supporting actors and actresses is a very important thing, and if your current films had this well-known actor and actresses, the movie may get more popular results.
