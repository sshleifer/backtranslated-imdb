I just finished watching Going Overboard. I must say that we should send each copy of this film to Iraq and have it seen. I even tried to make a blind woman see this and she turned it off in about 20 minutes. Adam Sandler could not find a better project than this one? As for writing, if that is what you want to call, those responsible should be forced to watch this movie forever in hell. I think somewhere I read that the budget for this movie was $ 10,000 and they were way below. Wallmart got a good deal on this? Each store has a large container of this garbage on the sales floor. The only good thing about this movie is that you can use the DVD as a roller coaster or exchange it with a friend, but then you can not be your friends anymore!
