I understand that this movie was made on a very low budget, but that is no excuse for the monstrosity that is Grendel. Deathstalker, The Throne of Fire, Barbarian Queen, Conquest, Invincible Barbarian were made with limited budgets and poor special effects, but managed to create cult classics by adding some warriors with little clothes and a good sense of humor. Primitive costumes, dark castles and the beautiful Bulgarian landscape gave Grendel the potential to be a very good low-budget swords and spell movie, but the manufacturers completely ruined this opportunity by using extremely poor CGI effects and colorless characters. Compare this movie with Beowulf (1999). It may not be Citizen Kane, but it is a good example of how to make an entertaining low-budget science fiction / adventure movie using credible special effects and attractive characters.
