This movie makes "American Pie" a sophisticated movie! No further comments are needed. The humor is cheap, the dialogues are stupid and the cast is uncomfortable. Each clich√© is used several times without any original spin. And what is worse, the film turns out to be more Catholic than the Pope. It's so sad.
