I own this movie. I bought it for $ 3.99 at a major video retailer to do an "indie" movie research since I had just finished my own show and was editing it. Now, when I feel bad about my abilities as a director for the first time, I just sit down with a plate of cookies and Cortados. In a few minutes I feel great! <br /> <br /> I hate to speak ill of another filmmaker, so I will only use constructive criticism. 1. Find good actors. The time. It really helps. 2. When you record a video, light up your scenes and darken on the computer later in the publication. 3. Close-ups are better for the video. 4. When an actor enters a scene, wait a bit before <br /> <br /> have them speak so that we know what is happening and who is speaking. 5. Never show the back of a door while we wait for someone to open it. Damn, it's worth it for the $ 3.99 <br /> <br /> The True Horror would get the revisions that Severed has here on IMDb. And you have to give credit to these guys ... they were distributed.
