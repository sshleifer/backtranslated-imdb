How low can someone sink while trying to recover an old glory? ST: HF will be happy to show you. <br /> <br /> If you're used to seeing what made a good Star Trek show, DO NOT look at this. <br /> <br /> The writing is Hodge-ask, the representations of the actors of their characters are weak, and above all, the design work is just puppy. <br /> <br /> How to look at strong captains, do not look here! Do you like the strong attitude of the federation? Forget it here! Starfleet mocks the badges that SPIKES wear on their hair. <br /> <br /> While a seemingly weak mental captain shuffles and within two minutes of the opening program credits, Ensign Spikey is trying to arrange an appointment with an engineer. It simply degrades from there. No, not even the uniforms match, for God's sake. They are too small or too big, they hang to the chest and the TNG uniforms Seasons One and Two are mixed with the Season 3 and DS9 uniforms. The strict discipline and tradition of any of the originals that are missing in this production until the rungs! The only good thing about this program are its graphics, which seem to improve a bit with each season. Okay, I'm retiring that. Who uses CG so inexperienced? The designers of this show. <br /> <br /> Do not bother with him, he will offend your sense of Star Trek, as did mine. Even the retreat to previous programs can not save this catastrophe. <br /> <br /> I cried openly when I saw this, probably because my eyes were bleeding and my head almost broke. That's bad.
