I should have imagined that any movie with Mrs. Poltergeist in it will not be good. Actually, it starts well, but during the first murder scene you discover that the movie you're watching is a movie inside a movie. There are people sitting in a movie theater watching that movie. A girl in the audience is so upset that I would have turned around and strangled her. A little strange, but far from good.
