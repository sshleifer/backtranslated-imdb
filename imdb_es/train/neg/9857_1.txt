I just finished watching this movie and discovered that basically it was not funny. <br /> <br /> I am a role player (type of computer, none of the DnD board things) but I did not find any of the jokes. In all this, it's fun. <br /> <br /> Some of the scenes seemed to take a long time (the tilt and zoom could have been reduced to 5 seconds instead of more than a minute) and it feels as if the director was just trying to complete the time. <br /> <br /> I think I laughed a total of 2-3 times throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> The performance itself was not that bad, the standard that a Grade B movie should have. <br /> <br /> I would suggest not to bother with this movie unless you are a big fan of DnD and even then it would be better to avoid it.
