This movie is like any other Dutch movie, so if you like movies like turks fruit and kleine blonde dood. then you could agree with this (although those two have better stories and actors) Zomerhitte starts strong enough, but even that good scene ends up having nothing to do with the story. There's a lot of nudity (but I and others just could not find that attractive girl), the dialogue is ridiculous (like we did a lot for the annoyance of other moviegoers), and some of the scenes are so random that this is more of a unintentional comedy that something else (like a random scene in which an owl plucks someone's eye ... has nothing to do with anything and is only referenced once later in a sentence that says "did you hear what happened ...? I was there"). The only reason I gave him a 2 is because some of the places where they look good ... that's it. And the reason I saw it was because we went to the preview (here in Holland we have a strange system with regard to previews, you pay less money for a normal movie and you do not know what movie that movie is). All you know is that it's a new movie that is not yet in theaters). My advice is to stay away from this movie, if you really want to see a good Dutch movie, temmink or zwartboek.
