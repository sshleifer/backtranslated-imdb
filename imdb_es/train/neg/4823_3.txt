The plot and the two-dimensional script made the characters look like cardboard cutouts. Needless to say, this made it difficult to feel empathy for any of the characters, especially the promised one; It looked and acted more like a cartoon. In short, I suppose you could say it was on par with your typical television drama. Use almost all the clich√©s in the book. The tortured classical musician who wants to go out and play salsa. The free-spirited bride committed herself to a "bean counter" personality she does not love. I will not list them or else it would be a spoiler because I would be giving away the whole plot. The dance was good but nothing special. I've seen worse. 3 stars for good music. The band was very tight. I saw it on YouTube. Fortunately I did not pay much money to see it in a theater. I'm still a little surprised by the amount of excellent reviews that this movie has graced.
