What a pathetic movie. <br /> <br /> I will not waste much time commenting on it. I'm still trying to recover the couple of hours I wasted on it. <br /> <br /> Let me just leave you with: Shaq DOES NOT HAVE BUSINESS, since he is an actor or singer. He is completely without talent in both disciplines. It is a real shame that much more talented people are wasted in community theaters and karaoke bars, while Shaq uses his name as a basketball player to participate in films and cut CDs. <br /> <br /> Much of the failure of this The movie was the pathetic without talent that is Shaq.
