In one aspect, it is like 'The Wizard of Oz', with Paris in black and white and the Riviera in color. But supposedly it's about possessive love, destruction and moral decadence, while in reality it's about designer dresses, Riveria shots, many big and expensive cars and music and dance interludes that suggest Vincente Minnelli on one of his days off . It can be seen, but it is a remarkable example of dark and desperate plot material and ostentatious style in the opposite direction. (Was this the model for 'The Talented Mister Ripley? Does anyone feel an affinity between Jean Seberg and Matt Damon?)
