Eddie Murphy for best supporting actor ??? What an insult to Alan Arkin and Djimon Hounsou. <br /> <br /> Jamie Foxx (who can act) walks through this movie like a zombie. <br /> <br /> Beyonce ??? What was he doing? <br /> <br /> This movie pales in comparison to CHICAGO or almost any other recent musical. <br /> <br /> If it were not for the great singing and the interpretation of Jennifer Hudson, I would have given her a ZERO. <br /> <br /> And no, I never saw the play, so I'm not doing The typical Broadway rap vs. hollywood
