It's not just that this is a bad movie; it's not just that four of the "best" Mexican filmmakers are in this movie; And it's not just that the script is terrible. It's just that ... this movie sucks ... big time. These people are wasting money on terrible scripts. It is supposed to make a critique of Mexican society, but we are fed up with this type of film. Is it supposed that bad language is fun? I do not understand it. Mexican cinema is in a big problem if this kind of films will continue to be reproduced (and will be written and produced). <br /> <br /> Please, do not think that these types of films are well received in Mexico: we hate them and they do not reflect us.
