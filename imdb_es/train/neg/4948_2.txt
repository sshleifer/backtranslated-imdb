I have always been enthusiastic about period dramas, an art form in which the BBC has stood out in the past. This presentation by "Byron" was amazing. Incredibly bad! The script was frightful, the performance had no inspiration, and all the characters were sadly insipid. Apparently, Byron was "very bad and it was dangerous to know", and he put the hearts of the ladies around fluttering. Not in this production. Here he appeared as a small, saut√©ed stream instead of a fiery hero of women and the Greek struggle for independence. It is said that Byron was limping. This representation of man was simply lame everywhere. <br /> <br /> I saw the full two and a half hours waiting for something to go on in life. It is not an uproar, not even a flash. It was total boredom, if not outright boredom, from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> Having the opinion that nobody will ever improve the Avon Bardo, I also believe that Byron's poetry is too revered and for my mind it should be in the background, and this dramatization of his life should receive the same treatment. <br /> <br /> I think the BBC lost its nous with this
