Over the past year, Uwe Boll has shown marginal improvement as a filmmaker, developing the compelling "In the Name of the King" (a clone of "The Lord of the Rings") and the proudly vulgar satire, after 9/11 "Postal." But then came "Seed", and the counter was reset to zero, maintaining its commitment to legitimacy and respect much more out of reach. And I'm a fan of the boy? His films exhibit a unique vision of skill, and they are never boring. <br /> <br /> Arising from his frustration at the wild warnings he received from his early films, "Seed" is a colossally misguided attempt at social commentary, and an even worse blow to create an iconic slasher mythology (Boll a he often seems to be pulling out a page of Rob Zombie's successful "Halloween" reboot.) The antagonist is Maxwell Seed (Will Sanderson), a mute and enormous brute who has killed 666 people and is on death row, waiting for his execution; After unsuccessfully frying the beast, he rises from the grave to seek revenge on those who put him there ... and thus begins a series of totally free chaos. <br /> <br /> Trying to create a slasher of the new millennium in the vein of Michael Myers or Jason Voorhees, Max Seed is too indescribable and boring to leave an impression, and in the end he looks like a professional wrestler who does "The Toolbox Murders" in a succession of equally boring victims. In addition, the character of Seed and the "message" of Boll are contrary: the death penalty is wrong, of course, but do we really hope to sympathize with a soulless killer who left a couple of hundred corpses in his wake? I think not. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Michael Pare acts like an apathetic brother and lost in the character of James Remar in "Dexter": a cop who sits a lot on his desk, flipping through newspaper clippings, and watching useless scenes stop-motion of decomposing animals and people trapped in Seed's lair. By the time he and a group of cardboard policemen broke into Seed's hideout, the sequence is so widespread, ill-conceived (the lighting is almost non-existent) and unattractive (despite a good dose of blood) that it almost puts me sleep. <br /> <br /> The poor quality of the shoot is not limited to just that sequence: "Seed" seems to have been filmed by a drunken cinematographer, as the camera swings and weaves endlessly, a technique that it's more stomach twist than blood itself; These prolonged shots of very little event only draw attention to the serpentine narrative, almost nonexistent. At 90 minutes, the movie is relaxed enough to be considered a form of torture, which could have been Boll's intention all the time. <br /> <br /> Pure genius ... I guess the joke is on me.
