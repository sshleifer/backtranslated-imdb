You would think that with Ingrid Bergman and Warner Baxter this movie would have been much better. Unfortunately, the movie has characters that are hard to believe and an important plot problem that makes some of the characters seem baffled. <br /> <br /> The movie starts when Ingrid Bergman comes to work for the Stoddard family. Everything is very peachy and full: the family loves Bergman and things could not be more perfect. Well, that's until the mother (Fay Wray) dies, the stock market collapses in 1907 (eliminating the family's fortune) and Bergman is forced to return to France. This part of the movie is a little sticky, sweet, but not bad. <br /> <br /> Later, after the luck of the family has improved, Bergman returns. The four boys have already grown up and there is really no conceivable reason to be hired once again as a governess. But, briefly, everything swells once more. But, when the First World War takes place, the four of them go to war, wow! In the midst of this, one of the children (David) brings home his new wife (Susan Hayward). The character of Miss Hayward is as black and white as the others, although although they are all good and they are fine, she is obviously a hot demon. To make matters worse, she comes to live in the family home while David is at war. <br /> <br /> Now this is where the movie really gets, really silly, incredibly silly. Hayward starts a romance with one of David's brothers, but when the father sees a silhouette of the lovers, Bergman enters the room through another entrance and pretends it was her, not Hayward with Jack! WHY?! Why would any sensible person do this to save the backside of an obviously evil and deceptive woman? This was exactly the kind of excuse Bergman needed to get rid of the gutter-snipe once and for all! This is just a case of bad writing and it made me angry ... and most likely did the same thing with the public in 1941. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is a missed opportunity after a failed opportunity to Hayward. evil to be exposed. This simply goes against common sense and made the movie a stupid melodramatic disaster. However, as expected, the truth finally reveals itself and everyone goes crazy once again, happy to be a great, wonderful and loving family without the whore, Hayward. <br /> <br /> The movie suffers due to bad writing. The Hayward affair made no sense, at least how it was handled. And, having characters that are so good or bad (with nothing between them) sinks this movie to the level of a second-rate soap. The only thing that saves it is the performance: they tried the best they could with a turgid script. Suffice it to say that the Columbia Pictures writers who made this movie should have been slapped with a dead chicken!
