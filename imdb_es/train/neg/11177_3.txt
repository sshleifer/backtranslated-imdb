In what seemed to be the longest 1 hour 35 I've had to endure in a long time, Al Pacino offers precise performance to be sure. Not his usual tipecasting, which was nice. But his character was truly pathetic. Someone who is given the penalty when he stumbles over the forgetting of appointments when we realize that the social life of Hollywood has taken away energy. But in this movie we need someone who likes it. And for some reason, all the characters in the picture said "I do not know why I like you, Eli" to the character of Al Pacino and I could not even get close to liking him. <br /> <br /> All Other actors played their usual styles. Tea Leoni, Richard Schiff and Bill Nunn did nothing to change their established characters developed on television or in previous films. And Kim Basinger was not even in the movie long enough to offer a performance of any kind. <br /> <br /> The story of the movie had no momentum. Most scenes never advance the story, but simply pick up factoids on characters that later came into play in an anti-climactic ending. He had potential, except for his unwillingness to build on history. <br /> <br /> What is the point of the movie? Daniel Algrant and Jon Robin Baitz would make you believe "once Hollywood has you, you can not leave". Yeah sure! And that's why so many people are fired in Hollywood.
