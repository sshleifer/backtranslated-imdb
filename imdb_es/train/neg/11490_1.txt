I have to agree with the opinion of the majority of users that this program was produced and written poorly. The performance was not much higher than the lower production values, however, I think that an actor can only rely on the material that is provided and get the best out of it. . According to this thought, I think it is important to point out that an actor has risen and persevered far beyond this insipid and insipid production to have become a respectable and quite talented artist. I mean Laura Harris, an actor born in Canada who has recorded her way through many badly produced programs and films to find a place in the HBO hit "Dead Like Me" where she plays the role of Daisy Adair and for her credit , handle this role in an efficient manner. I remember that I had a childhood crush. in the young actress during this series in which she played Ashley, a 7th grade student with a soft but intelligent voice. I felt that if someone could "triumph" in this series, it would surely be Laura Harris and true to her nature, she excelled in the performance. field to earn the respect of many producers who now recognize her for her talent, as well as for her unique Nordic and blonde appeal. If you ever have the opportunity to see this series, I recommend that you have something epic to see after rooms like the "Godfather" or maybe the "Beaches" to remember that, after all, there is a great integrity of the production. and value out there and that this series is just a little budget reminder of what Laura Harris can simply say about her time on the show and I bet she would quote words of defense from many young actors by saying "It's a start!"
