"Scary Movie 2" is a disappointment of the Scary Movie franchise. Scary Movie 1, 3 and 4 were good, but this was boring and not very fun. Luckily, after this they filmed their performance and made two great scary movies. <br /> <br /> This film is about a group of teenagers who are tricked by their teacher to go to a haunted mansion for one night. Things start to go wrong and then they realize that they have to escape. <br /> <br /> This movie is not horrible, but some things could have improved. It's a bit funny and if you liked the other Scary Movie franchise movies, then give this one a watch, but I do not think you like it that much.
