I had never read Gary Paulsen's novel, Hatchet, for which it is an adaptation of 'A Cry in the Wild', so I can not make any comparison with the book. However, I will say that as a film in itself, adaptation or not adaptation, it was an underdeveloped adventure that does not provide an important explanation of its few characters. <br /> <br /> Think of 'A Cry in the Wild' as a less luxurious teenage mountaineer (Quincy, California, was the only place where it was shot?) version of 'Cast Away'. Jared Rushton, 13 years old, Brian Roebson, a boy who was on his way to a small plane to visit his father, until the boat crashed in a desert mountainous terrain, leaving the child stranded for a while and having to fend. <Br /> <br /> There are basically three parts in the movie. The obvious thing is the introduction of ten or fifteen minutes of the characters, namely Brian and his mother. <br /> <br /> The next third of the movie (which really consumes most of the movie) is Brian's "mistreating" him. These scenes do not contain a particularly surprising action, nothing spectacular, besides a lot of beautiful images of a beautiful landscape of Yukon. There is nothing to make you nervous, no real encounter (except an energetic confrontation with a puppy) and no major dilemma to initiate any kind of enjoyment or connection with the character on the screen. You may even feel briefly bored with the passage of time, as we are witnessing that Brian is dealing with his situation through primitive means, first, and then with more improved ones (using tools, etc.) for his survival . It's more like ordinary time that happens if you were really stuck in the situation, and that's more or less about that. In other words, they did not give importance to Paulsen's words when they translated them into a visual medium. <br /> <br /> And, of course, the third part of the movie is your rescue. <br /> <br /> There is a secondary plot that continually seeks to make itself known during this time, however. Some conflict between Brian and his parents that created an awkward and rocky relationship between them. However, for the most part, it is only explained shortly, intermittent, minimal dialogue flashbacks that are more like a background story for a music video. At any time, the singer of Jefferson Starship, should start singing 'Sara'. Apart from what the viewer can extract from the implications, or guess their own need to fill in the gaps in the narrative, we get an underdeveloped background story that was probably necessary to enjoy at least part of this film and create a connection with the Characters, whether or not it has to do with Brian's survival adventure in the third part of the film. These are the flaws in the narrative that, through the viewer, becomes a stupor as he struggles to find out what the hell these people are doing on the screen and, to me, almost to the point of shouting at the television to say something and tell me more! <br /> <br /> It certainly was not, for me, a good adventure story. But, for fans of Jared Rushton, it was one of the last movies he made. Then, look at it purely for nostalgia, if nothing else.
