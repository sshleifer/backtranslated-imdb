"What happens when you give a homeless man $ 100,000?" As if by asking that question they would be morally absolved of what will eventually happen. The creators of "Reversal of Fortune" try to get their voyeuristic giggles while disguising their antics as a kind of responsible social experiment. <br /> <br /> They take Ted, a homeless man in Pasadena, and they give him $ 100,000 to see. if he is going to change his life. Then, with only the fastest guidance and advice, they let him go on his cheerful way. <br /> <br /> What are you trying to say? "Money can not buy you happiness?" "The homeless are homeless because they deserve to be?" Or how about, "Raise a man: it's more fun to see him fall from a higher height." They took a man with nothing to lose, they gave him something to lose and then they saw him throw everything down the drain. Is that supposed to be entertainment? They dress in this way with dark music and dramatic camera shots, but in the end has all the moral of the car crash videos, only this time they designed the car crashes and asked: "What happens when you stop someone? ? "
