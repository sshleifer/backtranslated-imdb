Have you ever wondered what would happen if a couple of characters from Beverly Hills 90210 were thrown into a Thai jail? If so, this is your movie. This is Midnight Express for the MTV crowd. That would be fine, but the story was poorly executed. The twists of the plot, the poor dialogue and the unresolved problems abound. This little movie did not win the right to be as cryptic as it ends up being. Potential spoiler and an incredibly absurd plot: the false tension was filled at the moment when the hotel employee discovers that the girls do not have a room there and are about to throw them out. (This moment is played inappropriately with the same solemnity and gravity as the moment they are arrested at gunpoint). Later, he finds the same hotel employee (and Bangkok is a big city, of course, I've been there) and testifies against the girls, as if a couple of free Mai Tais justified 40 years in prison. Let's go. Rent another day in paradise instead.
