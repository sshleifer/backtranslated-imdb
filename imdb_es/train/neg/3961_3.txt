What a movie dog. The performance of Noni Hazelhurst is pretty good, but it is in the middle of a jungle of writing of abhorrence, mediocre direction and wooden acting of most of the cast. Many of the characters are unfortunately moody, especially the always overrated Colin Friels. <br /> <br /> Very few works in this pretentious garbage. Much of the "character development" is done through a silly voice full of anguish that often completely contradicts the behavior of the characters on the screen. In fact, it is difficult to even find out who the voice-overs speak of because they describe characters so different from what we see on the screen! How should we know that Colin Friels (Javo) is an erratic, violent and unreliable drug addict? One of these nonsense tells us. To shout out loud, the nature of your character is half the point of the movie and the only thing that lets us know is an overlapping voice. The real killer are the characters. All about them. His clothes are perfectly maintained and look fresh from the rack, even though we are constantly reminded that they are destined to be destitute. All of them are absurdly well-spoken for "drug addicts". No one seems to have a real understanding of life on roller skates or a slap in the face, and yet this is the case with most of them. <br /> <br /> Monkey Grip does not deserve more attention than a weekday morning movie on television. Crud in this way, perfectly filmed and presented technically, but an agonizing drama driven by clich√©s that so broadly shoots out to be plausible and meanders for hours without really going anywhere. At least Noni gets her birthday suit on every given occasion. There is no other sensible reason to put up with this garbage.
