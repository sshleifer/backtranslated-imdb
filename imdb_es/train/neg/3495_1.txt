I saw an episode Yes, I sat through all the miserable experience, and I must say that this brand of comedy is one of the worst you will get. Imagine Peter Griffin, of the Family Guy fame. Now imagine Peter Griffin as a woman (certainly thin and without glasses), except that now he lacks something that made him hilarious. Peter Griffin is an idiot, but he does not know he's an idiot. Sarah does not have any of the genuine characters, nor the ability to act to get her character out. Maybe it's the trivial and trivial jokes that make her comedy even lower than her character can do it alone. Maybe it's the lack of credible pictures. His insensitive and fanatical person can appeal to insensitive and intolerant people, unlike the massive appeal of the insensitive and intolerant character of Stephen Colbert. Like Bill O'Reilly, Sarah creates an annoying and unpleasant character. She lacks something that is necessary for the genre of satire, much less for the whole world of comedy. What Sarah Silverman lacks, is remarkable. And when you do not believe it and identify with it, it's no fun anymore.
