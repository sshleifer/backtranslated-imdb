Halfway there, I realized that I did not care about these characters in the least; However, I have seen a bit more anyway. Unfortunately, I went back the next day and finished it. It should not have bothered me. <br /> <br /> If you know * something * about the film in advance, you know that the main character will be a survivor of a plane crash, and the title gives you a good idea of ​​what is going to happen next - He'll get on the phone and call people about that! That was almost as bad as "Snakes on a Plane" (another bad aviation catastrophe movie). <br /> <br /> I realize that this is an old movie, and the acting style in those days was much less naturalistic than it is today. But even for those standards, the performance was shameful. These were not characters, they were stereotypes. I suspect that this film was, more than anything, an attempt by Bette Davis to help her husband's career (Gary Merrill). However, in vain, I have seen that the oaks show a more genuine emotion than him. <br /> <br /> Davis playing the happy cripple (that is, a role without glamor) was probably seen as a bold and bold career move. It was not It was just boring. She was a kind of Tiny Tim in the film, making Trask (Merrill's character) see the truth about love and forgiveness (though she was less attractive than Tiny Tim), calmly giving wisdom about life and relationships without the least hint that her beloved husband had just died. <br /> <br /> The final scene, where Trask calls his wife to Iowa to reconcile, was so affected and exaggerated at both ends of the phone line, I almost shuddered. I had to remind myself that these people were really paid for what they were doing in this movie. <br /> <br /> I noticed that many people seem to have enjoyed this movie. If you found it edifying, that's great. But frankly, I just found it wrong. There are many old movies from the Golden Age of Hollywood that were much better written and performed.
