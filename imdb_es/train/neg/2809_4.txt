When I remember my university days at the University of Ohio, there will always be an event in which I will remember with good memories. Channel 23 is the local access channel of OU and until the last years, almost everything that was sent was reproduced. This included many DIY movies ranging from a marshmallow Peeps with microwaves and then scanning them online, to a Macbeth version featuring 8th graders who had apparently learned how to squib. <br /> <br /> However, the king In my opinion, of the alignment of channel 23 was Midnight Skater. The first time I saw him was around 2AM. I should have been studying. Or sleeping. Or watching regular television. But no, all that is for pussies. My roommate and I saw Midnight Skater, and when it was completed, I do not think either of us believed that any of the movies had just happened. But, actually, it was a few nights later, and we had to understand that this movie existed, in fact, it existed. <br /> <br /> I could go on talking about how horrible it is, but it's the kind of terrible thing that makes life worthwhile. The plot is disjointed, the terrible performance, everything that heals the soul, but, by God, if there are others watching with you, it is impossible not to spend a good time observing it. It's like the first time you listen to "Guts" by Chuck Pahalniuk. You hear it, you're upset and agitated, but five minutes later, all you want and want is to make someone else experience the abject horror you just endured. <br /> <br /> Long story short, Midnight Skater, for All your epic failures, make for a very late night fun. Also, I desperately want the Midnight Skater theme. Congratulations to who wrote it and sang it. My God, I love that song.
