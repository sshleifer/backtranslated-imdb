Mann takes pictures of the Rocky Mountains of Alberta in a magnificent way, and Jimmy Stewart and Walter Brennan give nice performances as they always seem to do. <br /> <br /> But come to Hollywood - a Mountie telling the people of Dawson City, Yukon to choose themselves as marshals (yes a marshal!) and to enforce the law themselves, then the gunmen who fight in the streets by Control of the town? <br /> <br /> Nothing that remotely resembles what happened on the Canadian side of the border during the Klondike gold rush. Mr. Mann and the company seem to have confused Dawson City with Deadwood, north of Canada with the wild west of the United States. <br /> <br /> Canadian spectators must be prepared for a pleasant howling Reefer Madness with this ridiculous plot, or, Shake your head in disgust.
