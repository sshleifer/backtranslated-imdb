This is the first guinea pig movie in Japan and this is the sickest one, in my opinion. A group of men tortured a girl for several days before finally killing her. And at this point, I will say that these films are NOT real! They are fake horror movies that try to be as realistic as possible. <br /> <br /> The scenes are disgusting but, in many cases, unrealistic. For example, when they kick the girl on the floor, we can clearly see how they kick and hit the floor near the girl. And how stupid this looks! The sound effects are also unrealistic and do not make sense. Other scenes include intestines of animals thrown at the girl, the girl exposed to loud noises for many hours, tearing the nails, worms placed in the wounds of the girl's body, the pierced and mutilated eye with horrifying details and things like that. A very sick and petty movie and it has absolutely nothing of value or cinematically significant. This first entry is the most sick and amateur guinea pig, although it is not as bloody as the next part, Flowers of flesh and bone, which tries to be as shocking as possible. <br /> <br /> Guinea pig: Devil The experiment is perhaps the sickest thing I've seen and the closest thing to tobacco there is. This is still (of course) u (n / t) forged, the only difference with the genuine "snuff film" is that nobody dies or really hurts in this movie. I can not recommend this to anyone, as this is so strong and repulsive. Those who consider it a great horror movie, do not understand anything about the cinema or its real meaning. I saw this as a curiosity (like the other parts of the series) and now I know how insignificant these garbage are. They only work at the shock level and that is not a very valuable cinematic achievement. Devil's Experiment is perhaps the sickest movie I've seen and Mermaid in a Manhole (Guinea Pig 4) is perhaps the most unpleasant movie I've seen. So these are pretty extreme in my book, but that's all they are.
