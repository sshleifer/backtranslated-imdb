I guess the spoilers. <br /> <br /> The absolutely absurd logic of the ending ruins the whole movie. I just could not get over it. And what's wrong with the character of Mark Wahlberg? If I suddenly found myself staring on a planet full of talking monkeys, it would be like "AAAAhhhhHHH! Run for your lives! Monkeys have inherited the Earth!" But he's all like, "talking monkeys, okay. Next?" That is quite tired, I would say. He must meet even stranger things on a regular basis. On top of that, this is Rick Baker's best job so far. This movie is a true testimony of how far we have come in the field of monkey makeup. 3/10.
