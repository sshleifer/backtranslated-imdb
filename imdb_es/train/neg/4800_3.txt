If you made a genre movie in the late '80s, you basically had a 50/50 chance of being placed underwater or in a prison (unfortunately, we never had a prison movie underwater). Framed to be killed by Mafia boss Moretti (Anthony Franciosa), Derek Keillor (Dennis Cole) ends up on death row, right next to the mafia's brother, Frankie (Frank Sarcinello Jr.). But this is the least of Derek's problems, since the dishonest government agent (and the mafia boss), Colonel Burgess (John Saxon, who also runs) is using prison as a testing ground for a new supervirus. This is the only film directed by Saxon during his career. For a guy who has worked with a lot of directors, it seems that the only ones who got any advice from were the cheap Italians. Sure, it's low budget, but that can not excuse the staging, shooting or awkward exposure in the first 15 minutes. To his credit, Saxon did it a bit bloody and works in a scene of funny nudity (our protagonist falls asleep during a prison riot only to fantasize about a scientist). Cole, who looks like a more robust Jan-Michael Vincent, is decent as Stoic leader and Franciosa, with a really bad carpet, he gives everything as the boss of the clich√© mafia. The ending takes place at Marty McKee's favorite place, Bronson Canyon. Retromedia released this on DVD as ZOMBIE DEATH HOUSE.
