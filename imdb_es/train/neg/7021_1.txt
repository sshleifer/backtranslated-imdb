Whatever happened to Keaton is what I want to know. <br /> <br /> Not really, I crawled, thinking I should owe half of the bookies in Las Vegas, or maybe not, maybe they just had their brain washed Blackmailed and bored to death . Rich enough to adopt a third world country, somehow had to star in another delocada talk, based on the same franchise of characters who has been recriminating since "Father of the bride" (91). . One would think that he will come face to face with Mr. Bean. <br /> <br /> (Spoilers) <br /> <br /> So my husband (Dax) is fired by the boss's obnoxious son, his mother (Keaton). ) leaves his father after the classic row, and crashes with his own exhibition of dogs in tow, oh those little rascals. The husband has cold feet for changing diapers, the ticking of my wife's watch and hey, we're going to launch a space cadet as second guest of the house, all in a single day, because it's very funny and original. The wife gets tired and leaves, Mom leaves dad for the space cadet and the couple recovers in time for closing credits, 86 very long minutes later. <br /> <br /> Now if you have to have a cadet from space, he can not be deceitful either, can not plan an excuse for his stay, and if mom leaves dad, he can not get into a taxi dressed as a pumpkin only because a screenwriter was distressed at how to cheer him up. . <br /> <br /> In addition, that gag she is invited to enter only to discover that she has her canine entourage in the taxi must already be outlawed. And you only get an odious, two-dimensional boss to denigrate. Another killer of the movie would be the script of the movie that the space cadet is working on, supposedly more lame than the real one, again, let-ad-nausea. <br /> <br /> Liv Tyler does not seem happy here, her voice was weird at times, it made me wonder if they would make her do something later, and she is smart, she has handled great roles and we will forgive her for Jersey Girl, It was prone to disasters, it could happen to anyone. Dax Shepard was observable and that is generous considering the material. <br /> <br /> Personally, it's the director, the writers and, especially, the producers, who would love to see Tar'n'feathered before sending to Guantanamo as toys for the prisoners, and that's me keeping This 'lite'.
