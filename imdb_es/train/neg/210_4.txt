Maybe you should not compare, but Wild Style and Style Wars are original hip hop. Beat Street has many of the early Hip Hop original artists, but obviously they have made it clear that this could be their great opportunity, of course, for some it was and that's good. But if you see this as an original Hip Hop culture, you're wrong. It is overproduced and has a hollywooden sauce. Rather look for the first two films I mentioned. They have transmitted the resentment that comes with life in the ghetto. Yes, the rating of this film is low, but the criticisms are mostly positive or even delusional. This is probably because although the story, the acting, the dialogues and the direction are terrible, music and dance is what people love. I love dancing, but at that moment I thought that the electro was the death of Hip Hop (I was very happy when in the '86 round a new generation of classic Hip Hop artists appeared, like Krs One, Public Enemy, Ultramagnetic Mc's, Jungle Brothers, Bizmarkie to name a few), and I still do not like most of the rhythms of this movie and that's why it does not work for me. I mean, Wild Style does not have a lot of history, but the music there is great and authentic. Of course, tastes differ and that's fine. But as far as I'm concerned, this movie is trash except for break dance and some music, so I can not rate it as higher than 4 out of ten.
