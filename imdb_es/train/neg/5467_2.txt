What about this movie. Well, this is a group of good students who have some bad drugs and become delinquent students who sell more of the bad drugs to people. Two of those people have adverse effects when one becomes a kind of toxic avenger and his girlfriend throws a creature that grows in the basement of the school. That's all you have to do and stretch it for 84 minutes. This movie is pretty bad and should be locked up forever. Although that is not fair, some people like Troma movies and can watch them if they wish. The Troma films for me, however, are the worst movies out there. I just saw this out of morbid curiosity.
