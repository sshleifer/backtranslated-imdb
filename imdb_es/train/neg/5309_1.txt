One night I saw the movie on cable and I could not believe how bad it was. I usually enjoy bad movies, but this one was so disgusting that it was not even entertaining. Some of the highlights of this movie include the absurd music that plays constantly throughout the film, the horrible special effects (when someone is shot with a laser gun, they turn neon green and disintegrate quickly), and the disgusting performance. Acting, in fact, is what I feel steals the show. I did not recognize any of the actors in the film, and I hope never to see them again. In general, I recommend renting this movie (if you can find it, I can not imagine a video store with this garbage) just so you can learn to appreciate quality films after seeing this garbage.
