Thunderbirds (2004) <br /> <br /> Director: Jonathan Frakes <br /> <br /> Starring: Bill Paxton, Ben Kingsley, Brady Corbet <br /> <br /> 5 ?? 4 ?? 3? ? two ?? one! The Thunderbirds are GO! <br /> <br /> And so began the Thunderbirds, one of my childhood favorites. When I heard they were going to make a Thunderbirds movie, I was ecstatic. I could not wait to see Thunderbird 2 roar to save people, while Thunderbird 4 would be deeply immersed in the idea. I just could not wait. Then came August 2004, when the film was finally released. Critics criticized him, but still wanted to go. After all, as long as the heart was in the same place, that was the only thing that mattered to me. So I sat in the theater, the only teenager among a crowd of 50 people, everyone else had more than thirty and less than ten. Possibly the most uncomfortable theatrical experience I've had? <br /> <br /> The film (which pretends to be a prequel) focuses on Alan Tracy (Brady Corbet), the youngest of the Tracy family. He spends his days wishing he could rescue people like the rest of his family, but he is too young. One day, he finally has his chance when The Hood (Ben Kingsley) traps the rest of his family in Thunderbird 5 (the space station). This implies that he must be more cunning than The Hood minions and rescue his family in time before The Hood can steal all the money from the Bank of England. <br /> <br /> Trust me, the plot sounds like a regular episode of Thunderbirds When you read it on paper. Once he starts filming, what a mess we have in our hands! First, the film was aimed at children, like the original show. However, Gerry Anderson treated us as adults and gave us quite advanced arguments for children's programming. This, on the other hand, makes the plot down the plot while trying to make a scam of the Spy Kids franchise. The final product is a film that tries to attract fans of the Thunderbirds series and children, while both are completely lost. False jokes, cartoons and stupid pranks that nobody really finds fun are in this movie, and I'm sure Jonathan Frakes is wishing he never directed this. <br /> <br /> Above all, everyone gave a solid performance, considering the script that everyone received. Ben Kingsley was exceptional as The Hood, playing the role extremely well. My only complaint about the characters is about the henchmen of The Hood, which are reduced to the leftovers of the old Looney Tunes cartoons, which, surprisingly, children take with ease. <br /> <br /> The strange thing about this movie is that while I was watching the movie, I had fun. But once the lights went on, I realized that the movie was pretty bad, that I had $ 8 less and two hours of my time were gone. A guilty pleasure? Maybe. However, Thunderbirds is a forgettable disaster. Instead of a big "go", I'll have to recommend that you stay away from this movie. If the rest of the movie had been like the first ten minutes, it would have been an incredible movie worthy of the name of the Thunderbirds. However, we get a movie that only the fans of the Thunderbirds (if you would like to see your childhood destroyed) or the extremely bored should be upset. <br /> <br /> My rating for the Thunderbirds is 1 Â½ stars.
