Immediately, this movie was ridiculous. Is not it that it did not have redeeming aspects? For example, the best thing about this movie was the beautiful landscape in the background. Anyone who does not live on the east coast should know that the south does not have beautiful mountains like those found in the west. He knew it was Utah from the beginning, but perhaps Dalton could not repress his English accent, so they had to excuse him by saying that this was a southern city. Subverting your accent on a southern one was easier. Of course the movie has twists in the plot, but its false sense of place was something that could not happen. It's not like Utah does not have methamphetamine labs ... so the reason the writers thought it was necessary to pretend that I was in the south is better than me. <br /> <br /> Another thing in the action pictures always baffles me. Why do they always make the "cocking" sound effect when the character pulls out an automatic pistol? It seemed that every other sound effect in this movie was a "chuk-chich" which means that a 9mm was loaded and ready to shoot. Of course, the weapons already had camera rounds so this was unnecessary. <br /> <br /> Finally, the pyrotechnics was far above. But hey, this movie was aimed at a certain "market segment", I suppose ... It's very bad. Each of the actors can act, but this movie was lame.
