I saw this movement several years ago at the Central Florida Film Festival, if I remember. I liked it, it showed great potential. I guess most of the people here are ruining this movie because the film seemed to be limping (as the filmmaker himself admitted on the official site, the short film was shown as a "cut"). <br /> <br /> But Nonetheless, it was a quiet comedy. I think a lot of people try to read too much in a comedy. All they are supposed to do is make you laugh, that's all. I did that in his presentation, so he succeeded at that level. Only my 2 cents anyway.
