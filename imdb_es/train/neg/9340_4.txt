What a lost deal. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most disappointing movies I've seen. <br /> <br /> Usually, Roger Ebert does not disappoint me, but I feel cheated after seeing this. movie. <br /> <br /> The only emotion is seeing Elizabeth Banks in her bra. That is a regrettable statement about this movie. It was very promising, but it was like fucking a transvestite. <br /> <br /> This is a self-absorbed gut. <br /> <br /> I can not express enough of my bitterness for sitting in this movie. And I hope I can warn you of the same disappointment.
