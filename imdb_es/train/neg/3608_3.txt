I have a good collection of movies, and this was added to it. Number 274 to be exact. <br /> <br /> The title had me at the beginning. University of the splash. I thought this would be a great horror movie. Have I ever been wrong? Do not get me wrong, this is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it could have been much better. I love all the movies, but this was one that was more of a laugh than a scare. <br /> <br /> The poor quality of the audio, the bad performance and the poor disposition of the shots are some of the areas that could have been improved. 3 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> The movie is ideal for a good laugh. If you are looking for one of those movies to make fun of you, this is one!
