I rented it because the second segment traumatized me when I was a child. One morning I sneaked down the stairs, started watching HBO and The Raft (segment 2) terrified me. This time, I still enjoyed The Raft, although I could not tell if it was for nostalgic reasons or if it was really a good short. The other two segments were complete garbage. I can not believe that a producer somewhere has paid to make this garbage. All I have achieved when I saw this was to ruin one more memory of my childhood. Creepshow 2 will now join Rad on my list of childhood classics tainted. 4/10
