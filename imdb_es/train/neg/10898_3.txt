If you like to comment on movies where the script reaches the middle of the movie, this is the only one. A setting and acting like in a porn movie, but nothing is happening, just a groping and moving movement of the third type. What actually becomes very boring after 45 minutes of finesse but no action. Some of the actors I've seen in real movies and their acting was much better. All special effects are made by the great "Rondo" Who performs all the magic with his mind. A cult movie is written on the box. Does that mean that this movie will not be seen at all? ??? <br /> <br /> Borrow with some friends and watch this movie on New Year's Eve thanks to the give.
