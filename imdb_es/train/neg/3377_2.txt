The Broadway musical, "A Chorus Line" is possibly the best musical in theater. It is about the experiences of people who live to dance; The joys they experience and the sacrifices they make. Each dancer auditions for the parts in a Broadway chorus line, but what emerges from each of them are stories of how their lives led them to find the dance as a respite. <br /> <br /> The film version, however, captures nothing of the passion and beauty of the theatrical performance, and arguably is the worst film adaptation of a Broadway musical, as it lacks life and lacks of affection for the dance. what. <br /> <br /> The biggest mistake was made in awarding the director's job to Sir Richard Attenborough, whose management offered the right touch and rhythm for "Gandhi". Why would someone in their right mind ask an epic director to direct a musical that takes place in a rather restricted place? <br /> <br /> Which brings us to the next problem. "A Chorus Line" takes place on the stage of a theater without real scenarios and limited costume changes. It is the least showy of the Broadway musicals, and its simplicity was its glory. However, that does not translate well into the movie, and nobody really thought that it would. For that reason, the film should have taken us to the life of these dancers and have left the process of audition and theater. The singers could have offered their songs in other environments and even offered flashbacks to their first ballet, jazz or tap class. Hell, they could have danced on Broadway in their vivid imagination. However, not a speck of imagination entered into the making of this film, since Attenborough's complete indifference to the dance and the show itself is evident in his sincere direction. <br /> <br /> Many scenes are downright uncomfortable when the dancers tell their story to the director (Michael Douglas) if he wants to hear them or not. The character of Douglas is capricious when choosing who extends his ear with sympathy and who does not have patience. <br /> <br /> While the filmmakers pretended to be true to the nature of the work, some heretical changes were made. The very beautiful "Hello Twelve, Hello Thirteen, Hello Love", a sensational scene number that led the dancers to their adolescence, was eliminated and replaced by the terrible "Surprise", a song so bad that it was nominated for an Oscar Adding Insult to the injury, "Surprise" simply retells the same story as "Hello, love", but without the wit or pathos. <br /> <br /> There's no reason to watch this movie unless you want a lesson on what NOT to do when a Broadway show is transferred to the movie. If you want to see a film version of this program, the next closest thing is the brilliant "All That Jazz" by Bob Fosse. While Fosse's daughter is on "A Chorus Line", he is the Fosse who should have been involved, as director. I would have known what to do with this material, which deserved much more respect than this sad effort.
