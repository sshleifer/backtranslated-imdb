OMG. This movie was horrible. I can not complain too much. I went to see him just to be disgusted. It was enough, a kind of funny thing that the most unpleasant part of the movie was in the beginning, in which the woman is extremely forced to give birth to a horribly mutated baby. <br /> <br /> I also think it's funny that the most The most prominent actor in the movie was the Hispanic soldier, who was a supporting actor on next Friday. Everyone in the movie did a horrible job of acting. It was one of the worst performances I've paid to see. <br /> <br /> I also expected it to be much more frightening than the first one. It was not expected to be more scary because it is a sequel and the aftermath of horror films are often much less successful than their predecessors. I expected it to be more frightening, since Gore and violence often sell a horror movie these days (Grudge 2, Saw 3, Jeepers Creepers 1 and 2, Dead Silence), but in reality it was not as frightening as the first, that It was another disappointment. <br /> <br /> The mutants in the first one were a bit disturbing, but the filmmakers tried so hard to make them creepy that they were absolutely fun. <br /> <br /> I also hated the whole concept of showing the video of the soldier's son on his camera phone saying "I love you, Mom" ​​FOUR TIMES. It was stupid to show it in the first place because they were just trying to make us feel worse for the vulnerable mother than for the rest of the soldiers, and it was even more stupid to keep trying to make us feel even MORE WEIGHT by her showing It's three times more for no reason. This movie was a joke.
