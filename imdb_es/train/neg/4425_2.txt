A film about the Harlem Renaissance and a particular author. It contrasts with a modern story about a young, gay and black artist. <br /> <br /> If that sounds vague, it's because the movie itself is. It is well-run, fairly well written and (for the most part) well-acted. Also the scenes in the past are recorded in black and white in a bad mood. Also, this is one of the few movies about gay men that DOES NOT move away from sex scenes (neither explicit nor direct). Still, most hated this. <br /> <br /> The film snakes everywhere, is full of unpleasant characters (including the main character) and (this is the killer) moves at a snail pace. Three times I considered leaving the theater because I was so bored. But the director was there, so I stayed. <br /> <br /> His later words show that this was a work of love and took 6 years to complete. I really wish I could like this more (there are very few movies that deal honestly with black homosexuals) but I can not. Unless you are very interested in the Harlem Renaissance, there is no reason to see this.
