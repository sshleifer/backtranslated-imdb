Fiction film (it is listed as being based on a story, although it has a credit "documented by") about a group of scientists who are entering Canada to try to find a Bigfoot (they want to capture one and then attach a follow-up). device). His many mumbo scientists mixed in what is really a boring movie of a group of people who wander through the desert. There are some attempts to create tension and fear, but to be perfectly honest, there is nothing worth looking out of some of the best planes of nature here. This is a perfect definition of an exploitation film, it promises you a lot, a look at Bigfoot, but in reality it offers very little. Recommended only for insomniacs
