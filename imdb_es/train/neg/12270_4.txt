This ghost movie by Kiyoshi Kurosawa is pretty wild, and he had at least one jump scare that took me by surprise. But overall, the movie is incredibly stupid, with a detective trying to track down a suspected serial killer, only to discover he may have committed one of the crimes. Then he finds himself chased by a beautiful Asian ghost, and has no idea why (and neither does the viewer). As other murders are committed, he gets even more confused when the killers are easily found, and this ghost still haunts him for some reason. Not only is the plot completely stupid, but the ghost lady is more fun than anything else, especially when she suddenly flies through the city, like Wonder Woman. And the end does not make much sense, in fact, the whole movie makes little sense, and I can not recommend it at all. If he did not take himself so seriously, I think it was supposed to be a black comedy. Outside of "Bright Future" this is the worst film directed by Kiyoshi Kurosawa that I have seen yet.
