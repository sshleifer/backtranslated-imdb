It's hard to believe that a movie full of "action" by Jet Li could be so boring, but this was trascendental trash. The plot is an amalgam of other chopsocky movies from Hong Kong. The action of martial arts is all special effects and not human talent. <br /> <br /> It is a comic book story about a group of superhuman soldiers who will be killed because they are mentally unstable, one of them (Li) who holds an incompetent army to save them and rebuilds a life as a pacifist librarian. The saved assassins resurface with a quality plot by Austin Powers to conquer the world, and Li disposes of his new life to save the world. The thin plot and the comic book of 25 cents with special effects. But I suspect that even the 8-year-old children who observe the Ninja Turtle would have found this young and hollow.
