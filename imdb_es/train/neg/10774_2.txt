What a stinkeroo this turned out to be! At one point, much earlier in her career, Linda Darnell was one of my favorites: she was not a great actress as an actress, but she was very beautiful and nice (especially in films like "The Mark of Zorro" and "Blood and Sand") , but when I saw this monstrosity, the memories of his golden days quickly vanished. The story is incredible and ridiculous, the second-class actor, the cast of support is unbearable. I can not think of a more immature performance from anyone compared to Tab Hunter, and Donald Gray had to be the most boring protagonist they could have chosen. Added to this, there was the terrible picture (and I do not mean only the color!) All those associated with this, must have shuddered every time it was shown.
