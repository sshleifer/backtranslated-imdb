I tried to like this program; I really did it. I even bought the pilot film, first on VHS and then on DVD. However, I could not enter this story because its two main characters: "David" (Bruce Willis) and "Maddie" (Cybill Shepherd) seemed to be in love with themselves, for one thing. I admit that there was an intelligent dialogue in the programs, which was a key part of the success of the television program, and I appreciated that dialogue very much. <br /> <br /> Basically, this was almost like the old comedy movies of the 30s and 40s with men versus women. You have many arguments, accusations, shouts and screams. A lot of people apparently love that type of dispute, but I hate it, so I never got in the Moonlighting car. <br /> <br /> Only Allyce Beasley as the hapless helper "Agnes" was entertained. It's a pity that she had so little time in the air. Shepherd was nice with his eyes and I suppose the women would say the same for Willis, but the argument between the two finally discouraged me.
