It does not take long to see why Code name: Diamond Head did not arrive at network times. The TV pilot film does not pass the credits before it is obvious how bad it will be. Maybe I missed something, because the plot did not make much sense. According to what I got from the tangled mess, a terrorist or thief or something called "Tree" (Ian McShane) goes to Hawaii to steal something that has to do with a secret weapon. The most boring secret agent in the world, Johnny Paul (Roy Thinnes), is willing to stop him. There could have been more, but trust me? It really does not matter anyway. <br /> <br /> Action movies should have action. The moments of suspense should have suspense. And dramatic moments should have drama. There's nothing like that in the code name: Diamond Head. Have I seen others use the word "turgid" to describe this fact for TV snoozer? and it's better than any word description I can find. None of the characters is in the least exciting or worth worrying about them. And Roy Thinnes makes the worst tracks imaginable. His charisma is slightly north of a slug. Ian McShane is easily the best the movie has, but unfortunately for everyone else involved, he does not seem to be returning as a regular cast member. Now, if McShane had been chosen for the lead in the series, well, maybe you had something. <br /> <br /> I'm quickly discovering that these Gawd awens 70s movies made for TV are a great episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. And that doubles if Quinn Martin was involved. Very funny things about Mike and the Bots. So, even though I only give the movie a 3/10, I rate Episode # 608 to 4/5 on my MST3K rating scale.
