This film about mental experiments of the secret government and the corrupt use of citizenship by secret and vile and shadowy figures had the potential to be a really interesting film. But for me, it failed. I will not elaborate much on the rather confusing plot, but if you are looking for a detailed explanation, the comment of the user "reluctantpopstar" offers a good description of it. <br /> <br /> But it was not like that. work for me. I found it slow, which would be fine, but due to the fact that it seemed to go nowhere. The viewer is left in the dark about too many things to really be able to handle this movie. In some films, it can be argued that the filmmakers tried to provoke thought and left things ambiguous for that reason. I do not think this is the case here. <br /> <br /> Regarding the frequent long shots of two buildings that have been mentioned frequently by other users ... I see that they have a point: they give the viewer time to get another drink without losing any of the " Actions". And I suspect that many viewers would appreciate the opportunity to have several drinks on board to overcome this.
