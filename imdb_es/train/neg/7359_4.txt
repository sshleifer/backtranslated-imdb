Anyone who has seen some Lifetime Movie Network films knows that the credibility of the plot is first removed from the planning table. Then, when the crazy Lara moves into Patti's house and starts driving her crazy crazy girls, I did not even blink. When Lara eventually increases her activities to threaten poor Patti and challenges her to do something about it, I just nodded. You see, on the LMN Planet, people do not behave as they do for any particular reason, they just do it to keep the action. Only on the Planet LMN could someone have the owner of a house thrown out of his own house by means of his seductive powers !! Poor Patti: she just trusted too much, and Lara left her medicine, and then there was a big fight at the top of the stairs involving a syringe filled with deadly things that ended up injected into someone's belly, and a bag of corpses coming out . the front door. The horror! <br /> <br /> But believe me, this Planet LMN product is a classic. You need to see it once, just for the big laughs you will have. On the Improbability Scale, I give this movie a 95/100. Make a lot of popcorn and get some apple slices too. You will understand later.
