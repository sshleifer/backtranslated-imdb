Bad movie sure. It's such a ridiculous fantasy with many poor special effects, lots of hasty scenes (the airport one, for example) and a really fun moment. (Charles Dance) is horrible as the evil guy and is much better in (Last Action Hero). (Eddie Murphy) is making a non-comical joke, and I heard that this sunken had already been successful, great success !! I will never understand why or how? In a television interview I heard (Eddie Murphy himself), when he was nominated for an Oscar 2007, he regretted it in a funny way! <br /> <br /> One of the comments said (Hey ... It's the 1980s!). Well, not my friend. It's the cinematic madness that made many RAZZIE films over the years, be it in the 80s or 50s! <br /> <br /> There are 2 reasons why I wrote about this movie. The first is that I will never forget the fascinating long legs of (Charlotte Lewis), especially when she was in bed, before the bad guys attacked her house, wearing only a blue shirt and OH BOY, the camera was reporting on her bare legs. should be. But how strange! As I have seen in the following films and was not so beautiful again? Anyway, the second reason is that I've found the title of this movie lately on my list of the 100 worst movies in history. <br /> <br /> The end result: bad movie, Greeeeeat's legs.
