A very bad sequel. Part 1 had many fun moments, part 2 is simply bad (in a boring way) and obviously it is made to squeeze the money from the fans. <br /> <br /> What a shame, Otto Waalkes! <br /> <br /> The only slightly amusing moment in the movie is Helge Schneider, who apparently seems to be concerned about the other characters. It is very easy to identify with him ... <br /> <br /> The script is careless / non-existent. The director should do everyone a favor and give up their work immediately. The acting is worse than a second grade school work. <br /> <br /> Technically, the film is also horrible, but who can blame the directors of photography / sound who had to work with such an untalented director?
