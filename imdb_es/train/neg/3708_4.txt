Down to Earth is about Lance Barton, a black comedian who is hit by a truck. He goes to heaven and gets another body. Lance gets the body of Charles Wellington, a white man. So Lance does some things in Charles's body. The movie has some laughs, but it's nothing special. It's a good movie if you're a Chris Rock fan. Madagascar, the animated comedy of 2005, is better. This is a good movie, but Chris Rock has done much better things than this. It will only make you laugh 4 times the whole movie. And it's not really fun to laugh out loud. You will laugh at yourself and you might laugh, but you will definitely not be rolling on the floor laughing.
