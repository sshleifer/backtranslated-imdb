The film confuses both religious ethics and ideals that fails to create a coherent argument against the death penalty at any level. In presenting the legal execution of a condemned murder as the catalyst for the apocalyptic end of humanity, the film elevates a murderer of parents to the martyrdom of Christ. Somehow, according to the plan, God is outraged that society has chosen to get rid of a fanatic who killed his own parents by setting them on fire while they were sleeping helplessly in their beds. However, this same god has no indignation for the acts of the murderer. The main character, a non-religious pregnant suicidal woman, ultimately gives her own life in a defiant but unlikely attempt to unsuccessfully save this convicted murderer. In other strands of the underdeveloped web, Jesus returns as a helpless and frustrated wanderer to symbolically unleash the wrath of God. The modern lack of brightness of Christ not only dehumanizes him, but also mocks the messianic ideal of all religions. He is incapable of affecting mankind forever and casually skims the limits of life waiting for humanity to destroy itself. Meanwhile, with little help from Jesus, the mentally unstable pregnant woman encounters the ability to reincarnate in her soulless newborn son that somehow saves all humanity from the wrath of the Almighty. I also interpreted it as a statement that supports abortion on some levels. This film, which tries to weave many religious themes in a thriller, fails to point out any religious point that could be interpreted clearly, except to circumvent people's beliefs. It raises many questions that you do not even try to answer. Ignore the religious values ​​of your audience when trying to portray an original version of their compliance. Silly
