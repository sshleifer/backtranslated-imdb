This is one of those movies that is more interesting to watch from an academic perspective than from an entertainment perspective. I make my grades based on how much I enjoyed or entertained me with the movie, so I give it a 4. If I were to qualify it as an academic film, I would get a 10. <br /> <br /> It was filmed in a way very interesting, like a pseudo-silent movie with elements of sound effect and reality. It is destined to transmit the unconnected memory and the fragmentation of the mind, and it is interesting in these aspects. <br /> <br /> However, the movie has many disgusting elements that I did not find so entertaining. They are mainly annoying. It also has some very interesting images and some interesting concepts, but some of the relationships of the characters (especially between the mother and the child) are quite disturbing. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie will attract you or it will not. For me, it was interesting from an academic perspective, but it was not a good watch, and I probably will not use it a second time. <br /> <br /> 4/10 if you are looking for entertainment. 10/10 from an academic point of view.
