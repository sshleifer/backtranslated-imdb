As a true fan of Elvis, this movie is a total disgrace and the script is a disaster. The film begins with the beautiful son "Stay Away" and the Grand Canyon scene gives the viewer the hope of something special. Elvis gets into the image and his talent is wasted in a big way, especially in the rest of the outstanding songs. I sat in this movie twice, just to make sure it's a piece of junk! 1 of 10 !!!
