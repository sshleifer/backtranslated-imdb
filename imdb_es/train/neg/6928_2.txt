All the other comments already said what I was going to say, here goes anyway. I thought this was Italian at first, I'm sorry, Italy.

He saw this in a package of Brentwood 10 and the quality was expected, terrible. Filled with stripes and those things. The movie was an incoherent mess. Silly music and clueless characters. The main guy should have known in the first minute that the doctor was crazier than the patients. I thought that the "doctor" who directed the scene of the "battle" was never going to end. Although I had some beautiful girls. It seems that these stupid movies always throw one or two naked girls and that hooks you. I gave him a 2 for the Nekkid women. That bird that dances people made me want to take my eyes out. Poe probably made about 3,000 rpm in his grave when it came out because it was based on his story.
