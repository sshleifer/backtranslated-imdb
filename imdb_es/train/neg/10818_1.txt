Having read the novel before seeing this film, I was greatly disappointed with the wooden performance and the arrogance of the producers in their blatant disregard of the plot. I feel that this movie in no way reflects the brilliance of Bronte's work, and rather gave the impression of a superficial love story. In the condensation of the film to a short 2 hours, the film lost many of the key features that make the book understandable and progressive, resulting in a somewhat nervous plot with little connection to ground. There is no accumulation of romance between Rochester and Jane Eyre, so this seems quite abrupt and unfounded, since the two characters have such an unusual interaction that you can not help but imagine that their "love" is superficial. This is an injustice to Bronte's novel: you are not given an impression of Jane's extravagant cheek and audacity, which draws Rochester to her, and her arrogance that draws Jane to him. <br /> <br /> Despite the bad writings, I think some of the characters were portrayed very cunningly, namely, Mrs. Fairfax and Grace Poole, however, in general, the production was poor. Given a better script, maybe the movie would have been more successful. See "Jane Eyre" (1970) with Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton for an outstanding production.
