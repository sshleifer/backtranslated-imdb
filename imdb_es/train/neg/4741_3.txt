Wendy Wu: Homecoming Warrior has a very good and strong plot, but it is ruined by cheesy details throughout the film. I am a younger teenager and I did not enjoy this movie very much. I thought the effects were horrible, but they might seem entertaining for younger children. The movements of the matrix ruined the action, you know that it was absolutely false. Then there was the Yen Lo, an evil spirit that temporarily possesses people at random and back home where Wendy struggled to win. Everything ends up like a typical feel-good movie when Wendy and her cousin Buddhist monk Shen defeat Yen Lo (and destroy him forever) in the end. Then Wendy learns a lesson ... blah, blah, blah. I'm ready for the next DCOM.
