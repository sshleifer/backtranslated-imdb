I have always liked the Spike Lee movies, but this was a total loss of 2 and a half hours. I expected more about Son of Sam and instead I got a movie that seemed to have very little to do with the serial killings of 1977. The dog that spoke was laughable (you know you're in trouble when all the sponsors of the film laughed inappropriately). The whole movie seemed very disconnected and not very interesting. The sex scenes were totally irrelevant to the plot. I'm not opposed to sex in movies, but I should have some point (unless it's a XXX movie). In general, we were very disappointed in this effort by Spike Lee.
