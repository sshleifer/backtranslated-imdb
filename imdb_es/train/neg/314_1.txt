I picked up this movie for $ 5 at a discount book store, Adam Sandler is an amazing actor and I thought it would be a good movie, well, it was not. There was absolutely no story at all, bad jokes, and the other comedian said "The F-Word" every other word he said, cursing usually does not bother me, but this was exaggerated. And even worse than the lack of history was the part where Sandler started talking to the camera in random parts of the movie, he reminded me of Dora the Explorer when they turn around, look at the screen and ask her questions. And the last of all is when they randomly place pictures of Bikini girls at random moments in the movie. In my opinion, do not buy this movie, it's a waste of money.
