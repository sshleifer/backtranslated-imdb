Another very bad the lowest one that can go here is one. Otherwise, you would get an easy zero. Truly one of the worst movies I've ever seen. In fact, if Peckenpah's name were not in the thing he had never imagined, he did. Actually, one of the people in San Francisco that I know was on the set a lot and since almost the sunset he says that Sam was just ridiculed. It is shown in swords. The bit of laughter in the first part of the movie is the ONLY thing in this mess that is worth checking out. Even Gig Young is not observable. This is a true test of masochism. If they had forced me to enter the confines of a theater to see it, I would have jumped screaming. And now I really feel guilty for having seen it all from the confines of a comfortable sofa that was too nice to leave. What a disaster, it seemed less written than it was invented as they went. It is not just a bomb but a bmob written backwards. Oh!
