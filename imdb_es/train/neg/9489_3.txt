In theory, movies should be a form of entertainment. While this excludes documentaries and other experimental forms of filmmaking; Most movies, especially genre films, should not only tell your story or message, but should also entertain your target audience in some way. All this just to say that, in my opinion, a bad movie is not a movie with low production values ​​or low budget, a bad movie is a boring one. <br /> <br /> "Hellborn" or "Asylum of the Damned", as is known in the USA. UU., It's a bad movie simply because it has nothing to do, and it's hopelessly boring and boring. While it has a good premise, it is poorly developed and mediocre performance does not improve things. On the other hand, the movie could probably have been a good or even classic B-movie, but here it's just a bad attempt to make movies. <br /> <br /> Director Philip J. Jones tells the story of James Bishop (Matt Stasi), a young resident of psychiatry, who has just landed the job of his dreams at St. Andrew's Mental Hospital; But the old asylum seems to hide a secret. After the mysterious death of some patients and the constant rumors of satanic practices, James decides to find out what is happening; only to discover the disbelief of his boss, Dr. McCort (Bruce Payne), who believes that Bishop is becoming as crazy as his patients. <br /> <br /> Although the premise is quite interesting, the execution of the film is much to be desired In an attempt to make a supernatural psychological thriller, Jones looks for an easy exit and makes a film full of all the clichés of the gender. Of course, there are many great movies that are also full of clichés; but in "Hellborn" each and every one is wasted and becomes a cheap fear to keep things moving, resulting in a boring and predictable plot. <br /> <br /> The acting is pretty mediocre for the most part, with one big exception: Bruce Payne offers a top-notch performance that makes the film seem unworthy of such a good performance. Matt Stasi is very weak, since the main character and the rest of the cast make forgettable performances. <br /> <br /> Despite all these failures, one thing has to be written about "Hellborn"; It has a very good visual appearance for the budget and very similar to the modern productions of Hollywod's "horror" big budget. In addition, makeup and prosthetics are made very well and the designs for the main antagonist are pretty good. Unfortunately, the rest of the special effects are terrible and outdated, which makes a great contrast to makeup and prosthetics. <br /> <br /> "Hellborn" is a movie with some good things that are outnumbered by their serious flaws. terrible results Unconditional horror or fans of film movies may be interested in its premise, but it is a boring and boring experience. 3/10
