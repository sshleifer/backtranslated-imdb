Somewhere I read that this movie is supposed to be a comedy. After seeing it, I would call it anything but. The point of this film eludes me. The dialogue is extremely superficial and absurd, many of the sets seemed to be late thoughts, and despite all the nudity and implicit sexual content, there is nothing erotic about this movie ... they all leave me wondering what the hell this is about! the premise of the title could have been the basis for a funny comedy (if it is politically incorrect). instead, they treat us cheap, amateur, unfinished and depravity sketches and oddities for their own good. If I want that, I'll go buy a cd of grace jones.
