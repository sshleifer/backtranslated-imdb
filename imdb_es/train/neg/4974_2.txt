May the saints preserve us, because this movie is not going to help. <br /> <br /> Someone with access needs to send an email to Mel Gibson and tell him that we need a faithful production of Beowulf. Something that really has something in common with the epic poem that is the basis of all modern western literature. <br /> <br /> Recent versions (since 2000) of Beowulf make us ask ourselves two things. First, why is there so much interest in the story? Second, why do all these filmmakers waste mountains of cash in this garbage? <br /> <br /> The only reason this has two is that the version with Lambert (Beowulf 2000) was worse and needed the 1. <br /> <br /> What is even worse, some people They will see it and get a wrong idea about the poem. How can an industry in which Peter Jackson get a literary conversion to a film so correct that it can do so badly? I mean really, the Roman Forum as a model for Heorot is too much. <br /> <br /> And PLEASE, horns in helmets? Save me This is insulting. <br /> <br /> / hjm
