You remember the Spice Girls movie and how bad it was (besides the songs), well, your manager Simon Fuller (also the manager of this band) makes the same mistake by putting S Club (another of my favorite bands) in his own movie. S Club: Tina Barrett, Jon Lee, Bradley Mcintosh, Jo O'Meara, Hannah Spearritt and Rachel Stevens (what happened to the seventh member, Paul Cattermole?) Basically they ask for a rest from their boss, they continue, and while come on TV! Three of them exchange, and vice versa, half discover that they are clones made by a greedy scientist, and the other half simply get into trouble. Also starring Gareth Gates as a clone of himself. This movie may have more of an argument than the Spice Girls movie, but in addition to the songs "Bring It All Back", "Do not Stop Movin '" and "Never Had A Dream Come True" is not a good reason to watch this movie. Not long after the band separated forever. Suitable!
