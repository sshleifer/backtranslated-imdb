My favorite quote from Crow was that when the car went to the precipice, "the movie is so bad, even the car wants to get out of it!" <br /> <br /> This had to be the funniest movie that I was. have you ever seen. Seriously, I was there to scare you, which makes it even more fun! If it were not for Mystery Science Theater, I would not be here today! :-P
