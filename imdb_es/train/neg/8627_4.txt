Although in general it is an adventure movie of the jungle, it has some highlights: the configuration is quite beautiful and the rhythm of the adventure is good. You will not get bored when you see it. <br /> <br /> Keith is as happy as possible with the leadership of the same name, a shamelessly drunk jungle guide who will escort the rich boy Van Hoffman and his beautiful wife Ducha on an Expedition hunt in the cannibal country. He never takes things seriously. The shower is there as decoration and Keith uses it a lot, she does not have to act much. She is not the only woman who shows her body and the prosperous aspects of the film reach almost half of a T / A image. <br /> <br /> There is nothing in this film that attracts specific attention, or far from that Produced to be shlock, it succeeds without too much fuss. A good 2 AM cable programmer.
