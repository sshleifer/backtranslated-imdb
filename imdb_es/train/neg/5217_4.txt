Meet Peter Houseman, professor of genetics for the rock star at Virgina University. When he is not playing on the court, he is going crazy and taking off his panties in his classes. Dr. Houseman is working on a serum that would allow the body to constantly regenerate cells allowing humans to become immortal. I would also like to be immortal if I look like Christian Bale and get the sweet feminine love that only VU can offer. A variety of old and ugly university professors do not care about the popular Houseman and cut the funds for their project due to the lack of results. This causes Peter to use himself as the guinea pig for his serum. To my surprise, there are side effects and he, understand this, the metamorphoses! in something that is embedded in our genetic DNA that has been repressed for "millions of years". She also sleeps with Dr. Mike's love interest, Sally after a whole day of meeting her. She has a son. His name is Tommy. He is an angry little boy. <br /> <br /> Metamorphosis is not a terrible movie, it's just not a well-produced film. During all the time I saw this, I could not ignore the fact that it was filmed in 1989. The appearance of the film has a quality of the late seventies at the latest. It does not help that it is packaged along with the films of the 70s, since Metamorphosis is part of the 50 creepy classics of Mill Creek Creek Entertainment. Basically there is no difference in film quality at all. The last five minutes are purely bad cheeses of movies that, in reality, for me at least, keep the film of a lower rating. Pay attention to the terminology of the computer, such as "chromosomal anomaly". No wonder Peter's experiment has failed. Your computer can not spell! This is worth a view followed by a trip to your local tavern.
