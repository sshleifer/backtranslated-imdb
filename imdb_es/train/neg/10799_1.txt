This movie is so, so, so horrible, it makes the angels lose their wings. Shaq had tried to make other crossed efforts, such as his work on Shaq-Fu for the NES and his large number of unbearable rap albums, and later, the epic portion of horrible filming that is Steel. <br /> <br /> There's nothing good to say about this movie. I saw it many times when I was very young, but I should have been an idiot then, because this movie takes everything that is nice from the movies and tears it apart. It's fun to tease. A while ago I saw it on the Disney Channel and spent a few minutes doing it. Although, once the emotion of mocking is over, you still feel overwhelmed by your terror. <br /> <br /> If you see it on TV, try this: consider, how are you watching the movie, eliminating all scenes in which Shaq uses his powers of magical genius. If you do, it becomes a movie about a pedophile chasing a child and rapping him to seduce him. That is something funny and disturbing. <br /> <br /> A horrible example of a movie. No, unless you want to make fun, watch this movie.
