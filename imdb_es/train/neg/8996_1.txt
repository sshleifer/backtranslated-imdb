In the future of 1985, a government committee headed by Howard Hesseman will hold hearings on the first uncensored television network. They show their programming, which they play as a series of parodies. I can name the good movies 'skit' in one hand, without using my thumb. "Amazon Women on the Moon", "Kentucky Fried Movie", "The Meaning of Life" and "Mr. Mike's Mondo Video". Notice that I did not mention "Tunnel Vision"? The reason for this is that this "movie" is death in cinematic form. None of the parodies is even remotely funny, not even a bit witty. It takes a great ineptitude on the part of the filmmakers to not even laugh. <br /> <br /> My note: F <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Dody Dorn fills up. frontal
