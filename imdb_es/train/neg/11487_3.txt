Laurel and Hardy's best shorts are filled to the brim with mishaps, accidents and destruction, mostly caused by Stan, but with Ollie receiving the most (!) Of punishment: see the great 'The Music Box' (1933) or 'Towed in a Hole' (1932) as some classic examples. <br /> <br /> Here, however, for some reason (is it because it was based on a sketch by Stan's father?) Children interpret it correctly. 'in a' comedy 'built around jokes and supposedly funny situations. It does not come out. It's just another tedious third-rate comedy from the 1930s, augmented only by the personalities of Stan and Ollie who never really show any of their characteristic gestures (the movement of Ollie's fingers, Stan's blank stares, etc.) or his comic abilities. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with them fleeing from the police. As we never see or know why, it is hard to believe or accept their fear of being caught and, therefore, hiding in Colonel Buckshot's mansion. The premise for "humor", Ollie posed as the Colonel and Stan posed as the butler and the maid are never very interesting. They are not playing 'Stan and Ollie' in this movie. Its parts could have been interpreted by any of the actors in the pedestrian study and would be equally poor. <br /> <br /> Stan could pamper and do whatever he would, but he does not have the opportunity to do it. nothing of that here. It is limited by issuing too much dialogue to "move" the plot, but none of that rises above the foolish. We are treated to the infinite third category comedy chestnuts, like the current gag of not correctly pronouncing Lord Plumtree's name, the "Call me a cab! Okay, you're a taxi!" jokes, policemen losing their clothes and being seen in long vases, and a non-kidnapping ending of Stan and Ollie as the two parties in a painfully obvious horse disguise while they escape on a bicycle for two, and James Finlayson is still doing it takes his full body of the silent era and the Keystone Kop jumps. <br /> <br /> Stan and Ollie do much better in a sitcom in 'Sons of the Desert' (1933), where we can watch them do what we love for them - be themselves. In fact, 1932-34 seem to be his best years. <br /> <br /> Because this movie does not play with any of its strengths, why bother doing it? I have to give it a 3.
