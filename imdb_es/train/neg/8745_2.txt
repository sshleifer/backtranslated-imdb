One more of the extremely unprofessional films about computer programmers. <br /> <br /> It seems that the authors of that film do not know the specific world of the programmers. <br /> <br /> The 20 best programmers in the world, a program that has its own satellites (for what?), a program that uses the satellite frequency, someone kills someone to steal the codes (why?) and many more stupid moments in this movie. <br /> <br /> Towns that do not program You will see something horrible in that movie, because there are no professionals in this. But the people will not see real things. <br /> <br /> Programmers will find that rare and horrible movie, because many moments inside the film are not RELATED in real life (why is not the movie scifi in this case?).
