I'm a Matthew Modine fan, but this movie, with which I stumbled on the cable, is absolutely ingenious. I see that the scriptwriter and the director were the same, so there was no one to control their worst instincts. There are no surprises, no original lines, no original characters. The golden fish was basically the most sympathetic character. What a waste of all this acting talent. Considering how expensive it is to shoot in New York these days, I wonder how this was done in the first place. And if you're wondering why I saw it, it appeared after a movie I like on cable and left it on while working on the computer. It is not a very demanding image!
