Elizabeth Taylor could never act at all and it was just her usual annoying and untalented self in this movie. This was before she got so fat, but she still looked very low and disheveled. Rock Hudson was fine as Bick Benedict, but clearly a more ranked actor like William Holden would have been better. James Dean certainly showed that he knew how to mumble his way through a movie. The whole movie is incredibly slow and lasts too long. The actors were too young and light, and none of them aged convincingly due to bad makeup. Hudson looked ridiculous just for being expelled and Dean and Carroll Baker were obviously the same age. <br /> <br /> 0/10.
