After the debacle of the first Sleepaway Camp, who thought that a franchise could be born. SC II is superior in appearance. More inspired murders and much more fun. While that might not say much (compared to the first movie), Camp Sleepaway II is worth the rent. <br /> <br /> Advantages: Entertain, do not take yourself seriously as SC I. Inspired Killings. Cons: Crappy's performance and the mullets abound. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: 5/10 <br /> <br />
