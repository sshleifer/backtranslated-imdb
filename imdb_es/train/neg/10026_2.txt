I had some expectations for the film, since I had a good cast of stars and it is the return of the duo of Akshay and Saif. Well, I hesitated to see the movie because this was done by the same man who wrote the story for the Dhoom franchise because he hated Dhoom 2; but if you compare Dhoom 2 with Tashan, I would say that Dhoom 2 is very realistic. <br /> <br /> When I saw the credits at the beginning, I felt good because they put it in a nice way. Well, the first scene itself fired me. So, the main drawback of the movie are the action sequences. My friends and I were laughing while we watched these fucking fights. It was like Akshay against about 30 thugs and everyone and the thugs even had machine guns! Go ... you have to see this to understand how bad the action sequences are. <br /> <br /> The other thing about the movie is the story too predictable. It reminded me of some of the early 80s movies. <br /> <br /> Well, the only thing worth the movie is the sexy Kareena, who looked really sexy in this. And so, I give it a rating of 2 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Guys, please ... please ... do not see this one thinking it's a real gangster movie. Well, you can see this to laugh at the terrible fight scenes. <br /> <br /> That's it.
