The history of Paint by numbers and mediocre performance saved by an authentic color, and some really wonderful and deeply felt moments. It effectively captures the delicate transition of a girl to adulthood, and deals very sensitively and inventively with the cultural conflict in the main family experiences. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this germ of a good movie is locked in a world without direction and extremely intricate plot that manages to incorporate religious conflicts, a conflict for a project of construction of a road, the sexual life of secondary characters and even tertiary, a mysterious man who lives in the forest, a group of racist hooligans, at least three different carnivals, the complexities of local church politics, and so on. And all that does not even include the real central plot, which deals only with the hopes, dreams and frustrations of two girls (and their whole families) at the crucial moment of their lives. I was really surprised when I realized that everything was supposed to happen over the course of a summer (and how much film was achieved in 1.5 hours!) <br /> <br /> Ultimately, the movie is melodramatic, every argument The point is predictable, important events happen that alter life and then they are forgotten about 10 minutes later ... and some of those events are extremely unpleasant. The most surprising thing is the fact that one of the characters is involved in a horrible crime (in a totally predictable "turn") and then he is completely forgiven and the whole incident is forgotten from that moment. Similarly, a secondary character is introduced only to die a couple of minutes later and provides another "turn". Everything is totally mechanical, until the end that perfectly links all the loose ends (well, not all, only those that the film thinks you are interested).
