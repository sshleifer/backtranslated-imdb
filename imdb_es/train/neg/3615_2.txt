How come I've never seen or heard about this scrap movie before? It is right in my alley with bloody skills, conspiracies of laughter and an irresistible atmosphere of cheese from the 80s that surrounds it. For some reason, nobody really cares, the staff and students of an elite Catholic university are killed by an unknown psychopath. The newly recruited teacher Julie Parker gets involved when all the people she has contact with die or behave strangely. This movie is hilariously bad! There is absolutely no logic or coherence and all the characters lack meaning for others. For example, there is a murdered girl and her body lying in a container. Then, and for no reason, the story suddenly advances three weeks, however, the murdered girl is never mentioned or even lost. Not even for her boyfriend! The performance is unfortunate and there is not a bit of nudity to enjoy. The revelation of the killer is quite funny because the creators seemed really convinced that it was an original turn ... It is not, guys! "Splatter University" is easily one of the worst horror turkeys of all time.
