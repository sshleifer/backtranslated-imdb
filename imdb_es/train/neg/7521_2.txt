I probably give him more credit than he deserves because it's Halloween, he was only in "Knott's Scary Farm" and he wanted to see a really cheesy Halloween movie. <br /> <br /> Oh, and it only costs me, a dollar. <br /> <br /> Usually, I'll flick through a movie like this to get to "the good things", but I resisted the impulse here and I'm still not sure why. It was obvious that, from the close-ups, this was not a "real" movie, not even a B-movie. It is more in the category of DeCoteau's "horror" movies, such as "The Brotherhood," which are recorded in a movie-like video for around 50 cents (in fact, I was afraid that at some point one of his sturdy college students would stumble when rubbing on his underpants or something). There were no cropped shots (too expensive to make multiple camera configurations) and flat lighting but ... it's hard to identify. There's something refreshing about watching a director without money make a decent movie. The fact that he is doing a decent job is commendable, and this movie has many merits: the acting is not bad, the photography is pretty good (although too bright to be scary), there are some surprises. and everything is kind of ... different in some way. <br /> <br /> A group of university students (for some unknown reason) are trapped in the warehouse where they are decorating the annual haunted house. A spooky old man gives them a satanic book and accidentally gathers the powers of hell. This makes the people disguised in the haunted house become who they are made to be, and cause much chaos and human suffering. On the way, we are faced with a secondary plot of strangely complex and reflective lesbian relationships: it is interesting that this couple seems to be the most complete in the film. Yes, there is a sex scene, but it is not salacious, or at least no more than you would find in a legitimate movie about lesbians that shows you having sex. It is quite unusual for a horror movie to take the time and effort to do so without resorting to cheap exploitation. <br /> <br /> The other thing about this that caught my attention was the way he clearly tried to emulate the "stupid kids who have sex and are killed" from the slashers of the 80s. It's hard to take on that's because there are many of those movies that already exist, the genre has been killed. I'm not sure if it's good or bad that these filmmakers just tried to make another entry in that genre, without irony, as if it were still a LIVE genre, but I appreciated the attempt. <br /> <br /> Which is why I sat through it; Sometimes you just want to see a horror movie without meaning, without a budget, "A-for-effort". There were really too many arrangements, there was not enough gore, endless plots, blind alleys and clich√©s and the unfortunate general feeling of a movie that simply did not have enough money to be the film that the producers imagined ... but at least the scenes of the haunted house were pretty cool. I would pay to go to that haunted house if it existed, and I would not mind paying a dollar to see it on a DVD, even if I would never see it again. <br /> <br /> Oh, and ** possible spoiler **, but there was a big brief business with the vampire in the coffin: "I used to be claustrophobic, but I've changed." Ha, ha, good.
