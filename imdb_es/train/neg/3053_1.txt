Wow. Who said that Edward D. Wood Jr. never influenced anyone? This steaming pile of donkey droppings is a perfect example; makes "The Violent Years" look like "Casablanca"! "Santa Claus" also makes the worst flashbacks of Keith Richards look like my first nighttime broadcast. I had nightmares, you know, when I wake up and sweat bullets, that they will never approach the visceral terror that Santa Claus unearthed from the seemingly pure earth of my own being. However, I can think of some parties in which this movie could go well. Also, if you are looking for the perfect example of a Santa-Satan dichotomy on the VHS tape, look no further. Do not check this movie, as I have been notified that the MST3K version is already available. Move over Satan, here is "Santa Claus".
