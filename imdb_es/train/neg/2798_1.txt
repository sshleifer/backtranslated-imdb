This movie is bad. If you're thinking about watching it, there's only one decent scene in the movie, and it lasts about 5 seconds (the topless scene of Amanda Carraway). The rest of the movie is horrible. I think high school plays probably have a better performance. The plot does not make any sense at all. The set was quite scarce, and it was not even good to make fun of him. It was boring and very very bad! I saw this in Starz, so I thought it had to be at least decent. The mini description sounded like it was fine. The girlfriend kills herself for what apparently has no reason at the beginning of the movie, after you have to watch a horrible music video. The transitions between the scenes are VERY abrupt and it is as if someone had put a lot of clips in a movie without even thinking about how to make the transition. Only cuts from one scene to another, without softness. Something like my random change from talking about how bad the movie is, to explaining why the plot is crap. The audio is exhausted in some points, where you can barely hear it, then it becomes strong with the 'screams of horror' of homosexuals released in random spots of the film. It's the same sound every time. This is now officially the worst movie I've seen <br /> <br /> Acting: 0/10 Effects: 1/10 Story: 0/10 Music: 3/10 <br /> <br /> Lame-meter: 1,000,000 / 10
