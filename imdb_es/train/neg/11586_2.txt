A nightmare on Elm Street: The Dream Child <br /> <br /> This is a bad movie. There is no escape. I love the series and I think Freddy is probably the best character of all the horror movies. But even being a fan, I can not help but see that this movie is mediocre. <br /> <br /> It's not even an effort to build an interesting story and strong characters. By now they had surrendered. They do not even try. Of course, they are producing, expecting a few dollars easier. <br /> <br /> The story does not appeal to you. It's so simple that it's almost absent. <br /> <br /> Alice, a survivor of part 4 is now pregnant. Freddy is coming back through the baby's dreams. At first we learn that to stop it, Alice must find her mother. And that is. <br /> <br /> The story progresses slowly since there is a plot so small that it becomes quite boring after a few minutes of bad dialogues and a horrible performance. In fact, that's the only thing that's scary, acting, since the deaths are not even slightly cold. <br /> <br /> The characters are so uninteresting that we could not care less about them. <br /> <br /> The girls are the least attractive possible. The whole cast reminded me of a bad amateur theater group. I have seen better actors in school plays. It really is shameful. <br /> <br /> Lisa Wilcox still manages to bring some class to this. She is beautiful, sexy and has some talent. But the material simply did not let it shine. What a pity. <br /> <br /> The work of Stephen Hopkins is nothing like the brilliant direction of Renny Harlin in Dream Master. Try some imaginative shots near the end, but the tension that Harlin and Craven created so well in previous films is nowhere to be found. <br /> <br /> The Dream Child is just another unimaginative sequel. It's the kind of movie that gives the horror series a bad name. <br /> <br /> The ending for which Freddy once scared. It is very sad to see him now. A clown who is not funny. A bad joke Goodbye frdy
