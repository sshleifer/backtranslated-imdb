Really an amazing stack of pap! <br /> <br /> A predictable, slow-moving, soul-destroying movie that numbs the mind, in which, cutting its own wrists with a rusty bread knife seems ... well, almost necessary. <br /> <br /> The acting is over for the slim dialogue, each scene lasts at least twice as long as it should be, the intricate details of how this race is collapsing or that career is increasing is too sad and worldly for words. The music would be good if you did not have to sit in the movie, but in reality, three good songs are not a sufficient reward for the effort required to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie, I prayed for God for narcolepsy or for someone to shoot me. <br /> <br /> Never, never, never again.
