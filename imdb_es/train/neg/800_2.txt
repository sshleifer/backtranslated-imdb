Actually, this film, made in 1999, has pretty good production values. The actors are attractive, and reasonably talented. There are not a lot of clowns running at full speed, spending hundreds of assaults, but never hitting meat. Nor are there chases / clashes of wild cars in which thousands of dollars of beautiful machines are destroyed uselessly. <br /> <br /> The interiors look respectably modern, architecturally, and the equipment is up to snuff. Well, there's a high-tech computer room furnished with what looks like the remnants of a 1950s electronics lab. And the pancake makeup on the corpses cracked me. It's not pancake makeup in the conventional sense, but what appears to be a dry pancake dough stuck on your exposed skin. This is supposed to support the idea that bodies have calcified, although how the virus would achieve this transmutation is an exercise left for the student (viewer). <br /> <br /> Oh, yes, the virus. I would like to tell you that this is not the absolute worst premise for a science fiction movie, a horror movie that I know, but I can not. A computer virus that is transmitted through a television screen (or computer monitor) and becomes a lethal biological pathogen? Give me a break. Warp units to the "Star Trek" are one thing, but the photons become viruses? This is so foolish that the desired "fear factor" is simply not achievable. The movie could have used one of those horrible dream sequences where the dead come alive, or make a cat jump out of the closet, or something like that, because the viral thing is not doing it. <br /> <br /> It is assumed that Robert Wagner has the same excuse to play in this madness that Lord Oliver gave for some of his later and poor quality places. I needed the money. However, no other comparison between the two should be interpreted.
