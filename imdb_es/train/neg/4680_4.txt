If you asked me how I would define the word "Superficial", I would answer "See a Jerry Bruckheimer production". If you asked me how I would define the phrase "Potential wasted," I would answer "See a production by Jerry Bruckheimer." Bruckheimer's productions are almost always sure of blockbuster successes, but almost always receive critical criticism from critics. From the top of my head, I can only think of AN OFFICIAL AND A KNIGHT and BLACK HAWK DOWN getting many critical compliments. <br /> <br /> CRIMSON TIDE also received some praise from critics, it is undoubtedly one of the best Bruckheimer films that unfortunately does not say much. The problem I had is the scenario that establishes the story: the Russians are fighting against the Chechens and the conflict spreads throughout Russia, leading an ultra-nationalist Russian to take a nuclear missile base and threaten the West if they interfere. Maybe the end of the cold war had everything to do with this, but I found it very unconvincing. It is not helped by some errors in geography, such as the French company Foch in the Mediterranean (would not the Foch be better positioned in the Black Sea?) Or that the exhibition newsletter consists of familiar images with conflicts in the Balkans, the First Gulf War and even Vietnam. Once again the adjective "Very unconvincing" slipped into my mind. The story gets a little better when the story itself - A battle of wills over orders between a commander of a nuclear submarine and its number two - gets under way. The director Tony Scott does his best as the cast, but the problem still lies in an unconvincing scenario. The worst thing is that if this had been done in the mid-1980s when WW3 was a real possibility, it is very likely that this movie would have terrified me, but after the Cold War the dangers of nuclear war also mean that CRIMSON TIDE has little impact
