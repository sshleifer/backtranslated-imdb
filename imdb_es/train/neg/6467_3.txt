I still can not believe this movie. They have so many incredible things in it, that it's hard to believe that anyone would want to do it. <br /> <br /> The story is a joke, but in the sense of being fun, but rather like no story. How can you mix a slapstick comedy with a train robbery, a prison movie, city conspiracies, sexual jokes and an FBI agent? You can not. <br /> <br /> In addition to the frightening direction, the most notable are the actors. I saw this movie and I thought: 'Is this really Marlon Brando? No, it can not be. (5 minutes later) Is this Charlie Sheen? Wow, maybe Brando is true. (5 minutes later) This can not be Donald Sutherland. (5 minutes later) No, do not look Sorvino. This movie is very bad for all of them. (In the end). No, no, no, this can not be absolutely Martin Sheen! Not for 10 seconds of a movie like that. Then it was over and I went down with my nerves. So many good actors, Oscar winners, usually convincing in such a stupid, stupid and horrible movie. I rarely wanted to know how they came to act in this case. They could not get that much money. <br /> <br /> Just a stupid and incredible movie. <br /> <br /> 3/10 \ 1/4 \ 5 (1+ - 6-)
