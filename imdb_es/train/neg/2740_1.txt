I still do not know why I forced myself to sit through the whole thing. This "movie" was not worth the Memorex DVD-R on which it was recorded; I thought I was seeing the end result of a group of high school students who stole their parents' camcorder. This is by far the worst movie ever made. Really, from the bottom of my heart, I want to sue Aaron Yamasato for the two hours he stole my life. <br /> <br /> Then, apparently, it's supposed to be bad on purpose; However, if you end up in hell and you're forced to watch this 90-minute doo-doo reel, you'll see that Yamasato is really trying to make an incredible movie. The actors try incredible dramatic performances comparable to Crimson Tide, but they are closer to The Marine. <br /> <br /> The acting of the shit is just the tip of the iceberg. The camera angles are horrible. The story is, at best, a C movie: the plot is not even good enough to be considered a B movie. The dialogue tries to be dynamic and witty, but it's crap like everything else. It is rumored that a copy of the script actually attracts flies. Also, the techno score is annoying ... not because it's techno, but because it's NON-STOP. That's right, the music plays in the background ALL THE TIME, acting as a subliminal reminder of how bad this is. I do not care what the disclaimer says, I do not buy it. BOTS did not get so bad on purpose, since he took himself too seriously for what he was: a joke. <br /> <br /> This "movie" had a very low budget. But that's not an excuse for its record-breaking suction factor. Great movies are born of substance, not budget. BOTS did not have any. <br /> <br /> Let me further articulate the overwhelming power of this 90-minute waste of time: if I were having a trio with Jessica Alba and Jessica Biel in front of a TV and Blood of the Samurai, I would get out of there faster than Steven Seagal in Executive Decision. <br /> <br /> Certainly, some people will try to defend the movie. Two, maybe three. They will say, "It's a grinding spit!" or "cheesy in a good way!" or "it's so bad, it's good!" These people are idiots. A movie is good or bad. There is no such thing as a good bad movie. But THERE are things like idiots that like fucking movies. Do not get me wrong There are many movies that are not to be taken seriously and that are fun and entertaining. Slither is one. BOTS is not. <br /> <br /> This suckfest takes about an hour and a half, and in my humble opinion, it's 90 minutes too. The best thing about this "movie" is the cover of the DVD, so the next time you're near the bargain of the Wal-Mart DVD, take a look, DO NOT TOUCH it, just look, and walk away in silence.
