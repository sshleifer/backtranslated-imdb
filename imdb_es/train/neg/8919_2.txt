I saw it for the first time when it was selected as a suggestion from my TiVo system. I like Danny Elfman and I thought it might be interesting. On top of that, I'm a fan of Max Fleischer's work, and this started with the appearance of his 30s cartoons. With both, I thought I would keep my interest. I was wrong. Just a few minutes, and I had the fast forward button down. I checked it in about 15 minutes, and I thought that was it. <br /> <br /> Then, I read some of the other reviews here and I realized that I had not given him enough opportunity. I recorded it again and I saw it through. There are 75 minutes of my life that I will not go back. <br /> <br /> I can not believe there are not more negative comments. Personally, I think it is because it is difficult to reach the minimum of 10 lines of comments. How many ways are there to say that this is a waste of time? <br /> <br /> The film appears as if it had been made by a few high school kids who were ready to outrage the world and think they can do it with breasts and blasphemy. , and sucked jokes. The characters are flat. The parody of "Swinging the Alphabet" is scanty, essentially improvising the melody, beating the A - E, reaching the obvious profanity with an "F", and then having no idea where to go. The trip through the intestines until the expected landing does not work the first time, let alone the following ones. <br /> <br /> In general, the full movie is what you would expect from someone trying to "get out of South Park" Stone and Parker without the ability to determine what is and what is not fun. This could be fun if you are tall. Otherwise, it is not.
