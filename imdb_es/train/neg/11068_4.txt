Dahmer, a confused young man. Dahmer, a confusing movie. Okay, I had a few beers while watching the movie, but that does not explain why this movie bored me so much. <br /> <br /> His flashbacks are nothing but confusing and annoying, and there is no real story with a beginning and an end, the only thing that made sense in the movie was the explanatory text at the beginning and end of the movie. The intermediate things, what would be the movie, are boring images and a waste of time. <br /> <br /> We never see real murders, everything is just a lot of innuendo. Sometimes, it even gives you the feeling that Dahmer is dreaming about everything, but you know that it is not, since it is based on a real story and this really happened, at least for the most part. But what happened? It is not easy to say. <br /> <br /> I do not encourage people to waste time in this movie. <br /> <br /> I did not like it a bit and I felt cheated when it suddenly ended. <br /> <br /> * / *****
