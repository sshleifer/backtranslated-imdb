I'm not one of those who think that King is a great writer, his books are good distractions for a few hours and often have interesting premises, however, in my opinion, they fall apart pretty quickly if you give them a serious thought . br /> <br /> This movie suffers from being a fairly accurate version of King's story. If you have read the book, there are no surprises, no changes, no alteration of scenes or characters. This is a movie made by King fans for King fans. <br /> <br /> For the rest of us, there's nothing terrible about the movie, it's a horror of "gypsy curse", with its touch it's the curse. Something that many people want, to lose weight. The last third has some serious structural problems, and the slightly forced end seems to break the rules of this genre a bit. <br /> <br /> There are worse ways to spend 90 minutes of your life, but you can also do it. read the book, because there is nothing new here ... <br /> <br />
