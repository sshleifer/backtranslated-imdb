This movie was terrible. I have given the highest score of 2 as I have seen worse, but very few. <br /> <br /> From the beginning cliche to have the end of the film at the beginning and return to the beginning at the end this film used everything in the box of tricks used in the making of films just for the sake of it, as a child with too many toys. There was an endless, boring and repetitive narrative, slow motion, frozen frame, flashbacks and combined images, etc., none of which made a boring movie any better. <br /> <br /> It is called "16 years of alcohol", but there was little drinking or drunkenness and no representation of the withdrawal with the movie jumping everywhere with no coherent sense. The story was poorly written and extremely pretentious and the address was equally poor and it is a pity that people have contributed more money for more films of Mr. Jobson, previously known to be in a group of garbage and on television, making so much sense like this. The movie yes. <br /> <br /> I found a great struggle to see this until the end, but hoping it would improve, I continued with the bitterness, but it really was a waste of time and it would have been better not to disturb.
