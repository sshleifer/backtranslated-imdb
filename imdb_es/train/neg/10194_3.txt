This 30-minute documentary made by Bu単uel in the early 1930s about one of the poorest regions of Spain is, in my opinion, one of his weakest films. First, let us admit that 70 years later, Spain is much richer than it was at that time (and when I say this, I fully admit that wealth can bring its own problems, such as excessive individualism and consumerism, although in general wealth is a great difference, better condition than the extreme poverty described here). And if poverty decreased in Spain, it was not exactly with the kind of socialism that Bu単uel favored, but with Western-style capitalism. But one of the most striking things about the film is this: in one scene, the narrator reprimands that in school, children are taught the value of Pi. Teach mathematics to the poor, the horror! Bu単uel's myopia is more evident here, without realizing that it is access to the latest knowledge and technologies that will help the poor to overcome their situation. What is he proposing? That children are taught exactly what they do at school? Does Bu単uel not understand that it is the lack of modern technology that has made them poor compared to other people?
