When I bought this DVD, I thought: "It seems to be a good and funny comedy about love and relationships invented according to Portuguese standards. It was TOTALLY BAD! What a disappointing movie! First, it is not a comedy; It's a cheap drama that can be so melodramatic that it's even worse than many Portuguese telenovelas! Second, the plot is so boring, and it does not lead anywhere. It has no structure, it just flows, like the wind, in one or the other direction. Production is also bad! The sound mix is ​​horrible, because sometimes the voices are disconnected. It reminded me of some old Portuguese films from the 80s? The performance should have been better too? Well, to summarize, it is not with films like this that Portuguese cinema will improve! In fact, it was one of the worst Portuguese films I've seen in recent years! Bad argument, bad performance, bad production. I did not have much hope for this movie, but it was much worse than I had ever imagined! Just forget it!
