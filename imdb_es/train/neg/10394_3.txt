With Knightly and O'Tool as protagonists, this movie had good possibilities, and with McCallum as the bad guy after Knightly, maybe some tension. But they threw it all away on a silly afternoon and then with remnants of Maudlin's war. Of course, it was totally superficial, beautiful English country and next to the sea or not. The number one mistake was getting rid of Knightly so early in the movie, when he could easily have played someone a couple of years older, instead of electing someone ten years older to play the role. They lost all the chances of having a great conflict between the cast, and instead, they stupidly threw out the elements of the easy and inexpensive heart.
