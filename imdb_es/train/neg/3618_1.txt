The story full of clich√©s of an impending divorce, is not it? - through the eyes of a 6 year old boy. Dialogue of Corny, cardboard characters, stock situations, a plot of zombies with false leads and, worst of all, absolutely no reward, either emotionally or dramatically. <br /> <br /> Nobody teaches creative writing anymore? The true sign of a weak narrator, when you can not create any kind of satisfactory outcome, simply finish the story. I feel compelled to ask: "What made you think this was a story worth telling in the first place?" <br /> <br /> Good, but wasted, debut of child actor Anthony De Marco; the rest of the cast was, at best, forgettable. And they wonder why nobody sees independent films! This is ninety minutes of my life that I will never go back.
