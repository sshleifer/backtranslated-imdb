What about Robert "Pretentious" Altman? Was I saving on lighting? Everything was so dark in this boring movie that it was ridiculous. I mean, have you ever seen a lawyer's office where everyone works by candlelight? <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time. In fact, do not waste your time with anything Altman does: everything is a waste of pretentious film.
