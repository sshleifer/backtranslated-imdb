*** SPOILER *** Do not read this, if you think about watching that movie, even if it would be a waste of time. (By the way: the plot is so predictable that it does not matter if you read this or not) <br /> <br /> If you're wondering if you'll see "Coyote Ugly" or not: no! It's not worth the money for the ticket or the VHS / DVD. A typical "Chick-Feel-Good-Flick", you could say. The plot itself is as superficial as it can be, a ridiculous and uncritical version of the American dream. The pretty young girl from a small town is becoming a big hit in New York. The few desperate attempts to give depth to the film fail, such as the "tragic" accident of the father, the "difficulties" of Violet's relationship with her boyfriend, etc. McNally (Director) tries to awaken the grief and sadness of the audience, he has no chance of succeeding in this attempt due to poor script and superficial acting. Especially Piper Perabo fails completely to convince one of the fears of "Jersey" to sing in front of an audience. The only good thing (and quite funny) about "Coyote Ugly" is John Goodman, who represents the small ray of hope of this movie. <br /> <br /> I was very surprised that Jerry Bruckheimer produced this movie. First "Gone In 60 Seconds" and now this ... what happened to the great movies like "The Rock" and "Con Air"? THAT was the true thing about Bruckheimer. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a superficial movie with attractive women to have a relaxed night, it is better that you go to see "Charlie's Angels" (it is much more fun, entertaining and self-ironic) instead of this movie. <br /> <br /> Two thumbs down (3 out of 10).
