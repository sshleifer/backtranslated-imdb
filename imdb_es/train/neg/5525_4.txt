The problem with family dramas is that, outside of television movies on channels like Lifetime, most people do not want to see them. And those that are observed tend to be sensational and refer to current problems or problems in the news (or recent news). Movies that explain or explore the human condition are not popular. Particularly with the young crowd that would be Miss Lohan's fan base or the younger people who tend to make the films not simply popular, but financially successful for the studios. <br /> <br /> The specific problems I had with this movie is the caricature of some of the characterizations. It was very much to blame the entire performance of the character of Lohan (ruining the car, the use of drugs, etc.) to what her stepfather did to her. While it is not unlikely, it is only a little bit to wait for the audience to swallow. In addition, other aspects, such as giving the young morman, oral sex, or the fact that he would actually be a good assistant to the vet, who happens to have something for his mother, etc., all these elements simply did not. It really helps this movie along. He placed it more in the element of a sitcom that proved one of his "special dramatic episodes" and did it for a well-made and well-written film. <br /> <br /> When you look at the DVD and listen to the commentary, particularly for the various alternative endings, you can really see that all this is a clear focus.
