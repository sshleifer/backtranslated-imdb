> warn you that this is a spoiler! > This movie is so bad that I doubt I can write enough lines. Great direction the shots were well thought out. The actors were very good, particularly Richard Pryor, although I would have liked to have seen more of him. Madeline Kahn and John Houseman were classics. Dudley More than God bless him he could have done better. John Ritter again I would have liked to see more of him. In my opinion, this failure is entirely due to the failure of the writer. Maybe the producer could have disconnected once he saw what he was creating. It's a shame that so much money came into this boiler, when with a small change here and there, in my opinion, I would fix it. They should have paid the writers' standard rates. To produce a giggle.
