Although there is a repertoire of more than 180 films to choose from, this 'Succubus' is often named as THE best movie by Jess Franco. Hell, even the legendary filmmaker Fritz Lang has 'Succubus' among his personal favorites. So, maybe it's me, but I thought that this was a terribly boring and too confusing movie. However, the opening is excellent and shows Janine Reynaud performing an act of SM on stage. Everything is downhill from here, unfortunately. The character of Reynaud is a maneater who eventually kills his lovers in a kind of trance. Franco had a decent budget for work and spends it well in nice places, beautiful photographs and a fascinating musical score. This COULD have been his best movie, if it were not for an uninteresting and uninteresting story. It is supposed to be psychedelic, but I would say that sophomoric is a better term to describe what is shown here. Half the time, he has no idea what is happening or exactly what is said, so even the short operating time of 80 minutes seems to last for centuries. This is certainly not the best Franco movie according to me. I would not even recommend it to the exploitation fanatics. If you are looking for a more superior Jess Franco movie, try to get 'The Vampires', 'The horrible Dr. Orloff' or 'Vampire Woman'.
