Being a Buster Keaton fan is having a broken heart regularly. Most of us find Keaton in one of the brilliant feature films of his great period of independent production: 'The General', 'The Navigator', 'Sherlock Jnr'. We recognize him as the greatest figure in the history of film comedy, and we want to see more of his films. Here the anguish begins. After 'Steamboat Bill Jnr', Keaton's brother-in-law, Joseph Schenck, pressured him to sign a contract that put Keaton under the control of MGM. Keaton became just another actor, playing scripts for someone else. Then his alcoholism worsened. After 'Steamboat Bill Jnr', Keaton never made a truly first class film again. A couple of sources describe a possible masterpiece comedy that Keaton claimed he * almost * had to do at MGM: a parody of 'Grand Hotel'. Biographer Tom Dardis has offered convincing evidence that Keaton invented this story. <br /> <br /> The anguish increases because, between the many years of Keaton's constant decay, he occasionally came up with a good movie ... such as his short comedy 'Grand Slam Opera'. I continue to search for the lost footage of the dramatic scene of Keaton with Spencer Tracy in 'It's a Mad Mad World': a sequence in which Tracy's police bitter a retired thief (Keaton) and tries to enlist their help to steal the money from Smiler Grogan. It is almost certain that this recording is gone forever, but I'm still searching. <br /> <br /> 'Speak easily', unfortunately, it is one of Keaton's films since the beginning of its decline. MGM was trying to develop Jimmy Durante (who, coincidentally, played Smiler Grogan three decades later) as a new comedy star. Unfortunately, MGM tried to develop Durante by joining it with Keaton, whose comedy style was simply incompatible with Durante's. (I'm a fan of both.) Throughout his career, Durante was a ruthless scene thief: he was praiseworthy, he knew they were building it at the expense of Keaton, and Keaton was the only co-star that Durante never tried to climb. to stage . <br /> <br /> Keaton was often chosen as the victim of extremely cruel machinations. In "Speak easily," he plays a didactic and humorless Middle School professor named Post (because he is as cunning as one) who receives a letter informing him that he has inherited $ 750,000, which must travel to the city from New York to claim. Do you make a phone call to verify this? Do you even check the postmark? Do not; He takes his life savings out of the bank and rushes to New York. As soon as he's gone, Post's servant confesses that he wrote the (fake) letter to push Professor Post out of his routine! <br /> <br /> Post, who thinks he's a 3/4 millionaire, runs into Jimmy Dodge (Durante), who is trying to produce a music magazine but has no money. The characters that these two brilliant comedians are playing on the screen simply do not intermingle. Keaton plays one of those eggheads (like Mister Logic in 'Viz') that intellectualizes everything. During play one of those annoying hepcats that is unable to make a direct statement because the script requires that he always speak in the jargon. There is a painfully unfunny dialogue scene in which Durante tries to talk to Keaton about money, but, instead of saying it clearly, Durante has to use more and more suitable jargon terms like "kale", "cartwheels", etc. . while Keaton, of course, has no idea what it is about. I'll give Keaton credit: his own dry, dusty prairie voice, his Kansas flat accent, is absolutely perfect for the character he plays here. <br /> <br /> Sidney Toler, with a much slimmer and more attractive look here than he would be just a year later, is impressive as the excitable director of the magazine funded (online) by Professor Post. Henry Armetta, whom I've never found funny, is even less funny than usual here, offering a joke with a stupid reward. Thelma Todd impressed me here, in a more villainous version of the role she played in 'Horse Feathers' (a much more fun movie). Edward Brophy, one of my favorite actors of the characters, is wasted. <br /> <br /> Part of the problem with "Speak easily" is that the secondary characters behave in a completely inappropriate way. Keaton's lawyer appears in the theater of Durante with an urgent message for Keaton ... but he is not there, so the lawyer proceeds to divulge Keaton's personal affairs to the first stranger he knows. (Join that lawyer, Buster!) In another scene, Professor Post, the guy who perceives that he is ruining this musical, enters the costumes of the choir girls, and all the choir girls chilan and cover themselves immediately . I know for a fact that the girls in the modern choir * would never react in this way, and I seriously doubt that the choir girls in 1932 behaved that way either ... certainly not in response to the 'angel' who controls the activities of his shows <Br /> <br /> THE SPOILERS COME. Approximately half the time in the funny little "Speak easily", the genial Jimmy Durante sits on the piano, smiles at the camera and makes a distinctive gesture with his head as he begins to play a melody. This is the moment in which I thought that, finally, this film would finally be established in its purpose of entertaining us. Oh no. The most annoying thing of all is the end of this film, which uses the most trite and implausible cliché of all comedy: that in which an absolutely incompetent imbecile becomes a star comedian through his own ineptitude. (Keaton would be forced to reproduce this cliché in an episode of 'Screen Directors Playhouse' in 1955, Chaplin had already used it in 'The Circus'). <br /> <br /> I almost cried, with anger and pain. In the wasted opportunities in 'Speak easily'. Especially out of respect for the work that Keaton, Durante, Toler, Brophy and Miss Todd have done elsewhere, I will rate this movie 2 out of 10. <br /> <br />
