A young man kills a young woman for no reason. The man's brother is imprisoned on charges that he was an accomplice, but soon escapes. When escaping, the apparently innocent man kidnaps three victims and soon attacks his girlfriend in the plot. If this is not bad enough, the situation quickly spirals downward. <br /> <br /> This movie had some good aspects and many bad ones. Her strongest appearance was the lead actress Emily Haack. Leaving aside the fact that she is naked in a good amount of this film, she is presented as a decent actress and a very strong character. I do not see why she can not take this experience and somehow turn it into a career in some way. He was convinced that he was a ruthless person. <br /> <br /> In addition, the creators of this film were very bold and made no effort. Graphic nudity (both male and female), coprophagia and extreme anal violence are not avoided. I like my horror films to push the limits a bit, and he ignored them completely, jumping happily towards Gomorrah. Maybe it was too much, but I think they achieved what they were looking for. <br /> <br /> But now the negatives. First, and most notably, this movie has a very low budget and the quality of the film proves it. I can excuse that: the plot was decent, the performance was good and in some scenes the low quality film actually made the movie more disturbing (a more realistic feeling). Therefore, I will not scold them for having low quality equipment. What I will scold is the use of bad choices in the shots. For no reason can I determine (in addition to filling the film), there is a large amount of images from a cemetery. I really do not know why, and frankly I started to fall asleep at this moment because it was very long and useless. <br /> <br /> It also seems like a problem with the title. The idea here was to trick people into thinking that this movie had some connection to the classic "I Spit in Your Tomb". Now, there is a line that seems to imply that the main character is the daughter of the woman in this other movie. And the themes are very similar (a woman who takes revenge on men). But there is no firm connection and the reason why this title was chosen was that the customers of the video store thought they were getting a sequel. This was deceitful and dishonest. <br /> <br /> My last important complaint is that this plot does not make any real sense. Not even a little bit. A woman is killed at the beginning for no reason. A fugitive from prison finds time to kidnap people to torture them, for no reason (why did they hurt his girlfriend?). The same man goes from good to very bad without explanation. Similarly, the female protagonist (Haack) turns from a normal person to one who is too cruel and sadistic, for no reason at all, and against people who for the most part were only a little insignificant to her (a neighbor who offers drugs for sex is wrong, but in no way worth being tortured by). <br /> <br /> Do not let this title fool you, or the claims that the movie is incredibly shocking. Yes, some scenes were shocking, but the vast majority of the movie is boring and makes you want to take a nap. If you see this in the video store or on Netflix, just keep browsing. Or rent it, and we can sit and relax for hours. You have been warned.
