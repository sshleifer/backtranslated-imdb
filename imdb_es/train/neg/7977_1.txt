Well, Jesus from Montreal is basically a smart movie. The actors are really good and the technical part of the movie is fine. But, although I was very interested in the subject and I liked to think and discuss about religion (I'm an atheist), it was difficult to force myself to see the film with a bitter end and, in my opinion, somehow unconsciously funny. Why is this movie so incredibly boring? I do not know. It simply is and that is why it is not recommended.
