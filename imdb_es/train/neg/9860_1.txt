I usually like movies like this one. It's a documentary style, but acting and writing are horrible. The performance is wooden and rigid and the writing is so clich√©, but by no means is it good. When writing this, I am surprised that it is in a 5.2 / 10 in IMDb. I am sure that most of these votes should come from family members of the people in the film. I guess if that's the case, you could laugh a couple of times, since it's always funny to see your family / friends make a movie. Well, in a way, I suppose this gives hope to all future writers, directors, actors, etc., because if they can do it, they can do it. Although, maybe you should not.
