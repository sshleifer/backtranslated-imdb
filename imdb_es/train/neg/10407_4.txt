I discovered that Tremors 4: The Legend Begins was boring and boring. All the action scenes were stupid. The so-called "GRABOIDS" are reduced to the size of a modern domestic cat, if not smaller. The performance was horrible, and this movie was just an unnecessary film in the Tremor saga, because although it tells the story of how the graboids were formed, the story is so silly and useless. Also, if you want to tell a story in time, make sure you use the SAME ACTOR (Michael Gross), to be someone in the past, when you are someone in the present in the other Tremor movies. Geez ... If you have not seen this movie, do not waste time. Tremors, 1, 2 and 3, to have a good time. However, this movie ensures that the remote control is sitting next to you with the STOP button for a quick removal of this nonsense.
