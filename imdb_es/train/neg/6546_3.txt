The old axiom that boring people are boring people is well demonstrated in "Mujeres enamoradas". The script, taken from the novel by D. H. Lawrence, contains an endless stream of concepts that, in the best of cases, are sophisticated. <br /> <br /> What a pity that so much effort has been made in such an empty exercise! what an empty matrix of characters paid such attention. Despite the high production values, this movie is as tedious as its staff. <br /> <br /> A revision in 2001 simply confirms a 1969 impression of youthful minds in adult bodies, without delay anywhere, and clumsy at every step of the way.
