The worst movie of David Lean. Even 'In what we serve' was not as bad as this. In general, a movie with a really good reputation like this has at least some redeeming qualities, which makes one understand why it could be considered a classic. But after seeing this, I just could not understand why this piece of shit was so nice even in 1945! I did not like the way of acting, the rigid British gestures of the upper lip, the story, the script (which can be quite ingenious at times but totally without grace) and the soundtrack. Elvira's character is meant to be attractive and attractive, but in reality he was ugly and had a strange and annoying voice. Just another movie that has convinced me not to trust the reputation of a movie. Another British classic very overrated.
