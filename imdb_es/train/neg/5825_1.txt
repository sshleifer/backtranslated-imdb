This has to be one of the worst movies I've seen! There were people leaving the theater, others were falling asleep (well, it was a nightly show) ... This is a meaningless movie, one that can make you never want to see an unusual image again. I would love to see how this film is made, since I am deeply interested in what goes through the minds of the authors of this type of garbage. Do they laugh when they create all these ridiculous things or do they really think they are doing something interesting? I wonder ... The soundtrack is horrible, apart from some instrumental things that remind you of a previous Bjork album. Even if you are a fan of Bjork's music, stay at home. It's the best that you can do. Small, small, pieces of good music are not a reason for you to come out and submit to this torture. God!...
