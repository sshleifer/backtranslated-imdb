This film changes from 4ยบ to 1ยบ without bothering in 3ยบ or 2ยบ, rectifying the gears until arriving at the line of end of film b, sappy. The scam at the beginning is easily the best and most intelligent part of the movie. That is worth seeing. The scene with Harlow in the bathtub happens so fast that I may miss her. Definitely not worth all the ballyhoo provided by Robert Osborne in his introduction of TCM to this confusion from bad to mediocre. There is no real conflict, and all the characters in this supposedly marginal society turn out to be saints, especially the incredible character, Al. I wonder if he has a job for me in Cincinnati.
