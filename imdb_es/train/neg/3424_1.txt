You can never have seen any of the movies and still know that The Jerk Too is a disaster. The question is not "how was it done", because if you throw money at someone and tell them to make a movie, they will do it. <br /> <br /> No. The question is "Why, oh, why, did Steve Martin allow it to be done?" I think he needed the money to fight a lawsuit for annoyance and he was determined that it would not cost him anything. I knew that the sequel was going to be so scary, that out of pride, I would not even consider copyright as income. <br /> <br /> The only way this sequel can not be a shame is that Carl Gottlieb and Steve Martin revive the nation's poor black favorite family. <br /> <br /> And "dcreasy2001" (also known as Mark Â¿Blankfield?): It's just obvious that you worked on this movie with some ability, and the only way you can feel better about getting involved is to be the only cheerleader of the sequel as a comment of an IMDb user. I was praying for you to turn to satire, but, unfortunately, you were really making an effort to turn. Why not 10 stars?
