After reading the reviews, it became clear that everyone intellectualized this work. How absolutely boring. Oh, what about the good times and there was nothing like it. Of all the comments, nobody expressed any emotion for this work or for any other. <br /> <br /> I grew up just after the end of the steam age and this cinematographic jewel along with Dan'l Boone appeared in the matinees on Saturday afternoon. . This was an annual movie that made the rounds and filled the seats with screams, buzzing, farts, giggles, snot monsters like me or myself. And it was a movie filler at that time. Almost as big as the Wizard of Oz. <br /> <br /> IMDb insists that each review contains something about the plot. The problem is that it was more of a template. Here it goes. Randolph Scott (cowboy / hero) gathers friends and goes to defeat those evil people. Hurrah! <br /> <br /> All of us, the children, discovered that plot before we moved our room down to see it. That was just about the plot of every Scott movie, John Wayne, Roy Rogers ever made. If you take the time to go back and review each and every movie, just do not ask for surprises. <br /> <br /> One must remember the context of the times. There was not a little television. None for children. There was school. It was outdoors. There were toy guns. There is no cybernetic time. And the steam age had just collapsed. But films like this provided entertainment and filled the imagination of the young people who beat children. Even the girls got into this. <br /> <br /> This movie was entertainment. And it is as carefree as anything produced today. It had a purpose originally to be propaganda. But they quickly became children's movies. <br /> <br /> Our parents had experienced reality. And it would not be until Sam Peckinpah, a decade later, who finally lavished the red splashes of imitation blood in realistic and plentiful quantities. Not until his post as director, someone died slowly, with great pain and miserably. Until the Peckinpah war and the gun fights were a pretty bloody affair. Thanks Sam. <br /> <br /> Watching a movie had little or no blood, adults did not care. They would not have tolerated it, I think. No guts spraying the shattered plant life. So this movie had all the glory and nothing bloody. Gung Ho was suitable for the children then. <br /> <br /> You will see that I assigned a four to this rating. Why would I do that? All right. It is a terrible movie. It does not matter how I love him. I love this movie because it gave me back one of the happiest moments of my childhood. But it's not so good of a movie in terms of quality. Basically, Gung Ho happened to become a romantic novel for children. <br /> <br /> In case people see it. Of course. I'm not saying to stay away. Realistically though. The plot is simple. The shallow characters? they are shallow You can love a bad movie.
