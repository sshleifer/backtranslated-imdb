Horrible end, and I can not believe that Moore has spent a year thinking about it. Smacks by L. Ron Hubbard and Dianetitcs, which Hubbard claimed to have written in only three weeks. Actually, this was disappointing enough to release my records from the first 3.5 years. Now, the first 1.5 hours were full of action, although absurd in the premise, and then deteriorated into a slow, painful and hot-headed dissolution of the series. Incredible how slow and prolonged was the last hour. Should we think more deeply? If I wanted a lesson on materialism, I would read Daniel Quinn's Ismael again. It is absurd to think that 38 thousand people would renounce everything for a "new beginning". Absurd shooting in a missing Kara, and a reappearance of Baltar and Six. Absurd pull on the mitochondrial eve. Simply absurd.
