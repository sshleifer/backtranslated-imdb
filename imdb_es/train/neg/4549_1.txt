Amateurism best describes the film adaptation of the best-selling philosophical novel "The Celestine Prophecy," which follows the spiritual awakening of a teacher without work in a mysterious village in Peru. The actors of quality of homemade video present to the called personages who exhibit an overexcited exhibition and a metaphysical hokum, whereas the film is impelled by the extremely strong direction of Armand Mastroianni. Although there are visible attempts to measure the most interesting and interesting fans in the vacancy of "Lost" of ABC or "The Da Vinci Code" by Dan Brown, the filmmakers are not up to the task. This film reeks of an ill-conceived spiritual propaganda of mass consumption, and the results are so terrible that few can go through this mess to detect a real point.
