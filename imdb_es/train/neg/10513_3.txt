This movie was almost a waste of an hour and a half of my time. In general, I like cheap horror monster movies, but this movie was a disappointment. The main defect is the lack of explanation of the creatures. When they entered the house and found the man who could have at least explained. He really does not say anything about them, except that they killed his parents, and, unless he missed something, he did not say how he managed to escape ... Not to mention the fact that he does not give any clue or reason why only the Survivor stays and essentially feeds the creatures after his own near-death experience. It would seem that she would have had the opportunity to leave after the "cross incident".
