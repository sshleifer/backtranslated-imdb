This is only beaten because it is starring David Hasselhoff. Well, then let me hit him. Compared to the garbage they call horror today, this movie is not so bad. He has the beautiful Leslie Cumming. She is super hot, but she can not speak very well. There is a great scene with her when she is raped supernaturally. She shows her good body. Linda Blair does not do anything here as well as Hasselhoff. 3/10
