I like musicals, but as a fan of Dickens, I hate this one. ** MILD SPOILERS ** Hungry children who have enough energy to sing and dance in the workplace? Do the poor people of London come out to sing? Fagin and Dodger walking towards sunset? Not exactly true to the novel. As I recall, Dodger was hanged publicly and Fagin went crazy in jail. ** END OF SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Oliver Reed is very weak as Sykes, doing little more than growling to indicate his evil. The worst, however, is Mark Lester as Oliver, who is often so clumsy and passive that you wonder if he is really the main character. Their interpretation is not affected in any way by the fact that the best they can do when they sing is the voice in a girl's voice. I guess they did not realize that you can find triples in almost every church in England. <br /> <br /> Fans of Dickens who respect themselves: follow the incredible 1948 film by David Lean or the 6-hour adaptation of the BBC since the mid-twentieth century. -80's. Avoid this inflating of lime in a musical.
