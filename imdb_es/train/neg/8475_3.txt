(NOTE: I thought I would be the only one who would write what I did next, but I see that the others agree.) I guess it was pretty obvious: this was exaggerating the bit of bait-cat.Anyway, here's what I had written :) <br /> <br /> The owners have gone on vacation for two weeks, a trip to California, leaving the cat (Sylvester) completely alone and locked in the house. That means there is no milk, but the cat, to his relief, finds a lot of canned tuna. However, to his dismay, he can not find the opener. <br /> <br /> It turns out that the little mouse in the house has it ... and cheats the cat with it. This is a bad rodent that keeps bothering Sylvester with the opener and then retiring at the last second. Sylvester tries his best to open the tuna can, but he can not do it. <br /> <br /> This is a frustrating story, and why they make the sadistic mouse the "good boy" surpass me. It's like in some of Tom and Jerry's cartoons where poor Tom always gets the worst, even though the mouse often starts the conflict!
