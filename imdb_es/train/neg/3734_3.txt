A true and confusing incomprehensible mess. Most of the things in the film look more or less like 1987, but then there are futuristic things that are thrown, like the policeman's lightning gun. And that car! The director seemed to be in love with colorful lights. The only really remarkable performance was the girl who played Valerie, but since there was no cast, I do not know what actress that was. This is worth losing. Grade: F
