I did not expect a movie as good as "In The Line of Fire" or an episode of "24", but it seemed that this movie was made for television and did a mediocre job at best. The (good) cast could not disguise the fact that the plot was too predictable and the actors had to fight (I think really the best they can) through their lines of bad scripts, giving their characters quite flat some extra. When I saw the movie, I had the feeling that I had seen most of this in other (best) movies. In it you had car chases, big shootings, romance, plot twists, etc., etc. This movie does not have any. <br /> <br /> ** Spoiler ** As soon as you see another woman talking on the phone with the character of Cuba, you know who is behind all this and all the suggestions they are giving you ("you stand too close to the President, you see it from my perspective ... ") sounds silly. <br /> <br /> If it were up to me (and maybe it's good that it is not), I would rewrite the plot in this way: <br /> <br /> The first lady orders the murder of her husband because she is sick and tired of writing checks to Cuba all the time.
