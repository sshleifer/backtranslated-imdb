Announced as a sequel to The Full Monty, about unemployed men in Sheffield, this movie is fake. <br /> <br /> As a person born in Sheffield, and still with ties to the city, I was very disappointed. this movie. Someone said he could have settled in Oklahoma, and that sums it up for me. This looked like a romantic view of northern England made for the American market. Probably many Americans, and many Englishmen from the south, do not realize that Sheffield is a large city of around half a million inhabitants, with a sophisticated urban culture. In Among Giants it was like a small, semi-rural city, with no exit and dreary, where everyone in Sheffield seemed to drink in the same old-fashioned pub, and where the idea of ​​a people's party was to dance in a row somewhere village. Similar. This was a small, united community, not a metropolitan city. <br /> <br /> The working-class men of Sheffield were totally different from their real-life counterparts, who are generally taciturn and communicate with each other in grunts and brief words. Dry comments They do not chat, and they certainly do not sing in choruses. <br /> <br /> Even rural settings, supposedly in the Peak District, seemed strange to me. I recognized some places where I used to go hiking, but some of the aerial shots of the pylons that stretched over a desolate landscape reminded me more of Wales. In fact, in the credits at the end I saw a reference to Gwynedd, Wales. The Peak District is, in summer, full of walkers and tourists in cars. It is located between two large cities. It is not a kind of desert. <br /> <br /> As for the idea that a young woman could fall in love and covet Pete Postlethwaite, that was ridiculous and could only have been a male dream. His reasons for becoming his mistress never became evident. It was not shown that any of the men had a partner or family; They existed in a vacuum. <br /> <br /> Anyone who would like to see a movie about the unemployed, the Sheffielders would have been diverted. This Sheffield only existed in the minds of its middle-class writers and filmmakers. <br /> <br /> It was a gigantic fake! <br /> <br />
