For some strange reason, the world of cinema is driven by fashion. Someone makes a movie about a killer shark and, suddenly, the oceans of the movie world are flooded with giant squids, killer octopuses and sea monsters of all types. A man is harassed by a former lover of hell, then all the characters in the film are harassed by a policeman from hell or a roommate from hell or a nanny from hell. Then, when a large Hollywood company produces a huge budget success with a lot of successes about tornadoes, then other film producers get in the car, the fact that they do not have the budget to do so does not stop them. NIGHT OF THE TWISTERS is an example of this. What struck me about this movie for television is the fact that it tries to hide its lack of budget by cutting advertising cuts. Each time a tornado appears, the camera looks at the horrified expression of the actors as they shout things like "Oh, my father is heading like this" and "Run for your lives", then the screen fades to black, what saves producers the need to increase the special effects budget. Unfortunately, the budget of NIGHT OF THE TWISTERS should have been increased to include better actors. The cast is not at all bad, but they are not impressive and lack the ability to carry a movie directed by the characters. Where are Josh Hartnett and Elijah Wood when you need them? <br /> <br /> And the last word that it's a TWISTER clone ... Yes, NOTT was released a couple of months before TWISTER, but TWISTER had been touted for several months as the blockbuster Summer of 1996 and NOTT has a rushed feeling that leads me to believe that it was made and launched to link with the hype surrounding TWISTER
