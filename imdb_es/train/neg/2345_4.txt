I watched "Written on the Wind," starring Rock Hudson, Lauren Becall, Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone. Robert Stack was terrible, just horrible. He was supposed to be a charming jet-jet millionaire. Go: the plot was stupid and exaggerated and the 3 "romantic" drivers had no chemistry. Somehow, Dorothy Malone won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, although her corny character was boring, I think Splendor in The Grass's older sister was full of malice and bitterness and lacked charisma. Director Douglas Sirk has the entire cast overreacting through dialogue that felt forced and the end result was a 99 minute loss. He had a cameo from the actor who played the boss of Get Smart.
