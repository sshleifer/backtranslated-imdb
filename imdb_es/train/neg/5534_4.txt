I'm working on the collection of the Horror Classics 50 movie package and REVOLT OF THE ZOMBIES is one of the set movies. I'm seeing them with my future seven-year-old daughter, which makes most of these movies become laughs. <br /> <br /> I had high hopes in REVOLT OF THE ZOMBIES, after seeing White Zombie, who is really the precursor of so much that he is the pillar of the zombies in the cinema (think of Clive Barker's Serpent and the Rainbow and Live and Let Die, James Bond's funeral scene, NO Night of the Living Dead). <br /> <br /> However, although the title includes the word "zombies", it is little more than a love triangle, involving the anthropologist Armand Louque, who is in love with Claire Duval; who in turn is taken with his partner Clifford Grayson. At a yawning festival, my daughter fell asleep halfway. <br /> <br /> I had a hard time deciphering who these people worked for: the allies or the axis; But, I think that does not really matter. <br /> <br /> I was surprised to see Bela Lugosi in the credits of this movie; but, of course, those were his eyes (from White Zombie) that served as the mind control device for the zombies.
