I've been willing to put up with a lot of the action / action movies at the end of spring / summer, but in general it's due to the fact that most of them have reasonable benefits (ie, great special effects, interesting plot twists, comic value, etc.). Steve Buscemi, etc.). This movie, however, had none of this. All we got was the cheap emotion of several minutes from the cleavage of Eva Longoria (a theme of Maxim is cheaper than a movie ticket). There is a shameful lack of argument, suspense, background story, character development, continuity, etc. I would like to go into details, but frankly I have already forgotten the part of the film, maybe willingly. <br /> <br /> During all the time I was in the theater, I kicked myself for not only spending the afternoon watching a season of 24 on DVD. Save your money in this case, friends. Unless, really, really, you really like Eva Longoria's cleavage.
