First of all, this is a very old-fashioned film, not focused on its exposition of the left political revolution. Honestly, when someone says that the only way to be truly revolutionary is to stop being intellectual (which in itself is quite absurd, since the answer was obtained precisely because it is intellectual) it reduces me to despair; As if we were all monkeys again in the name of equality, it's just ridiculous. Our intellectuality is just one of many human qualities, but this does not mean that we should not educate ourselves to the greatest extent possible. But, undoubtedly, this non-educational message is related to the use of rock music by Godard; therefore, The Rolling Stones. <br /> <br /> The song "Sympathy for the Devil", whose creation we witnessed, and of which the film takes its name, is not really anything special. The sequence of chords, which is not especially original, was used for a much better effect on Led Zeppelin's 'Thankyou' (Led Zeppelin II). Apart from that, 'Sir' Mick Jagger declares with his generally hazy style (like Bob Dylan) - notice how the first melodic phrase repeats itself in an unimaginable way to form the verse. <br /> <br /> In addition to the fact that The Black Panthers represented in this film do not seem to know why they are fighting, the most interesting scenes involve the equation of fascism with pornography; a message that, in fact, undermines the sexual "liberation" of the 60s and today (in fact, a message that would disprove the behavior of the Rolling Stones at the time the film was made). <br /> <br /> No wonder, the DVD came free with The Sunday Times! For a truly profound historical exposition of the sympathy of the left, listen to Luigi Nono's masterpiece, 'Al Gran Sole carico'd'amore'.
