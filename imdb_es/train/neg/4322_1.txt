Keep reading and take note: you could save 88 minutes of your life (that was it!). <br /> <br /> Without qualms, this film proposes to produce (I suppose) a small modern city. American Christmas Fable in the Capra style. If it fails ... it totally and absolutely fails. I've been trying to think of something good and I can not. Let me mention some of the highlights ... <br /> <br /> People do not die, they spend eternity as immigrant workers in the Santa factory. The angels are actually former cowboys who sit in the trees. Santa can bring the people of death (if you send him a good letter). <br /> <br /> And the plot ... I will not spoil it for you, but there has to be some light in the movies, only to contrast with the darkness but there is none. Even the photograph is somber: the snow is shown at the end of a freeze, everywhere it seems cold, damp and miserable. <br /> <br /> As you can imagine, the film has a happy ending (schmaltzy). What a relief !
