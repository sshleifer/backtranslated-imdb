This is one of the worst movies I've found, but I want to say that some of the criticisms I heard turned out to be unjustified ... <br /> <br /> As far as pure filmmaking technique is concerned, this director is competent. It is limited by the limited budget and the VHS camera, but the actual editing, the camera angles, the camera movements and the staging of the scene are quite professional. I have seen many movies where the "address" was much worse. At least the scenes flow in a way that is not confusing and has some smart takes here and there. In addition, the scenes of the forest contained a decent atmosphere. There's only so much you can do with a VHS camera, and he does a good job with regards to the technical aspects. As for artistic merit, there is none. The scene in which the camera moves down so we can see a man peeing in the forest for 15 seconds, is a kind of personification of the artistic style of the whole movie. This is pure garbage ... Total garbage. <br /> <br /> The gore is decent for a movie in this budget range. It's obviously fake but there's a lot of that, and it's very extravagant .. I saw the American version with intentionally campy dubbing. This was a good idea (and it's the only thing that allowed me to get over the movie) ... Unfortunately, it's exaggerated, especially towards the end. <br /> <br /> It's really a terrible movie, but I have to recommend it for its camping value. It is really hard to find a movie that is worse than this and that puts it in a unique category.
