I really have no idea why some people think that the Power Rangers TV show is even remotely interesting. The costumes are completely ridiculous and the people who wear them also look completely silly at the same time. There is absolutely nothing remotely interesting about the Power Rangers. This is just a higher-priced television commercial designed to sell extremely cheesy plastic trash to unsuspecting children around the world. From the notes, I can see that it has been banned in the country of New Zealand and from what I have seen, I can agree with your decision. Avoid this show at all costs, it is terrible and ridiculous.
