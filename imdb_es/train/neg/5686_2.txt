Hi. This is my first comment for any movie I've seen. I took the trouble to do this to tell everyone that this is literally the most unpleasant movie I've ever seen. I feel that the movie became porous, which will give me some understanding due to the budgetary restrictions to make it. I felt I was watching a very bad remake of the movie's saw. In what I agree, I also saw that it is very graphic, but I liked the saw of the film. <br /> <br /> The scene in which he carries the hammer to the head of the victim tied in the chair is the most disturbing scene I have seen. The scene lasted almost forever, well, actually, it probably lasted about 5 minutes, but still. I want to point out that I like some horror movies and I give credit if they are good. this director, uwe boll, and his group of people who used to make this movie, should think about it before making a similar one. a final note haha! FOR ALL PEOPLE WHO ENJOY SEEING ANIMALS THAT FIND DEATH, THAT LET THEMSELVES, WITH WOMEN AND CHILDREN, AS WELL AS IN A SCENE OF FIVE MINUTES OF SOMEONE WHO ARRIVES A HEAD WITH A HAMMER, then he will enjoy this movie, if no, and you'll like the horror, go with a bigger budget movie, as I saw for example. I can not believe that people really make movies like this. Anyway, I'm sorry for anyone who loves uwe boll and took it seriously, this is just my opinion about the movie.
