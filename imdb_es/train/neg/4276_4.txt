This series overrated and of short duration (two miserable seasons) is as experimental and unique as a truck driver who goes to a strip bar. I'm not sure what they mean by "innovative" and "original" when they flattered Lynch and his silly little television work. What exactly is your criterion of what is original? Of course, compared to the "Bill Cosby Show" or "Hill Street Blues" it is original. Insurance. Next to "Law and Order", TP shows originality to the left and the right. <br /> <br /> TP fans often say that the show was canceled because many viewers were not smart enough, open enough for the supposed "rarity of the show" ", their supposed savage wit, or whatever As a fan of rarity, I have to correct that misconception.There is nothing too out of the ordinary about TP, it is just a pretty observable, rather silly whodunit that circles in circles, weaving nets in every corner, but (or because of that) ultimately, it is not going anywhere, the supposed rarity is always forced, the characters do not behave strangely as much as they behave in an IDIOTIC way half the time, there is a difference ... <br /> <br /> Every time I see the sequence of the "strange dream" in "Living In Oblivion" in which the dwarf criticizes the director (Buscemi) for succumbing to the tired old application of -Un clich√© of the scene in a dream, I think of Lynch. Do you want weird? "Eraserhead" is weird, in fact, it's more than strange, it's basically abstract. Do you want a unique television show? See "The Prisoner". Do you want a strange looking cast? The films of Felini and Leone offer that. TP looks like a police drama about television in which all young people look like fashion models. The cast gives TP a plastic appearance. Kens & Barbies en masse. <br /> <br /> In fact, one of the TP producers said that Lynch was looking for "unique faces" for the series. Unique faces? Like Lara Flynn Boyle's? Sheryll Fenn? Do you like those "uncles" with an effeminate face that come directly from the catalogs of men (or gay magazines)? Do not get me wrong there's nothing wrong with getting an attractive cast, especially with beauties like Fenn (the way Madonna would look if she were 1000 times prettier), but do not say you're doing a "strange show with strange-looking people " "And I never understood Lynch's strange fascination with Kyle MacLachlan (I should get a medal for bothering to write his name correctly.) It's not unpleasant, but it lacks charisma, it seems a bit too smooth and polished. his character were not entirely interesting, just one of Lynch's many attempts to force the oddity, trying to live up to his reputation: he had completely lost his advantage, but this time, everything Lynch did after "Elephant Man" was far inferior to his first two films, and what followed were often mediocre efforts that relied on Lynch's relatively small but fanatical fan base to keep him in the public eye when interpreting meanings in his bad stories. made that do not contain water on closer examination, in other words, Lynch is the favorite of all aspiring intellectuals. <br /> <br /> So Laura Palmer was murdered by her dad ...? I was obsessed with the devil or some of that nonsense. It's the best that this "big mind" could have ... You have horror films from B movies that end with more originality. <br /> <br /> Lynch is not smart enough or tough enough to create an incredible story. <br /> <br /> Go to http://rateyourmusic.com/~Fedor8, and see my "TV and cinema list: 150 worst cases of nepotism".
