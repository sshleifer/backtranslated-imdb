I saw this movie last night and it disappointed me a little. Many of the "facts of time" were muted. At the beginning of the film, Grandpa made a comment to this grandson and his friends about how they felt when the 9-11 hit. This movie was supposed to take place in 1994. In addition, one of the grandchildren's friends was wearing an Eagles Donovan McNabb shirt. He had not even been recruited yet. The story line was good, but the facts and the reality of the time frame were so far from the base that it made the movie seem corny. My boyfriend is an avid reader of books and memories of World War II. I rented this movie with the hope that it was good. The performance was regular. The dog was cute. But the way this film was made, I was happy to have paid only 4 dollars to rent it, instead of the 50 that it would have cost me to see it in a theater. I hope that whoever reads this understands that I do not mean any discontent with those who fought in the war, but that the facts and the time frame should have been monitored a little more closely.
