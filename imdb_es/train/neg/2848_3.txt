... so I thought I'd say a few words about William McNamara. It's not a bad way to spend a couple of hours if you want to see it in your little friends: it's obvious that he got into this role and he looks pretty good in them, or less. There is an extended sequence in a cave where you have to undress until you get to your underwear. There's a nice little bit where he has to chase Miss Eleniak in the buff, with only his hands cupped over his groin. William McNamara is naturally a little skinny, but he has a handful of nice and generous booties. Also, there is a time when you are getting out of bed and if you stop the action at the right time, you can see the whole enchilada. If you feel inclined to do it, and come on, half of the people who decide to watch a movie about Navy men on a "road trip" are. I would just like to thank Dennis Hopper for his free nudity and equal opportunity. Can William McNamara act? Heck, I know.
