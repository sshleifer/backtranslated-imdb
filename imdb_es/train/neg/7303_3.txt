Cabin Fever is the first feature film directed by Eli Roth. Roth and Randy Pearlstein wrote the script for a Roth story. This is a zombie movie, which owes much to George Romero and his previous "undead movies", and to the original Texas Chainsaw Massacrenot does not mention "Evil Dead" by Sam Ramie. There is nothing original here, and the story is not convincing. The performance is on par with this genre, it's just that the story fails. We've seen this movie a lot before. and better said. Having said that, having achieved the commercial, if not artistic, success of this film, Roth decided to be a director and went out with the garbage hostel abysmally atrocious, petty, meaningless (though much more ambitious). I should have resigned while I was behind. Cabin Fever is not a good movie, however, compared to Hostel, it is a work of art. I hope that someone (preferably a psychiatrist) convinces this guy that making movies is the wrong choice of career. Cabin fever, a weak 3/10 for not being as aby smal as hostel.
