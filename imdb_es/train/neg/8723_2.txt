Very bad movie. Very, very, very bad movie. It's a rarity, but definitely not worth hunting. The Italian jaw scam makes little sense most of the time, and the rest makes no sense. The "alligator" is not at all convincing, and many of the subplots are not going anywhere. If you're in the local video store, you might want to see it if you're a fan of monster movies, but it's not worth looking for.
