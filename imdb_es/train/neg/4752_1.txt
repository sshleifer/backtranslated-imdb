I heard many stories about this movie that is great ... Well, I took a chance when I saw it for a cheap price on Ebay last month. <br /> <br /> I saw it and I only have a few comments about it: <br /> <br /> 1) Terrible story-line, 2) Terrible acting, 3) Bad fighting scenes ... <br / > <br /> I have never seen a worse movie in my life, so far away! When the story is bad, at least it makes the fights more interesting. BOTH they get ridiculously bad ... <br /> <br /> * The only positive thing about this movie (in my opinion) is Nikki Berwick. God, it looks good in this movie. <br /> <br /> That's it ...
