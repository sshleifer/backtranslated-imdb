Boris Karloff is Matthias Morteval, a moribund and lonely lunatic who lives in Morhenge Mansion with some servants and tells his doctor friend: "Do not try to cure me, doctor! I'm disgustingly healthy!" Invites his nieces and nephews to his house and warns them that they may have inherited a genetic disease that causes madness by "shrinking the brain" (?) <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** <br / > <br /> Morteval / Karloff ends up dying, and murderous "toys" (designed by his dead brother) begin to kill their relatives. A mini cannon shoots real bullets in a boy's face, a life-sized knight in armor attacks with an ax, and a dancing sheikh stabs people with a knife. A boy who is strangled makes some funny faces. In the end, Julissa and her boyfriend discover that Karloff is still alive and hidden in the dungeon where the steel doors close the room. Play the music of the theme of the recurring organ (a kind of death rattle used for the murders), the spirit of the brother begins to speak ("The whole house will go with me!") And the mansion is on fire. <br /> <br /> This nonsensical mess is too dark, boring and the stupid dialogue never matches the lips.
