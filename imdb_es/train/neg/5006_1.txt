Nothing like a movie about a group of friends who not only all dislike each other to the point of loathing, but have little or no redeeming qualities to make an audience like or empathize with any of the characters. There are films so bad that they are good (like the Ed Wood movies or Tod Slaughter), and they are just bad (like 99% of Uwe Boll's "work"). This movie is barely tolerable even if you are an MSTie engineer with brilliant talent (for example, Mystery Science Theater 3000). Fortunately, although I'm quite talented in that aspect (that's how my mind works all the time), for those who are not so talented in the MSTie riffing, finally in the movie * this * you just want to get your head off. painfully aware that the movie "Taboo" steals him about an hour and twenty minutes that he will never come back. Even my MSTie talents were just a competition for this slow and boring waste of time. The most disconcerting aspect of this movie is that * someone * lit it up in green and / or funded it ... I rented "Taboo" only for the talented Amber Benson, who clearly must have been blackmailed to make this movie. I have another lesser-known film of her in my rental queue, the critiques I read best first. Ironically, the best aspect of the film was its impressive maze-like mansion for its interior location.
