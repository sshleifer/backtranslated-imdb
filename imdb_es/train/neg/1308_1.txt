What really excited me with this movie (that is, what makes me physically sick with this movie) is that someone really paid to have it done. There is absolutely no purpose for the existence of this movie. It is not frightening, it does not provoke thoughts, it is not entertaining, it is not good. It's a sleeping pill made of cyanide. The DVD case compares it to Blair Witch, Evil Dead and some other decent movies, which makes the filmmaker's desperation evident. It's nothing like any other movie ever made; It is much, much worse. The claims of an "extremely shocking ending you will never forget" are the equivalent of a ton of stinky horse droppings. Please, do not waste your time watching this piece of garbage, as it can make you sterile. The man who wrote this film must be erased from the list of members of the Writers' Guild, and he should never be allowed to film anything again. Because if you thought that THIS was a movie that was worth doing, it probably does not have much to offer in the future. Zero stars. May Grod have mercy on the soul of anyone unfortunate enough to see this. I'm going to throw up now.
