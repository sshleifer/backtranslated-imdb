Filmography: excellent, beautiful camera angles (I do not remember having seen a movie in recent times, with good close-ups, until this). I could have avoided gruesome scenes with a soft camera. NY is fine in the photo. I liked the inverted angles, in particular (a different touch). <br /> <br /> Music: It's not impressive. The songs do not stay in your mind even after watching the movie. It may be, I expected the same quality as "Anniyan". A disappointment. <br /> <br /> Actors: Kamal needs to slowly move away from the hard core action sequences. His age and his belly really appear. In addition, you should avoid close romantic sequences in the future. It was very uncomfortable to see a mature / aging star trying to play like the scenes of more than 20 heroes. Love can be expressed at any age; as we get older, you can still express love kindly from a distance (without touching a woman too much, for example, the love expressed by Rajinikanth in "chandrmukhi"). <br /> <br /> Jyotika simply appears for the namesake in the movie. I'm not sure why he accepted this. Well, that's not my problem, I suppose. <br /> <br /> Others simply have a small presence. <br /> <br /> Direction: I expected Gautham to stand out (or compare) with his other movie "Kakka Kakka". He disappointed me. It took a long time to launch the movie due to several problems. It slips in few scenes. Even the most important things slipped from a famous director. <br /> <br /> In general: just a good movie. Too many graphics. DEFINITIVELY not for children (and adults who expect some type of "Entertainment"). <br /> <br /> Thx
