I found a DVD of "I Dream Of Jeanie" in the $ 1.00 container at Wal-Mart. When I saw that it was the "story of Stephen Foster", being a musician and a music educator, I had to see it. I had no idea what year it was done because it did not say anything on the cover, just that it was a remake of the "Sewanee River" of 1939. Bill Shirley's performance of the composer is sometimes painful, sometimes laughable. The man DOES NOT have testosterone and is a wimp in everything! I find it hard to believe that Stephen Foster thought that music publishers were doing him a favor by publishing his songs ... without paying for them! In addition to that ridiculous idea, there is a segment of almost 20 minutes of Ray Middleton and his "black face" Christy Minstrels playing the songs of Stephen Foster that was hard to see, to say the least. I can hardly believe that anyone considers this film appropriate to resuscitate in our current time. It is a shame and must remain forgotten. Fortunately, Stephen Foster's songs will NEVER be forgotten ... also, Jeanie de Eileen Christy's performance was undoubtedly the highest point at this lowest point in Hollywood history.
