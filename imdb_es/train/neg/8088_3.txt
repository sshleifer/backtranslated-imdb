To make a good movie you need excellent actors or an excellent director. You need at least one of the two. In this Eye of the Needle we have none. <br /> <br /> I do not even remember the name of the director. He must not have done much in his career. I like Donald Sutherland a lot, but he can not be the main actor in a movie. He falls short. Sutherland is excellent in a movie when it appears for no more than 15 minutes. I would say, for example, that Sutherland was excellent at Oliver Stone's JFK when he spoke with Kevin Costner at a park bench for 10 minutes without stopping without even breathing. Wonderful. But it's not good that Sutherland is the main actor in a movie. <br /> <br /> Kate Nelligan? She is probably good for television series. The DVD is horrible. Terrible colors Terrible light I could not even appreciate the landscape of Storm Island because of how bad the photography was. <br /> <br /> This story by Ken Follett was good, but it's a shame that they made it into an uninteresting movie.
