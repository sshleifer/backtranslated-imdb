A crazy madwoman with a totally black cast trying to find out who murdered the trumpeter who was about to go to Hollywood to make it big. Was it his wife? His girlfriend? His future girlfriend? His father? Your butler The newspaper guy? Who knows? Who cares? The result of this is a bit disappointing, and the actors here do not really make me want to worry one way or the other when I discover it. Why the snake venom as a weapon? Who knows? Who cares? The music in this is fine, but there is little of that, and most of it is quite "let's finish with this" This is not worth your time. There are better movies cast completely in black out there.
