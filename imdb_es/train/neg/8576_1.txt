The solid entertainment of the comedy, with musical interludes, generates a fast rhythm that advances with a vertiginous rhythm through a maze of funny and funny complications. Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi and Peter Lorre form a strong structure of sinister villainy. The script contains all the accessories of standard mystery film: sliding panels, secret passages, thunder and lightning and poisoned darts. Karloff, Lugosi and Lorre are dedicated to reading heavy and melodramatic music evident from the gas age. Kay Kyser and his band offered great entertainment for people who lived in the 1940s trying to forget the horror of World War II.
