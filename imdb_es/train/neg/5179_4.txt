['Without the effective indulgence of the supernatural or poetic nuances of humanity, all that this creative team should expect is the effective use of its mediocre and non-original elements. The &quot;party of the five&quot;, which has become manic and then genetically inescapable, has little interest in rooting because the singular non-homicidal element is a &quot;Wes Bentley&quot; mopester of gentle second-class action. In fact, the whole performance is deep skinned. Even though dark-haired women appeal, salaciousness is kept to a minimum. There is no nudity here. There are also missing enough blood cubes. All the sensations are kept at a mocking, safe distance ... an unfortunate fact considering the given name of the directors is &quot;butcher&quot;. Only the soundtrack, the angsty alt-country drone and the tense fluctuating score provide a palpable tension. Sometimes, some static storyboard compositions add attractive low angles that add to the discomfort ... but for a movie called horror, I did not even come close to shuddering once. Perhaps a greater emphasis on social rejuvenation through the ingestion of blood, scenes directed with variable geometric shapes outside the square, and a sustained focus on fun through the evil of the family or the traps that the characters Supporters need to escape to escape their dilemma, it would have improved my opinion. But this was not a good start for my trip through the most horrible thing.']
