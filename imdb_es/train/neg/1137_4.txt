I tried twice to go through this movie, happening the first time, and it was like pulling teeth, and failing the second time in spite of a great DVD transfer. The problem? It is simply too boring. <br /> <br /> If you can get to the dramatic court scene, which occupies most of the second half of the movie, you already have it, but it's hard to get to that point. There are some interesting talks of "Abraham Lincoln" (Henry Fonda) during the trial. The end is moving when Lincoln moves away and they superimpose his Memoral statue on the screen. <br /> <br /> It's a good story, well acted and such ... but it lacks spark in the first half and discourages the viewer from hanging there. I suspect that the real Abe Lincoln was much more interesting than this movie.
