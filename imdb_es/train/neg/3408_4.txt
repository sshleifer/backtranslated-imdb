I was in second grade, 12 years ago. I remember it clearly. We were learning about space. All young children want to go to space, right? Well, after seeing this, I was so scared to death that I would 'accidentally' be thrown into space by a psychotic robot with a one-track mind. I had no idea that this was a movie. I thought it was a news program or something. I guess it was my own version of when people got scared by the radio show "The War of the Worlds." So, recently, I see this movie again to see it, when I realized that my favorite actor, Joaquin Phoenix was in it (then known as Leaf Phoenix). I can tell you that I was laughing at the dramatic parts and I laughed even harder at the performance. I mean, when Andy is in space, she moves in slow motion, did you ever notice that? I do not think being in space makes you talk so slow or think it's slow. <br /> <br /> The best part is when Andy is knocked unconscious by the oxygen tank and starts to float backwards when the security doors close. . Little Max is trying to catch her. Suddenly, we have a big close up on Max's face when he screams (in slow motion) "whaaaaatttt'ssss happpeniiiinngggg?!?!?" I had no idea.
