Aldolpho (Steve Buscemi), an aspiring filmmaker, lives in a battered apartment in New York and depends on his mother to help pay the rent. He has a beautiful neighbor named Angelica (Jennifer Beals) who may or may not be married but Aldolpho would love to star in his movie. When Al unexpectedly receives a financial pledge of funding for his film from a strange man named Joe, he believes it came true. That is, until Joe takes Al along on an adventure to steal a Porsche as part of the financial backing. Will the film be made before Aldolpho is completely without a moral backbone? And, will Angelica star in the movie? This is, in the view of this viewer, a horrible movie. The script is abysmal, with a plot that wanders willy nilly. Beals practically entangles all his lines and Buscemi, although pleasant, is indescribable. There is a lot of unpleasant material and nasty characters to boot. Finally, the production values ​​are also very low, which makes the film look second hand at all times. If you have time on your hands, it is a good idea not to risk this movie. But, if you are the proverbial glutton for punishment, go ahead and observe the damn thing. Beals looks beautiful, after all.
