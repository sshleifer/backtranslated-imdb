Andrewjlau, I could not agree more. My girlfriend is watching this at this precise moment, and this movie seems atrocious to me. Quote from my Chinese girlfriend, laughing: "Are you doing all this for a man?" <br /> <br /> I find that these women do not have intensity, they have no sense of the struggle between tragedy and identity, and that these men are hardly worth fighting. During the dance scene in which Zhang Zi Yi wins, men seem more stupid than admirers. <br /> <br /> The Japanese have much more intensity than the Chinese, and being a geisha is the Japanese culture. I'm sure the Chinese had something similar, but the faces do not match the main ones. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the dialogue is so little mysterious, so American. If a European had done it with Eastern Europeans, they would have done a much better job. <br /> <br /> I have to add: it seems that most of the people who liked the movie are Americans. I'm sorry to say it, but it's not surprising. Everything explained to you, not instinctive, not passionate. I think Chinese actresses are charming, but I can not say that they were good actors in this movie. Yes, the cinematography is great, but in reality, I can not see how you can see that these characters are complex and deep people. <br /> <br /> I'm going to Japan to see the reality. I'm sure it would be amazing to see.
