It is often voted the best Chinese film by Chinese critics, as well as Chinese film enthusiasts from abroad and, frankly, I do not understand it at all. What I saw was one of the most generic melodramas imaginable, softly directed and acted, with a complete shrew for a protagonist. Wei Wei (do not laugh) is that shrew, a young married woman who has suffered along with her tubercular husband (Yu Shi) during the last years. It is post-World War II, and they live with the husband's teenage sister (Hongmei Zhang) in a ruined house with little money (the man had been rich when they got married). Along comes the old best friend of the husband (Wei Li), who also used to be the boyfriend of the wife when they were teenagers. She considers running away from her husband with this man, while the husband remains practically unconscious, thinking that he can commit his little sister to her friend. That's the setup, and it's not going anywhere that I would not expect. In fact, I've seen the remake, directed by the Blue Kite director, Zhuangzhuang Tian. Run a half hour more, and it's actually a bit boring, too, but at least it was nice. This classic assumption is quite intolerable.
