The city girl, Meg Tilly, receives a horrible phone call from her mother and, understandably agitated, returns home to the rural excavations of her family, only to face a mystery: why do all home residents act so strange and disturbing? The radiation thriller, with just a nod to ecology, makes the residents of small cities go crazy, which (in a smiling way) includes two women who look at each other in a public place and Tim Matheson receives attention oral of a girl in an office bench. The image is too silly for words, wasting Tilly's nostalgia and calm intensity in the garbage, while forcing herself into a corner from which she can not wait to get out. Part of the cinematography of Thomas Del Ruth is good (particularly a sequence of fire inside a garage), although the scandalous edition disappoints him, and it is a pretty smooth ending. The simplistic script has neither a surprise nor a piece of originality in the sleeve. * 1/2 of ****
