NOTHING in this movie is funny. I thought that the premise, which gave a human the libido of a Rand ram, was interesting and should provide some laughter. INCORRECT! There is simply nothing funny about the movie. For example, the main character who makes a pass to a goat in heat in the middle of a farmer's yard is not funny, it borders on obscenity. They are playing with bestiality in this movie on one level, and it's not funny. <br /> <br /> We all know that dogs eat anything, anywhere, at any time. The main character who does this with everything, everywhere, every time is not fun either. It becomes a clich√©. <br /> <br /> Rob Schneider is, I suppose, acceptable on paper. With this, I want to say that it is not a bad actor, but with rotten material it is difficult to comment on quality. However, Coleen Haskell, the other half of the romantic-HUMAN protagonists (does the number of animals in which the main character has an interest also as romantic protagonists?), Seem embarrassed about the whole thing, and should be. She seems to be acting in some kind of vacuum, separated from all the other actors in the movie. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie only if you want to get bored with insipid, boring and repetitive material.
