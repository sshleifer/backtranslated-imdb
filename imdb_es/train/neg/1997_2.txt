It is likely that this version will be available at your local DVD store. The printing is not excellent, nor is the sound, but if you have $ 1.00 and 90 minutes or more to spare, you will get the value of your money (which does not mean much). Anna Neagle is extremely insipid as Nanette. Whatever their charms have been in the past, they are not evident in this movie. A lot of actors of fine characters appear in this movie (Helen Broderick, Zasu Pitts, Even Arden), but the material is far below their talents. However, it is interesting to see how the best performers make the most of weak writing. The musical numbers (actually they are only two) are pretty horrible. Clearly, the studio did not feel compelled to take advantage of the rich musicality of the original "No, No, Nanette". For what it's worth, the DVD can be had for $ 1.00. It's worth a lot to just say that you've seen it.
