I saw this movie a few days ago ... what the hell was that? <br /> <br /> I like movies with Brian O'Halloran, they are fun and enjoyable. When I saw a name of this title and genre, I thought it was great, this could be really good ... some parody for slashers or other bloody movies ... but ... then I read a preview and thought it could be good of all modes ... but it was not ... <br /> <br /> my opinion: if, like the movies, they look a bit like a documentary, with a bit of comedy, try some of Moore's films or the Alien's autopsy, it really is about something. This one was empty. <br /> <br /> and put a comedy to the title ... no comments ... very bad joke
