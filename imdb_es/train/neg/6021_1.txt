I can not believe they managed to spend $ 17 million on this movie. Spectacularly bad performance, scripts and notorious effects that could make on your average PC, incredible plots of plot ... a reporter who can get an inexperienced stewardess an important job at the UN? What? Not only that, but the message of this movie is so subtle that you feel like you have tried to hit yourself in the head with a full-size crucifix. Everything that this film will do will preach to the choir and make everyone else laugh at a ridiculous waste of money. If the creators of this film really wanted to influence Christianity and show what it really means to believe, they would have used the money to help people who really need it. Now, / that / could have convinced some people to really listen to them.
