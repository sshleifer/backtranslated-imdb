I have this movie out of the library right now and I have not finished watching it. It's so bad that I'm in disbelief. By then, Audrey Hepburn had totally lost her talent, even though she had almost finished with "Robin and Marian". This is the worst of this frighteningly stupid movie. It really is only of interest because it was his last feature film and the appearance of Dorothy Stratten just before his murder. <br /> <br /> There is nothing but idiocy between Gazzara and his friends. Small signals and small loops, and nodding to the true comedy of gunfire, of which this is the weakest and palest shadow. <br /> <br /> Who could believe that there are even some of the same surroundings of Manhattan that Hepburn inhabited so magically and even mythically? in 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' twenty years earlier? The soundtrack of the old Sinatra songs and the Gershwin song from which the title is taken is too high and obvious: you do not have to wait for the credits to discover that something was subtly woven into the cine-musique of the image. to know when the songs were heard. <br /> <br /> 'Rewrite' means to go back up, as well as download, I suppose. In this case, the elegant European lady of Audrey Hepburn is all you see of someone who was once an actress occasionally and always a star. Here he has even lost his talent as a star. If someone whose talent continued to grow in the period, such as Ann-Margret, had played the role, there would have been some life in him, even taking into account the incredibly bad material and Mongoloid-level situations. <br /> <br /> Hepburn was a great person, of course, bigger than most movie stars dreamed of being, and was once one of the most charming and beautiful film actors. After this terrible performance, he went on to make an atrocious television movie with Robert Wagner called "Love Among Thieves". In 'Everyone laughed' is as if he was still playing a wit in his 50 's. Even the much vain and obviously less intelligent actresses who insisted on doing this as Lana Turner were infinitely more effective than Hepburn. Turner took acting seriously, even when it was bad. Hepburn does not take it seriously at all, he could not bother with that; Even your hair and your clothes look sticky. His last really good job was in 'Two for the Road', perhaps his most perfect, if he is not the best in many ways. <br /> <br /> And that girl who plays the country singer is just disgusting. John Ritter is horrible, there is simply nothing to recommend this movie, except to see Dorothy Stratten, who was really pretty. Otherwise, the critic David Thomson's usual phrase "losing his talent" has never made more sense. <br /> <br /> Ben Gazarra had lost all sex appeal by then, so we have 2 movies with Gazarra and Hepburn. Who could ask for something less? The last and lamentable film of Sandra Dee, 'Lost', 2 years later, a nothing short of a budget, had more than that. At least Mrs. Dee spoke in her own voice; in 1981, Audrey Hepburn's accent simply sounded silly; she would continue to do the PBS World Gardens with Audrey Hepburn and there her somewhat irritating accent works while walking through English gardens with aristocrats or waxes effusively about what I like the most when flowers return to nature. 'as in the naturalized narcissus, but in a real fictional movie, she just sounds ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Thinking that 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' was a poetic kind of light so deep with Audrey Hepburn one of the most beautiful women in the world: surely it was one of the most beautiful screen presences of "My Fair Lady ", with Garbo in several things and Delphine Seyrig in" Last year in Marienbad ". And then this! And her brief final role as the angel 'Hap' in Spielberg's film 'Always' was only part of the lady's things: corny, witty and stifling. <br /> <br /> I went to his funeral at the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church, a beautiful service that included a children's choir singing Shaker's hymn 'Simple Gifts'. The only thing that did not figure in the program was the sudden reproduction of Hepburn's 'Moon River' on the fire escape in 'Breakfast at Tiffany's', and this caused a lot of excitement and some tears in the congregation. <br /> <br /> A great lady who was once a good actress (as in 'The Story of the Nuns') and one of the greatest and most beautiful movie stars in many movies of the 50s and 60s that They became really bad. Thats not all. What common And perhaps it is only a great human being who, by making trivial cinematographic interpretations, nevertheless, has the mentality of wanting faults to be pointed out without mercy, which all his late cinematographic work contained in abundance. Most of the conversation about Hepburn's mistreatment is about 'My Fair Lady'. But the one that should have had the original actress was "Wait Until Dark", which starred Lee Remick on Broadway. Never as famous as Hepburn, she was a better actress in many ways (Hepburn was completely incapable of interpreting something really sordid), although Hepburn was at least adequate enough in that part. After that, all his performance was downhill.
