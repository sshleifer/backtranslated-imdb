Madison is not that bad: if you like the simplistic, non-offensive, "family friendly" rates and, most importantly, if you know absolutely nothing about unlimited seaplane racing. If, like me, you grew up with sports and your heroes had names like Musson, Muncey, Cantrell, Slovak, etc., be prepared to be disappointed. <br /> <br /> Professional film critics have commented extensively on the formulated nature of the film and its penchant for using all the sporty clich√©s trodden in the book. I do not need to repeat what they have said. What I felt was unfortunately missing was any sense of the real thrill of the unlimited hydroelectric races in the "glory years" (which many would say had already happened in 1971). <br /> <br /> Yes, it was wonderful to see it. the old classic boats were traveling the field six a day, although it was clear that the restored versions (congratulations to the volunteers in the Hydroplane and Race Boat Museum) were taking care of themselves through the scenes at reduced speed. But where was the sound? Much of the excitement of the old hydros was the rumble of the six engines of the Allison or Rolls-Merlin aircraft, even the RPM that their designers never imagined, reaching the starting line right in front of you. You did not hear it, you FEEL it. Real water buffs know exactly what I'm talking about. There's nothing like that in Madison. Instead, each racing scene is buried under what is supposed to be a "heroic" musical score. <br /> <br /> And then there are the first planes of the pilots, riding smoothly and comfortably in the cabins as if relaxing in the latest luxury limousines, in some cases taking the time to smile maliciously while contemplating the best way to frustrate the poor hero of the hometown. Or, in a particularly ridiculous shot, take a moment to see Jake Lloyd giving a "rocky" salute from the pier of a bridge. In fact, some limitless drivers wore bullet-proof vests to minimize the beating they received when the boats crashed into the rock-hard water at speeds above 150 mph. <br /> <br /> As one critic so aptly put it, "Sport deserves better than this." <br /> <br /> Finally, since another user mentioned the anachronisms, I will add one: the Seattle map shows the Kingdome and the Safeco Field. Neither existed in 1971
