First, this movie was not so bad. It was entertaining ... at least for me probably for all the wrong reasons. I have never seen the original, so I can not compare the two. <br /> <br /> This movie reminded me of that strange Christopher Reeve movie, Village of the Damned. The two films have different arguments, but in both there is a creepy feeling and an unwanted comedy. <br /> <br /> The wicker man is supposed to be a mystery / thriller / men, please do not anger the woman. I do not know the whole pagan thing and the sacrifice was a bit strange. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage, his glorious and bad self goes to an isolated island called Summerisle when he receives a letter in calligraphy from his lost girlfriend. who affirms that her daughter has been kidnapped and hidden by other islanders. <br /> <br /> Cage is a police officer and, as the policeman is tired, he goes to the island almost unexplored and nothing is known of his whereabouts to anyone who is in the real world. Stupid. <br /> <br /> Things get weirder when the big Amish-esquire women who populate the island grunt and lie about the whereabouts of the missing girl. His girlfriend is not of any help that seems to be elusive and tired all the time. Cage stays on the island when he learns that the missing girl is his daughter and the lucky one who was tricked into coming to this island as a sacrificial victim during the festival of the sick harvest of the island. <br /> <br /> In this film, men do not fare so well. A twisted and sick display of feminism? <br /> <br /> I found the film laughable at times especially when the cage hits some women and runs with a bear suit. I think there were too many bumps in this movie. I find the whole concept of angry women hiding on an island quite uninteresting for men, but the way it was described in this movie was rare. While most women have had some sudden damage and anger, this is clearly a form of sexism. I would have turned off the movie with disgust if the roles had been reversed. This movie is something to see maybe just once or twice. It is NOT a thriller, it should be categorized as simply strange.
