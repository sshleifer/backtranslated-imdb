I heard that this movie was much more stylistic than the director of films Guy Ritchie (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch) had directed before, the problem is that it may be too stylistic. Basically, Jake Green (Jason Statham) gets out of jail after seven years alone, and in two years he risks a lot of his money. He's ready to seek revenge against the owner of a violence-prone casino that sent Jake to jail, Dorothy 'Mr. D 'Macha (Ray Liotta). In the process, the doctors tell Jake that he has three days to live because he is dying of a rare blood disease, oh, and Macha puts the killers to him. The loan sharks Zach (Vincent Pastore) and Avi (Andr√© Benjamin) are demanding that Jake return the money in cash and do some odd jobs for them. The movie is full of Jake's stories through some flashbacks, and during his last three days before arriving at the big revelation about Zach and Avi, and Macha, well, I guess that's what it was. Also starring Terence Maynard as Frenchman Paul, Andrew Howard as Billy, Mark Strong as the Sorter, Francesca Annis as Lily Walker, Anjela Lauren Smith as Doreen and Elana Binysh as Rachel. They are sequences that involve a bit of animation, repetition of lines twice in different perspectives and speed changes at times, and all these are irritating to the point of confusion and boredom, which makes it a silly criminal drama. Pretty poor
