Did I miss something here? This "adaptation" has everything that Brookmyres' first novel had. Everything aside from the history, the laughter, the black humor, the political intrigue, the characterizations, the plot and some sense. <br /> <br /> Spoilers; <br /> <br /> Godamnawful, from beginning to end. They made fun of the conspiracy, they had a romance between Parablane and a policeman, and what it was about, Dr. Slaughter was represented as a spectator, and who the hell was Annette Crosby? <br /> <br /> It seemed that they had made an adaptation of three hours, then reduced it to 90 minutes. (Although the 90 minutes seemed to last forever). Please, do not do this to any of Brookmyres' books, (especially "Country of the Blind").
