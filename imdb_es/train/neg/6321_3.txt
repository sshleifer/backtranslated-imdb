I can not imagine that someone, in a million years, wants to see this movie. Not because it was one of the worst events (it was not), but largely because it is approximately 20 years old and is out of the mainstream. I was trying to figure out where I saw an actor before and this appeared. So, yes, a child stops playing in the minor leagues because he does not like nuclear weapons, this generates a lot of media attention and a quick resolution of the cold war. The end. A fantasy, no doubt, but a surprise so big that it would make John Lennon blush. Since terrorism has replaced communism as the ism that scares us, this film really has no relevance, except as an (inaccurate) look back in those times. The writing, acting, and art of the film are equally underdeveloped. The reason why I rated it as much as I did was because I saw this movie about 50 times when I was between 5 and 6 years old and I still have a small place in my heart, but now I realize that it is not enough. mustard. Therefore, if the law of large numbers is met and someone finally decides to watch this movie, realize that there are many better ways to spend your time, but also much worse. (I will refrain from a diatribe from John Q. for now).
