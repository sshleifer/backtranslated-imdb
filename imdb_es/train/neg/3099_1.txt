This movie is not only bad, not just cheesy, it's repulsive. Something about Daphne, about the spooky prostitute, about the whole damn movie (and I use the word literally) radiates a grotesque that would offend a brothel lover. This film makes my skin crawl, it makes me regret having reproductive organs and it makes me feel impure. <br /> <br /> One of the things that bothers me the most about this movie is that they used such a good concept. A creature that makes fantasies with disastrous results, instead of the cliche Worst Nightmare and overdone Twisted Wish, is a truly fascinating cinematic idea. They are attracted to bright lights. During the day, bright lights do not show well, so they could go anywhere. <br /> <br /> Tell the Hobgoblins: Four hobgoblins come out of the movie studio, and at least nine of the pernicious stuffed toys are killed throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Question for discussion: If you had a frigid, demanding, and contemptuous girlfriend, would you enter the tool garden with a military chunkhead?
