BEGIN SPOILER: Very funny and memorable for the literal scene of Chong who smokes cockroaches: Chong coldly fry a kitchen cockroach in the bowl of his pipe, ignites, coughs and hacks violently for an apparent eternity, then with a perfect aplomb and without skip anything , reload the container correctly, turn it on again, play again. FINAL SPOILER. Unfortunately, I began to lose faith less than half the process. It occurred to me that the indifferent duo is very unpleasant and not easy to identify. I have come to appreciate the relative sophistication of contemporary drug addicts, Harold and Kumar. I simply prefer a brighter company. However, it is likely that the film is perfect for fans of the fraternity or for those spectators who are so weak as to be mocked by an imbecile when they ... the former are sober. Notable appearance of a guest by Paul Reubens spitting obscenities in pre-Pee-wee form.
