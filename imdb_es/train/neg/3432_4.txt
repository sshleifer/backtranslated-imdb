An assassin, cannibal rapist is killed by a crazed cop at the scene of his latest murder. In his grave, a cult met with plans to resuscitate him by urinating on the grave. This, of course, works and he wakes up tearing the boys' penis and returns to his old ways of killing with a new zombie appearance. The two policemen, one of whom is getting a little crazy about the city scum and has a drug problem, are back in the case. Two of the cult's original members also try to stop the murderer by resurrecting another kind of dead thing. Thinking that they have filed away they leave, but from the grave comes a plastic doll that was used in the original resurrection. It sounds a bit confusing really, but it's not just rubbish. <br /> <br /> The acting is terrible and one of the cops is the same guy who plays Dr. Vincent van Gore in the faces of the gore series and is just as terrible as the annoying cop in this movie. The other policeman almost struggles to eliminate his terrible lines. Now I am in favor of low budget cinema, but this movie is just terrible. If it were not for the ladies very easy to see and their nakedness, I would probably have fallen asleep. There is a bit of blood, but it is never more than some animal guts placed in the stomachs of the victims. The zombie makeup, on the other hand, looks very good and his long penis that he uses to rape his victims is funny sometimes. There is also a decent half scene where the killer falls in love with a sex doll. The doll with the voice of the squirrels is the stupidest thing I've seen in a movie. It's just a plastic toy on a fishing line. <br /> <br /> The ending is extremely bad. One would expect the killer to fight much more than him. God knows how they made enough money to make a sequel. <br /> <br /> 4/10
