Someone will have to explain to me why every film that presents poor people and adopts a pseudo-sandy appearance is somehow seen as "realistic" by some people. <br /> <br /> I did not see anything realistic about the characters (Although the actors did everything possible with really bad parts) or situations. Instead, I saw a forced and shy effort to be "nervous", "rough" and "down and dirty". <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it takes a lot more than holding the camera without rhyme. or the reason and not illuminate the film to achieve any of the above qualities in a meaningful way. <br /> <br /> It's a sad commentary on the status of independent film distribution that the only films that see the inside of a movie. The theater is today all carbon copies, with a bad photograph, a nonexistent camera address and many oaths that strive to become "Art". <br /> <br /> It's no wonder that movies like "In the bedroom" or "About Schmidt" receive such praise. I found them meandering and very average, but compared to the large number of independent clones like "Raising victor Vargas", they are absolutely brilliant and inspired. <br /> <br /> A few years ago, I watched an "independent" movie. It meant that you would probably receive some originality and a lot of energy and care, and maybe some technical flaws caused by low budgets, nowadays, means that you are likely to get another additional number, come on. The attempt to appease the lack of taste of the Independent distributors shake the camera around two hours. And, of course, all this to serve characters and situations that are completely unreal and artificial. <br /> <br /> Is it a surprise that the independent market has fewer and fewer surviving companies? No, not at all, when you watch movies like Raising Victor Vargas that do nothing but copy the worst of the films that preceded them.
