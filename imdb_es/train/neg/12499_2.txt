I went to the movie as Sneak Preview in Austria. So I did not have an idea of ​​what I'm going to see. The story is very normal. The movie is very long, I think it could have been reduced to 1/2 without causing any problems to the story. It's the kind of movie you can see on a boring night that bores you more! Ashton Kutcher was very good. Kevin Costner is fine. The film talks about the United States Coast Guard, how they are trained, their lifestyle and the problems they face. As there are not many effects in the movie. So, if you want to see it, you do not need to waste your money and time going to the movies. It would be more effective to see it at home when it is recorded on DVD.
