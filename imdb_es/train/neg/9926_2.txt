I just saw the 30th anniversary edition of Blazing Saddles, one of my favorites of all time! The Black Bart television pilot stank. The plot did not exist and the performance was not good. Obviously, it was an attempt to benefit from the success of Blazing Saddles and there have been television programs that have been successful in making takeoffs of great movies, but this would never have worked. Bearing in mind that for so many years, television would not even emit the noises of farts when they televised the movie, it is inconceivable that they thought they could put a program on television with the word "N". On the other hand, I enjoyed seeing many familiar faces !!! There were quite a few actors / actresses that I recognized from other shows over the years. I had to write all the names and do some searches. That was fun. I was arguing with my mother if Steve Landesberg was from Barney Miller or Mash. I win! :)
