This is undoubtedly the worst movie I remember seeing. Everything was incredibly clich√© and retarded. The performance was also horrible. The work of the camera was not bad, but it still could not be redeemed. The writer / director of this movie must suffer from Down syndrome if he thinks this movie would help his career. I want the hour and a half of my life that I wasted seeing this shit. I'd rather watch a video of the grass growing than this. I can not believe that IMDb is making me write 10 lines to publish this, but I feel that this movie is so bad that I should continue to warn others about it. The reason I discovered this movie is that my girlfriend requested it from the local library, thinking it was Kris Kristoferson's film that ended up being titled "Disappearances". I do not know whose fault this garbage ended up in my DVD player, but I feel that someone owes me at least $ 20 for my time, pain and suffering. In conclusion, the director / writer of this film hopes to recognize him on the street.
