The summary practically sums it up. This is not as good as the original. With a script co-written by Stallone and James Cameron (at the same time that he also wrote Aliens). Most of the action was written by Cameron and the political aspects were written by Stallone. <br /> <br /> Sly was physically in the best conditions when he was doing this and Rocky 4 and he looks in great shape or well up. to the eyeballs of steroids, depending on your own point of view or opinion. <br /> <br /> Rambo starts in jail and is visited by Colonel Trautman, who asks him to go on a special mission that could win him a presidential pardon. Finally, he accepts and goes to the information camp run by Charles Napier, who is wearing a Washington suit, trying to pass himself off as ex-forces to placate Rambo. <br /> <br /> The mission is to find out if there are any missing prisoners of war are still alive in the Vietnam camps. Rambo was chosen as the camp he was controlling somewhere in which he had previously been imprisoned. He is told that it is not a rescue mission and he is there only to take recognition photos. <br /> <br /> After a bad attempt to parachute from a plane, he loses most of his equipment, meets his contact (who happens to be a beautiful woman) and travels down the river with pirates to the camp . <br /> <br /> Find that there are still prisoners and rescue one. When the 3 run away from half the Vietnamese army on their boat down the river, they are betrayed by the pirates, but Rambo kills them all and they are forced to continue to the pick-up point on foot after their ship is rammed and exploded with Rambo. on board. <br /> <br /> Rambo is betrayed again and abandoned when Napier orders the withdrawal of the rescue helicopter. It is clear that when Trautman returns to base to reprimand him, no survivor was expected to be found. <br /> <br /> Steven Berkoff appears as a Russian Colonel Spetznatz and Rambo is tortured and, finally, escapes to be pursued by more Vietnamese Troops and spetznatz. Killing many of them, Rambo eventually steals a helicopter and rescues most of the prisoners to return to their base. <br /> <br /> Resist the urge to kill Napier for abandoning him, but destroy the Operations Center. <br /> <br /> A weak plot and a very weak ending when Rambo walks towards the sunset as a free man.
