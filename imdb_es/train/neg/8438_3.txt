I guess bad Laurel and Hardy is better than nothing Laurel and Hardy at all, but barely. It is sad that Fox films are those that get a great DVD release, exposing people who may not be very familiar with L & H to their SAME things instead of their classic comedies. <br /> <br /> Once again, the boys are loaded. with a stupid romantic argument about a guy who invented an invisible ray. He is in love with the daughter of the bosses, who hates him and prefers some clever guy. It's amazing to think that Fox's geniuses thought that THIS is what L & H needed in their films. <br /> <br /> Without the pancake makeup, the boys look tired and old. The only scene that works for them in this image is when they try to escape through the window of a bedroom at night and the rather strange scene in which Robert Mitchum, being an evil classic, tries to sell Oliver Hardy "safe" in Stan. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, this script is just a mess. Forget about this and see if you can find a copy of "A Chump at Oxford" or "Bohemian Girl" or "Sons of the Desert" instead.
