This movie was so bad that I could not stay without doing something else. There was no plot or point. I was completely bored and for a movie about a comedian, I could not remember a funny joke or phrase worthy of the description. Politicians who have no charisma, technical jargon can not be less entertaining. <br /> <br /> So, how was this done? Is there no quality control in the movie? Seeing the girls in bikini was the only distraction during this horrible experience. <br /> <br /> It's hard to imagine that Adam Sandler, who has become popular and has appeared in fine comedies, may have survived after this kind of exposure. It was not fun in the least in this movie, so it shows that writing is so vital in effective comedy.
