Stephen J. Cannell apparently decided a few years ago that he would broaden his horizons and immerse himself in horror. The result, "Dead Above Ground", is an abysmal piece of garbage. Now, if I had noticed his name in association with THIS particular movie, I would have returned it, but no, I did not put on my glasses and, therefore, I missed it, damn it, I really need to take them with me while I'm in the shopping video . The first question would be, who the hell is the target audience for this? It's almost like a "terrifying" children's movie, but again there are topless girls and some blood and some bad words thrown here and there. The main characters are so cute you want to see someone, anyone, go after them with agricultural implements of some kind. It seems that a man opens a bed and breakfast that has a past of pictures, a murderous witch of children who picked up the teeth of the children who lived there. Probably something the real estate agent did not mention. Of course, now, at present, there is a ghost of little girls to warn the girl who lives now and who now lives there, that something bad is going to happen. He does, and there are also two Bubbas who were squatting on that property when the new owner took over, so they also want revenge. All this has the feel of some junk made by cable that is for children on Halloween, except, of course, things that are not suitable for young children, so it is not only mediocre, but also confusing. A great howl and whistles to Anchor Bay for putting this too, considering his usual track record with the best pitches, this is a new minimum. The UK receives a set of Phantasm Box, we get "The Tooth Fairy". It hardly seems fair. 1 out of 10, absolute garbage.
