I'm usually willing to like low-budget gonzo movies, but Darkman III is so incredibly unattractive that I do not feel anything but contempt for it. <br /> <br /> It looks and feels like a television show, and it is particularly bad quality. one in that The scenarios are scarce, the flat lighting, the score and the effects are disconnected, and the camera work is the film school 101. There is no argument to speak, the characters are one-dimensional and the actors are sleepwalkers. Most of the cast looks like they should be doing soft-core porn ... In fact, the only reward I got from this mess was seeing squinting at Roxann Biggs-Dawson (B'Elanna from Star Trek: Voyager) Without her Klingon put makeup on his head. His skin tone is two shades lighter than in Voyager; either it has been bleached for this paper, or blackened for Voyager. Very strange anyway.
