This show is horrible. How is it that George wants his mother's death to be funny? This show is terrible. Parents are obviously horrible and children should be taken to child services. The daughter is a witch with a b and the son is simply a complete brat. George is not funny, especially when he speaks his noisy and nasty Spanglish brand. Ernie is a loser, but at least I've laughed at him sometimes, but mainly because of how pathetic he is. George's mother, Benny, with a horrible and despicable character. Sure, her husband left her, but how can anyone laugh at the way she treated George when he was a baby? You can explain to me how funny George's head is that it is big. It's not even that big! I went through the characters because they are too horrible and it would take me hours to write and, frankly, I do not care enough. I care enough to tell anyone who sees this and wonders whether or not he wants to watch this program, that this program is a huge excuse for a comedy, and it's not worth his time. <br /> <br /> I give Starts 2, because the woman is extremely attractive.
