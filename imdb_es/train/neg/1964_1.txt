When I saw the cover of this movie, the first thing I thought was that it was made for video. The second thing that came to mind was how similar it looked to another terrible movie "Darkness Falls," the story of this silent witch who killed people in the dark. Unfortunately, Darkness Falls was a masterpiece compared to this pile of trash, and this movie should not have been made. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with a little story for the witch, or rather as a useless introduction of two little boys who are going to meet the tooth fairy in hopes of giving them a new bicycle and bright for your tooth. The opening is filmed badly, and like the rest of the movie, it's certainly not scary. Currently, the film is about Peter (Lochlyn Munroe). Peter is renting his house, and his ex-girlfriend Darcy (Chandra West) and his daughter Cole come to stay there. Cole meets a neighborhood boy, and they talk about the tooth fairy, and how you should not lose your tooth, or she will come for you. Unfortunately, seconds later, it seems that the Tooth Fairy steals her bicycle and breaks her teeth (How ironic). Will Cole will survive the wrath of Tooth Fairy, and his mother and Peter will be able to save her, and they will rekindle their romance ... this is a bad movie, you can probably understand it. <br /> <br /> One of the main problems with this idiotic movie is how undefined the tooth fairy is. They say it kills you if you lose your tooth, but no. She is more like a serial killer who kills randomly, and if you lose a tooth, you're definitely going to go. She steals a bicycle, so apparently she is also a thief. I said earlier that the idea of ​​this movie was based on Darkness Falls, but where did they get inspiration for the appearance of Tooth Fairy? Let's see. He looks like a burn victim, and he used to go around the neighborhood killing children. Hmmm ... it's almost like it's an exact Freddy Krueger scam from the "Nightmare on Elm Street" movies. And this is not the worst part of this terrible disaster, it is the climax. This movie could have the most ridiculous climax (not literally laughable because I found it more disgusting than fun) that I've ever seen. Do not see this. <br /> <br /> Just a little trivial. Lochlyn Munroe was in Scary Movie, and Jianna Ballard was in Scary Movie 3, and both were in this, so apparently the stars of Scary Movie are forced to end their career with scary movies. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/2 out of ****. 80 minutes R for violence.
