This movie was a blow for me. I suppose that little girls should aspire to be nothing more than models of swimsuits, housewives or lovers, since that seems to be everything that will ever be portrayed. It is really sad to see that the work and the life of an artist are so unjustly misinterpreted. Unconsciously (or maybe it should have been expected), the whole character of Artemisia and everything she represents, had been reduced to a standard Hollywood female character; a pitiful little creature, physically impeccable and helpless, that does not show any of the character traits that really took her to that place in history that was being mutilated here. The saddest thing was to see that a large part of the audience was very ill-educated in the area to understand the incredible gap between the message conveyed in the film and reality. Representing the artist as a lover of her real life rapist, someone she actually accused of raping her even when she was under torture, just bothers me. If the director had nothing more important to say, he should have refrained from basing his story on a real person.
