The stereotyped sending of slasher movies falls short as supposed entertainment. Gerrit Graham, Michael Lerner, Zane Busby and, in fact, the entire cast is totally lost. Jokes abound, and each line of perforation is well telegraphed. The silent liners come at a rapid pace, and almost all fall flat like a crushed grape. The musical numbers only contribute to the boredom that is established and lasts throughout the film. Another negative aspect is the claustrophobic environment completely inside the walls of an abandoned secondary school. Avoid this and look for one of the really fun movies of "Lampoon" like "National Lampoon's Golddiggers" - MERK
