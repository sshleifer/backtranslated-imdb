This movie is too skeletal. It's a fairly low budget movie (I hope!) That excuses him a bit, but the lack of a decent cast and a complete plot hurts her too much. Phillips is quite credible in his role as the shattered son of a wealthy family who is looking for himself (although his family is ... er ... well, a little too white ...), but the rest of the cast is grabbing the straws. Every moment that has potential is ruined by an excessive melodrama, and there are too many subplots (which is an obvious sign of deficiency in the plot.They needed stuffing ...) I would not recommend this movie to anyone who is not a fan of Phillips or who has absolutely nothing to do. 4/10.
