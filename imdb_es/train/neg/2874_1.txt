This movie begins in a very scary way with a woman tied and tortured psychologically. There are male frontal nudes, parts of dead animals, dogs that lick their nipples, the female loses control of her bladder. All shot in a cold gray color. Effective, but a little too much. Then we went to see the youth of BTK's killer, as well as the present and its history of crimes. The tension is completely psychological and the scenes of the murderer who enters the homes of his victims and speaks to them lasts a long time and is scary. Here we do not see extravagant or good images, it seems as if they were filmed with the camera of your home. It does not seem horrible, but in a way to see a criminal involve his victims for quite some time before killing them is quite unusual and chilling. What this movie does not have is any drama, really. There are some police scenes from time to time, but there is no emotion in that they find the killer. There is not much arc in this story. This could have been an effective psychological thriller, a study of madness. Unfortunately, the movie is full of real images of slaughterhouse. It disperses throughout the film and appears suddenly again and again. Sometimes you do not know what is coming and you do not have enough time to look the other way. And that I have to reject. I am in favor of low-budget horror films, but I do not tolerate the suffering of animals. It was unnecessary, excessive, and it comes without warning. I'm glad that Lionsgate publishes things that nobody else does, but they should have broadcast this movie or edited the animal gore. Stay away from this garbage.
