I give him five out of 10. The five marks correspond to Hendrix, who delivers a very decent set of material from the last days. Unfortunately, the quality of the work and the editing of the camera is made to order. We have innumerable full shots of Hendrix where he could almost be doing something, maybe pee? We do not see his hands on the guitar which is the point! Do you also give us many pictures of Hendrix from behind? It seems that there are three cameras in Hendrix, but the amateur fools operate them all. The guy in front of Hendrix seems to be willing to divert his attention lazily on the stage as if Hendrix on the guitar were a mere distraction. While the guy behind it is easier to focus on some girls in the posts than actually documenting the incredible guitar work that is bleeding the amps (the sound recording is good thanks to Wally Heider). Vietnam, etc. on tracks like Machine Gun, complete movie loss! If Hendrix had lived even another two years, Berkeley is one of those things that would never have seen the light of day in regards to the full official release. The only gem that it contains is the incredible Johnny B Good, but all in a very poor visual document of the great man and inferior both to Woodstock and Isle of Wight
