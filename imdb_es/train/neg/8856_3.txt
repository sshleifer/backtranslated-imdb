Lee was the host of 100 years of horror for Ted Newsom and talked about werewolves filmic. He said something in the sense that his only touch with lycanthropy was The Howling II, and then he joked: "The less you say, the better." In fact, he was right, since this movie may be the worst in its catalog of screen presentations. The first Howling by Joe Dante was an innovative werewolf movie with its incredible special effects and its sense of style and theme. It was a movie to be taken seriously. Like other good original films, the filmmakers, for some strange reason, thought that more sequels were needed than at the first time (see CHUD and then CHUD II to illustrate this point). This movie is miles and miles away from the first on each front. There is absolutely nothing of fear in it. It seems cheap and is completely dark in most of the main scenes. Lee is the only actor in the movie that is worth mentioning (well, I'll also give Ferdy Mayne). Lee is embarrassed when he says an inane dialogue and does ridiculous things (see that it ends with him and Stirba). Lee looks incredibly tired and knows what the hell this is, which is a little more insightful than the two drivers who leave the United States to go to Romania. The story is not worth examining here, and you can bet there's a little story worth mentioning when you have to make Stephen Parsons and his band Babel play a lot of the movie at the beginning and end with that terrible noise. Sybil Danning is here and, yes, she gets naked once and then they show us the scene over and over and over again, said one critic 17 times (I counted ten, but I could have been so bored of my mind at that time). I gave the movie three stars, but it really deserves a zero, the three I gave you are 1 for Lee and two for contributions from Mrs. Danning. Gross
