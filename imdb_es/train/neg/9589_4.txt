This movie is horrible if you pay attention to it. It's a perfect movie if you only see the colorful images dancing on the screen, each without apparent connection to the next. I rented this movie because I'm a David Bowie fan, and I really appreciate the musicals. In short, Bowie was in the film for a total of ten minutes and the songs and the dance sequences were scarce and left something to be desired. The moral of the story was really disconcerting. I could not tell if it was about racial problems in London in the 1950s or if it had not been sold. During the first half of the movie, I was laughing at how corny it was, but I liked the "do not sell" message. When the blacks began to be killed, I thought that my tape had broken down. Maybe I rented half of two different movies? No, there was a sequence of songs and dances from "Keep Britain White". I'm sorry, but World War II is not something you can write a musical about. At least it is not a musical that could be described as "campy" as I have done several times in this review. In general, I would say that this movie could be much better if it were decided and chose better actors. (And put David Bowie in for longer, damn it!) My note: C-
