This is one of the worst movies I've seen in years. Besides Cuba and Angie, the acting is actually embarrassing. Was not Archer once a decent actress? What happened to her? The action is decent but completely implausible. The makeup is so bad that it's worth mentioning. I mean, whoever has ever thought about makeup in a contemporary feature film. Someone should tell the makeup artist and the DOP that you are not supposed to really see it. The ending is a big disappointment, along the lines of "and then they realized that everything was a dream". <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time or your money. It is better that you stay looking at space for 2 hours.
