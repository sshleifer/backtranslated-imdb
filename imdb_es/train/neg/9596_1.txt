It just does not do any good to try to glorify any part of this movie. <br /> <br /> It was garbage. At the beginning, you may think that a visually stunning movie film awaits you ... and shortly afterwards you are hit with a big sack of FAIL! The fight is hardly martial, the performance wobbles on the edge of the pair, and the music is not worth describing. There's only one story enough to have created an excuse for this film to have been made. The decisions made by the characters and the way they handle situations are weak and they only frustrated me. I think the only reason this film came out was to act as a little fan service using Yumiko Shaku.
