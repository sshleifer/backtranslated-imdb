In the first place, this movie is not a comedy; Unless you really try, you can barely laugh. Second, the movie is slow and boring. The performance is not bad but neither is it special. There's a Lucky Luke comic book about two families (one with big noses and one with big ears) fighting each other in a small town ... you'll laugh a lot more if you read this instead of wasting time with this movie. Religions and dogmas are not the best source to make a good comedy and this movie only confirms this rule. There is a similar comedy "The house masters"; This had some good moments. My last comment is: do not waste your time and money to see this boring and uninspired movie.
