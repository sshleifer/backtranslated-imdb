This movie is so amazing; - The whole premise is bunkum; the fact that a serial killer (vampire or otherwise) can fly without tracking and killing as many people as the film implies is ridiculous. The vampire himself would not look out of place in a Bela Lugosi movie. Most of the acting is so wooden that the actors must be treated for dry rot. I look forward to the day someone makes a decent movie from a Steven King novel (with the possible exception of Stand by Me). This film suffers from what most of Stephen King's films do: the lack of money used for the "special" effects, the poor actors, the frightening characterization and dialogue. This movie is cheap, tasteless and fails in everything it tries to do.
