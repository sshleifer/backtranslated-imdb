I rented it last night. The opening (2001) ran WAAAAAAAAAY too long. The hitchiker scene did not help. Some parodies were delayed. I knew beforehand, Chevy Chase was on for less than 2 minutes. No problem. Here are the best parts: <br /> <br /> KOKO, URANUS, BABS COMMERCIAL, song by Curtis Mayfield <br /> <br /> Total: 7 minutes of good footage from a 75-minute movie <br /> <Br /> Everything else was without grace or stupid as hell. <br /> <br /> Let me give you some advice: if you want a raw movie that falsifies television and movies, rent "Kentucky Fried Movie". If you want a less coarse film of fake TV and movies, rent "AMAZON WOMEN ON THE MOON" or "UHF". <br /> <br /> Otherwise, do not bother to rent this movie. You will save 2 or 3 dollars. <br /> <br /> In my humble opinion: Ken Shapiro's best film STIL continues "Modern Problems"
