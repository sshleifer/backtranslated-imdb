Horrible looting of a classic. <br /> <br /> It was not convincingly written at all why Mary should develop such sympathy for Bates. He may be more stable until they start playing pranks on him, but he still does not help himself with his actions. (invite a comparative stranger to stay alone with him in his motel until recently in disuse, tell the attractive young man his mental problems, lie about knives, etc.) This, in addition to his previous knowledge, should have kept Mary extremely distrustful of him, but this somehow does not happen just so they can play the wrong identity murder game later on. What, in itself, is also ridiculous: 'He is the true murderer, he is the same, so is he! There were too many artificial twists to slap a story on the screen when it was not necessary to extend the narrative. <br /> <br /> It was good to see Perkins repeating his famous role again, but that is the only small pleasure. to be had Definitely not a patch on Hitchcock, and if you do not intend to even try to get close, then you should not bother at all.
