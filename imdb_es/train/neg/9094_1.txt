Okay, let me explain it to you ... IT'S HORRIBLE! <br /> <br /> If Roger Kumble did such an elegant job in the first cruel intentions, then why did he do such a bad job in this? I'm sorry, but this movie is stupid, it's true that it may have improved if its series ever aired, but let's face it ... this movie is nonsense! A lot of bad acting * NOTE The shower scene * "Kisses of cousins" ?????? What kind of line is that? "Slipery when it's wet" ?????????? Can we say DUH-M? This movie had an effort, I'll give it to you, but it was too stupid! They even tried to make it fun by giving the servants of the house stupid accents that actually ... IT WAS NOT FUN! It was pathetic. Not to mention that they made everyone in this one look Absolutely NOTHING like the original cast. It's as if they made them look different on purpose or something! I like to see it when I'm really really on board, which does not happen occasionally. For those of you who liked ... Okay, what were you thinking about? Could you choose this movie over the other that had a great performance and the fabulous Sarah Michelle Gellar? A movie is gold if it has Sarah Michelle Gellar, DUH! But this movie does not do it, do not be offended by Amy Adams. Oh, yes, since when does Sebastain have a heart? UGH!
