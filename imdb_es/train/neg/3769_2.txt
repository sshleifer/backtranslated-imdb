There have been many movies with Bigfoot, most of which are not good, but at least most have a ridiculous charm. Sasquatch Hunters does not even have that in their favor. It's just a hole. <br /> <br /> Sasquatch Hunters is about a group of paleontologists, primatologists and rangers venturing into a remote part of a forest in the Pacific Northwest. Bones belonging to some type of abnormally large primate have been discovered in this region and, as the apes are not natural in North America, to begin with, this leads to a scientific expedition. Indeed, they soon discover a whole cemetery full of the skeletal remains of these huge ape-like creatures. I think we all know what happens to people who disturb the old cemeteries in the movies. <br /> <br /> The first half of the film consists of not interesting and interchangeable characters that assemble their teams, walk through the forest and stop to rest. Walking through the woods a bit more, stopping long enough to investigate and discuss some finds along the way, but even more walks through the forest, looking for a member of the group that has disappeared, even more walks through the forest, digging in The Earth, randomly theorize and gather around a campfire to discuss how little they have done that day. When Sasquatch finally appears, he simply turns into people who stagger in the dark while being eliminated one at a time (done in the blink of an eye and you missed it and the real death happens outside the camera). All this is unbearably boring. <br /> <br /> The film wants to be taken seriously and the director is clearly trying to create suspense, but you can not find anything, so we are left with boring and boring scenes of people wandering in the woods alone to get somewhere and wander through the forest at night trying to act scared. I would be lying if I said that I did not make a liberal use of the fast forward button to speed up these scenes. <br /> <br /> As for Sasquatch himself, like all the other characters in the movie, he does not have much to do and he lacks a different personality. It seems a hairier version of King Kong, which is not so bad, except in the scenes where they used CGI instead of a man in a Bigfoot costume, which is painfully obvious during the daytime monsters scenes. A part of me can not help but feel that even using computer effects to bring Bigfoot to life is a bit sacrilegious. If there is any movie monster that I think should only come to life through the situation, it's Bigfoot. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies that does not have as much argument as a premise. . That's all it really is, a premise, that the people involved stretched to make a feature film without bothering to add all the ingredients to make a worthwhile movie.
