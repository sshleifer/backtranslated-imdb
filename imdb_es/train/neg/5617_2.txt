This documentary film is based on incomplete considerations of the evidence, in which Brian Flemming, perhaps on purpose, does not mention important evidence to the contrary. Perhaps his most crucial mistake is one of the earliest: his claims about the invalidity of Paul's testimony about Jesus Christ ignore key facts, such as: ** The existence of some creeds formulated within Paul's letters. These creeds suggest that most of the central claims about Jesus were already formulated in statements of faith possibly within a few years of the death and resurrection of Christ. ** The testimonies of the first Christians can not simply be dismissed as mere fantasy. In fact, there were many people who claimed to be the Messiah during that period, but only ONE of them has remained: Jesus. Why? Because it would have been absurd if someone had believed that Christ was the messiah, and he would die for those beliefs, if they knew he had not been resurrected. ** Even if the gospels have a more liberal date, we keep talking about stories of Jesus written in the course of the life of other eyewitnesses who would have pointed out inaccuracies in these gospels. And there is evidence that the gospels were written much earlier. <br /> <br /> What I am saying is that Flemming's documentary is an incredibly skewed and selfish work that hides different arguments and evidences to serve its anti-Christian point of view. Do not be fooled by the bad investigation.
