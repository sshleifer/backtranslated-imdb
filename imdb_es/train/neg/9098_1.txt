There is a reason why certain movies go directly to the video and, of course, the obvious reason is that if it is too naughty for the theater audience, then it will be released directly to the video. Of course, it would not be fair for the movies that are good and yet they are also released directly to the video. This is no exception, although the film has good actors or at least actors with potential: Amy Adams (I'm an Oscar nominee and a talented actress), Robin Dunne, who deserves a better or at least a better actor, and Sarah Thompson, who deserves roles that are an exit from the teenage melodramas. The film is also wrong: this film takes place before Cruel Intentions, therefore, this movie is actually a prequel and quite stupid. This was a waste and it is really a movie that is on the same level as soft core movies and pay-per-view masturbation. Fortunately for the actors, I hope they can erase this from their curriculums. So, if you're looking to see something bad, but you do not have the courage to buy porn, then rent this movie as a starter.
