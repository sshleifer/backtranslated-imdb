Oh man, I know what you think: "With a title like that, I can not go wrong!" Uh if you can. I, too, loved the title, but the man hated the stupid child who played the "little helper of Satan." He also hated the mother, the sister / daughter and her boyfriend. I hated all those people! Man, it was agony to see this sometimes! The ONLY reason why you do not get 1/10 is because we consider the low budget, they did it well. But oh man, I hate those actors, so stupid! I knew it was going to be bad, I guess they saved a lot of money just by wearing Halloween masks for the killer, and the Jesus costume in the end was also really stupid. Oh the agony, do not look!
