This reminds me when I was a born-again believer that I was going to be a minister. Actually, I never thought that I would be a minister or even that I would graduate from high school because I was almost certain that I would be caught up to heaven before that happened. That was before I discovered that Christianity was a lot of garbage. Now I am an atheist, and that only proves that the doctor "once saved always saved" that Christians tell us is no more real than the elves. If it were true, why did I leave after many years of being a devout born-again believer? Yes, I was really saved. I prayed with all my hearts the prayer of foolish sinners. <br /> <br /> If Christians read their Bible, they would discover that their god thinks like rape, genocide, abortion and many other atrocities are well in agreement with him. You may be surprised to learn that nowhere is the word "rapture" mentioned.
