However, ANOTHER film about a group of unintelligent people on a road trip that deviate from their original travel route either by a shortcut or, in this case, to visit an attraction of secondary shows. The results, as expected, are not entirely good, since this particular secondary spectacle is the home of a group of crazed, race-bred residents who escaped the prisoners of previous years. The father, who apparently is a professional photographer, only has to stop and take pictures of the place, only to discover that it is still inhabited. The various members of the family move away to see the various attractions, just to be scared. When thinking that they managed to get out safely on their way, the tire van explodes (surprise!), Leaving them to seek shelter and accommodation in the small town, which we discover is inhabited only by monsters (surprise!). <br /> <br /> This movie unfolds as expected, with the family being harassed and killed by the monsters. There is a bit of struggle on the part of families, but these are probably some of the worst scenes in the film, as they are poorly executed. There's nothing remotely original here, unless you count the totally inappropriate soundtrack that plays in particular scenes that completely ruin the atmosphere and mood of the movie. The acting is as bad as I've seen it in quite some time by all involved (it's pretty bad when your cast is outnumbered by the cast of "Camp Blood"). The special effects are terrible and the end made me want to hit my TV. <br /> <br /> Even so, in spite of all the negative aspects, I enjoyed a little of this film. It definitely has a vibra "so bad that it's good". I made it through the whole movie and even pleasantly entertaining once I got over the ridiculously clich√©d plot, the terrible acting and the cheesy special effects. Although the ending left me feeling cheated and angry, particularly because the movie is not so good to start and the end makes the whole movie has no meaning. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, I can list countless movies that, if you've seen them, you've seen them. The difference is that most of those films are better. Although it's not a complete waste, this movie is pretty bad and does not scare remotely. <br /> <br /> My rating: D
