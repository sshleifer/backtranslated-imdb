A movie with very few positive words to say. <br /> <br /> First of all, it has a null pace and positively lacks any drama. <br /> <br /> In addition to being remarkably slow, The Empty Acre seems to be dedicated to using the same archival material over and over again. I lost count of how many times I had seen "that" field at night or that piece of cracked earth. <br /> <br /> It also has the fundamental defect of thinking that if the audience does not know about things that will be seized instead of simply confused. Then, without signs of trouble, we suddenly find that marriage is not what it seems despite having the impression that it is okay. We find that Jacob is possibly the worst farmer in the universe, since he does not seem to spend much time on the farm and also seems to have bought land with a totally useless acre. Does Beth have a key to a book store? There are countless other questions, some of which are resolved later in the film, much later, in fact, too late. <br /> <br /> And at the point of the acre. Do horror filmmakers notice that large inanimate objects are not intrinsically frightening? and also if they are meant to be a big acre, then do them like that. <br /> <br /> There is also a terrifying lack of reasonableness as Beth (the best performer of the piece, followed by Jefferson - the policeman) suddenly seems to be accused of everything under the sun just because he is taking "medication". <br /> <br /> With more than ten minutes of running through the fields looking for the lost child (did he get out of there? The window? He is six months old) the film descends to a badly written scene after a Wrong scene written. Bad plinky plonk "horror" music fails to add atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Often, bad movies can be fun but not The Empty Acre, which is simply bad.
