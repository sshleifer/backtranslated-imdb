It has been said several times, not just me, that watching a film by Eric Rohmer is like watching the paint dry; It seems that Monsieur Rohmer resents this (he does not deny it, but then, how could he, simply resents it) to the point that his new film, which may also be the last, Inch Allah, is so delayed? It's time to see how it dries. Those wonderful people who gave you the Nouvelle Vague, Cahiers du Cinema have already named it one of the best movies of 2007, so it should give you an idea. Reality does not occupy a prominent place in Rohmer's agenda, so that in fifth-century France we have at one end a castle that would not be out of place in the Loire Valley, while the only other housing we see is a Log cabin. The story involves nymphs and shepherds and, as he often does, Rohmer has done so with unknowns that happen to be happening, so the general effect is that the annual class work at a school for students with special needs was recorded in a movie by accident. One is almost tempted to say: "Godard returns, everything is forgiven", but even this unfortunate production can not make me utter those words.
