I really liked ZB1. I really did it. I have no problem with very low budget movies, and I have enjoyed movies with lower production values ​​than ZB3 (if you can imagine something like that, see 'wiseguys vs. zombies', if interested). In fact, I prefer low-budget zombie movies, because I suspect that Hollywood directors do not understand what zombies are about. <br /> <br /> But ZB3 was so bad. It was delayed. I do not want to bother to be worthy in my criticisms. I want my 90 minutes back, etc. Except that it really only took me about 80 minutes, because half of the 1.4X advance. <br /> <br /> Well, here are some criticisms. <br /> 1. The pace was TERRIBLE. All spoke in monologues. Even when someone just had a single line, the work of the camera, the editing and the insertion of a bunch of F-bombs in each sentence made the line feel like a monologue. At first I was excited about the 90 minute run time compared to the 70 minutes of ZB1, but in reality there were fewer "events" in ZB3. Everything is talking. <br /> <br /> 2. Gore effects became more stupid. He just rubbed people's belly. <br /> <br /> 3. Despite the epic exposition, there really was not a plot. And the exhibition is in fact epic! I will not spoil it, if you will see it. (Do not see it). But then, it's just a group of lame characters walking and arguing for about 80 minutes. or less, if you choose.
