Some might say something like "Baby Geniuses" with their giant robot babies or "Dumbo" with their psychedelic and addictive nightmare sequence winning the prize for the most disturbing movie ever made for children. You could say that too, but you would be wrong. Here, then, I bring you: Santa Claus, the family movie most helpless and helpless since ... well, forever. <br /> <br /> From the initial scenes that show children from different parts of the world singing their insipid songs (seriously, this segment lasts almost 20 minutes and has nothing to do with the plot!) to the exciting conclusion in which Merlin appears out of nowhere and saves the day (it does not matter, it's Barcelona), this is the trauma of childhood at its best. And no matter how hard I try, it does not matter how many different therapists I visit, I just ... can not ... get ... those ... reindeer ... laughs ... out ... of ... .. my head! <br /> <br /> Avoid this amazing piece of junk like you would a sexually hungry whale during the mating season. However, if the gay demons on fire with a severe case of exaggerated flu are something for you, I guess you should try. But in reality, this movie is not worth your time and your mental health.
