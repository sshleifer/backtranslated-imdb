I think it's time for John Rambo to move on with his life and try to leave Vietnam behind him. This series is getting old and Rambo is no longer a soldier, but a cold-blooded killer. Every time someone appears on the screen, they die. Vietnam was not a fun place and, frankly, I'm tired of Hollywood looking like it was. This is not the worst movie about Vietnam, that honor is for John Waynes Green Berets. In any case, John Rambo with a 50 cal machine gun that faces what appears to be half the Viet Cong army and many Russians is an insult. What is worse is Rambos' cheesy speech at the end ... Please! Oh yes, I heard they are doing another ...
