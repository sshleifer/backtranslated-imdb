When I saw this in a store, I thought it looked really good and original. Just as Wolfs Creek encounters the Texas massacre, I mean it only costs three pounds (about $ 6). To be honest, I do not think it was worth it. <br /> <br /> It seemed that the directors, the "butcher brothers" could not decide if they wanted to make a kind of artistic horror or a bloody slasher. horror. It ended with a bloody sadistic hour full of clich√©s and fifteen minutes with all the one-dimensional characters and could not care less what happened to them, but to try to make the public care about the characters, they added a useless monologue at the end. and the beginning of the film, which to be perfectly honest, was not necessary. <br /> <br /> The only good part was actually the middle / end. I will not ruin it for you. But that was the only "good" part. <br /> <br /> In general, a clock without sense. It looked like a two-hour movie, but in reality I only had 75 minutes. If you want an artistic film, do not bother. If you want a slasher movie, do not bother, the movie moves very slowly and nothing ever happens.
