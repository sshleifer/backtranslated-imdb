American Pie: Beta House is like a limbo between genres. On the one hand, it is a comedy without an argument and few really intelligent jokes. On the other hand, it is a porn movie that is a bit too soft to actually turn on the viewers. Essentially Beta House is a collage of sex scenes, some humiliating, others just unconvincing humor attempts, with a couple of plot points in a cohesion effort. The characters are barely two-dimensional, most of the development is based on Naked Mile knowledge, and the "important" plot scenes are so far apart that one wonders why the writers felt the need for a story. <br /> <br /> In all fairness, I did not enter this film without expectations. I liked the three original American Pie films, and I thought that Band Camp and Naked Mile were solid rentals. I thought Naked Mile was good enough to be released in theaters, and when I saw some of the same characters come back to Beta House, I was thrilled to see this release. I was aware that there would be numerous scenes of debauchery and sexual humiliation in multiple forms. And I did not care, because in the past, these scenes were backed by history and were well integrated into the plot. In Beta House, however, it's almost as if the writers had forgotten why the formula worked in the other AP movies. They spent too much energy working on nudity that they forgot to write a story. <br /> <br /> This movie is a disappointment and is not even worth renting for a dollar. The jokes are boring, the story does not exist and the porn aspect is too docile if that is all you really want to see.
