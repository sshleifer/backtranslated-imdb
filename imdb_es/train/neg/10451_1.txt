I'm sick and tired of all these little idiots that are happening about how this movie "shook". It's pure CG overacting CRAP! Do not send an Assassin, it's much wiser to smuggle hundreds of poisonous, aggressive, brightly colored Serpents into a plane! The only reason why people like this movie because they feel they have to do it. It's not "so bad it's good" It's so bad that I'd rather have them poked in the eye with a sharp cane and then submit to this again. I honestly thought it was going to be a COMEDY like AIRPLANE! A parody! I was wrong. It's all that "It sucks, get it!" Or Samuel A. Jackson yells "Snakes on the plane! I'm sorry, I do not understand." It seems that a group of weak guys gave more money to the movie industry to make more movies like Triple X and Die Hard. watch a movie in the company of the same people who bought William Hung's CD, still live in the basement of their moms and they smell like plastic chair sweat from the days on the computer playing online games and watching pornography. and asks for a ticket (since I doubt you have a girlfriend) for Snakes in a Plane of stupidity, to hell with movies like Full Metal Jacket, Pulp Fiction, True Romance, 12 Monkeys, Clerks, etc. It's not ironic to watch good movies. The true decline of Western civilization Calling this a cult movie is an insult to the true cult classics such as the Repo man, or even the Orgazmo, I have said enough.
