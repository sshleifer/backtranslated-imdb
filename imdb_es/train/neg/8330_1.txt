I saw "Shiner" on DVD. While I was watching it, I thought: "This is a really bad porn movie without porn". I also thought: "Whoever wrote this has some real problems". Then I saw the director / writer Carlson explain his process as a special feature. Yes, it was really special. <br /> <br /> The emphasis of the film is placed on two alcoholic losers who hit each other to get off. They are marginally attractive. There is full frontal nudity. These factors probably explain the movie you are watching. <br /> <br /> The most disturbing element of the film is the attack on homosexuals and the subsequent attack on homosexuals of the same victim who unjustly tries to take revenge on his assailants. , the two drunken losers. From a technical point of view, the issue is not only handled in an absurd and bad way, but the performance is terribly bad. <br /> <br /> Then there is the subject of the stalker-boxer. This is really crazy, not just absurd. This hunky boxer is traumatized in some way by the persistent attention of a fleshy mommy boy who works in the parking lot of his gym. This is in Los Angeles, look. The boxer is so traumatized that he appears in the stalker's house, strips naked in front of him and gets excited in the process. <br /> <br /> Well, all I can say is, why a heart boxer? Will an exhibitionist be so traumatized by the attention of a stalker? It just does not make sense. And, I'm afraid, some psycho-dynamics really make sense, if you take the time to read about them. However, bad scripts rarely make sense. <br /> <br /> The director / writer seems to have thought that this film represents a considerable minority within the gay community. Well, maybe he's right, I suppose. We may never know, since that minority would be so dysfunctional that they could hardly organize enough to get to a dark gay movie festival or a DVD store, the only two places where they could find this turkey. Thank God for that.
