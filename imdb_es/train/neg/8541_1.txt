Welcome to film 17 in the spooky pack of 50 classics. Where we will see, that is correct. Another movie that does not make any sense. Seriously, this movie had me so confused at the end, I thought I was going back to see "At dawn they sleep." The plot seems pretty simple ... well, that's up to 3 seconds in the movie where a girl supposedly killed a cat and then ... um ... does it explode? I have no idea what happened. And that was BEFORE THE TITLE SCREEN. That's really sad when I can not even tell what happened in the first 3 minutes. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's starring a photographer with a big mustache who finds this girl after leaving her other girlfriend on the way to take pictures. of something somewhere. so we got there, but not before someone steals his jeep to drive it 200 feet out of the way to a city. suspicious? nah so they decide to stay in this desert village with an old woman. and then, blah, blah, things happen and blah, blah talking. The guy with the mustache comes out in the fog for some reason, even though the old lady tells him not to do it. It gets lost and then finds its way back. <br /> <br /> Oh, I forgot to mention that this is all after 20 incredibly useless minutes of staying in the house of a guy who looks like that guy with casablanca buggy eyes. Then they leave. There really is not any point in this scene. It's really just the stuffing. If you had cut it, no one would have noticed or imported it. <br /> <br /> But, unfortunately, that was the best part of the movie. I waited. let me reformulate that. REALLY sadly that was the best part of the movie. because the rest is so confusing that I had to look in IMDb to find out what happened. But of course no one else knows, so I'm SOL. <br /> <br /> Seriously, the last 30 minutes of the movie were some of the most amazing moments I've seen in the movie. They dressed her in a dress, they kidnap her, then they let her go, she runs back to the house, then, in the end, are the witches in the house and it ends? seriously. I've almost never been so confused in a movie. I mean, as bad as movies like "Robot Wars" are, at least, I HAVE SENSE. This movie does not even make the INTENT consistent. The ending was as confusing as the ending of "At dawn sleep" and the plot was much more boring. This movie gets a 1 just for its sheer "I have no idea what happened in this movie" ness. "Monta√±a de brujas" gets 1 confused film viewer in 10.
