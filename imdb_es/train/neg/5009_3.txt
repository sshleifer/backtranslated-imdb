This was possibly the worst movie I've seen in my life. The plot did not make much sense and the performance was horrible. I'm a big fan of Amber Benson, I think she's usually a wonderful actress, I can not imagine why she decided to make this movie. His character, Piper, is drunk for most of the movie, except for the opening scene. On the positive side, there were several points in the film in which the performance was so bad that, in fact, I laughed out loud. But despite that, I would not recommend this movie to anyone. It only has 80 minutes of duration, but those 80 minutes of your life you will have lost completely.
