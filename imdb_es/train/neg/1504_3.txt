I'm a big fan of the Spaghetti Western genre, and I usually like most of the low-cost ones as well. The infamous director Demofilo Fidani, however, is rightly known for some of the cheapest, bad, and, worse, genre contributions. The plots of Fidani's films used to be very weak, and since his talent was quite limited, he generally tried to sell the movies by adding the titles to the famous names of western spaghetti as "Django" from "Sartana." In the particular case of "Gi첫 La Testa ... Hombre" of 1971, he has just taken the title of "Gi첫 La Testa" by Sergio Leone (also known as "Duck You Sucker") and added 'Hombre'. The film can be found under various titles ("Fistful Of Death", "Western Story" ...), I personally bought it under the name of "Adios Companeros", which this film shares with another Fidani film with almost the same cast. , "Per Una Bara Piena Di Dollari", which is also titled "Adios Companeros" in the German version. <br /> <br /> The plot is quite weak, basically follows a guy named Macho Callaghan (Jeff Cameron) and his participation with two rival bands besides Butch Cassidy (Jack Betts) and Ironhead (Gordon Mitchell). <br /> <br /> The main performance of Jeff Cameron is, kindly, not very convincing. I also did not find Jack Betts very good as 'Butch Cassidy'. The legend of the movie B Gordon Mitchell, however, is always worth trying, and although he probably was not a very good actor, I always found his performances in the Spaghetti Westerns quite fun and original, and actually saved some of the films from Fidani (as the "Django And Sartana ... Showdown in the West"). <br /> <br /> There is a very funny and original thing about "Gi첫 La Testa ... Hombre": the great Klaus Kinski. A priest is playing! I could have imagined Kinski in any role, but before watching this film I would never have imagined that someone would consider him a priest. Kinski is, once again, great, although he only has a little time on screen, and a scene, in which he breaks a fight, is probably the only good scene in this. One more interesting thing about this movie is that the legendary director and king of Sleaze Joe D'Amato made the cinematography. <br /> <br /> "Gi첫 La Testa ... Hombre" is a cheap movie of poor quality, but nevertheless, it has some fun moments. Being an enthusiast of Spaghetti Western, I found it fun to watch, but if you are not, do not worry about this movie, or watch it just for the purpose of seeing Kinski play a priest. 3/10
