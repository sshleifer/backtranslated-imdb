Let's be honest. As a film school project, done without a budget and "real" actors, this is a very interesting film. As something that will be released on DVD to an innocent bystander, it is a very poorly produced product. If I were idly changing the channels and if I accidentally picked up this movie, it would probably attract my attention and attention for a while. As a person who bought this DVD with the impression that I would get a suitable film product, that is, a film, I feel deeply disappointed. It is a work of TV recorded on video, something similar to serial series of the sixties, but without that particular charm. Apart from the protagonist, Mr. Redfield (who is also the director), the other actors seem to be campus types (a little too old for that) or members of the director's family, who appear before the camera without any help. only of the armchairs that act, but also of the make-up artist or hairdresser (a cap on the permanent bangs overcome or a top hat on the red mullet is very far from creating the 1840s). Everything is taken with a camera mounted in a small, nude studio, sometimes with a blue screen for outdoor backgrounds. The synthesizer generated an uninspired score from a romantic karaoke inspired by the "period" that insults viewers on more than one occasion. The film tries to be "dreamy", while, in fact, it is simply a collage without concepts of those shots that the editing achieved (and believe me, the standards were not too high to begin with). There are interesting dialogues from time to time, but in general it is quite scarce and the two-dimensional production in more than one way, without flashes of genius neither of the director nor of the members of the crew. This is how the "artistic" films tried to see themselves in the 80s. Mr. Redfield does a much better job as an actor than the director.
