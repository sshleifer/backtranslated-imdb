Is there a more intolerant and more critical movement than the environmental movement? For a budding young socialist, joining the circus must seem as intimidating as joining a real circus. Even though these people usually outsource their brain to Hollywood for these important issues, Hollywood teachings can often seem fragmented and confusing. Fortunately, Ed is here to teach neo-hippies in the art of environmental environment. <br /> <br /> Here you will learn the art of moving your finger in the face of anyone without losing your trademark smile. You will learn to ignore logic and science with powerful arguments of fear. You will learn how to stop any human activity that does not interest you by labeling it as the gateway to planetary Armageddon. <br /> <br /> In addition to learning to lie with a serious face, you will also learn how to avoid accusations that deviate your way no matter how hypocritical you are. You can use as much energy as Al Gore while people treat you as if you were Amish. <br /> <br /> In the second season it was even more useful as we were able to visit other Hollywood Gods. , saints be your names, and audit, that is, judge, their lifestyles. NOTE: This is the only time it is appropriate for one envirofascista to judge another because it allows the victim the opportunity to buy all kinds of expensive and modern ecological toys so that they can move their finger in the face of other people. <br /> <br /> What has Ed booked for us in the third season? Maybe he will teach us to judge while he sleeps!
