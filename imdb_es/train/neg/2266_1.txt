Ringmaster, the pathetic excuse of Jerry Springer to waste a film that should be recycled, since the toilet paper recently destroyed my confidence in the art of the film. First, it was done. Second, people went to see him. Third, some people voted it as the best movie they've ever seen. If a monkey could make a movie, I'm 100% sure it would be a billion times better. Most fucking movies have their moments, (even Godzilla had some great special effects) the moment of this movie was when I left the theater with nausea. The only thing that could possibly have worsened this movie would be if Jerry Springer were the star. If I want to look at the shit for an hour and a half, I'll throw myself in a can. If someone does not completely disregard this movie, I feel sorry for you as much as for your children and your children's children; however, contrary to Springer's beliefs, I clearly do not condone children who have sex.
