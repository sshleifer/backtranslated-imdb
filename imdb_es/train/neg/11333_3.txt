This movie is crap. Even though the directors claim to be part of that oi culture, it's still a very, very bad debut as a director. The subject itself is very interesting and I accept the bad performance because they are all fans and never acted before, but the worst of this film are the dialogues and a very inexperienced and naive direction. There is no time at all in that movie. I felt that the directors were so excited to make that movie (it's their first film), that they never really asked themselves, what story they want to tell. I met Ben (one of the directors) several times and he's a nice and considerate guy, but that does not make him a director. I think "American History X" is full of clichés, but somehow manages to convey a story. "Oi! Warning" is full of clichés, does not say anything new or provocative and (that's the sad part of this movie) is far from any Oi! -Reality. <br /> <br /> If you want to see strange but great German films, watch the films of Michael Haneke, Christoph Schlingensief, Oskar Roehler, Hans Weingartner or Oliver Hirschbiegel: <br /> <br /> Benny's Video Funny Games Die Unberührbare Mein Letzter Movie Das Experiment Das Weisse Rauschen Muxmäuschenstill ... <br /> <br /> *** of every ten, for the theme and the photograph.
