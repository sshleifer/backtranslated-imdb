Eytan Fox, although generally based on the apologist side of Israeli politics, has made several quite interesting films in the past, such as "Walk on Water" and the simply wonderful movie, "Yossi & Jagger". In "The Bubble," however, he has taken this illogical and unfair approach to the extreme. <br /> <br /> Far from giving this film a standing ovation, the people at the screening I attended got up quietly and left. I also went quietly, enraged by the anger at such a ridiculously one-sided film that translates self-preservation as racist intimidation, and racist intimidation (and terrorism) as outbursts of justified anger; which implies that the evil Israelis harm the Arabs who react with anger to a constant stream of unilateral Israeli aggression against them, and who, therefore, should not be held responsible for their actions. <br /> <br /> This movie was not worth the money I paid for the ticket (in fact, I considered claiming my money back), and it was basically an Israeli simulation of the Palestinian film "Paradise Now". If you want to be an anti-Israel, then look at this movie, since it really justifies such a belief system. The fact that this film was made by an Israeli director and, what is worse, such a talented Israeli director, is a real shame. In fact, how can it surprise Israel to be considered a pariah state when the Israelis themselves make such anti-Israel propaganda, believe the beggars. <br /> <br /> What a shameful and horrible little movie!
