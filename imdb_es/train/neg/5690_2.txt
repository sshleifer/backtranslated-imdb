First of all ... I never considered myself a Uwe Boll Hater since I think I never saw one of his films, but after seeing this cheap excuse for a movie called "Seed" (which is the name of the serial killer of this movie )) I'm close to joining the hate club. This movie does not make any sense at all ... the plot is a joke and, although Boll clearly tries to get the attention of shocking people, 90% of this movie is simply boredom. You can summarize this movie like this: <br /> <br /> 1. The hooded killer looks at clips of tortured animals on television. This is a real-life video of fur farms and the movie starts with the ridiculous reason to "make a statement about humanity" and give Peta a direction. Since this movie has no message and is the worst piece of torture porno-exploitation, you already have a reason to hate the movie from the beginning. <br /> <br /> 2. Death by electrocution with a pretext that reveals what happens later on in this movie printed on the screen so that all the retardants can obtain it. <br /> <br /> 3. The cops watch videos of animals, babies and women starving and decomposing in the basement of Seeds, having stupid nightmares and crying in their whiskey because Seed is an evil villain. Although the performance is fine, the film is submerged every time you try to incorporate emotions ... <br /> <br /> 4. The police stop Seed at home, act stupid and reduce in the dark. This sequence reminds me of a video game, you hardly see anything except flashlights. Seed is a super murderer who is everywhere at once and all the police act stupid enough to be killed ... except one who catches him. <br /> <br /> 5. Seed takes the chair and we see his electrocution as long as everything else in this "movie" ... he will not die and reminds us of the initial statement that he should be released if he survives 3 blows electric Guess what ... they only bury him alive to solve the problem. <br /> <br /> 6. The seed comes out of its grave, kills everyone in another part of court and then looks for the main policeman to take revenge. <br /> <br /> 7. A woman hits her head with a hammer in an endless sequence from a point of view just for the value of fun and impact. <br /> <br /> 8. Seed captures the family of policemen, draws him into his house, threatens to kill his wife and daughter. After killing his wife with a nail gun, the policeman shoots himself in the head considering that that's what Seed wants (it's hard to get into that guy's head, since he not only uses his mask even in jail, but never utters a word ... the movie almost does not have any dialogue, so it does not matter. <br /> <br /> 9. Boll looks for a nihilistic and surprising ending where Seed blocks the daughter with his dead father to rot like the people we saw in the video in sequence 3. <br /> <br /> This is all ... no message, no argument, no reason, no face behind The mask, there is no background, except the stupid story that Seed burned himself as a child. <br /> <br /> This film is based only on some key scenes and their impact value. emotion, message or entertainment, it's like seeing August Underground ... that's fine with me, some You will enjoy this brainless tobacco. But what is really hard to bear is the pseudo-message at the beginning and the fact that the film is well done considering the camera work, the effects and even the acting is too good for this waste of celluloid. <br /> <br /> So, how do you get Boll money to make those "movies" when thousands of talented directors work in limited budgets? "Seed" is not only the essence of the ridiculous, it is living proof that the free market has flaws ... luckily the German taxpayer is paying a large amount of this garbage to obtain deductions.
