Now I have never seen a bad movie in all my years, but what happens with the songs in the movie is the physiological meaning that it has. WOW, some demented Pokémon appear and multiply. I can get an attack on this. Animie does not make sense. The creators do not make sense. It is a great marketing scheme. They just have to reduce the songs and get a good grade. I think this movie would have been fine if they posted a message. You must see all episodes of Pokémon. Understand what is happening and it is not a movie. It's just an animation that should be in the video. <br /> <br /> Ps: I will give you a 1 because I only received 5 dollars, I could not give half because there are no halves.
