Are you kidding me?! A show that highlights someone who opens cans and envelopes for a meal? How talented do you have to be to do this? She MAY be able to cook, but she is NOT represented in this agitated stomach pain for half an hour. I know she has an empire of Martha-Stewart-esquire. Also Warren Buffett, but I do not see it with fake knockers that open cans of cream corn and Alpo. <br /> <br /> She has a nephew named ... Brycer. Brycer? Stop talking about someone with such a stupid name. <br /> <br /> More time is spent on "table landscapes" than in the real kitchen. Who has that kind of time ?! The silicon should be on your spatula, not on my TV. This program should be on Cartoon Network, NOT on the Food Network.
