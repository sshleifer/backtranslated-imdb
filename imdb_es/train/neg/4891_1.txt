I want to clarify some things. I'm not familiar with Ming-liang Tsai's films, and I'm very familiar with art movies; I grew up in the seventies of Goddard, Fellini, Bergman, Bertolucci and many others. <br /> <br /> Art films were really ART; like the paintings People did it to express their inner feelings, without really worrying if other people understood something. They were beyond commercial values; just look at something from old Antonioni (or early Picasso) and you'll understand. <br /> <br /> Tian Bian yi duo yun (The Wayward Cloud) has nothing to do with it. It is an opportunistic film, destined to deceive the judges and critics of the festival, interpreting many things without saying anything. <br /> <br /> The story does not make sense. The lack of water causes the government to promote the use of watermelons to hydrate. A girl in despair, steals the water from the WC public toilets. There is also a porno start (neighbor) that tries to make a movie with an actress that he does not seem comfortable with. There is a romantic awakening between the girl and the porn star. The mess ends with a sexual scene (not pornographic) that many people feel shocked, but I think it is less provocative than you can see in American Pie or History of Violence. <br /> <br /> The two main characters never speak. Sometimes, a musical style with the number 60 appears and explains (through a song) what happens in the minds of the characters. These video clips are really welcome because the previous scene, without dialogue or music only for people who look at each other, sometimes takes 4, 5 or even more minutes, which in movie times is TOO MUCH. <br /> <br /> There are also some snippets about "the hard to do sex without love", the "selfish mind of the porn industry". <br /> <br /> It is obvious that this film was intended (to get away with it) to deceive the juries and critics of the festivals. It has some pseudo-shocking scenes (within the limits of Taiwan censorship) and many issues are open, but nothing is concluded or going anywhere. <br /> <br /> These tricks got the film some important (disputed) prices at film festivals and made the film an undeserved commercial success (I see the film in France and the theater was full). <br /> <br /> However, please, do not be fooled. There is nothing new or original, not even originally said or filmed in this movie. It's boring and empty; Really a fraud to the public. Boogie Nights (which I did not like very much), Intimacy and 9 Songs are much better movies.
