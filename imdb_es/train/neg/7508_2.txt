I wish Spike Lee had chosen a different title for his movie. "Summer Of Sam" conveys the impression that the film is about the infamous serial killer, David Berkowitz. It is not. It is a portrait of street life in New York City during the hot summer of '77 when Berkowitz terrorized that city. <br /> <br /> The film follows several young fictional characters in an Italian-American neighborhood, and their reactions to the Son of Sam's threat. There are Vinny and his wife Dionna; there's Richie and Ruby, and several other characters. <br /> <br /> The problem is that these characters are not nice. They are routinely annoying and, sometimes, unbearable. Lee, then, silences their high energy and chaotic lives, which are full of anger, lust and general agitation. There are at least two scenes of prolonged struggle between Vinny and his wife, redundant scenes of disco dance, innumerable gabfests ... I kept asking myself: where is the editor of the film? <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, with all that volume. , the film passes the opportunity to convey any real sense of fear or fear that arises from the threat of the Son of Sam, which is too deep in the background. Lee is more successful in showing a different kind of threat, which comes from neighborhood watch groups. <br /> <br /> The performance is uniformly good. That, combined with the disco music of the 70s, and the splendid attention to costumes and production design, make you feel like you're in an Italian-American neighborhood in New York in 1977. <br /> <br /> Atmospheric authenticity of the film, however, is not enough to compensate for an exaggerated and exaggerated writing about the lives of extremely irritating people.
