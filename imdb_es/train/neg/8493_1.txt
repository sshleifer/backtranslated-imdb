Many days after watching Conceiving Ada, I am still surprised that a group of people spend so much time making such an atrocious movie. <br /> <br /> No one should see this movie with the hope of learning something important. about Ada Lovelock, her colleagues or the product of her efforts. <br /> <br /> Similarly, no one should watch this movie in the hope of entertaining themselves. <br /> <br /> Like a science fiction movie. , this would undoubtedly be a tremendous failure. Somehow, the main character manages to bring the past to life and interact with him on his personal computer, with advice and words of encouragement from Timothy Leary. I doubt that anyone can suspend their disbelief enough to prevent this from looking absolutely absurd. <br /> <br /> Like a dramatic movie, this would undoubtedly be a tremendous failure. Somehow, the writer / director manages to complete eighty-five minutes with a constant, unnecessary, annoying and trivial drama about practically nothing. I doubt anyone can feel that all the drama in the movie only serves as an irritating distraction. <br /> <br /> I find it difficult to fully express my degree of contempt for Conceive Ada. The circumstances in which I saw it forbade me to leave the theater, but there is no doubt that I would have something else. I'm still angry that I lost the time it took to see it. Just to be able to criticize this movie more effectively, I would like to be more eloquent.
