F * ck Me! I've seen some incredibly horrible movies in my time, but this takes the p * ss! <br /> <br /> Honestly, I can not express in words how bad this movie really is. In addition to the plot that is not really there, the comical fucking act, the hilariously frightening excuses for zombies; You know what, I could continue all day. Every little thing in this movie is stupid, meaningless, trash or shameful. I express to anyone who wants to see this movie ... no! <br /> <br /> I'm ashamed to say that I have this on my shelf. It's hidden right in the damn bottom of the huge pile. I could not even give this excuse for a movie away. That is how bad it is.
