I was also cheated by the packaging. I also fell in love with the bloody packaging and the DVD cover that says "saddened fans because every copy was taken off the shelves". Even though it was cheap ($ 6.99), it really was not worth it, I was not scared and it was very limited. The ending was very cheesy and did not give the blow it should have. I really do not even know how it became a "Nasty Video" with how gentle it is. The story drags, the characters are obvious amateur actors ... does not live up to the promise. The DVD bonus feature (the "interview") is very strange since the director seems very incoherent and not everyone is there. The main actress speaks as if she appeared in a Shakespeare production. It is a great laugh.
