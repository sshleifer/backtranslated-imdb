Why did I waste my time with this movie? There was not a single funny joke or line along. The slapstick was not even slightly fun. I mean really, a vacuum suction tube out of control? Why is the name National Lampoon attached to this movie? Even the Christmas holidays were better than this (I actually thought the movie was fun). <br /> <br /> AVOID THE PLAGUE!
