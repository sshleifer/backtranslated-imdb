This film is extremely boring, tells the story of a gas station owner and her life. Nothing exciting ever happens. The director has really "kept it real" and feels like a camera following a woman while living her life. I had to see other films by this director for a class, the others were not so boring. This movie was also seen for a task ... it's worth the boredom with a good rating !! In general, unless required, do not watch the movie. But do not discount other films by this director, because they are not so bad ... and do not discount other films about Africa, they are generally good, especially when made by a Western director.
