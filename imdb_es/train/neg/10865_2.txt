I love the MBBS of munna bhai but "Lagge raho ..." SUX really SUX. I've never seen such a boring movie in my entire life. And these high grades really amazed me that Wat had gone through the taste of Indian cinema viewers? <br /> <br /> ** YOU CAN BE SPOILER ** <br /> <br /> An educated girl needs the advice of a Bhai, people who discuss her personal problem. on the phones are the man what part of the world are you from? I agree that movies must be fictional, but these things are really indigestible. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10. (2 stars is for a good start of 15 minutes)
