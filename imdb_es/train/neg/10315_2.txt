I can not believe that people thought that this stinking pile of garbage was funny. Changing moods between cruelty, disgust and stupidity, "There is something about Mary" leaves little reason to stay until the end. Sure, Cameron DÃ­az is very nice, but that will never be enough to save a movie. Ben Stiller struggles to work within the plot, and obviously has a lot of talent, but the film is a loser. <br /> <br /> Not once was any of the scenes credible. The shots were badly synchronized and badly framed. The Farreley brothers must stay away from making movies at all costs. I check IMDB to see what they are working on, so I know what to avoid. <br /> <br /> 2/10; The bonus is the only time I smiled. It is not that I am immune to humor or only in my opinion. My wife also hated it. The next day we saw 'Rush Hour' and laughed laughing. This movie just sucked.
