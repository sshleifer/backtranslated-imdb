A really terrible movie. At first I did not know that this was a Kiwi effort, but very soon I began to realize that all the characters spoke with kiwi accents barely disguised beneath the false Americans. Why did he have to be established in America anyway? - could have been established in New Zealand and then the actors could have used their normal voices. Surely someone on the production team could hear the terrible attempts to speak with an American accent? A bad bad movie. I'm surprised it lasted so long. How did you get out of the can? It just seemed like a very poor attempt at a Segal / Willis action movie. A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY! If there were money from the TAXPAYERS in this garbage, it would be leading a revolution so that all the money is returned to the Treasury. I'm still staggering (understand, word game, staggering!) For the absolute trash I just saw. Why did I keep looking? Well, I'm a fan of the movie and I can not help myself!
