So they exaggerated the violence and has been branded as sick. Well, I'm afraid that violence is the best thing, but unfortunately the characters are not developed enough to allow us to understand why they are going on their rampage (totally predictable). This movie has a really terrible script. We never have the opportunity to meet Robert and his actions in the end are just pathetic. The performance is not much better, the worst of them is the television chef and the school teacher. The direction is clumsy, the pace enough for you to fall asleep. And what is the project of the school film about? A comment about the movie itself maybe? The use of news during the climate murder is ridiculous. These guys obviously think they are intellectual, but they are desperately out of their depth. How the hell they made Yorgos' great arvanitis ignite her, I'll never know. And how they got the money to do it in the first place is an even bigger mystery. Absolutely horrible beyond understanding.
