I have never read the book "A wrinkle in time". To be perfectly honest, after watching the movie, do I really want to do it? Well, I should not be reviewing this movie, I'll start with that. Next I will say that the television movie is quite forgettable. Do you know why I say that? Because I forgot what happens in it. I told you it was forgettable. To be honest, no television movie will be better than "Merlin." <br /> <br /> How do I describe a television movie? I have never written a review for one before. Well, I'll just say that they usually have some celebrities. A wrinkle in time includes only one. Alfre Woodard (or Woodward, I'm not sure), the Oscar winner. <br /> <br /> The film has special effects of cheese, a slightly interesting plot, scenes that make you pass "WTF". The movie is incredibly bad and makes you go "WTF". What did you expect? It is a television movie. They are usually not good. How is this. A wrinkle in time is a waste of time and a great waste of time. To make matters worse, the most likely thing is that you forget about it as soon as it's over. Well, maybe not the second one's over. But in a few minutes. <br /> <br /> A wrinkle in time: * / ****
