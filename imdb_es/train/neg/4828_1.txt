I picked up TRAN SCAN from the library and brought it home. We considered taking a trip east and thought that it would give us an idea of ​​what it was like. The movie was a total waste of time, if I went out to buy it, I would call it TRAN SCAM when I saw that it cost $ 49. <br /> <br /> The DVD lasted 8 minutes and showed a roller coaster. through Canada, with my stomach feeling sick as they went up and down and curved around with the film at high speed. <br /> <br /> There were many images that probably filmed in this and you would think they could have done it. He made a better product. If I had done this project, I would have provided more images, I had paused the traffic signals so that people knew where they were and stopped at places to see the landscape. To make a movie like this it should have been 60 to 90 minutes. Oh, yeah, the case said it was in stereo, the whole movie was a whistle of the accelerated sound of the car, which could at least put music on it. <br /> <br /> If you want a good movie from Canada. See The railrodder / National Film Board of Canada starring Buster Keaton (the one from the last movie he made) in this comic movie. Buster Keaton gets on a speed train in Nova Scotia and travels to British Columbia.
