While watching the movie, I'm not sure which direction to take. There is a reason why a writer should not direct his work and even act in it too, you can not do everything. I felt that the story really suffered in this film because the director wore so many hats. Mrs. McTeer is the movie. To add to his incredible talents, his representation of this woman was the reason why he was engaged. Here is a British actress who can do anything. In my opinion, conflict is what makes drama and a great story. I felt that this movie did not have that. Everything was easy for the characters, there were no real obstacles that prevented the characters get what they wanted. Watch the film to know the sweetness, but especially for the brilliant performance of Mrs. McTeer.
