Disappointing and undeniably boring real crime movie that has misread actor Jeremy Renner, languidly muttering his way to the title role of Jeffrey Dahmer, who was easily one of the most recognizable degenerate / serial killers of the last century. Launched directly into the video in early 2003, "Dahmer" is an openly sarcastic, boring, badly performed, and virtually bloodless snore feast of a true crime drama that never delves into the monstrous, insane psyche of the late mass murderer. As if I had perfectly good potential to do! However, what it does, for reasons unknown to me, is to evoke some kind of sympathy in the viewer for the man by interpreting it as what is ultimately a lonely, nebbishy and socially inept homosexual loser who was simply watching. For love in all the wrong places, unlike the cold, calculating and depraved sick and crazy that was! In general, the "Dahmer" of 2003 is one that true crime fans anywhere can omit because I'm not kidding when I say it's one of the worst biopics of serial killers ever made. It is even sadder than other pathetic and exploitative direct video wastes like "Gacy", "Bundy", "Ed Gein" and "The Night Stalker"! (Turkey-zero stars)
