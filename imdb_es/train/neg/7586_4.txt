Summer Holiday is the forgotten musical version of Eugene O'Neill's Ah Wilderness and deservedly so with the Broadway musical adaptation of Take Me Along. With the exception of Stanley Steamer's song, none of the other Harry Warren-Ralph Blane songs are worth remembering and even that is questionable. <br /> <br /> It was just after the release of this movie that MGM let Mickey Rooney go and I do not think it was a coincidence. The film was made in 1946 and premiered in 1948, so Mickey was 26 years old playing Andy Hardy as a teenager. He was too old for the part of a 17-year-old boy who was affecting radical ideas in a spirit of youthful rebellion. <br /> <br /> Rooney made four films for MGM from 1946 to 1948, this one, Killer McCoy a new version of A Crowd Roars by Robert Taylor, Love Laughs in Andy Hardy and Words and Music. In all of them, Rooney played an adult role. Even in the Andy Hardy movie, Mickey played an adult, Andy Hardy came back from World War II. Why he was in this Louis B. Mayer only knows. <br /> <br /> Rooney's misguided cast makes summer vacation even worse, because in the original Ah Ahmadre the emphasis is on the character of the father played here by Walter Huston. And on the Broadway show Take Me Along, which won a Tony Award for Jackie Gleason, the Great One played the intoxicated Uncle Sid, here played by Frank Morgan, and that's the central character. <br /> <br /> Gloria DeHaven intervenes for Judy Garland as the sweet and adorable girlfriend of Rooney and Marilyn Maxwell plays the showgirl who gives Rooney an adult education. In the original work, O'Neill has her as a prostitute, but this was the Hollywood of the Code, so all Marilyn does is let the young Rooney be fired. <br /> <br /> Many really talented people stepped into this one and do the best they can, but summer vacations quickly fade into a cold fall.
