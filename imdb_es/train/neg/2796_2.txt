For the most part, On Demand offers some pretty horrible horror films, and only offers other horror movies that everyone has already seen and where they already have an opinion. It was this, or Invinicible (I like Mark Wahlberg's films), that I have not seen, and I was actually in a mood to watch movies, which does not happen often because I've already seen all the movies I have. A million times, and that's a lot of movies, and I do not have much interest in the new movies, and this movie made me regret it. I'm not going to put spoilers, I'm just going to tell you that only some of the few actors in this movie are pretty decent. I think the main girl, the dead woman who kills everyone, is very annoying, but convincing; I would take her for a psycho bitch at any time, so she fits well into her roll, although it is unconvincing. The blood is not so good, just some of the deaths, or I can say that the "wounds" are fine, but you do not see much and there are no body part elements in the movie to make the injuries look more convincing. Towards the end of the film, I was begging my girlfriend to turn it off, and being a member of the band, the "recording" parts were not very interesting either, although what actually happened would happen when it was recorded. I'm finished, if you want to see this, do what you want.
