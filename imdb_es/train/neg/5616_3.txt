This will be brief. Let me say first that I am an agnostic and I am not exactly crazy about the Uxtians, especially the Uxtian fanatics. However, this documentary had a tone similar to that of a teenager angry with his xtian mother for not letting him play video games. I just could not take it seriously. Mentioning how Charles Manson thought he was Christ to illustrate the point at which Christianity can breed evil? I do not know, it was only cheap and childish, it made the opposition seem ignorant. On the other hand, the narrator was simply stiff and pretentious. The delivery was too complete. I can not take this documentary seriously. He could appeal to an angry teenager angry at his xtian mother for not letting him play video games.
