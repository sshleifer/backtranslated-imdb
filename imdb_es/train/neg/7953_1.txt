While it can be argued that the acting and directing have some merit, the story is a very poor film from Vietnam, whose country name simply changed. <br /> <br /> At least, for a movie to have some credibility, try to have some appearance of precision in the equipment, weapons and tactics. It does not matter the disgusting distortion of the behavior of the troops as a rule. <br /> <br /> Apart from the limited use as silly propaganda about the South African Defense Force, it is useless, it definitely has no entertainment value. <Br /> <br /> Aspiring movie makers: this is how not to make a war movie. Do some research and be proud of your product.
