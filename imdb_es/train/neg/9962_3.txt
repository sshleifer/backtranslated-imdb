Uta Hagen's "Respect for acting" is the standard textbook in many university theater courses. In the book, Hagen presents two fundamentally different approaches to developing a character as an actor: the presentation approach and the representation approach. In the presentation approach, the actor focuses on realizing the character in the most honest way possible, introducing emotional elements of the actor's own life. In the Representation approach, the actor tries to present the effect of an emotion through a high degree of control of movement and sound. <br /> <br /> The Representation approach to acting was still partially in vogue when this Hamlet was made. . British theater has a long history of this style of acting, and it could be said that Olivier is the last king of the School of Representation. <br /> <br /> Time has not been kind to this acting school or this movie. Almost all the actors who work today use a presentation approach. For the modern eye, the stylized and enunciated delivery of Olivier is quite heavy, rigid and forced. Instead of creating a Hamlet with internal conflict, Olivier made a bullhorn of self-important declamation from the melancholic Dane, a style of acting that would have gotten well to the back of the biggest theaters in London, but is too starchy as for lunch. Modern Hamlet <br /> <br /> And so, the movie continues to move forward without desire today. Olivier's tendency to e-nun-ci-ate makes some of Hamlet's lines unintentionally funny: "Instead, you must acquire and have a purring time that can give you ... smoothness!" Instead of crying when meeting his father's ghost (as any suitable actor would), the bright lights of Olivier's students give us that impression. <br /> <br /> Eileen Herlie is the only other outstanding actress in this Hamlet, who has put a good trial on the queen, despite the painfully obvious age differences (he was 41, she was 26). The other actors in this film have no chance to do anything more significant, given Olivier's tendency to want to stay! the camera! at! absolutely! times! <br /> <br /> Sixty years later, you feel the insecurity of the Shakespearean stage actor who lacked the confidence to portray a brittle and flawed Hamlet, and instead chose to portray a kind of Elizabethan megaphone. Final analysis: "I'll have one of them killed by Termagant who is doing a job, surpasses Herod: I beg you to avoid it".
