This false journey never compares with the ingenuity and madness of the excellent adventure that these guys had in their first film. This installment tries to deviate from its prequel to capture some new blood from the joke, but it takes a wrong turn and the trips are nowhere interesting or fun. <br /> <br /> It takes almost half an hour to show the guys doing a rock concert (and a lot of people watching on "free TV", since when does that happen?) Surely the scriptwriter could have done something more creative; look at how all the random elements of the first film were carefully joined by a convergence in the presentation of science. Not in this movie, which practically ended with the Bill & Ted franchise. The joke was over. <br /> <br /> The Grim Reaper got into the mix, for whatever reason. This infusion, like the whole plot, is poorly made and lacks sparks for comedy or public participation. There is a ZZ Top print, hammered for no reason. There are lights, smoke, mirrors, noise. But nothing really creative or funny. <br /> <br /> Skip this false thing.
