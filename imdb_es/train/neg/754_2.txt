I must admit that I laughed when I saw a critic compare this with LOTR. Yes, if you exclude the dwarves, the cast of thousands, the great special effects, the great battles, the strong characterization, the decent plot, the good acting, the elegant direction and everything else. What leaves you with the walk. And boy, does this movie walk? If Mr. Piano got his way, it would probably be three hours of unconditional walking in the Wisconsin countryside, but every 40 minutes or so, these annoying Martians appear for a few seconds to interrupt him before he goes for a walk . . You've never seen so much walking in a movie. If this really had a budget of $ 20 million, most of it must have been in Mr. Piano's shoes, because he had to go through a lot of pairs with all the walking he does. Which explains why there is no money left for decent effects, a decent video camera or appropriate actors. Honestly, it's like watching a strange video fetish for people who intend to take long walks in period costumes. Even in fast forward, this is a relaxed hike. <br /> <br /> As for science fiction things, I think it was a mistake to put the Martians in the movie: they just get in the way of the walk. , which is clearly much more interesting for the director than the story. <br /> <br /> I wonder how much Mr. Piano charges to the dogs that walk.
