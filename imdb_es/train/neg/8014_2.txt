"Wild tigers that I've known." It will only be shown in the big cities, to be sure. It's one of those very artistic films, which does not make any sense, except for the director! I hate those! And all those people, oh, so alternative / artistic, try DESPERATELY to find "metaphors" in what is EVIDENT horseshit. <br /> <br /> There was NO plot, neither history, nor moral, nor chronology, nor anything funny or even touching. For me, it was a lot of scenes that had nothing to do with each other, and they were all "show" to show how "artistic" and "visual" could come. It was an INTENT in another film of adolescent anguish, but the mark was lost at all humanly possible levels. Then the credits go! I was waiting for SENSE! I was waiting for "the good part". I have about 60 independent films in my DVD collection, many of which could be called "art house" movies. This will NOT be between them. You will be very angry with yourself for paying to see this movie, let alone buy it on DVD.
