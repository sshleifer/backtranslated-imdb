This is another Northeast Florida production, filmed mainly on and near Fernandina Beach and Kingsley Plantation. I was quite surprised that the company could take the main street of Fernandina Beach as long as it was necessary to achieve the street scenes. The movie is pretty, and pretty bad. Tami Erin is cute, but overreacts. Eileen Brennan exaggerates even more. Good for small children, or for those who like fluff in large doses. A 4 of the Miller-Movies formula.
