Necessarily ridiculous film version of the literary classic "Moby Dick". John Barrymore is Captain Ahab, who falls in love with the pastor's daughter, Joan Bennett. His brother Derek is a rival for the affections of Mrs. Bennett. When Mr. Barrymore loses his leg in a whaling accident, Bennett rejects it. He must kill the whale and retrieve Bennett ... <br /> <br /> There are several scenes that may have thrilled the 1930 theatrical audience; particularly the scenes that involve Barrymore losing his leg. The film has not aged well, however; There are much better films of the time, both the silences of the twenties and those of the thirties. The two named attractions, John Barrymore and Joan Bennett are not at their best. <br /> <br /> **** Moby Dick (8/14/30) Lloyd Bacon ~ John Barrymore, Joan Bennett, Lloyd Hughes
