... not living in Montana and especially not living there at the end of the 19th century. <br /> <br /> "A river runs through it" is certainly a well-made film from a kinetic point of view. Great landscapes, Redford acting well. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the story is bad (if there is a story) <br /> <br /> I felt sorry for the narrator / author, who is a character as dry and narrow as his father, a preacher . Being driven, not leading his own life, he is allowed to see his brother, who is also caged in the environment of a small town, losing his life. The author does not even come close to understanding his brother's motivations, but at least he realizes that he lacks the slightest amount of fun / fun. All there is is fly fishing, where he follows, even as an older man, the style of his father. <br /> <br /> The ending is not surprising, it is predictable from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Definitely NOT a must see (3/10) <br /> <br />
