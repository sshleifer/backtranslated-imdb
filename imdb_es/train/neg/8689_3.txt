The main problem with "Power" is that it also has nonsense characters and subplots that do not add anything to the movie. It gets boring after a while, sitting around waiting for scenes that do not connect to find something that drives the movie. You could probably pass it all as character development, but they are all recycled from previous scenes in the movie or they are simply simple and uninteresting. Lumet never gives enough time to let any of the actors in the cast blossom. I should have cut some of the characters (hackman, wife) and concentrate more on the others (Billings). It could have been a great political thriller, hard, instead of a messy mess that loses any message in a sea of ​​bad writing and acting, a fact that surprised me when considering the cast. Even Gene Hackman's performance was not up to par. Denzel Washington is the only real actor of the note here. Gere and the others have done much better performances in other places. <br /> <br /> Sidney Lumet needs to return to the fierce demonstration of a man he did in the seventies (ie, Serpico) and stop trying to regain his success with "12 Angry Men" and "Fail Safe". It still has not worked, Sidney, and probably never will. Leave the dramas as a whole to Altman. <br /> <br /> 3/10 <br /> <br /> * / * * * *
