"ASTONISHING" screams the LA Times from the front of the DVD box. They must be referring to the fact that such a pitiful shit was ever released. The film revolves around a group of girls who have an illness that forces them to become cannibals and kill innocent people just to stay alive. His skin is detached throughout the film, we also see cut legs, heads, etc. which are as convincing as a Halloween Fuzzy Felt set. There are a lot of talks, a little human cooking and a strange chapter of zombie hunters who imprison the sick of the skin disease in their closet tied to a chair, before stabbing them in the head, cutting them. in bits ... <br /> <br /> You get the image. Considering that there is no acting talent on display, and the gore is ridiculously unrealistic, what is the point of all this farrago? Once again, looking at the video frame, the person in charge of it is a "clandestine cult director". Would that be like those strange religious cults where they brainwash you so that you think in a way when clearly the opposite is true? Because that's the only possible reason I can think of so that anyone can get pleasure from seeing this tax reduction. Then, in the same paragraph, it is compared to Mike Leigh, Ken Loach and George Romero. HAHAHAHAHA oh stop. Now you're just being silly. <br /> <br /> Do you like this movie? Are you offended by the previous opinion? If so, you must be a member of that cult. Do they pocket their salaries? Do they let you see other family members? Do they force you to watch Andrew Parkinson movies until you think he's the best director since A. Hitchcock? Tell him ... this sounds like a special elaboration of Panorama for me. And say hello to the criticism of Los Angeles times when you return to your colony, will you? 0/10
