What is this? A zombie movie produced in Canada that I had never heard of before. A mortician works on the body of a recently deceased young man. This allows an extended flashback that shows how the boy got there. Basically, he and his friends went to a cemetery on Friday the 13th and resurrected the dead thanks to his stupid song. Trim the morgue where our corpse comes back to life and kills the shroud and the owner (whose eyes are taken out). The last WTF? Shot has the owner of the funeral home in a straight jacket and shouting "I'm not crazy!" Surprisingly, he has his eyeballs back. <br /> <br /> With just 58 minutes, this is certainly a rarity in zombie movies. It feels much longer, but it put me in a kind of trance where I could not stop seeing. The movie also has one of those gags "if you see this image, get away from the screen". It is the image of an old sick person in a theater (prophetic?) And when it appears (only twice) the blood begins to flow. The scenes are pretty bloody for the period of time. There is a big mistake in which a zombie cuts the right hand of a girl with a shovel, but, when he throws the fake hand in the frame to chew it, it is a left hand.
