OK, I've been a big fan of the Blacks for a long time and I WAS GONE after seeing this movie. Let's name the problems ... First, this movie has a lot of the same equipment as the first two. It has also been called PREQUELA to the original Black Stallion. Why is it that they can not correct the name of Shetan's mother or her color? In The Black Stallion Returns, we learn that Sagr was the mother of Black's CHESTNUT and in this film she is a gray mare named Jenny?!?!?!?!? WTF? And it is set in Africa in 1946 and 1947 ... It could be wrong, but the first was also established in the 1940s when the ship was shipwrecked. The timeline does not sound very good to me. Also, as a mistake, there is a Friesian at the beginning of the movie who is supposed to be Shetan's father ... then on more notice, he seems to be a nerd. Ben Ishaak is the only character left to make this film seem related to the previous two in any way. It may be a nice family movie for some, but it's my biggest movie disappointment of the year.
