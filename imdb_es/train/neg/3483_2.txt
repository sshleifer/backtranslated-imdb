Surviving Christmas (2004) Ben Affleck, James Gandolfini, Christina Applegate, Catherine O 'Hara, Josh Zuckerman, Bill Macy, Jennifer Morrison, Udo Kier, D: Mike Mitchell. Abandoned by his girlfriend, a yuppie does not want to be left alone at Christmas, so he decides to return home as a child, imposing himself on the dysfunctional family that now lives there and bribes them to pose as his family. An unpleasant, one-dimensional performance by Affleck, who acts mainly with a striking smile, makes his character become a mentally unbalanced scam, but Gandolfini and O 'Hara bring this disaster to life. Even for the farce, his stupidity is heavy, he does not make much sense from one scene to another, and his sentimental messages are as false as Affleck's smile. 91 min., Classified PG-13. * Â½
