This is the saddest collection of clich√©s, united in a straight line, without a perceptible plot or any decent way of acting that I've seen in a long time. Cannibalizing scenes from Star Wars, Reign of Fire, Godzilla, Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, was a total war against the intelligence of the viewer. Was this movie good? It was not a movie at all! <br /> <br /> Even if it is not so low as to be really fun and achieve cult status as a comedy, the film offers some laughs. The trick is to put the scenes copied in the context of his original films. Gandalf can be fun talking in Korean, the basilisk looks like a very funny snake if you compare it with a kitten and the evil henchman can provide you with a lot of fun alternating between Sauron and Jaja-bing, or whatever you call it. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: any pleasure derived from this film completely depends on the state of intoxication and imagination of the viewers, not the director / writer. What a shame, Shim!
