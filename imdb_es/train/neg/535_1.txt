Some of these comments from the viewer are simply ridiculous. Is not it painful to watch with your partner? I was apologizing to my boyfriend the whole movie. <br /> <br /> It was so slow and terribly strange. <br /> <br /> Redgraves, Vanessa and Natasha were not suitable for this, especially with Vanessa doing that ridiculous American accent. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes was the same clumsy, clumsy-looking one in My So-Called Life. She still has to push herself in no way. Girl, find a new way to pretend to cry! <br /> <br /> Meryl Streep was one of the only redeeming parts of this movie, she was on the screen for five minutes, and I swear to God, she came out of the movie screen and slapped me to wake me up. <br /> <br /> Oh! And Hugh Dancy, who improves every time I see him. <br /> <br /> Glenn Close and Eileen Atkins were also great in their two and a half scenes. <br /> <br /> I mean, this was a well filmed movie, it was very pretty, the setting was dressed in an interesting way, relieving the intense boredom I was feeling. <br /> <br /> I do not know, it's pretty pathetic when a movie that has a cast composed of "The best actresses of our time" stinks so much. Surely he had more than a few notable editing errors, and the main character (Ann) was a big jerk. I was glad that she died. But that's because I felt bad for Lila, Ann's friend, mainly because these two women were better actors and they made me feel a bit of empathy. <br /> <br /> Ugh. BAD work, late movie. You were not entertained and you did not even think about it. I hope the book was better, so it did not waste any more time on people. 3/10
