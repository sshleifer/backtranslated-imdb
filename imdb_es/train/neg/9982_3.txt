The story starts slowly and nothing funny happens for a while. All the action is at the end, but you will not have to laugh because the movie is funny, but because the story is pathetic. <br /> <br /> The funniest part is when Harvey "I'm not Paranoia" Keitel really loses it and the judge starts a massacre. Oscars for this boy!
