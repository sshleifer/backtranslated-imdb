What can I say about cruel intentions 2? Well, I can say it in all honesty, I will only see this movie again if you tie me to a chair and open my eyes to the orange-mechanical style. <br /> <br /> The movie "stars" Robin Dunne (No, I never heard from him either, whose terrible impression that Ryan Phillipe made me tremble.) In a terrible cast case, Dunne tries (and fails) to bring As the actor is not handsome, charismatic or charming, the character is totally amazing Amy Adams, (she was once in a buffy episode), tries to continue where Sarah Michelle Gellar left of playing Katherine in the making ... However, Adams is not such a good actress and her performance was flat and without any real emotion, she often seemed to be reading cue cards right out of the camera, however, there were two good actors in the film, Barry Flatman (Saw 2 and Saw 3) and Mimi Rogers (Mrs. Kensington in Austion Powers), made very good and entertaining performances as the parents of Sebastian and Katherine and are the only reason why he qualified the movie as a 2, no as a 1. <br /> <br /> The film itself is a poor version of the original, with low points like the paper copies of the dialogue and the imitated scenes lacking the originality of the previous film. <br /> <br /> I think like a television show, it could have worked, but it would have been modified with people who could act in the main parts.
