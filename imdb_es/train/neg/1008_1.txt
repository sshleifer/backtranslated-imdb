The plot of 'Edison' was decent, but one actor in particular ruined the whole movie. Justin Timberlake ruined the movie with every line he uttered during the movie. He is, by far, one of the worst actors I've seen in my life, and should face the same fate as the entire F.R.A.T. team. <br /> <br /> Whether it's an emotional scene, an action scene or even a silent scene, Justin Timberlake managed to ruin it. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time watching this movie. Do not even bother to download it, dwarf porn would be a much better option. <br /> <br /> And Justin, if you're reading this, stay with the music. Even though you're not good at that, you've done a wonderful job fooling people into thinking you can really sing.
