I suppose if you like science fiction and horror things, it can be interesting. The performance was good but not great. The two pregnant girls are supposed to be fifteen, but they are played by obviously older actresses who turned out to be twenty-one and twenty at that time. The plot is fine, but the story jumps a bit, leaving one guessing if you're in Boston or Pennsylvania. The priest seems to use deformation speed between the two. The Catholic Church is presented as a secret sect to investigate events that only happen to those of that faith. What if the two girls had been Protestants? Would Catholics be cared for? Therefore, some achieved it. Who knows, some day the Catholic Church could even learn what the Bible teaches. If you miss it, do not feel that you have lost anything.
