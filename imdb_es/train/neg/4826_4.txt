I see what the director was trying to do, but he lost the mark. The main actor was really good, but the editing around his moments takes you out of that. The work of the camera, that is, the lighting and the exposer is a type of amateur who could forgive if the direction was more fluid but it was not. The sound was a bit off and that takes you out of the movie too. I see that this director could improve a bit in the future, so it's not a correct total, but do not expect a dv movie as good as 28 days later or nothing, keep your expectations low and you'll get more of that. At least it was only an hour and a half. Oh, yes, and apart from the protagonist, the performance was pretty bad if you ask me. But I'm a snob from the movie, so take it for what it's worth.
