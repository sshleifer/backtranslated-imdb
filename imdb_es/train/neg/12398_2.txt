Look, it's the third, so you know it's bad. And "Maniac Cop" was not good enough to justify the second installment, so you know it's even worse. But how much worse? Terrible, approaching God, horrible. <br /> <br /> When Maniac Cop goes on a wave of murders, a reporter exclaims: "What happened here can ONLY be described as a black rainbow of death." <br /> <br /> 1- The rainbows are not black, and they can never be. 2- Rainbows are harmless and can never inflict pain or death. 3 - A news reporter, a valuable one for your agency, could find another way to describe the consequences of a wave of murders. "A black rainbow of death" is not the ONLY way to describe the given situation. <br /> <br /> This is what you need.
