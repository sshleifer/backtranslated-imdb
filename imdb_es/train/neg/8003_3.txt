Do not be fooled as it was by the "brilliant" critics cited in the DVD box. "Very entertaining", "a really scary freakout", and worst of all, "ON PAR WITH JAWS". This movie is not any of the above. <br /> <br /> Normally I do not bother writing bad reviews for movies, but I can not believe that this is resting at a comfortable 7 in IMDb. He does not deserve it. <br /> <br /> After an opening day attack of a monster created by, what is more, chemicals downloaded by lazy scientists, this film is not going anywhere and is going very slowly. Basically and unlikely, a girl is trapped by the monster (I'll give you points for a good creature design, but this is not a WETA creation) and her semi-comic family spends an hour and a half chasing it ... in the sewers that They surround the Han River. Their search lacks suspense again, did anyone call him on par with Jaws? -And the moment you find her, you realize that everything was pretty useless. Apart from that, a large part of the film is committed to a government quarantine that culminates in a funny scene involving a boy who spits in a gutter in front of a bus stop full of people. <br /> <br /> Blech. This was bad. I'm not kidding. Do you want to see a movie of rotten monsters? Rent Deep Rising. At least you will save 30 minutes of your life.
