There are some stimulating things to say about this, but I can mention that Matt Dillon does everything he can to make something out of nothing and the many divided screens and graphics that are worth it. Since most racing movies suffer from the premise that car lovers are not that smart, we end up with movies like this one. <br /> <br /> Lindsay Lohan, who was so surprised at Mean Girls, has to make better decisions about what roles to take. . Here it can only fail. <br /> <br /> Children will only be entertained a little because it tries to attract more adults than children (although it is still quite silly). Those of the theater with whom I saw it showed no real interest after a couple of minutes. And like a family sports movie, this is horrible. The best moments are at the beginning in the scrapyard creating a certain feeling and, later, in the car festival creating some tension. If you develop a car as a central character, you must develop it better than here. After some obligatory scenes of the race, the best part awaits you: to be able to leave the multiplex in your own car.
