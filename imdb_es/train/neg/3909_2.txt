When I heard that there was a movie that had my two favorite actresses, Meryl Streep and Wynona Ryder, I went for the roof! But I had a strong fall after seeing this film boring and I still have the bruise. First of all the character that Jeremy Irons (an actor that I still admire even after this disappointment) the plays were horrible. He treated his family as trash, especially his sister, played by Glenn Close. I could not approach or sympathize with any of the characters and I am not rude, but the sex scenes were really unnecessary or could have been attenuated. The characters of Wynona and Antonio could have developed much more and their romance could have been much more passionate. And what about the character of Meryl and her "mystic powers"? Why did not they enter this more? This movie had many dead ends and the conclusion is that it is a very bad movie and that there was a lot of talent wasted here.
