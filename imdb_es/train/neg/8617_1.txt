After having watched 10 minutes of this movie, I was baffled, after having watched 30 minutes my toes curled up, I just could not believe it: the movie is really horrible. In fact, it is so horrible that I had to see everything just to convince myself (!). During this, I realized that it reminded me of a group of Danish comedies from the 60s and 70s. The pattern is this: take an extremely popular comedian, make a script that puts this comedian in as many grotesque situations as possible, add a lot of jokes (especially from a single line), and add it to a couple of beautiful girls. Film that, and you have a success! I would not know if this movie was a success, but unlike the Danish tradition that died quietly (with some great comedians), it seems that there is a market for this type of films in the United States.
