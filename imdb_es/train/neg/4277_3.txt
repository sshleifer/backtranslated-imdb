The veteran director and producer Allan Dwan, whose large number of films includes both the forgettable and the recurring shown (for example, John Wayne in "Sands of Iwo Jima") tested a great musical with "I Dream of Jeanie". Taking advantage of a cast of singers with little past film experience and, as it turned out, virtually no future, he made a fictitious and largely offensive story about the great American composer, Stephen Foster. <br /> <br /> Bill Shirley is the young and in love Foster, whose kindness to slaves includes giving the money saved for an engagement ring to pay the hospital's cost for a wounded black child. His intention is Inez McDowell (Muriel Lawrence) whose annoying younger sister, Jeanie (Eileen Christy), is slowly realizing that she is in love with the singer of songs almost impecunante. Foster is in love with Inez, who revolts with the composer's number 1 in the song by Levee Parade Parade, "O Susannah". Enter the minstrel Edwin P.Christy (Ray Middleton) to help launch the profit phase of Foster's career. <br /> <br /> This is, according to the standards of the musical film of the early fifties, a great production. The sets are luxurious in that special Hollywood way that portrayed fakes with all the trimmings. The singers are not so bad and the songs of Foster are almost impossible to ruin. <br /> <br /> But this is also a literal rinse of the South antebellum. The biggest number has a black face for everyone on stage, a historical anomaly and a contemporary piece of thoughtless racism. If these representations of blacks were close to reality, the abolitionists would rightly be condemned to interfere with such a beneficent institution. <br /> <br /> "I Dream of Jeanie" apparently sank into the vault of the studio with barely a whisper of death. Now revived by Alpha Video for only $ 4.99 it is a period piece with charming songs and repulsive sentimentalizations about the victims of the great crime of the United States, slavery. <br /> <br /> This was what Hollywood was publishing two years before Brown v. Board of Education. It must have warmed the hearts of some moviegoers who brought their bedding to the theater.
