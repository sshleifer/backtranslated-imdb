I started watching this movie waiting for some impersonator of Hammer's horror movie ... and it was not far away. There is a good amount of blood shining, and they threw a lot of nudity, but the last part of the film presents some ironic twists. Sacred cow, they actually put a little thought into the story, and they did not completely fall for the predictable things that were expected at the beginning. And I dare say, part of the "free" nudity was not so gratuitous after all, because it fits with the story and the scenario. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, it's still a bad movie overall, but as bad movies go, it's a smarter tone than the REALLY horrible gut like Mesa of Lost Women and Robot Monster.
