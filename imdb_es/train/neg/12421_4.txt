Mark Pirro's "Deathrow Gameshow" of 1987 is a black comedy that is extremely cheesy in many places, but sometimes it's very funny. This movie could have been much better, the acting is terrible, and some extremely cheesy scenes make it difficult to watch it sometimes, but the concept is fun and has some fun moments. <br /> <br /> In the near future (the year 1991), the game programs have changed. Chuck Todean (John Mc Cafferty) presents a game show called "Live Or Die", in which prisoners sentenced to death have the opportunity to play for their lives and for money. Unsuccessful candidates are executed in the air using many different methods, such as guillotines, electric chairs and other more bizarre execution devices, followed by applause from the studio audience. The show is, of course, more than controversial, and Chuck has made many enemies ... <br /> <br /> "Deathrow Gameshow" is incredibly cheesy and horrible in many ways, and the acting is terrible, but Doubt is fun in many places, especially if you are a fan of black humor. You have not missed anything if you have not seen it, but it's definitely fun and a good waste of time. 4/10
