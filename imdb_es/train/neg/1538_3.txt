What a shame that a really competent director like Andre de Toth, who specialized in slippery and changing alliances, did not understand this concept first. It could have helped to bring out the real potential, especially with the interesting character played by William Bishop. As the film is, it is a disaster (as the critic Chipe affirms). The main problems are the address, the cheap budget and the deficient script. The strength lies in an excellent cast and an interesting general concept: characters thrown in different directions by conflicting forces. What was needed was someone with enough vision to gather the positive elements, reworking the script into a kind of coherent whole, instead of the uncomfortable and extensive mess that it is, (try to discover motivations and interaction if possible). In addition, a larger budget could have matched the contrast location and studio shots, and managed to get the locations out of the very obvious outskirts of Los Angeles. The real shame lies in the waste of an excellent cast: Hayden, Taylor (before his teeth were stopped), Dehner, Reeves, along with James Millican and William Bishop shortly before his untimely death. Few films illustrate the importance of an author with a vision more than this dark little western who, in the right hands, could have been much more.
