YOU MUST BE JOCKING !!!! Let's consider the possibility that Parker Posey is really an actress, and not just an entry in the actors' "club of the month". In fact, unless it is intended to be an ironic satire on David Mamet: a concise and confusing dialogue delivered alternately in the speed of machine guns or monotone (think of Ben Stein) or in a totally dry comedy; This movie has to be in the race for a Rotten Tomato Award --- or worse. <br /> <br /> As if the stiff and uncomfortable Posey was not enough, we have the stiffer and even more uncomfortable Jeff Goldblum. There is more wood in this film than a toothpick factory. <br /> <br /> Adding to this already strange casting, there are several other roles, all populated by forgettable actors, that look or sound like fugitives from the next United States Top Model, Don Pardo, or even the boy, who he pronounces the word "been" as "bean", which draws our attention to the fact that this film has nothing to please, we are analyzing his accent to guess if he is Canadian or not. !! I think I laughed heartily in places that are supposed to be serious, and I took seriously sections that are meant to be humorous. Even the soundtrack sounds like a caricature of Alarik Jans' music for Mamet's "The House of Games". If it is taken as a parody, the film is almost funny; if you take it seriously, it's just a piece of self-conscious drek.
