Who were they cheating with this? There was too much in this movie that was hard to digest. Since when Arjun (Ajay Devgan), without knowing it, he wants the death of his father when he arrives in London with his uncle (played by Om Puri) only to leave him minutes later. The only problem with that theory is that anyone who has passed through London Heathrow knows that such a party would be impossible to achieve and, especially, not by an Indian. But the problems of the film do not end there, is the theme of the two main protagonists (Salman Khan and Ajay Devgan) who pass as rock stars about to achieve their dreams. I mean, yes, we saw that the success came to Susan Boyle (a woman in the UK who achieved her dreams after 50 years), but that was a rare case. It was very difficult for me to suspend my disbelief because I felt that the cast of Salman and Ajay was simply ill-conceived. They were never going to choose Madhuri Dixit and Sridevi to play the same roles, why should we be forced to see Ajay Devgan and Salman Khan (men well into their forties) desperately trying to hold on to their twenties? Let's not talk about the most shy actress on today's screen, Asin. This is her second film (which I've seen) and she has no choice as an actress, so aware of her appearance that she only cares to look good and go for the camera instead of giving a good performance. It's hard to believe that she rejected all those movie roles to star in this fluff and then be as fluffy as an actress, nothing great. And to top it off, the movie went on boringly. There is nothing special about it, trust me, you will predict every clich√© that will happen in it.
