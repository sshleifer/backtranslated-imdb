This movie was a disaster from start to finish. Interspersed with the performances of "the next generation of beautiful losers" are the interviews with Bono and The Edge, as well as with the artists themselves. This leaves little time for the clips of Leonard Cohen himself, who dominates everyone else in the film with his presence, as well as gentle presence, wisdom and humor. The rest are too busy trying to canonize him as St. Leonard or as some Old Testament prophet. Many of the performances are about forgettable interpretations (especially those of Rufus and Martha Wainright) or unsatisfactory achievements. Only Beth Orton and Anthony stood at a surprising distance from Leonard's versions using a bit of moderation. Annoying little pseudo-avant-garde gestures are spread throughout the film, such as out-of-focus overlays of red spheres in many of the concert shots and interviews, blurry camera work, the use of digital delay in some of the comments by Leonard Cohen (which makes it more difficult) to listen to what is being said) and a low drone, absent and pretentious in many of the segments of the interview (an attempt to add gravitas?). For reality, see the documentary Songs From The Life Of produced by the BBC in 1988.
