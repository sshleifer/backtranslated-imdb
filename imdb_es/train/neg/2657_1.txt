I waited for this movie to play with great anticipation. Assuming it is portrayed more accurately as the movie, "The Christmas Box" based on the book by Richard Paul Evans. I sent many emails to friends and family asking them to watch this program with the hope that they would better understand a small amount of my "new" life. After watching this movie I was very disappointed. As a mother who lost her only child in November 2003 and REALLY knowing the pain, she hoped this film would shed light on parents who "think" they understand the grief a father who has lost a child is going through. This movie was a very happy movie and the stupidity of Diane Keaton was a slap in the face to parents who have buried a child. It was VERY unrealistic from start to finish. I received a few calls after the movie, each one equal, "That was so out of place and it made it seem like in a short time he's back on the road and listening to songs on the radio and life is back." bunch of bull! It is clear that the director and Keaton have never lost a child because neither of them would have made the movie so bad. I guess that's Hollywood.
