I had high hopes in this film because I loved the original. It seems that Disney, however, is trying to perfect the art of sequels on DVD. They deserve a razzie. Several, in fact. I thought the idea had merit, but the music was absolutely horrible and the story was not much better. What happened with the great music that Disney used to have in his films. Mary Poppins, Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King ... even Hercules and The Hunchback of Notre Dame. They made so many great movies over the years that it's really sad that they've reached the point of making sequels that are not even good enough to put in theaters. <br /> <br /> I hope this movie is Not an indication of what will come for Walt Disney Corporation.
