Imagine that you are a high school boy, in the back of a dark theater without crowds with your girlfriend. How bad should a movie be so that you feel compelled to leave the cinema and go home before it ends? This movie is so bad. Really. Movies often become so bad that they are good; This movie is beyond that stage of evil. It is painfully bad. Horribly, terribly, crime against the bad mankind.
