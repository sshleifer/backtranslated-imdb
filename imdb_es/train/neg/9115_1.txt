If you ask me, the first one was really better. Look at Sarah M. G., she's a cruel, cruel girl, look at Amy Adams, she's a fool. She is nothing! People do not love her! Second, Sebastian was cute and sexy in the first movie, now it's "baby face". The story is not so good, and I do not understand it. Why did not they do this first, it's the beginning. Loose actors, nothing with history. This is not cruel, this is playing. First one has better actors, better story and its meaning. I think music is better in cruel intentions 1 and music is better in cruel intentions 3. It's not the worst movie I saw, but compared to the first one it's a big one, a great one, a great nothing.
