I saw this movie with the intention of not liking it. I sure did not. It's one of those films that seems to have been made exclusively for the Oscars: music throughout the film in almost all frames, almost without blasphemy, set in a past time, sepia-toned images, pretentious title, NON-SEX and genius that explains everything he thinks and concludes in sfx / cgi so that we (the stupid audience) understand it. However, one thing that amused me is the fact that they wrote the NOBEL PRICE incorrectly. Instead, they call the Nobel price (named for a real person named Alfred Nobel) "the noble price." Jesus! How can one make such an error in such a large production, supposedly based on a real story? What a farce! What were you and the other RON thinking?
