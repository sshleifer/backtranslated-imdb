It is ironic that Dr. Seuss's fable that emphasizes the non-commercialization of Christmas should be one of the most promoted, commercialized and successful box-office hits of the holiday season. The general idea of ​​Ron Howard's adaptation is that Grinch's downfall against Christmas is due to an early childhood incident and that the Whos themselves are trapped in the materialism of the season, except for Cindy Lou Who (played very well by Taylor Momsen). This film makes an ardent and ambitious attempt to capture the madness and feeling of Seuss's story, but the end result is a movie that wobbles and never presents the emotional impact of the animated version of Chuck Jones. Jim Carrey is remarkable in his performance as the diabolical Grinch, but either because of the dialogue, the rhythm or the strange stories accumulated in the initial plot, the transformation from miserable bitter to cheerful benefactor just does not turn on convincingly. There are some wonderful images and the makeup work is amazing, but beyond the technical triumphs there are one or two missing elements. <br /> <br /> Succin '? <br /> <br /> Alma? <Br /> <br /> Or maybe Jones made the initial adaptation too well in his 25-minute cartoon that Howard fails to achieve in a three-hour movie. Howard, Carey and the crew are very capable and talented, but what looks like a winning combination is weak and laborious in its final product. If you have to see the full version, fix it on video with the animated version of Jones and you can see how big and bright is not always better. I give this movie three cans of Who-Hash for five.
