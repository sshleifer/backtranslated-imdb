Truly terrible, pretentious, endless movie. The director Bellocchio seems to be in love with the pretty face and the figure of his actress Detmers, and who can blame him? But maybe, just maybe, he should have focused his attention a little more on making a good and attractive movie. I hate when a sex movie is presented as an "art movie" just to be more "respectable". Frequent sex scenes are sometimes the only reason for the existence of this movie. Whether it's worth it or not sit in the rest of the image is strictly a matter of taste. (*)
