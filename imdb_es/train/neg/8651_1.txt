I saw the first 15 minutes, thinking it was a real documentary (with an irritatingly dramatic producer "on camera"). <br /> <br /> When I realized that everything was staged, I thought "why would I want to waste it? My time watching this garbage?" So I turned it off and connected to warn other people. The characters do not act credibly. too much immature emotion. for a man to travel half the world around a country devastated by war, he acted like a child. and I do not think it was because "his character was so annoyed by the bombing of shopping centers." <br /> <br /> very trite and stupid. <br /> <br /> have you seen "the city of the lost" children "? dark French fantasy film about a boy who kidnaps children and steals their dreams ... I liked it!
