I was China in this movie. I chose the screen name Sheeba Alahani because I was modeling at that time in Italy and they could not pronounce my real name correctly, so I chose Sheeba and then added Alahani since it was similar to Alohalani. <br /> <br /> I had never acted before (and it shows), but it was very fun to shoot. They gave me "acting lessons" every morning (which obviously were not useful). They nicknamed my voice (thank God). <br /> <br /> David and Peter were an explosion on the set, full of good humor and jokes. This film should never have been taken seriously, it was a collection of taxes according to internal information. <br /> <br /> I give it a 1 because I have a sense of humor, but a 10 for the fun I had "acting".
