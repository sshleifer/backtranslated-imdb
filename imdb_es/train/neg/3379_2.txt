I recently bought the DVD, forgetting how much I hated the movie version of "A Chorus Line". All the changes Director Attenborough made to history failed. <br /> <br /> By making the Director-Cassie relationship so important, the whole set of the premise of the musical went out the window. <br /> <br /> Some of the musical numbers are accelerated and accelerated. The hit song of the show breaks all the meaning when it is given to Cassie's character. <br /> <br /> The general staging is very timid. <br /> <br /> The only reason I give it a 2 It's because some of the great numbers can still be enjoyed despite the film's attempt to squeeze all the joy and spontaneity.
