I do not know what would be so good about this movie. Worse yet, why should anyone bother to see this? In the first place there is no history. You could say that even without a story, a movie might be worth seeing because it invokes some kind of strong feeling (laughter, crying, fear, ...), but in my opinion this movie does not do that either. <br /> <br /> You are viewing images during +/- 2 hrs. There are more useful things to do. <br /> <br /> I suppose you could say that the movie is an experiment and it is daring because it lacks all of the above. But is this worth 2 hours of your valuable time and 7 EUR of your money? For me, the answer is no.
