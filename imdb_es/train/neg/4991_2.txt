One of the worst movies in which I have seen the work of the camera of poor quality, the use of the fucking filter, the film was grainy, the script was terrible, I mean, how predictable was the great battle at the end .. ... <br /> <br /> Some of the fight scenes were fine, I guess ... <br /> <br /> Some scenes were so bad it was comical ... as Sorbo get the horse and ride in the end ... LOL, I mean really a horse Oh, I can not forget how the bad assassins turn in the same vehicle throughout the whole movie ... one would think that after assassinating key witnesses and federal agents, the they would have tracked ... CEC, ETC really do not bother to see it ...
