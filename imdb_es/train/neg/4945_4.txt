Of course, this is not really a box office success, nor does it point to such a position. "Dieter" is the name of a very popular German musician, who is loved or hated for his type of acting and that is exactly what this film is about. It is based on the autobiography "Dieter Bohlen" that he wrote a few years ago, but he does not pretend to be precise in that. The film is full of sexual offensive content (at least for the American standard) that can be fun (not for the other "actors", of course) or silly: it depends on your individual mood type or that you are a "Bohlen" -Fan or not. Technically speaking there is not much to criticize. Speaking of me, I find that this movie is a good movie.
