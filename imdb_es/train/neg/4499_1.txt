Any movie that has nude scenes of Karen Allen and I'm still so bored that it comes out, it's a stinker! <br /> <br /> Karen is stuck in Paris and befriends a very handsome French man with whom she will soon have sex. Of course he is married, ("But, cheri, why should it be a problem?") What could be an interesting clash of cultures is (believe it or not) just boring. I left <br /> <br /> Maybe the movie improved a lot after I left; but I would have had to have MUCH better to compensate for a bad start. <br /> <br /> My advice, if you are in this, run, do not walk, for the exit. Save your time and your energy. You will surely save your money. It is a pity that the producer has not saved her money.
