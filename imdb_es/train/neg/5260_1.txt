Normally, I do not have any problem with a movie or a story with an ending that leaves you wondering what really happened, when it's done on purpose ... <br /> <br /> But this movie really feels like it they would have succeeded. but the last 15 minutes, then I realized that they had $ 5 to finish in ... <br /> <br /> I saw it in TBS ... I recommend that you also do not spend money on that. If you catch it on television, you see everything except the last 15 minutes, then you walk away and create your own ending in your mind. <br /> <br /> Actually, the movie would have been better if they had just run away, and come back with the state's Poice of Feds only to discover that the city and the car graveyard were gone, and for all the appearances had never been there ... <br /> <br /> "I wish I had more thumbs, so I could give that movie 4 thumbs down!"
