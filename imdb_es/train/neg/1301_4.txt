Recently I saw him in the international film of Palm Springs 2009. This is the debut feature film as the director of the veteran Dutch actress Monique van de Ven and, according to my observation, it should be the last. I hate movies that are so unlikely that you disarm practically every scene. This movie immediately leaves you scratching your head. When it begins, a young photographer and his girlfriend who works for an international aid organization are driving slowly through the Taliban-controlled mountains in Afghanistan, talking about their love when a rocket stops a truck in front of them. They leave their vehicle to see how the Talliban fighters equipped with rocket launchers, machine guns, rifles, pistols and grenades execute the five people in the truck. Bob (Waldemar Torenstra) begins to take pictures of all this when he is seen by one of the insurgents who throws a hand grenade that kills his girlfriend. as they are at a hand throwing distance, they can not be more than 50 meters away, but somehow he escapes. His girlfriend is swollen and he takes a photo of the moment of the impact of the grenade that kills her and earns a prize as photographer of the year for the photo. Every scene and situation in this movie is as ridiculous as it is opening up. The following year, Bob is assigned to National Geographic on a Dutch tourist island where he meets Kathleen (Sophie Hilbrand) and is inserted into his sordid underworld of international drug traffickers. Avoid this movie. I would give a 4.0 out of 10.
