Die Hard meets Cliffhanger when a ski resort is besieged by terrorists and it depends on a policeman, Jack (Crackerjack) to stop this. <br /> <br /> An action B movie that borrows from other movies and is pretty good. with pretty good action, a ridiculous plot (as always in these movies) and three fine stars. Thomas Ian Griffith as the police and Nastasja Kinski and Christopher Plummer as terrorists. If you do not like stupid action B movies, this is not for you.
