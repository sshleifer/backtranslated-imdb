This is definitely the worst Bigfoot movie I've seen in my life and possibly the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. The actors and actresses were horrible and it seemed that they were trying too hard to interpret their roles as fools, tough guys, idiots, knowing everything, etc. And the great foot itself was terrible. It seemed to be a kind of computer generated image from the days of Atari & Intellivision. At a time near the end of the movie, while an army of sasquatches chased the remaining survivors, one is shot and, while it is running, it looked like a poor man's version of the donkey kong! And one is hit by a bullet and the blood that comes out of it was a horrible animation. Another thing that was annoying was the music. Throughout too much music (classical score or whatever it is called) throughout the entire film. It never ended. Oh yes, the movie is also boring. Absolutely one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. I highly recommend bringing your $ 3 or whatever you charge to rent this movie and spend it on a gallon of gas or a value menu somewhere. Really horrible!
