['I tried to watch this movie three times separately. The night I rented it. I spent about 20 minutes hoping it would be better if I had a restful night. I looked 15 more the next day, I almost threw up for how stupid it was ... It was not even funny, which is sometimes a funny movie, but this movie was a shit with a capital S (if you know what I mean in The censored world in which we live). And finally, on the third day I saw more than an hour of stupidity and I did not enjoy a single moment! Not even one. How did this script go green? Oh boy! <br /><br /> Sun <br /><br /> 1/10 - the one is for cheerleaders ... they deserve at least something for all their hard work.']
