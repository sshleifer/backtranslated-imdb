Scotty (Grant Cramer, who would star in the big movie B "Killer Klowns from outer space") is committed to helping three middle-aged boys learn how to "dialogue" with the ladies in this bad comedy of the 80s. It's not bad as in the lingo of the 80s, which meant good. Bad as in bad Without nice characters, which include, but are not limited to, a boy who is the most daring guy since "Friday the 13th, part 2", a girl who leads the men and then gets furious when he wants to touch her , and the fat slob token, because after all, what would an 80's sexual comedy be without a fat slob? Well this one has two. This movie is practically the bottom of the barrel of the sexual comedies of the 80s. And then the sequel came, deepening the proverbial barrel. <br /> <br /> My grade: D- <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: too many to tell, you even see the strange looking child imagined with tits on the point, think of "Bachlor Party" but not so funny and VERY annoying. <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Comcast Moviepass
