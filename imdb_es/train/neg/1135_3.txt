I have not read a biography of Lincoln, so maybe this was an accurate representation ... <br /> <br /> And maybe it's because I'm used to equally alienating and unrealistic worship representations that are characterize unnaturally. Lincoln as brilliant, honorable and the savior of our country ... <br /> <br /> But why would they make a film that portrayed Lincoln as a buffoon? While Henry Fonda made an excellent Lincoln, his depiction of him as an "aw shucks, I'm just a simple guy" seemed a bit insulting. <br /> <br /> [Of course, that was all Bushie Jr. campaign, to make us think he was "a normal guy", so we would not mind if he was a rich and privileged imbecile, but that's another story .] <br /> <br /> Not only does the movie show Lincoln as a kind of simple (almost single-minded) type, the movie claims that Lincoln simply became law by accident, and that he was not even so interested in the law, only with the falsely simplistic idea of ​​the law that deals with rights and injustices. In the film he is not a very good defense lawyer (he relaxes with his feet on the table and mocks the witnesses), and the result is determined mainly by luck / luck. <br /> <br /> Also, partly because this was funded by the Republicans (in reaction to a game sponsored by the Democrats that had come out) and partly because it was just the feeling of the times, the movie is, misfortune, religious, racist and conservative. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time in this movie!
