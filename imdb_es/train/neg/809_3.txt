I was expecting a little "K-911", I mean it looked like a nice movie that I could get into. I always loved the canine comedy movies. But it looked like it was supposed to be Jame's movie, not Jerry Lee's. The plot was quite boring and the two love interests really had no chemistry to begin with. Not to mention that James seemed to have a total sexist vision in the film despite the fact that the writer was not going in that direction. James really made me angry for more than half the movie. The dogs were the real stars and that is quite sad that they have highlighted the actors. <br /> <br /> So, I'm glad it's not just me in IMDb who agrees that this was a pretty stupid movie. But hopefully, James will realize that it was his brother Jim who had talent, without offending, but not everyone can be his star brothers. Would not you like Ashlee Simpson to take that same advice? : D <br /> <br /> 3/10
