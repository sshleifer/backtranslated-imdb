Like most people, I was intrigued when I heard the concept of this film, especially the aspect of "the filmmakers were attacked" that the case seems to emphasize, with the image on the cover of the filmmakers pursued by an angry crowd. <br /> <br /> Then, to see the film and discover, oh, what they mean by "the filmmakers were attacked" was that some children threw stones at a poster and several people complained loudly and said " Someone should hit those two children. " The image on the cover, "the pursuit" so to speak? Total manufacturing I suppose that it is related to the theme of the film, the lie and the manipulation to satisfy the vain and stupid children with more money and more time than sense. <br /> <br /> I have no idea of ​​the great truth that the spectator is supposed to assume. away from this movie It's like "Roger & Me" by Michael Moore, but if "Roger & Me" was Moore mocking the people of Flint. It is completely misdirected and totally inane. Woohoo! Can you believe that the people who suffered under the yoke of communism would be really excited to have markets full of food? Idiots! And it's not so much, "Look at the effects of capitalism and the Western media, blah, blah, blah," since it was not just that their fake market had comparable prices to competitors, but, as many people say in the movie, the prices were absurdly low, someone mentions that they should have known that it was false for how much they charged for the duck. That is not showing anything, except that people who are poor, will go to a store that has low prices, bravo fellas, a way to stick it to the people below. <br /> <br /> A way to play a stupid and practical joke. In older people. You should be very proud. What do you think of your next film making a documentary about Iraq and showing how the people there really get excited about a house without bullet holes in the walls and then say: "HAHA! THERE IS NO SUCH HOUSE! IT IS SO STUPID AND I LOVE TO BE "LIED TO THE MEDIA! ". <br /> <br /> Morgan" Please Like Me "Spurlock unleashed this wet film fart and it's no surprise that Spurlock as the prince of the documentary world of One Hit Wonder seems to be throwing its weight behind any concept It sounds silly to be relevant in a world that really does not need it. <br /> <br /> Avoid like the plague.
