The quality of the video is horrible. The quality of the sound is pathetic. The acting is horrible. The dialogue is painful. The lighting is depressing. The edition is laughable. I could go on, but it would be useless. Snitch'd is a third category amateur video that is broadcasted as a feature film. It is best to leave this to collect dust in the trash bin of the video store.
