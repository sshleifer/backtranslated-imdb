I will not spend much time on this because, as far as I'm concerned, it's not really a movie to begin with, just a careless mix of borrowed images and shamefully amateur new images made solely for the purpose of hitting the whole mess and calling it a sequel of "Boogeyman". Literally, 80% of this movie is stolen from its much superior predecessor "The Boogeyman", a film that the writers of this garbage apparently did not even bother to see because they could not even get the name of the original character of the actress Suzanna Love (Lacy). Right. And to add insult to injury, the killer is invisible in the original video and visible in the new video, apparently they think their audience is as stupid as it is. 0 out of 10 and I would like the IMDb rating system to be so low, the most cruel and flagrant attempt to defraud the money of the people I have seen, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!
