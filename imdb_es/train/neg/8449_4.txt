What an absurd story, blackmail of murder, accusations of child sex, homosexuals and the Catholic Church ... absolute tripe. How is it possible that the majority of television dramas based in the United Kingdom, sitcoms, etc., have to include mandatory Gay? Everyone accepts that there are gay people in society, only that there are other minority groups, but we do not want our throats to explode (I'll go to this one) in all the shows. Apart from the above, the drama went from what could have been an interesting little story to a pantomime, the priest was a pedophile and there are gays running everywhere, oh, yes, to be totally PC, one of the gay couple was black. I'm surprised by c ecclestone for even contemplating this when he read the script.
