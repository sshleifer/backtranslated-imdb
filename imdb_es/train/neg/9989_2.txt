I had the misfortune to see this crap in Sky Cinema Max on a cold winter night. I'm not a big fan of horror movies, because most of them are just trash. This is even worse: it's one of the dumbest pieces of shit I've ever seen in my life. Horror movie? Yes, there are horrible things in this: acting, script and special effects: My God, I laughed at this ridiculous attempt to make a movie for 90 minutes. Actually, if it had been a comic movie, I would have given it a 5. Do not even think about renting this unless you want to make fun of the producers. <br /> <br /> Rate: 2 out of 10 - I did not vote one because it made me laugh all the time ;-)
