I have to say that many people have argued that some of us have to measure up because the new movie "Dukes" is a modernized version. OH PLEASE. If this is what you consider modernized, then Hollywood can keep it. Many people on the MSN site have also said that (and I quote) "You old fogies need to overcome it and exempt it as it is". Well, let me tell you something, I'm 24 years old, so I'm far from being OLD FOGIE, and I will not get over it, it was a disgrace to all that is the county of HAZZARD. The only correct thing in the title of the film was "HAZZARD". It was all the blasphemy, smoking and drinking really necessary. The cast was terrible. Jessica has been in several morning programs to talk about the film and, frankly, I think everything has gone to the head. She is not in any way a Daisy Duke, maybe a coincidence, but she's definitely not Duke. I love Sean Williams Scott, but not like Bo. They should have included the original cast as at least one cameo, but even Hollywood knew they would not approve the script. I mean the people, even the actors and actresses of today are expressing a negative opinion, so why do some of you make positive comments?
