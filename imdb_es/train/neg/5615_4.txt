I saw DVD 1 only. The program itself can have 10 minutes of good information; Otherwise, it is snotty downdowns of religious people. It's as if director Brian Flemming recently discovered both atheism and sarcasm, and feeling that with these tools he can easily repress his opposition. <br /> <br /> In addition, Flemming goes deep into his own personal problems, and they take care of them. movie. Never return to the subject. <br /> <br /> Religious people tend to discount skeptics when their objections to religion are obviously rooted in abusive education.

It is not necessary to be told that religious people are crazy, nor do they need to be told to American Jews how upset Christmas music is in mid-December. <br /> <br /> In the best scene, the Superintendent of Fleming The Christian school of childhood confronts the director with insight for his motivations.

Harris also has some good interviews (and easily on Google) at Salon.com, Amazon.com and Samharris.org.
