I could not stop laughing !! This movie is incredibly funny and stupid! But, no matter what, it's very entertaining! In this movie, you do not need to pay attention to anything! The acting is the same - LAME! Dinosaurs are the same - RUBBER (Oh, I could see the stick that holds the head of T-Rex for a moment). The raptors are the same as Carnosaurus 2, T-Rex is also the same, but ... in In some scenes, her head seems somewhat full and seems like a kind of project failure from kindergarten. The action is fast, sometimes too fast, actually I speak of fast editing, they edited it very fast, so we can not see the rubber dinosaurs, but OOPPS! Until late, they're rubber! Well, the only interesting thing here is to see Rick Dean in this sequel. <br /> <br /> What can I say? Do not rent it ... Watch it on TV, with friends, it's much more entertaining!
