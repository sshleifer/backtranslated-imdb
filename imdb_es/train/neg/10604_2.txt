This time, the hero of the first film has become human and this time uses combos of feet and fists against super universal soldiers and a computer that has twisted and is ready to conquer the world. I'm pretty sure it was the Double Team, which convinced everyone that Jean-Claude Van Damme was no longer credible by providing visible action movies. However, it was this that forever tarnished his credibility. While Universal Soldier: The Return is not as boring as Double Team or The Quest, it is still quite horrible, without the style and style of the original and without the pairing of stars. This sequel is made simply for children who enjoy professional wrestling. When I look back, not even the action sequences were so exciting and, therefore, this movie has no value. In other words, another clunker on the Van Damme assembly line. <br /> <br /> * of 4 (Bad)
