A gave a "2" instead of a "1" (horrible) because it can not be denied that many of the images were impressive, many of the talents were dedicated to special effects and art. But that was not enough to save it. <br /> <br /> The "sepia" type of washed colors has been done many times before in other films. Nothing new there. I can see that there were some hat tips for other old and classic movies. IN AGREEMENT. There is no problem with that. <br /> <br /> But a movie has to be entertaining and interesting, not something that makes you sleep. <br /> <br /> The story line and the script for this movie It was horrible, the characters in two dimensions. Slow movement. Some of the scenes were beautiful to look at, but in the end, in general, it was quite boring, I could not recommend it.
