This movie is a complete shit! Avoid at all costs this waste of celluloid, it is incoherent and incoherent. I take pride in delving into the depths of the sordid cinema of the 70s, from Salo to Salon Kitty. I like to be surprised, but I need a coherent story. However, if seeing a horse companion takes you out of this movie it is for you. The saddest part was that lame werewolf costume with the functional wang. I mean it's just hard to sit down, not to mention that the acting is terrible and that the soundtrack is badly called. Please, I know that the cover is interesting (what looks like the hands of a gorilla looking for a woman's butt) but do not waste your time or money since you will not receive any of the two.
