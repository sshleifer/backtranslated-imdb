As a fan of Notorious B.I.G., I was waiting for this movie. I have the misfortune to see that it is a terrible movie. Jamal Woodward is not convincing or realistic enough to represent Notorious B.I.G. Much of the story follows the true son of Notorious B.I.G., Christopher Jordan Wallace as Notorious B.I.G. As a child Unfortunately, it is not convincing enough to pay tribute to his father. Derek Luke is as unconvincing as Sean Combs "Puffy". In short, no one is convincing enough to play their roles here. The big problem with this is that they are real people who are playing. It was boring and he did not give any information about Notorious B.I.G. That fans and non-fans alike did not already know. I felt especially disappointed with Angela Bassett, a very good actress lost here like Voletta Wallace. The film slips and the slugs along think that Notorious B.I.G. Fans will spend tons of money on it. I have the misfortune to say that it happened. It is not even close to a good movie. I expected a lot from this, but unfortunately I did not get any of this. I think you should definitely skip this one.
