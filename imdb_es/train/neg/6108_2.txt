Tarzan the Ape Man is a remake of the 1932 film of the same era, and like that previous film, has little resemblance to the literary character of Burroughs. But while the Tarzan of 1932 was reduced to the "Tarzan - Jane" speech, this Tarzan, played by Miles O'Keeffe, does not speak or growl. He makes Tarzan's scream a couple of times, which seems to have been taken from the previous movie. <br /> <br /> No, Tarzan is Bo Derek's second banana as Jane. Or, rather, as a third banana to the left breast of Bo Derek and his right breast. This movie makes no more sense than showing Derek naked. <br /> <br /> The two action scenes in the film are presented in slow motion and are really bad. More evidence that nobody cared. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, Tarzan has an orangutan side kick in this movie. Maybe the Sumatra car joined the Indian elephants that are also on display.
