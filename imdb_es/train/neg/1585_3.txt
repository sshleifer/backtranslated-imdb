::: SPOILER ALERT ::: <br /> <br /> Soooo, Arnie is really a nice guy, but after an incident with some fights in a helicopter and a bit of disobedience of the orders, he was sent to the jail (or rather some type of work camp). He escapes, but after a while he is trapped once more. This time it ends in a monstrous reality show in which it is supposed to be presented for a time between a group of tough guys with different themes, and finally die. But we all know Arnie, and we all know he's tougher than the harder. <br /> <br /> I really wanted to like this movie, be a fan of Arnie and all that. However, "The Running Man" contains too many defects that really bother me. E.g. The reconstruction of Arnie's fight inside the helicopter, where the surprised audience shows a brief summary of the incident, with 5-10 different camera angles. This means that the military helicopter in which Arnie flew was equipped with almost 10 cameras that filmed the crew members, one of which, inside, is the eye of one of the crew members that Arnie wins. <br /> <br /> There are also other flaws, and the plot, which in theory seems to be very interesting and innovative, works for a while, then creates a kind of stupid and unreal in which it drowns. <br /> <br /> The acting can not really be said to be something better than a sub-item, with Arnie in the lead role, making an average performance of Arnie. The rest of the cast manages without being especially good or bad. <br /> <br /> The special effects are fine, without being impressive. <br /> <br /> RATING: 3/10
