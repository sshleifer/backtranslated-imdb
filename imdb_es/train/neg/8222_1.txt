Um ... Okay, I think I have all the shooting technique of the gorilla style with trembling camera, but unfortunately I think a gorilla could have made a better movie ... This was just a complete disaster from the beginning. Bad acting, bad direction, bad history and horrible cinematography. I will never know how this piece of garbage was thrown, but it has been done and, unfortunately, I have seen it. Filmed on location in Tennessee by the management team of Greg Swinson and Ryan Thiessen (Harry and Lloyd), "Five Across The Eyes" I guess resembles a "Blair Witch" movie but falls short ... The nose Dives from a cliff. In fact, I felt embarrassed by these young girls, to whom I'm sure they were promised Hollywood stardom, but they ended up in this dung heap. The dialogue is ridiculous and actually aggravates you as you listen to it. How this is supposed to be a horror movie is another mystery, since there is nothing that can scare you, except for the fact that I saw it ... Try it on this size: there are 5 of you and 1 of it, do the calculations and hits his ass ... "The End". Regrettably, it continued (and continued) for 95 more minutes of stupidity that paralyzed my mind ... <br /> <br /> I saw it for free and wanted to get my money back.
