It seems to me, as a recent graduate of a film school, that in these times when the New Zealand film is reaching new heights, the general public seems to think that all the New Zealand films made are great. Sione's wedding shows that this is totally wrong. <br /> <br /> It's completely overrated and not fun, and far from the "hilarious" movie that other IMDb users have commented on. The only really fun thing I found in this movie was Derek, the black man wannabe, but other than that, the jokes were recycled garbage that we all had heard before. <br /> <br /> Being half decent of Samoa, I wanted to see how the film was going to deal with the Polynesian representation. It was a complete fight. I know it's a supposed comedy, but I did not feel that the characters had anything new to say about the Polynesian identity, even if it was in an ironic way. What disappointed me the most was the end of the film and the resolution of the character's relationships. Mikaele was the player who only messed with white women. He turns again in his direction when 'Dusky Maiden' arrives in the city, he has an epiphany that maybe he should start looking for a stable relationship, then at the last minute he rejects it and accepts his position as a Polynesian Playboy for palagi women. I did not understand why they did this. <br /> <br /> In general, it was very disappointing. My whole family went to see him expecting to laugh, but ended up being very bitter about paying to see her at the movies. The jokes are bad at best, the performance, in particular Sefa's girlfriend, APPEALING, and honestly, I would have liked if I had in my hands one of those pirated copies of the film to save me the price of the ticket $ 15. /> <br /> I think the only good thing about the film is that it is the second step (behind number 2, of course, a film far superior to this one) in the birth of the Polynesian cinema. I hope that Pacific filmmakers in the future can learn from Sione's Wedding about how to NOT reflect Polynesia and say something more meaningful and sensible. Even if it's done comically.
