Although being one of the "stars" of this film does not necessarily give me a wise vision, I do know a little of what was first there ... and what ended up on the screen. I remember seeing the original cut of "incoming freshman" and being very happy. It was fun, sexy, obscene, all the main requirements of a drive-in movie. You have to remember that this was filmed and released before everything else ... animal house, porky's, etc ... so in its own way, this movie was really ahead of its time. for whatever reason, the film was delivered to the main distributors who edited half of the original film and then edited it (should I say "shuffled?") the most random scenes in the story. The fat one, the people with goat heads ... What the hell was all that ?! I'm sure it was set for additional T & A, but it was so slow that it caused everything that was going on before it slowed down and stopped. but in general, it's a fun memory for me ... especially because I can say it's the worst movie I've seen ... I'm inside!
