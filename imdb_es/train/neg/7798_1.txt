This review is based on the dubbed video Shock-o-Rama published in a world that does not deserve it in 2002. How bad is it? It's horrible, which is what a '1' represents on the IMDb scale, but it's much worse than that. It's nice to imagine that an original German-language print could make things better (the comical dub in English is not funny at all), but honestly, this is one of the worst amateur movies of any genre you'll probably see. . The zombies in the movie are as slow and clumsy as ever, and they do not seem to have the ability to talk or think about anything beyond their next meal. However, they are also smart enough to operate chainsaws and malicious enough to know that Western taboos on the genitals will certainly encourage their conversation at the table. The Earth of the Dead of George Romero postulated a zombie nation that retained a bit of social coherence; Here, zombies are nothing more than an empty canvas for the perverse imaginations of director Andreas Schnaas. Absolutely without redeeming the social value, and what is worse, completely devoid of entertainment, Zombie '90 is a bad joke for anyone who wastes money with it.
