The Horror Channel only plays erotic movies from erotic goth movies every night from 10 p.m. M. Until about 4 in the morning, but its "fear" factor is very limited, if it exists. In fact, I'm sure I'll find a multimillion-dollar lottery win more fearsome than anything else this channel can offer. <br /> <br /> The blood dance leader deserves a special mention because it's what I feel, the undisputed bass From a channel full of bass. I can not even begin to tell you how bad this movie is, but in order to complete the minimum of 10 lines required by this site, at least I will try. <br /> <br /> First of all, the title is deceptive and does not look anything like the action on the screen. In fact, the film could well have been called 'Toothbrush' or 'Wallpaper' for everything that has to do with the plot. At least they used toothbrushes ... at least they had wallpaper. <br /> <br /> There is no bloodsucker for miles around and, what's worse, there are no dances, not even one. I'm sure you were doing two different movies by mistake here. <br /> <br /> A more appropriate title would have been: "The horny Italian count takes five people to a castle of fear and bores us silly for ninety minutes." Yes, that fits better. <br /> <br /> The acting is terrible and the dubbing dreadful, and the guy who plays Seymour was almost as rigid in his walk as he was in his character ... abysmal. <Br /> <br /> The only saving graces of this movie are a small but slightly interesting lesbian sex scene, two very small and very interesting heterosexual sex scenes, and the additional attraction of each female character taking off the case . Bonus <br /> <br /> Otherwise, move away a broad birth of this. Without vampires, without dances, without scenes of a brutal or frightening nature and in no way in the land of God, never, never, I will never see this again. <br /> <br /> It's not a lie, this movie could put you out of the images for life.
