I have seen bad movies but this took the p ***. It does not make sense, and all the characters do is swear every couple of seconds, oh, and I think you have a low sperm count. It's that good A Welshman plays a cocky cockney. A top-notch English guy plays an evil fool in a rice field, and some minor lights play with faint pies. <br /> <br /> And there are some Russian gangsters. Oh, yes, someone has a gun and maybe he talks trash while he's drugged. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie like the plague.
