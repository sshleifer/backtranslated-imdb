I saw one of the theatrical performances in Denver and I have never been less impressed. The word "vagina" says it all. A part of the body. Nothing shocking here. I could say to my doctor: "My left arm has hurt a bit after tennis" or "My vagina hurts after riding a bicycle" with equal or more social comments. They could be the "triceps monologues" for all the entertainment or radical commentary that I heard. The monologues were boring, but they presented themselves with drama, the themes were not updated and, alternatively, I was bored and annoyed. Once I think I laughed, but apparently it was not when I was supposed to. Surely this is not really a success. Oh, and spoilers: there was a LESBIAN! - Oh, wait, maybe not, now that I think about it. And inappropriate caresses! And a Mama Crack! That covers everything.
