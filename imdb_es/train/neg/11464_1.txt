While I do not pretend to be an expert in marine life, I must say that anyone with a minimum of intelligence could not accept this idea of ​​a whale (and not even the mother!) That has an idea of ​​revenge because he witnessed that his dead partner had a forced abortion by humans! Seriously! This is basically the whole plot. Richard Harris must have been extremely hard for the roles to have accepted this garbage. This is the kind of movie that is so bad that if he paid 50 cents to see it, he would want to get his money back.
