Well, I hated to have done it, I despised the 40-year-old virgin, and this little jewel is a useless piece of a garbage movie. do yourself a favor, and skip it. I admit, I do not like the actors in this movie, and after my 18-year-old son showed me the cover of the DVD, I said "I would not like that movie", but at his insistence, I decided to try it, unfortunately. <br /> <br /> Approximately two minutes from the movie, I turned it off, I was so offended. It's just disgusting. Any decent person would be offended by the filth in this movie. Call me old-fashioned, but pushing your hand covered in juice on your friend's face so he knows that "you have something" is on the line of decency, in my opinion. Yes, that's how this rotten little movie starts, and I can only imagine that it gets much worse. Another real winner for Mr. Rudd. I bet he's proud as a punch. Imagine if you could get worthless roles like him, would you stay in the movies? Despite the pay, I would not. <br /> <br /> I should have known better; Next time, I will.
