Yes, I sat through the whole thing, God knows why. <br /> <br /> It was a long afternoon, I had nothing to do, it was very cold outside, well, those are all unconvincing excuses but they are the only ones I have. <br /> <br /> I gave The Darkling 4 stars a maximum of 10: I've seen worse movies, but it's definitely there, in the old trash can of the bad movie: poor script, bad acting, bad lighting and effects Cursed specials. <br /> <br /> The story, which never makes sense completely, revolves around this small and simple family, Daddy, mommy and girl, which I assume the viewer is supposed to be "identifying" with, the three They were tedious and annoying. You only want the dark side for each of them. <br /> <br /> Papi is a cook whose hobby is that of cars. Dad meets a rich man named Rubin who collects cars and who also owns a being he bought in the "mysterious" East. Rubin keeps it in a cage and refers to it as "The Darkling". <br /> <br /> During the course of the film, it is explained that the Darkling is around 3 or 4 different things: a shadow without a person, the inner darkness that exists in all of us and the Devil. So choose the one you like the most, because trust me, it does not matter. <br /> <br /> The main problem of Darkling seems to be that he longs to have a partner, gets a human partner - and then eventually feels dissatisfied with the human being. This, of course, leads to immense wealth, followed by a disaster, for the human being who is linked to The Darkling. <br /> <br /> And for the rest of us, it only leads to a very long and tedious movie. . <br /> <br />
