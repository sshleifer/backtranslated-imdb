When this movie premiered, it generated one of the critics of the best capsules of all time: Sphinx Stinks. He does it, but in a fascinating way. The casting is silly, starting from above: Frank Langella and Sir John Gielgud as Egyptians? There is not enough makeup in Cairo for that, at least not while this movie was being made. But it's quite fun to watch them try it. The presentations range from a kind of mummy (sorry, the obvious observation) to over-the-top, with very few intermediate stops. The character of Lesley-Anne Down seems unable to find Egypt on a map, much less on its archaeological treasures. This is due, at least in part, to really bad writing, one of the curses that every viewer of this film will visit. It is my opinion that films that involve a curse or that are based on a theme that is somewhat esoteric, such as Egyptology, are ripe for a silly and overwritten dialogue. It does not disappoint, and convergence shows a double blow. The plot has a source of dramatic tension: can this become more foolish and less credible? The answer is, usually, YES. The location shots are beautiful, and the set design is generally very good, the only consistent reminders that this was not a low budget production. That and the fact that there are so many familiar faces that render service in such an involuntary laugh. Cheap, no; corny, yes.
