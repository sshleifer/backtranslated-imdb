The only movie I've ever been on. Incredible, since I paid for myself and my appointment and I'm really cheap. But my brain could no longer bear the load that was accumulating, especially since I could have written more fun stuff while I was tied up and gagged. <br /> <br /> From the beginning to the end, this movie offends. Worse yet, it's not funny. It was not fun then, and it sure is not fun now. But even worse, this film represents the beginning of the end of a really intelligent and sophisticated comedy. It's youthful, the script and really sophisticated ideas began an era (which continues to this day) where cheap laughs and sexual advances dominate the culture of comedy in movies. <br /> <br /> Sex Olympics? What high school kid has not thought about that? The beginning of the end.
