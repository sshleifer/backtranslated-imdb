I did not expect much from this movie, but, oh brother, how stinking. <br /> <br /> I found this gem in a giant box of horrible $ 5 DVDs at Walmart (where else)? As cheap as this record was, I feel cheated. The special effects had a secondary school appearance, the work of the camera was marred by wobbly tripods and poor lighting and the performance was a perfect example of the "Christian School". One can imagine the long and exhausting "prayer meetings" of the production company after seeing how the rush returns. The people who financed this thing must have had serious anti-biblical feelings towards the inept production company that unleashed it. Think of your anguish when you saw that your investment of $ 914.86 went up in smoke. <br /> <br /> Someone asked why Christian movies are so bad, maybe Xian filmmakers need to watch GOOD movies and try to copy some of them. The things that make them so good. Stories and credible characters, less hysterical movements and fanaticism, and a story that attracts everyone, not just the true believers. That is to say. For the sermon, keep it for the church. Take the Omen or Prophesy series, for example. Excellent films with compelling stories, great cinematography and intense music. There are no movements of hysterical arms. Without preaching. <br /> <br /> If this movie had a laugh theme, it would have been MUCH better.
