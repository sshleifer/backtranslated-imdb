It's one of those stereotypical dance films of the mtv generation, and I do not see where all this garbage comes from "it's not that bad". The acting is terrible, it follows exactly the same story as all the other "dance" movies out there. It's terrible! The name must scream do not look. 'How she moves.' Since when can movie titles ignore grammar? At least some dance films had decent half-dance scenes, these do not even deserve a watch. I give it 1 out of 10, just because there is no zero. I seriously implore anyone with an IQ of more than 60 years to not see this and not waste your money. The 1.6 / 10 should say it all. This movie should not have been made.
