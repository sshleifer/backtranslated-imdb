Being of Puerto Rican descent, I had mixed fillers about this "documentary". First, I was offended that Mrs. PÃ©rez compared Mr. Campos with Mr. Guevarra. It is also a fact, Mr. John Leguzaimo is not of Puerto Rican descent. His parents came from Columbia. Whoever investigated this was not very precise. I feel that the future of our race rests on education. This message should have been resonating throughout this movie. Education is our path to freedom and power. I believe that any future effort of this production team should make this their focus. In my opinion, this movie leaned toward an anti-American sentiment.
