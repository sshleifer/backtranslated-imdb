* Spoiler warning * <br /> <br /> First, I rated this movie with 2 out of 10. <br /> <br /> The idea is good, but there are too many stupid mistakes in the movie, but make be the psychological drama that could have been. In the first place she never fights alone. After a very strange initial doubt of her mother (who is not credible when the mother proves to be so supportive and loving later in the film), the rape victim is not alone. <br /> <br /> She is also incredibly naive and always falls into the strange traps of the crew. <br /> <br /> Your friends are incredibly unpleasant. <br /> <br /> What I find most amazingly is that Ethan does not control the crew when he changes his mind. Ethan is the crew leader (hey, they even say it) and people seem to think that the other guy is a jerk, but when Ethan changes his mind, he just can not convince a single person of the crew. that he is right and that his old friend is wrong. Everyone simply hates it ... why? The movie does not provide any explanation. How did he become the leader? <br /> <br /> A funny note is that my girlfriend thought she was watching Beverly Hills when she entered. Two actors from the same successful television series ... a cheap way to get viewers?
