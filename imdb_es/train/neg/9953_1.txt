I really must see a good movie soon, because it seems that any other input is something I despise. However my story speaks, I must not tell a lie. Bobby Deerfield and all that suck big green banana peels. I never thought I would see a movie hit as loud as this one. Al Pacino is not acting in this movie: he is posing. There are many, many scenes of his character, who is a racing driver, just looking at the camera. He is perfectly horrible. Marthe Keller is equally bad. These two are supposed to be in a love story, and there is simply no chemistry. Sydney Pollack directed this movie? There is no trace of the genius behind Tootsie here. Is this the same man that I animated in Eyes Wide Shut? I can hardly believe it. Save yourself a horrible movie experience. Run, do not walk, away from Bobby Deerfield.
