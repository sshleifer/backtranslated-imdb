First thing's first . In this genre movie, the first thing you need is good music, and that's where Mr. Shankar and his party fail. <br /> <br /> The music is completely pale and ineffective. On the other hand, there is AJAY DEVGAN, WHO HAS REMOVED A LETTER "A" from his spelling, he did a good job, but it did not work for movies like this one. <br /> <br /> ASIN is like a doll that is used to entertaining the public, although it is good to watch, but its role in the film is to dance, it is actually a member of a rock band and I do not think any Rock band have a dancer as a member of the band. <br /> <br /> In your shell, this movie is a piece of shit, a piece of *** t. Look at it if you want me to cheat on you.
