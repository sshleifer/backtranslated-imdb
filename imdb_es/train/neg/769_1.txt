The main flaw in this film is that it is impossible to believe that any of these people ever participated in a professional Macbeth production. Listening to the soft voice of David Lansbury struggling laboriously with the famous speech "Tomorrow, tomorrow and tomorrow" made it impossible to believe that anyone would ever consider him for the role. I kept believing, therefore, that he did not get the role because he was a lousy actor; Not because a larger name was available. Then, when we see parts of the work in the essay, it is hard to believe that the director is not parodying things with a helpless and misdirected farce of actors who are unable to articulate or even understand the verse and the directors who see the work through their own problems. Sometimes managers are so eager to finish their films (and writers believe they have the ability to direct their own work) that they settle for less. This seems to be an example of this.
