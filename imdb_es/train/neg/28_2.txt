This movie is terrible. You really do not need to read this review anymore. If you plan to see it, just say it: do not do it (unless you're studying how not to make a good movie). <br /> <br /> The acting is horrible ... the fan's time would be. Throughout the film, I thought it was interesting to find someone who speaks and looks like Michael Madsen, only to discover that it is really him! A new minimum even for him! <br /> <br /> The plot is terrible. People who claim that it is original or good probably have never seen a decent movie. Even for the standard of Hollywood action movies, this is a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> Do not see it! Go running, instead, at least you will not feel like killing yourself.
