This is not horror, as was the first part: This is ("campy") light and humorous entertainment. As in so many sequels, the action begins immediately without explanations. But there are tits, so I'm not complaining. And the real tits that is. If I understand correctly, nowadays they are quite rare among US teenagers. UU Which reminds me of the fact that the lead actress here is Pamela "Bruce's sister" Springsteen. <br /> <br /> This can not be. I thought without the first movie, so I compare this with that. Once again, there are clothes too small (mainly pants) and funny hair, it is not difficult to say in what decade this movie is made. Again there are really strange characters, this time even more visibly "pathological". Especially the camp staff. It's like a mental rehabilitation summer camp. The people are older: most of the actors must be at least 25 years old, but I think they're supposed to be 16 or something like that. Some "methods" used by Evil Dyke are quite unpleasant. Actually, this movie does not have much in common with the first part, and this is worse than that in every way.
