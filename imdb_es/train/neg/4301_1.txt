I was staying for one night and I got really bored around 2:00 a.m. so I flipped through the channels aimlessly and stumbled upon H.B.O. where I was playing this "classic". At first I was glad I had caught something at first, but my happiness vanished within two minutes of the movie. The entire film focused on an unattractive man who feared women, four beautiful but empty-minded women who worked as waitresses in his uncle's restaurant, and his enormously fat and extremely miserable cousin who also works in the restaurant. There are some strange twists in this movie that make it interesting, but it's certainly not worth seeing. Basically, if you have nothing to do at night or just can not sleep, the medications work much better. However, there is a lot of skin, so it may be fine to look without sound, but even that can be annoying.
