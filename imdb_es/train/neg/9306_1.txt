This movie is the worst excuse for a movie I've seen. For starters, I'd like to say that the cover of this movie is misleading, if you think you're about to see a really scary horror movie with a monster clown, you're very wrong. In fact, the killers' faces do not look like the cover at all, it's just an image they must have found on Google and thought it looked good. Speaking of things they found and thought it looked good, there is a scene in this movie where some gang members look for the friend in the old forest, then, suddenly, the screen appears in a scene where there is a deer mother who cares for his young man in a brightness of sunlight ... I mean seriously WTF ??? How important is this to the dark woods they roam? I bought this movie from a man in a market hoping it would be entertaining, if it was not horror, at least it would be funny, right? INCORRECT! The next day I gave it to my work colleague, getting rid of the plague called S.I.C.K <br /> <br /> The conclusion is: DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE !!!
