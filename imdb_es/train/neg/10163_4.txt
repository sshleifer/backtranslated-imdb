When I think about the revelation that the main character of "Bubble" arrives at the end of the movies, I remember last year as "Machinist" with Christian Bale. The only difference between the two films is the literal physical weight of the characters. <br /> <br /> A discreet, but completely realistic portrait of the life of a small town. The title is a reason for contemplation. Maybe, we, the audience, are those of the "Bubble", since in the movies we are not given benefits, we have a running time of 90 minutes. The reactions of the audience were often misleading and critical, which clearly indicates how people can be separated from seeing any thread of humanity in characters so alien to themselves. These characters are what people refer to as those who put George W. back in office for a second term. <br /> <br /> It is heartening to consider how the reality of television has ruined our sense of reality when we see an audience jump to His feet for release as soon as the role credits. This film has its merits and deserves to be considered for the things it does not say directly.
