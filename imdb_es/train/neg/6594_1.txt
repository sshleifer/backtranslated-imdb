I've seen most, if not all, of Laurel and Hardy's classic movies. I've always liked comic stupidity, even after having seen it again and again. This new film tries to recover the classic with two new actors that resemble both Laurel and Hardy, however, fails miserably for several reasons. One of them is how out of place their clothes are (even at the beginning of the 20th century), however, they are portrayed in the configuration of the 90s. Some of the previous dialogues were recovered, however, it also fails miserably in approaching the classic series. This movie could very well be the worst movie I've ever seen and it should be taken off the shelf and saved forever. The real Laurel and Hardy are turning in their graves before a bad imitation.
