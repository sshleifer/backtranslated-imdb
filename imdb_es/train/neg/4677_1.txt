What a load of left-handed Hollywood cud. This film glorifies the riot as brave and noble if it is for pacifist principles. The fairy tale ends with the pacifist character, played by Danzel Washington, who is actually promoted for his betrayal. What's up with these Hollywood tools? Is this still a reward for McCarthyism? <br /> <br /> If I look cynical it's because I'm sick of the movies with a political agenda. The military bronze in this film is portrayed as, what else? Gong-ho war warriors. Sounds familiar? Have you ever seen a movie in which the CIA or any government agency is not bad? Think about it. Once again, Crimson Tide emphasizes the point. The character of Hackman, the submarine captain Ramsey, is presented as a crazy lunatic, until the end when, of course, he returns to his senses, makes a full 360, renounces his thirst for blood, suggests a promotion for the traitor Ron Hunter and regrets retiring from service. A man riots, takes command of his ship, puts the United States at serious risk of receiving a first nuclear attack, and you promote it ??? What nonsense!
