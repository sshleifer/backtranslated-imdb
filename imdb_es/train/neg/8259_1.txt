I saw this movie when it was released. <br /> <br /> It was based on the idea that autistic children could communicate with written messages with someone else simply by helping them and guiding their hands. <br /> <br /> Then, suddenly, these children, many of whom did not even look at the keyboard or screen when the messages were written (in some cases, they could look up at the ceiling), but their moderators had the eyes glued to the keyboard began to write messages of abuse from their parents and others, sending parents and child welfare agencies in a proverbial tizzy, left and right. <br /> <br /> All this turned out to be a fallacy when a third person presented a folder, opened it to the child and said 'write the image you see', then, when the presenter passed the folder to the moderator, it a cover would fall, revealing another different image. <br /> <br /> Then, while The child may have seen a dog, the moderator saw something like a boat. <br /> <br /> Each time In each moment, the name of the written image was what the moderator had observed, never what was shown to the child. <br /> <br /> So, who was writing? Never the child. <br /> <br /> This movie had a disastrous turn because, according to the Australian poster, the person who molested the child in the film was IN the situation trying to help the child. <br /> <br /> If Melissa Gilbert had never put her son in that place, he would not have been bothered, that's what the movie says. He was better under his supervision. <br /> <br /> If I hand my child over to your organization for help and instead bother you, do you think I will be willing to listen to anything you have to do? say after that? It is not probable! I think it's a sure bet that all these accusatory messages that these children wrote, on which this movie was based, never accused anyone inside their operation as happened here. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I remembered that the film had a very good performance of Gilbert as the mother of an autistic, but other than that, the film really did not do much. <br /> <br /> The worst thing was the child who wrote at the end of Patty Duke, and we heard the mechanical voice read what he wrote. . . . . "we won!" This child was bothered. If you cut my leg and I take you to court and you are guilty of harming me, assaulting me, whatever it is, that is legal justice, but it does not return my leg. <br /> <br /> At best, in my condition, I will see it as an empty victory. <br /> <br /> Any chance that this child has in what is perceived as normal with autism is only affected by sexual abuse. <br /> <br /> A 'normal' child has enough to deal with such an experience. <br /> <br /> It is absolutely superficial to think that you should look at any situation and go 'win' if that person is found guilty in court. <br /> <br /> Only a bad handling of a situation and circumstances in the whole place.
