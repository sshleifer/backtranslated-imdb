This relic of a short film begins when a teenager goes through the process of trying to get a driver's license. Quickly deviates with almost every imaginable topic related to cars. <br /> <br /> Things like dune buggies, drag races, custom paint jobs and car shows are discussed. He often tries to be funny, but sometimes the movie is boring, prolonged and even sexist. None of the people in the movie is really listened to. Instead, everything is done in narration and voice-overs. I'm sorry, but I can not stand it. <br /> <br /> There is nothing educational or interesting about "Dad, can I borrow the car?". It's just another piece of mindless stuffing to take time out on his "Wonderful World Of Disney" television show. 1/10
