If you loved "Pulp Fiction" and you like handheld cameras, you will love this movie. I liked the extravagant story (although I think "Pulp Fiction" was the most overrated movie since "The English Patient") and I found the characters unrealistic but interesting. It is not "On the Waterfront" or "Citizen Kane" and it is overwhelmed by the European pretension. But the worst part, by far, is the handheld camera. It's so annoying and annoying that I found myself desperately waiting for the movie to end. I do not know why the new directors think that this filming method is so good. If you are prone to dizziness, stay away, the handheld camera will make you feel nauseous in about 10 minutes.
