Look, there's nothing spectacularly offensive in this movie, it's just boring. It's a typical rom-com with an ending that you can see before you've seen as much as the trailer. The key difference is that classic rom-coms approach their stories with ingenuity and unpretentiousness. This movie has no pretensions, but really has no sense of movement, you feel that you can get up and away at any time. The production of the film also has the feeling of a debut film made about fifteen years ago. I recommend going back to watching a classic movie like When Harry Met Sally instead of this superficial imitation. Oh, another BIG problem ... not chemistry. If you're used to seeing Michael looking as cute as Vaughn in Alias, you'll be seriously disappointed with the way they did see him here.
