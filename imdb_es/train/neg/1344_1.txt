Any film with a title as ridiculous as "The Bagman" should automatically attract the attention of any lover of bad movies, but the plot is very different from what one can expect after seeing the cover of the DVD. The Bagman is by no means a good movie. It falls into the category of movies that appear to have been (and probably were) filmed on a domestic video camera. The acting is horrible. I have not heard or seen such a rigid performance since Troll 2. There are many scenes with nudity and sex, but clearly they have been introduced too quickly. The characters are idiots and totally forgettable. The end (which I will not spoil) can easily be anticipated after seeing the first scene. Due to the film's corny nature, nothing apart from the terrible production values ​​is really frightening (terrible attempts at realistic gore, a driving scene where the car is clearly stopped, etc.). Recommended only for bad moviegoers.
