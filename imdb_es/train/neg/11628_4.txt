Wow, you are very good! Corny, Corny, Corny This is how I feel about that movie. It started well with a good idea, a man (Edward Asner) escaped from the jail dressed as Santa Claus, a group of children found him and believes he is the real Santa Claus, so the false Santa enrolls the children so that he help find a bag of stolen money. The movie is like a Christmas version of "Whistle the Wind." The movie starts well, but gradually becomes Cheesier and Cheesier to the point that in the end it becomes ridiculous and you can not take this movie seriously. For example, you get the Scrooge-type character named Sumner (Rene Auberjonois), who is a total of Douchebag who treats his young son like a pile of trash, treats his son so badly that he does not even buy him decent clothes, the poor Boy wears jeans with holes in it! but a scene of 45 seconds with Fake Santa visiting Sumner and at the end of the movie, the boy gets happy singing Christmas Carol and gives a hug to his careless son ... yes, that's how Corny is ... I'm Everything I feel good about the movie, especially at Christmas and I'm a big fan of seasonal television movies, but for me it's too exaggerated, it's a shame because it started well, but the second half of the movie is a supernatural element. The movie that just does not match the rest. It's not all bad, there are some solid performances, especially from children, but there are many better Christmas movies.
