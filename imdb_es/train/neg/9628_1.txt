This has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The DVD was delivered to me free of charge with an order I placed online for items not related to the DVD. <br /> <br /> No wonder they were delivered, surely nobody could pay money for this fool. <br /> <br /> How some critics can say that they thought the beggars' belief was funny, the person who includes it in the worst five films has achieved it. <br /> <br /> How on earth a talented actor like Philip Seymour Hoffman could get involved in this crap is amazing. Mainly toilet humor and badly done. <br /> <br /> Anyone who wants to be entertained should avoid this at all costs.
