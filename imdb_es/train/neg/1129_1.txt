I have seen this movie because I had it (my work includes watching movies of all kinds). I could not stop thinking "who gave money to make such a horrible movie and also send it to the Cannes Film Festival!" Not only was it boring, the actors were also horrible. It was one of the worst movies I've seen in my life.
