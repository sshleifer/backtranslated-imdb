Mr. VanHook took a good idea and kicked like a soccer ball. Unfortunately, he did not score. The historical theme of the giants is good, but pour goon's milk and end with a giant cheese wheel. I say, take this reel wheel and throw it down a cliff. I could not even watch the whole movie. That says a lot because I rarely get away from a movie. I always like to give them an opportunity for last minute redemption. It is impossible to exchange something so bad. Well, at least the performance was good ... NO! <br /> <br /> The only thing that "falls" in this movie is the classification. 1/10 and sinking into the negative numbers!
