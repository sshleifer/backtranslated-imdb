So let me start by saying that I saw this movie as part of a bargain. I was really bored one good day in 1997, so I cycled to the movie rental store. I asked the employee what was the worst movie I had in existence. Without hesitation, he accompanied me to "Lucky Stiff". He told me he would not pay the $ 1 rental fee (he said it would be wrong to charge more) if he promised to watch the entire movie. So look, I did it, for free ... <br /> <br /> This movie is terrible. My God, even I do not need to go into details of the plot, read the other reviews. The jokes do not make sense. The performance was terrible. I know it was supposed to be a comedy, but the stupidity of the main character was exhausting. You can try to see it as something to laugh at, but it's so bad that it's not even funny that way. Avoid!
