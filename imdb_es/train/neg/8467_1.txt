My friends and I rented this to Blockbuster because we saw the name of Nana Visitor in the box. This movie is a farce, I hope you deny it from your CV. <br /> <br /> The "plot" was lost and flaccid, the performance was mostly dry and unbearable in some places. The movie did not make any sense at all. The rough plot of a kind of alien parasite that infects humans has often been made with films with much better scripts than this, for example, the invasion of the body and faculty thieves. <br /> <br /> If you ever have the misfortune to find this movie, I suggest you burn it. <br /> <br /> How she classifies herself as a horror movie when fear, suspense, gore, terror or any of the usual horror movies were not used. Techniques that I do not know, however, if you still feel like watching this movie, I suggest you have a lot of sugar in advance so you can find fun parts.
