This is a typical low-budget disaster of the 1970s. It is supposed to be a docudrama on a team that hunts Bigfoot across the Pacific Northwest. Each character is a stereotype, from the Native American to the cynical cowboy. The acting and the narration are a complete joke. If you are waiting to see many bigfoot images, keep waiting. There will not be much, and what you could do in your yard with a cheap disguise and a camcorder; It would look better than this movie. <br /> <br /> It's not that I do not like the low budget rate of 1970; I make. It is that this is a chaos of bad acting, bad characters, lousy and emotionless story that you simply can not enjoy. It does not fit into the category "so bad that it's good", nor can it laugh at how bad it is without the help of illicit substances. It is mostly a lot of boring images of people who camp, walk, ride horses and observe wildlife. There is a big foot attack that is completely stupid; supposedly our friend Sasquatch is throwing stones at the campers from above while they shoot his rifles. For that moment you are strongly encouraging for the big foot to drop some rocks on the filmmaker's heads and stop the whole thing.
