The only good thing about this ungraceful outfit is that I did not have to pay for it. I saw him for free at the university. And if a university student can not find humor in something that is free, there is no remedy. <br /> <br /> Vintage acting and bad jokes can not be masked by an excellent but disconcerting overall design (which goes out of its way to market the Volkswagon beetles). I do not know what Michaels Myers was doing in this movie, but I've never seen anything more depressing. This was no more than a blatant effort to capitalize on the previous success of the Grinch (which has its opponents, but I enjoyed it a lot). It is difficult not to keep this failure and ask me what better projects were passed to finance it. <br /> <br /> Do you want a funny adaptation of Seuss? Go with the Grinch.
