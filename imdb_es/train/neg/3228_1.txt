I have seen other movies of guinea pigs, like Mermaid in a Manhole & He Never Dies, and although they are quite sick, at least they have a little sense of humor (even if it is dark). The Devil's Experiment, however, is nothing more than filming a group of punks who subject a girl to many methods of torture and violence, and there is no plot or values ​​that redeem it. It's not remotely scary, except maybe for the mentality, but it's definitely disgusting and I certainly would not call it entertainment. Now, I'm not the example of good taste in movies and I like my trash and misery, but this was too much for me, really. I am in favor of the inconvenience, in fact, I look for things that bother me whenever possible, but this was too much. The young woman is kicked, beaten, subjected to a continuous noise through the headphones until she drools, and then she is thrown with raw meat and entrails and left hanging in a hammock somewhere in the forest. If you think that sounds great, do it, but it certainly discourages me from seeing more things about the guinea pig. 1 out of 10, absolutely nauseating.
