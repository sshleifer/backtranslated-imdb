If you like movies like American Pie, Road Trip & Van Wilder; Avoid this cinematic garbage at all costs. It's a waste of resources tasteless and uninspiring that should not have been discussed out loud; much less really recorded and sold to unsuspecting consumers. Easily the worst movie I've seen in the last 18 months; It is hallucinatory bad during the 86 full minutes of its execution time. If it had been for a long time, I would not have been able to write this review without using bad language. Consider yourself warned!
