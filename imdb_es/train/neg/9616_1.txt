First, I had my doubts just looking at the DVD box and reading it saying that it was a group of teenagers gathered in a lake where they would find something to do. Any movie that has a premise like this has failed miserably, even like a slasher movie, except for the first Friday the 13th. <br /> <br /> I wanted to get up and stop watching the movie at least 10 times, but I kept thinking I had I improve a little. He did not. Usually, I think every movie has something you can get out of it. This has nothing. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and find something constructive to do for 80 minutes. Like, give yourself papercuts, or eat dirt.
