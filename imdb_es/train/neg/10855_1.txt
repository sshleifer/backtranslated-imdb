This is a comedy that I probably will not forget for a while. <br /> <br /> Normally I would not bother commenting on this movie: it's so insignificant that no one would see it anyway, but it's actually quite popular on p2p exchange networks like Kazaa, so this production of Saaad must be exposed for what it is. <br /> <br /> Then what is it? Well, of course it's not really a comedy; instead, it is thought of as a horror movie, "the intention" is the keyword here. The script is a totally incoherent and unbalanced disorder, the special effects are only special because they are especially pathetic, and in terms of acting, well, let's say that if it had been my graduation work in elementary school, my teachers would do it. I broke down crying for our talent. <br /> <br /> Of course, I realize that this is a very low budget movie and that in those cases one should lower expectations, certainly with regard to special effects. Also, although I am a big fan of the horror genre, I am aware that these movies are rarely places where you can look for interesting scripts and top-level performances. <br /> <br /> But still. <Br /> <br /> B movies often have some redemption features to compensate for lack of funds, such as humor. The only laughs in Cradle to Fear are in the ridiculous performances. If you can find the humor in that, and I could do it for the first 20 minutes or so, and then fall asleep after that, then that's all the movie has to offer. Oh, that and two or three pairs of breasts. <br /> <br /> Woohoo, how exciting. <br /> <br /> As for the story, it's not that I do not try to convey anything: Victims use drugs and / or are involved in serious crimes. The lesson: care, naughty boys and girls, because one day you will have to pay for what you have done. <br /> <br /> I rest my case. <br /> <br /> So, in general, a little sex, a good amount of drugs, but absolutely zero rock 'n roll. <br /> <br /> I qualify this with 1 out of 10, but I would go to 0 if I could. Or maybe he would not: he deserves a 1 for correctly writing the names of the actors in the titles. I mean, that's something, right?
