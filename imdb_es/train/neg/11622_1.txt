Dave is going through a divorce and his mind returns to his first love. "Wanders" is probably not the word. I must say that he looks at the last bride. Remember the day the relationship ended. The dream sequences are missing only the nebula transitions. Remember fondly your favorite songs and places where they went. I'm not a counselor, but maybe this had something to do with the failed marriage? Dave goes to a support group and meets a lady half his age (also divorced) who, instead of being "turned off" by his chill, begins to take an interest in him. Did I mention how creepy Dave is? Sometimes he refers to himself in the third person. Nor does he move his arms when he walks. It's just weird To summarize, Dave plans to hunt Mary (the old friend) and kill her ... err ... I mean confront her. He does What was really creepy. He believes that she is married, but STILL flies across the country to meet her. He watches her house to make sure she is alone, before "falling" on her. He has an uncomfortable conversation with her that ends when he shares the gospel of Christ in about 10 words or less, and flies to the new bride. We enjoy the movie mainly for an involuntary comic value. I'm still entertaining the wife with my impressions of Dave ... "I heard another Dave & Mary song!"
