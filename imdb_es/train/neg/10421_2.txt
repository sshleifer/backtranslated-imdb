I saw this movie as a very young girl (I'm 27 years old now) and it scared me senseless for years. I had nightmares about all aspects of this movie because of the way I was attracted to music to (obviously) violence. My parents are still arguing about who allowed me to see him and both say they would never let me see a movie like that. I think they just say that knowing that I have such strong feelings about it; 0) I am currently reading the book (due to morbid curiosity and the fact that it is a classic) and it is really a great story. However, I do not think it should have become a cartoon. Forever. Well, today's children may find it strange, but it gave me nightmares for weeks and weeks and I still find it hard to see the rabbits drawn in a similar way. It gives me a little heart palpitation every time. Yes, I'm a wuss, but I strongly suggest that any parent who wants to show this movie to their children, read the book to them or see it first to make sure they approve the content. Not everyone finds it as disturbing as I am, but we are out there; 0)
