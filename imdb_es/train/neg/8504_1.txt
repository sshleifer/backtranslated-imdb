Holy Week is surprisingly bad. It's so bad in so many ways that I do not know where to start. So, let's see ... Mira Sorvino, whose judge has been shot while protecting her, goes from Madrid to Seville for her police work. During the Holy Week (Holy Week, see? ... everyone starts to sleep ... they told you it was bad in many points, even from the beginning), a murderer executes his victims like bulls in a bullfighting arena . She is allied with the macho pig Olivier Martínez and the friendly Feodor Atkine. Soon discovers that it will be the next target of the murderer (wearing a red robe). Why, oh but why? <br /> <br /> Why ... that's the question the whole movie has been in my head. <br /> <br /> Q: Why did I go see that? I love Mira Sorvino (I even apologize for that FIRST SIGHT shit). <br /> <br /> Q: Why were we only 8 people in the theater this Saturday on the opening weekend? A: ah-ah-ah. Spider-man had a relationship the same day. But also the fact that the film has been full of excellent reviews. <br /> <br /> Q: Why has this movie been made? A: Money I suppose. But the boy, Look, he needed the money. <br /> <br /> then ... Why ???????????? First of all, there is always something wrong with European co-productions. Here you have a French-English-German-Italian-Spanish-Danish production. yi-ha <br /> <br /> Then he wants to play in the same place as the thrillers / slashers / whodunit / mysteries / whatever it is in the United States. Even VALENTINE, although unnecessary and with bad script and shot, was much better in suspense and fun. <br /> <br /> Then, to give some credit to the story, the screenwriter wanted to add some political insight to the story. . Incorrect: done in flash-backs in a photograph similar to Traffic's, it's certainly the most interesting thing in the movie. I could have kept it, I would not have to spend the whole movie. You'd better go straight to THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE from Guillermo del Tros for clever fun. <br /> <br /> Then the homophobia. Diana! The first victims are gay twins addicted to S & M drugs who were stabbed to death. The annoying Olivier Martinez goes to a dating agency organized by an overweight transvestite and a blonde platinum wig. Call the character of Mira Sorvino a great dam all the time. Do we need this kind of thing? Nah Only unnecessary offensive comments, like the previous times. <br /> <br /> Then the suspense. Yipee There is no apparent reason. The first murders are a simple illusion, since they are a representation of a famous painting. But no. And the revelation of the murderer (a horrible fascist, of course) could have been made from the beginning, as it appears at the end of the film, since I think it was time for the director to say "well, it's time to finish that" . Damn movie. We reveal right now who the killer is and why he kills. "<br /> <br /> Then the director thinks he is a director, wrong: there is no sense of suspense, there is no sense in directing the actors, there is no knowledge of the change of rhythm A giant, mega-diameter The scenes of Holy Week are unnecessary (maybe a co-production rule that says: well, record in Seville, but show some credits of this beautiful and historic city with the celebrations of Passover, here's a mystery movie for tourists!) <Br /> <br /> Then the actors, all the mistakes Mira Sorvino gets bored to death: she does not do anything, unless they stab her with her right hand Everything she did better (the Replacement Assassins, Aphrodite Powerful ...) was as if they had never existed Olivier Martínez ... hello, is there anyone here? When the producers will learn that it is not an actor but a mannequin without capacity for expression or feelings? Fodor Atkine, soft and transparent. We only have a lot of respect for Alida Valli, one of the best actresses of the last century (and I hope there are more roles in this one). She is the main attraction here, as she is the only one who gives life to her poor lines. I will not mention the other actors, since they are only unilateral, uninteresting and shallow characters. <br /> <br /> Incoherent direction, inconsistent actors, improbable plot. Incarnate idiocy. <br /> <br /> Superwonderscope says: 1 <br /> <br />
