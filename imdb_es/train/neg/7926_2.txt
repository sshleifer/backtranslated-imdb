The classic of the original exploitation, although it is far from being fun at almost any level with respect to some types that turn cats into monsters that eat human flesh because the cat food they make with people is remade with elements of science fiction added. Cats can not get enough and when contaminated meat is depleted, cats turn to their owners. Mismatched at almost every level, this is an example of the absolute background of the barrel material that used to play in movie theaters in the early 1970s, updated with races of alien dogs and cats fighting for supremacy. The director Ted Mikel is a hack, but he is such a nice person (I usually like the guy thanks to his interviews and comments that cause smiles) that you can almost excuse the trash that resulted. Mikels wanted to make movies and he did not care how they turned out while producing something. More power for him, but I wish he would not submit us to his home movies.
