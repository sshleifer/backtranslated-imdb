['THE FBI HISTORY (1959) was an epic tribute of 149 minutes from Warner Bros. to the famous criminal investigation agency. From a book by Don Whitehead came a somewhat laborious script by Richard L. Green and John Twist, and was directed with just a touch of style by Mervyn LeRoy. However, he had a splendid color photograph by Joseph Biroc and a useful score from the studio&#39;s music magician, Max Steiner. <br /><br /> The film shows the history of the Office from its humble beginnings in the twenties to modern times and everything is seen through the memories of the annoying agent Chip Hardesty (James Stewart) as he relates his research experiences, in a flashback, to a class of outbreaks. Young agents. But everything is very long and episodic! And as it progresses, it begins to resemble a television miniseries instead of a major film production, as the young Hardesty runs the gamut of American crimes, and takes such famous figures as &quot;Baby Face&quot; Nelson, Ma Barker, Dillinger , etc. Infamous organizations like the Ku Klux Klan, the Nazi spy rings and the red menace. And here it must be said that just by the presence on screen and the appeal of its star, THE FBI STORY, it would probably have ended in a forgotten disaster. Also, this is another problem with the image: Stewart is allowed to carry the whole movie almost on his own! With the exception of Vera Miles, who has the ungrateful role of being his long-suffering but devoted wife, he is surrounded by a cast of minor players! Throughout you you find yourself half expecting someone like Robert Ryan, Jack Palance or even Raymond Burr to make a welcome entry like a mobster or a police chief or whatever. But nothing so imaginative as that never happens! Pity! <br /><br /> However, the film manages to give a good look at the operation of the Office! With the help of Stewart&#39;s narrative, we learn about the thousands of men and women who work for the organization, which includes the hundreds of agents in the field. And they also invite us to take a look inside the headquarters, which houses the gigantic record section, and we can also see the chemists and fingerprint experts meticulously in their daily tasks. <br /><br /> Another advantage of the film is Max Steiner&#39;s extraordinary score. Listening to the titles is a powerful, stimulating and determined march, while for the softer moments of the image there is an attractive theme of love. But quite ingenious is the threatening and sinister theme of the march for the Ku Klux Klan sequence. And even better is the Latin American rhythmic music that the composer wrote for the South American scenes, especially the exciting Fandango as orchestrations for the arrival of federal troops on horseback. THE FBI STORY was one of the five scores that the composer wrote in 1959, which included Samuel Bronston&#39;s naval epic &quot;John Paul Jones&quot;, the charming comedian &quot;Cash McCall&quot;, the seminal western of Delmer Daves &quot;The Hanging Tree&quot; and Daves &quot;A Summer Place&quot;, from which the Young Love Theme was derived, which would become an important song for Steiner, better known as &quot;Theme From A Summer Place&quot;. <br /><br /> THE FBI STORY comes closer to the film as a result of Biroc&#39;s rich color cinematography, Steiner&#39;s wonderful music and, of course, Jimmie Stewart, which makes it all possible! <br /><br /> Classic but unlikely line of THE FBI HISTORY ............. While the bland Nick Adams (who just flew a plane with 43 people on board, including his mother) is being carried in handcuffs, he directs the agent who arrested him and says: &quot;In case you receive an email, you can send it to the Canyon City prison during the next month, more or less, then you can send it to HELL.&quot; Woohoo!']
