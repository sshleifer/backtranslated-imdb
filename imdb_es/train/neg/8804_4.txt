Great CGI effects and a performance worthy of an Oscar by Gary Sinise as Lieutenant Dan. <br /> <br /> Tom Hanks is a one-trick pony in this movie, how getting the Best Actor Oscar that year on Morgan Freeman was a crime. <br /> <br /> This movie is a loving love letter for the baby boom generation, with a barely concealed prejudice from the right, from the Forrest service in Vietnam to the "resolution" with Jenny in the End. < br /> <br /> That said, though, it's hugely entertaining and a complete American movie. Some parts of this movie seemed extremely offensive, and Zemeckis makes the fool of this movie almost at the same level as Gump himself. . Maybe that was the point I was trying to make. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie and ask yourself: "What is Robert Zemeckis saying about what makes a good American?" <br /> <br /> It seems that Forrest made the "right" decisions and was in the "right place at the right time" for the past 45 years. Those who are wrong according to the director's vision seem to pay a very high price. So, does Zemeckis say that idiocy disguised as innocence and naivety is a patriotic, even American, quality?
