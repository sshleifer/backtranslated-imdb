I have seen this movie many times (and recently I read the book on which the film is based) and every time I see it, I just want to slap at four. The fact that they do not realize the fact that Tom Hank's character is becoming his D & D character (oops M & M) :) ("Oh, he's just acting like a character") outside of the game session. That and the fact that after three months of therapy, let's destroy all that and feed their delusions! This kind of people is what gives RPGs a bad name. <br /> <br /> Also the cursive 'love ballad' and the music of 'cat on a piano' and 'Stop us if we get too upset' are almost enough to put your teeth on the edge!
