Sure, I had some of the ingredients of a good movie. The story is good, though a bit bland and the performance was good enough, though I did not understand why Olivia d'Abo had such an pronounced Australian accent if her character was supposed to have been educated in the United States. My biggest problem, however, was with the costumes. I know that, as a rule, the average American is considered a scruffy dressing room by any self-respecting European, but this went beyond that. Anna's color combinations were positively frightening! And that sad excuse, similar to a potato sack, of a coat that I used throughout the film made me jump out of hives. I guess the idea was to be as realistic as possible (how many school teachers walk in Prada?) But simple does not mean an absolute lack of taste. A word for the wise ...
