Hmm ?? I agree with the critic who said that "strange people with generous tastes have been reviewing this movie". I thought the movie was intriguing enough to see it. I think that was mainly due to Marsden and Speedman, not the plot. <br /> <br /> The conclusion is that this film is something psychologically tempting on the one hand and deeply homophobic on the other. Thumb up on the first and triple down on the second. I'm not sure if the film aims to promote dialogue or spread fear and propaganda. <br /> <br /> I thought the acting was mediocre. A lot of conversation that was about 90 degrees from reality. I kept wanting to get some meaning from the plot, but ultimately it's just a conversation with a madman (Speedman). I feel a little bad for him (Speedman) because of his loss, but not really. Its loss is not greater and, certainly, it is less than the losses suffered every day throughout the world for more significant reasons. <br /> <br /> Does the film expose naïveté about HIV / AIDS? Yes: the audience to which it is intended. Is HIV a dark, mysterious and evil murderer? What about their victims? The answer to both questions is no. Neither HIV nor its victims have a more or less evil intention than lupus, multiple sclerosis, tuberculosis, hepatitis, CANCER or its victims, FOR THE SALTA DE DIOS. The fact that a disease is contagious does not make it deliberate or negligent, or evil, simply IS. <br /> <br /> Does this justify ignorance or infallible risk taking? - DO NOT. Do all people have to practice safe sex? - yes Will safer sex save the world? - DO NOT. Is safe sex realistic in all cases of love and lust between passionate and emotional human beings? ?? OF COURSE, NO. In what kind of world would we live if everyone followed the rules, nobody would risk it and sex was never spontaneous and passionate? Am I ignoring that the movie specifically deals with gay sex? ?? YES. HIV is transmitted by sharing blood or body fluids between infected and uninfected people. Sex is not necessary for transmission, gay or otherwise. <br /> <br /> I am always annoyed by the intentional violence of one person over another. I really thought that the film did a good job of portraying the absurdity of Tom's violent abduction, his captivity and his intention towards Dan, and this kind of insane violence happens every day. <br /> <br /> Notes from the stream of awareness of the film: Tom is crazy. <br /> <br /> Why Dan does not ask "why" do you feel this way, instead of "what are you doing"? Implication: men who have sex with men are infected with "AIDS" Implication: HIV = AIDS Where was Tom's responsibility in the sexual act? Why was it Dan's responsibility to use the condom? "Maybe you took it off before you put it in?" What are we talking about here? Was one of the parties unconscious? "Maybe she did not want to hear the truth" Are you kidding? "She's in heaven and she's incredibly hurt by what she now knows about me," right? Is Dan's life over if he has HIV? Certainly not! Is that why everyone is so homophobic? Do you think that gay men are the cause of HIV, that they will give it to the rest of the world and we will all die? Are you kidding me??? Are people stupid enough to think that homosexuality is the cause ... is it the problem? Do we feel this way for the victims of tuberculosis? of malaria? I can see that Tom is hurt by the death of his wife, and he blames AIDS, but really? Who is to blame here? The victim or the virus? Are diseases really the responsibility of the sick? (assuming they did not search and did not seek to spread the disease). <br /> <br /> Sure, safe sex is essential for a safe life, but so is not driving, not flying, not leaving the House, not living. Do we really want to blame the victims of the disease? Would safe sex between Tom and Dan have prevented the definitive death of Tom's wife? Maybe, but it's not Dan's sole responsibility. <br /> <br /> Tom is crazy. Did I mention that? <br /> <br /> From Tom to Dan: "Maybe you get what you deserve"? COME ON! 24 days: violent, naive and homophobic. <br /> <br /> Am I exaggerating? Maybe. But I think this movie aims at homosexual men for their reckless and malevolent intention towards a "straight world" practicing insecure sex, when the rate of homosexuals who practice safe sex is proportionally equivalent or better than that of heterosexuals. We all need to wake up and take HIV / AIDS seriously. HIV is killing hundreds of thousands of STRAIGHT Africans every year.
