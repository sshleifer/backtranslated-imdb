The story and the program were good, but it was really depressing and I hate the depressing movies. Ri'Chard is great. He really had a first level performance, and the girl who played his sister was really amazing and beautiful. Seriously, I thought it was Carmen Electra until I saw the profile of IMDb. I can not say anything bad about Peter Galleghar. He is one of my favorite actors. I love Anne Rice. I'm currently reading The Vampire Chronicles, but I'm glad I watched the movie before reading the book. This is a bit too "real" for me. I prefer the small and witty tiffs of Lestat and Louis to the struggles of the slaves. Eartha Kitt was so creepy and after her character did what she did. The movie was ruined for me; I could barely stop to see the rest of the show. (Sorry for the ambiguity, but I do not want to reveal anything) Sorry, but it's not my kind of show.
