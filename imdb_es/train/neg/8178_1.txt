Have you ever sat down to watch a movie when 20 or 30 minutes have passed and suddenly you realize that you have actually seen the movie before? That happened to me with "The young graduates". The cover of the video box, if you can find the video, is extremely misleading. I swear the two women on the cover are not even in the movie. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I was born a decade too late to appreciate the finer points of this movie or ... it's just mindless junk. I'm strongly inclined toward the latter, but I think some of them have developed a connection to this movie. <br /> <br /> Hmm ... argument. A plot Let's see ... there must be a plot here somewhere. No, I can not find it. It's pretty much about some high school students who behave like crazy, use drugs and speak in a language that became obsolete decades ago. One of the students is in love with her teacher. The teacher has a frigid wife (whom, in fact, he refers to as an iceberg), so he is receptive to the girl's advances. <br /> <br /> There is a lot to drive, an inane dialogue and a lot of spastic dancing. Our cat, BooBoo, was paralyzed by the high school kids who danced. He watched with amazing intensity as the dancers spun and shook on the dance floor. It is good to see that at least one species has found something interesting in this relic. 1/10
