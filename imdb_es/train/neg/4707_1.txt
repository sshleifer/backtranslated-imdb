My God, this was the most painful experience of my life to see this. I could even finish what is happening to Nick. The best thing about the teenager Nick is Drake and Josh and that's about to go on the air. The children's songs are a bit annoying and so are the children. My little sister wanted to watch the show because she likes everything that comes in Disney or Nick, but after finishing watching this show, she said "one of the worst shows I've seen so boring". My little brother really fell asleep, I envy him. In summary, if you are 3 years old without brain activity, you will enjoy this show, otherwise, change the channel now.
