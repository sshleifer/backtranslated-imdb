The original "Vanishing Point" was a great movie. Subtle motives, characters that seemed real and spontaneous. The remake was terrible. Preacher, openly obvious; He did not understand why the original was a classic. The black charger was great, but even that could not rescue this movie. Why continue with a white Challenger? I did not think that was the best option in '71. Some parts of the movie were involuntarily fun. Like when Vigo was standing on a cliff overlooking the canyon after his "Dream Quest". His Indian friend was standing next to him. Vigo was wearing only his white underpants. Sorry, it seemed ridiculous, he watching the sight in his Fruit of the Looms. Another scene was at the end, after the explosive crash in the bulldozers, the announcer said the impact was 180 mph. He then mentions that the police officers said that his remains were not found because he vaporized, but some people believe he escaped and was hidden by friends in the crowd. Then, it shows you get out of the car at 180 mph! First, you could not open the car door at 180 mph. Secondly, the car would not continue traveling in a straight line for 100 m. with nobody to direct it. In a short time it would roll about 30 times. Third, if you hit the pavement at 180 mph, you will end up in several soft pieces. It does not matter, we see him standing next to his daughter. In short, a movie that would insult anyone's intelligence.
