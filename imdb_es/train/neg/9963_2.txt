I love Alec Guinness. And that's saying a lot after this movie. Actually, it's not bad at that. It seems that it is put aside, it is urban and its usual charming self, but it does not invest anything. It is obvious that the girl she is paired with is a featherweight, even like an inexperienced young Frenchwoman. Sir Alec would not have chosen it when he was young and obviously he is not happy now. <br /> <br /> The interesting character is the disturbing brother of the strange "Suzanne", another imbecile. "Donald" aspires to be a French Heathcliffe and I waited in vain for the source of his mystery. What dark and deep secret was hidden behind that forehead? Was he in love with the father's lover? Why did she shake Suzanne's hair when she planned to piece together the disparate parts of this turkey on the farm? Or maybe he just got tired of his odious acting. <br /> <br /> The film would have been lovely with Guiness and the "older woman" remembering and seeing Paris together. THAT would have been a great story! Two charming experienced people in a beautiful city after the destruction of World War II. Why did not someone come up with that? I suggest seeing Alec Guiness in "The Card", a little known but worthwhile film.
