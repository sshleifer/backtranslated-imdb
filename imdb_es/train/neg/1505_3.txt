A stupid and quite typical story of Italo-Western, full of clich√©s and lack of logic, some mediocre actors, dirty stages, many fist fights and people who kill themselves on a large scale. <br /> <br /> This has nothing. do with Django. - At least not in my version translated into German, this DVD in German is called "Adios Companeros" and has Macho Callaghan fighting against Butch Cassidy and Ironhead because his gang killed him (he is the only survivor). Then you have Butch Cassidy and Ironhead fighting between them because they fought and the gang split up. And you have Ironhead fighting everyone, because he's the biggest, greedy asshole anyway. Yes, that's all, no more intelligence in history, hehe. <br /> <br /> A small role of Klaus Kinski as Reverend Cotton is remarkable (that's why I bought this DVD). In one scene, try to separate two men who fight by beating them and shouting "I said love!" and in another scene, he wins a competition when he throws horseshoes and he goes crazy for a second: FANTASTICFANTASTICFANTASTIC !!! <br /> <br /> It is also remarkable that JOE d'AMATO aka Aristide Massaccesi made the cinematography. I love this master of incompetent-thrash exploitation, so it was an "aahhh" for me.
