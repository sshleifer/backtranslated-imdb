This is simply disposable. If there is a story here somewhere, it is so deeply hidden under the horrible characters and the camera work that it is indiscernible. There is a group of vampire hunters who are doing their thing, and the vampires they kill have little aliens inside them. They stick their heads out and talk like Speedy Gonzales. If you can imagine an alien puppet covered in blood and blood screaming in horror while a cowboy guy hits her with a cattle hit, well, that's what you get here. These people are noisy, unpleasant, violent and extremely annoying. Then there are some antihuman humans, who are in their CGI spaceship being so incredibly pompous that it is impossible to take them. These people make Hillary Clinton look like a right-wing extremist by comparison. They're friends with some vampires, or something ... who cares. <br /> <br /> Then there is the work of the camera. Do you remember that everybody hated the shit of a thousand cuts per minute from the recent Rolleball version? The people who made this movie LOVE those things. There's enough of that here for three really bad nu-metal videos on MTV. <br /> <br /> Nuff said. This thing smells. In comparison, Dracula 3000 is a masterpiece.
