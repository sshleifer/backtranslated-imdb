FLIGHT OF FURY takes on the mantle of being the BEST Steven Seagal movie I've seen ... Until now. <br /> <br /> It's a terrible bore with no action scenes of interest, Seagal is not. I'm really trying to do this, he's fat and his voice is bent once more. <br /> <br /> The Co-stars do not fare better, being a rather unfortunate burden for the 3rd assessors. <br /> <br /> The Direction Keusch is very poor and it is not surprising that he is also responsible for another stinky pair of Seagal (SHADOW MAN & ATTACK FORCE). The script co-written by Seagal himself is ridiculously inept. <br /> <br /> According to IMDb $ 12M was spent on this boring burden of old tosh - If these figures are correct, I feel a big tax problem by not spending that amount. <br /> <br /> FLIGHT OF FURY is actually a shot-by-shot remake of the Michael Dudikoff movie, BLACK THUNDER, which has to be better than this gut. <br /> <br /> This has NO redeeming qualities at all, give it a MISS! 1/2 * out of *****
