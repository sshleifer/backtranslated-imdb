I heard a lot about this movie how it was a great killer and one of those films of the early 80's that die hard fans of most of the movies that only had to do. Well, I rented it and I have to say that although I kept my attention to the suspense for most of the slasher movies like "April Fools Day", "Friday 13th" and "Prom Night", this movie could have been correct. up there, with the aforementioned, he just lacked real enthusiasm and potential from the characters, as well as from the current story. The characters that I found unfortunate to be in this movie were the weird guy with the frizzy hair that crawled around the bedroom and, of course, led to his true climatic role during the finale with which he faces the killer. Another would be the dirty boy with the disheveled look in his jean jacket, he could have played more roles in this movie that could have made him more interesting, instead, the movie played this guy as another loser out there making unknown calls while he sleeps. with his girlfriend and then drop his part and interrupt it until the end, which was a waste, I was disappointed his part in the end. As far as the true identity of the murderer was concerned, when the identity of who he was was revealed, I just laughed, but it was very obvious and really made a real tug outside of himself, as well as an annoying character after his The true intentions were revealed. This movie should be one to see at least all the slasher fans, but do not spend your hard earned money on a rare inventory of collectors.
