Okay, Chuck Norris somehow found a way to achieve this sequel. I have a question, why? Who read this script and said: "The sound is great! Original!" This movie is regurgitated shit that would not stain my intestinal toilet. Of course, it's another story, following the tradition of MIA, Invasion USA, Walker, Texas Ranger, Delta Force, etc. in which Chuck Norris, of course, is the only man who can beat America out of some bad guys. You do not even need a gun most of the time. It's stupid patriotic jargon that attacks the mind. Great surprise that the only one who will direct these Norris movies is Chuck's son, Eric. Eric Norris has worked mainly on all of his father's movies and television shows. Does not this seem to someone as a sign that he has no talent for directing? After all, direct the same people as before in the same stories as before ... the only difference are the names of the characters. If this is supposed to make me patriotic and encourage the USA. UU., Our country is in a much worse shape than I ever imagined. Hopefully, this will be the nail in Chuck Norris' performance coffin.
