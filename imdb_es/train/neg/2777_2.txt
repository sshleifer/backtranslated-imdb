Unfortunately, this has been showing on Star Movies here in Thailand during the last week. It's a complete garbage performance. As another member said, this movie is a good example of "how not to act". I have not seen a movie so badly performed in a long time. The actors (can you call them 'actors'?) They are completely flat and offer their lines with the passion of a dead dog. I would say that to really understand how bad acting is, you should see the movie ... but that would be similar to torture. <br /> <br /> I shudder when the protagonist speaks her lines. , and the rest of the cast with its accents (false or artificial) is equally atrocious. Another actress with the fake British accent was pretty, yes, but good sir was her terrible accent. Mix that with your (lack of) acting and you have a mess. She should have said nothing and I could have accepted her as the pretty girl. Oh, we just got to the scene where the protagonist's lover says "Really, me?" after a forced crying scene of her. Funny. No, seriously, I just laughed out loud. <br /> <br /> The sets and the art directors offer something of salvation to the film. Some of the sets are colorful and some of the scenes are quite nice (except the actors). <br /> <br /> The old lady of the magic potion? What?! Another member mentioned the "modern" love song that was in the movie. Totally unsuitable for a set of period pieces about 500 years ago. <br /> <br /> I understand that the film was considered 'Great Budget' in Thailand at the time of its production. I would feel very angry if I were the producer of this movie. It only goes to show that money does not necessarily make a good (or even mediocre) movie. <br /> <br /> I would give King Maker 1 out of 10, but the costumes and sets make the film save such a rating. 2 out of 10
