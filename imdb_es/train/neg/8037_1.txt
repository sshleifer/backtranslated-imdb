Okay, a slasher movie. A very, very stupid movie. <br /> <br /> We have your teenagers stereotyped in a house. We have an FBI agent who has seen Dirty Harry once too much. "So, what's the secret ... punks?" We got about 4 different camera shots and scenes that do not make any sense. "Hey, I'm fixing the sprinklers" ((that guy was my favorite part of the movie)) Suddenly, there's a preacher tied up on a couch watching home movies, they kill him. <br /> <br /> follow the murderer to the center of nowhere, without cops. Suddenly she is in a church, wearing a wedding dress. I swear this is the most stupid Slasher movie I've seen in my life.
