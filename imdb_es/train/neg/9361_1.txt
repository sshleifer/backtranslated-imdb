When I saw the preview of this on TV, I was thinking, "Well, it will be a good werewolf movie," but it was not. It was not scary at all! Acting was good, the plot was horrible, the military offensive was just stupid. I think the SCI-FI channel could have been better than this piece of garbage. The movie made it look like Arron would become a werewolf, instead he went crazy and bit the throat of a doctor. If you have read some of my other comments in other films, there are all positive, but this is not simply because the story was terrible. One in 10 max. I'm sure everyone expected a werewolf movie, but I bet they did not expect this. Beyond Loch Nes was much better than this movie, hell, any movie of the science fiction channel is better than this movie.
