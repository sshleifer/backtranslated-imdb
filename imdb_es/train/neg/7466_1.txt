Wow. Some movies leave me speechless. This was undoubtedly one of those movies. When I left the theater, not a single word came to my mouth. All I had was an incredible urge to bang my head against the wall of the theater to help me forget about the last hour and a half. Unfortunately, it did not work. Honestly, this movie has nothing to recommend. The humor was at the level of first grade, at best, the acting was too silly and the plot was astronomically implausible. I listen to the commitment never to see another film starring Chris Kattan or any other member of the SNL cast.
