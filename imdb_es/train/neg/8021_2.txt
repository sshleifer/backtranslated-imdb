Visually disarticulated and full of himself, the director apparently opted to seek a false depth to expand a 5-minute plot at an 81-minute snoring festival. <br /> <br /> The moments that work in this movie are VERY limited, and the characters do not even feel real. How can you feel invested in a main character that became so surreal? <br /> <br /> Substantially and stylistically, everything feels like a peculiar dream sequence. The irregular work of the camera, the uncomfortable silences and gaps in the action, and what about the small spider image that is dragged across the screen? Whoever has thought about it needs to go back to film school. It did not add any meaning, just cheese, and it did not even work stylistically with the rest of the movie (assuming the movie had a style, which is a close decision). What a failure.
