I did not think this movie was worth a bad script, a bad performance except for Janine Turner, no fantasy, a stupid plot, a stupid husband and unfair divorce adjustments. If you've never seen this movie, do not worry, it's not worth it. The only good thing was that Janine Turner did a good acting job. Terry's husband is an intelligent defense lawyer who has won many cases and even got rid of guilt killers. She thinks she's so smart, but in reality she's just crazy. Her best friend has an affair with her husband and betrays her. Good girl, huh? Yes, she is a real peach, no. She is not a day at the beach either.
