I saw this furtively two days before the official opening, and I must say I was very disappointed. And I have to put most of these problems into the decision to choose Claire Danes in the lead role. Depending on what you think about the Danes, she was terribly grumpy, or is so far from her head that she should be the first favorite of the 2007 Razzie for the Worst Actress. I think we were supposed to sympathize with her. On the other hand, she is completely unpleasant. The other "great" actresses do a good job, but they certainly do not illuminate the screen. Of all the "great" actresses of this film, I would say that the one who did the best work was Natasha Richardson. Streep is barely in the picture, and only appears near the end. <br /> <br /> Horrible script too. It comes off more as the reading lines really be "in character".
