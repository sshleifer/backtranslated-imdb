Do not let the MPAA fool you with your "R rating for extreme violence" there is definitely no extreme violence in this boring piece of s * t. I expected a cheap rambo-type action that promised the trailer, however, it's just boring and boring nonsense with tons of slow and slow flashbacks that make no sense. AVOID!
