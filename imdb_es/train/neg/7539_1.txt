Where, oh, where to start describing the complete misery of Neil LaBute's last attempt to make a movie? <br /> <br /> There are many types of movie fanatics, but the most intriguing is, by far, the most annoying and superficial. You know Mr. intriguing, right? <br /> <br /> He is the guy who, no matter how stupid, lame and incomprehensible a movie, says: "Gee, I do not know why everyone hated her, I found her intriguing". He is the kind of person who finds the smell of dog poop intriguing. Especially when he stains it with the shape of a Hitler mustache on his upper lip and marches through the house ranting about the brilliance of science fiction that presents references to Greek mythology, little disguised. He is also the guy for whom this version of The Wicker Man was created. Nobody else could stand it.
