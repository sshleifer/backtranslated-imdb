... because 99 out of 100 times, the producers lied (or someone else's) for you to rent or buy their * mercifully censored *. <br /> <br /> The film Shock-O-Rama shows that The truth of this is once again with the release of "Feeding the Masses", a possibly incomprehensible entry but totally inept and sad in the zombie genre. Friends, this is not just a low budget movie, but a VERY low budget movie made by a group of people who, I'm sorry, I know they have families that love them, never, never, will be in Variety in any meaningful way. This is a baaaaaaaaaad mooin 'pitcher, friends, and not just because it's cheap. <br /> <br /> The acting is mediocre, but I do not blame the actors; They had no address. They had no direction because the script was a half-witted zombie fantasy of a true cinematic narrative. The characterization is thin at best, not thanks to the weak dialogue and the soporific direction. Did I mention that the script and the direction are pretty boring? Are. There is no drama, there is no tension, there are no great moments of character, nothing. The whole premise of the suppression of the media by the government is wasted in second-year "commercial recesses" and in a non-dramatic plot that defies rational analysis and that bothers its final ridiculous. Syd Fields would not be happy. <br /> <br /> How could the government suppress the truth of a virulent zombie epidemic when the reality of it would be evident everywhere? Why do you give more than one superficial attempt? In the current era of cell phones with wireless access, what could you expect to achieve for more than a day or more? Now, if they were covering up something, like their own guilt ... but "Feeding the masses" never explores such possibilities. Instead, it is based on the absurd and ill-organized events to unearth in search of laughter and / or meaning, praying that their audience does not notice the almost total lack of production value beyond the basic film crew. Was someone paid in this movie? I hope the actors have done it, even if they have only lost time in dead ends like this one; at least the technicians had the opportunity to accumulate a legitimate work experience. <br /> <br /> Even zombie fans will find little to gain from "Feeding the Masses". The gore is remarkably docile for those who have no budget, and there are no distinctive elements or memorable effects. All are eminently forgettable, in fact. KNB has nothing to fear. <br /> <br /> Even garbage such as the Australian fetal death "Undead" was way ahead of "Feeding the Masses". Sorry, guys, go back to the drawing boards and take your deceptive marketing with you.
