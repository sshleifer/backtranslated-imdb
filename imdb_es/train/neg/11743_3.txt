I really can not say anything bad * or * good about this. His characters are quite nice, they are skillfully produced and designed, and they look professional (except that cheesy monster costume). However, it has no originality, no ideas, and nothing that you have not seen in ALIEN, PREDATOR, ARMAGEDDON and / or OUTLAND. It's just another formula, cookie cutter, "dirty corporate drones in deep space in front of an unstoppable monster" movie. Quite a waste of time.
