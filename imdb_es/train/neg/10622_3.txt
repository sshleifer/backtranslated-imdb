In fact, I have a penchant for Christopher Lee, but this was not up to his other performances ... and he was one of the best actors. <br /> <br /> The movie does not live up to its premises. It's not that scary, it's too melodramatic, and it's very bad. Every time I thought, "Oh, HERE comes the good part," the good part never came. <br /> <br /> The Evil ones are not entirely convincing. Most of the other characters also lacked depth. <br /> <br /> Maybe if I had been in the right frame of mind, I might have enjoyed some MSTie-fication at the expense of this movie, but ... Naaahhh ... It really does not seem worth it the effort. It was not really very good, it was not really very bad, it was just mediocre.
