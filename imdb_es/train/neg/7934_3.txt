A family that travels for their daughter's softball league decides to take the 'scenic route' and end up in the middle of nowhere. The father is an avid photographer, and when he hears about an old abandoned secondary show in the city, he decides to take another detour to take some photographs. <br /> <br /> Of course, the side show is full of innumerable. monsters, who quickly kidnap women and let the young son and his father fend for themselves. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this movie is how the family really fights against its pure captors. Apart from that, there is nothing worthwhile in the movie.
