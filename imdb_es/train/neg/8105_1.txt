Hard, yes, but I call them as I see them. <br /> <br /> I saw it in the late '80s, and it was really one of the most horrible and boring movies I've ever forced myself to do. Look. <br /> <br /> Yes, the cinematography is beautiful. The Czech settings are really impressive. The political context is attractive, but unlike similar "historically established" stories (eg, Mr. Zhivago_ (qv)), this did not make politics relevant to history, or even interesting. <br /> <br /> Sure, Olin and Binoche are beautiful. But this film manages to make even "erotic" scenes heavy and slow. I am in favor of romance, but this movie was very boring, I started to expect the Russians to shoot at them all and put an end to my misery. <br /> <br /> I'm sure I read the book, the story would have made a little more sense. However, life is too short to spend more time on this.
