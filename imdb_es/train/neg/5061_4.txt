Anurag Basu, who co-directed the flop KUCCH TO HAI made his debut in this film. <br /> <br /> The film was ahead of its time in a way that has a not much different story and came closer to HAWAS, which premiered 1 week earlier and fortunately this was better and made a better business. <br / > <br /> The movie starts well, Malika's fault is well shown at first, although the scene with Emraan-Malika is too coarse / vulgar <br /> <br /> The scenes between Emraan and Malika are well managed and the turn in the story where Ashmith confronts Emraan is brilliant <br /> <br /> The rhythm moves fast and the viewer stays on the edge but the second the track of Emraan's girlfriend is not entirely convincing <br /> <br /> Also the police track is almost baked <br /> <br /> The ending is too filmic too <br /> <br /> Anurag's address Basu is good Music is a winner, all the songs were fabulous. The work with the camera was amazing. <br /> <br /> Emraan played very well his naughty streak, this was the role that gave him the stardom and although he continued playing such roles and got annoyed in this movie, he was also excellent. Ashmith was also good at his role for once, he did a good job and one of his only good results and he also looked good. Malika was brilliant in her role especially in the second half, but sometimes, her phone delivery was not up to par. Unfortunately, he rarely showed such potential in other films, Raj Jhutsi is fine.
