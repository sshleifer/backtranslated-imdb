If I could, I would give ZERO stars for this, but unfortunately I have to give one ... <br /> <br /> There is not a single scene I can laugh at ... but the game did not make me laugh either. So, If you are a little late, go to your local cinema, watch this movie and give it 10 stars, as some people here already did. <br /> <br /> but for me ... in a movie where children are shot to achieve humor ... good taste exceeds the limit ... this was the third time I wasted my time watch a Boll movie and it was definitely the last! <br /> <br /> 0/10 ... I am ashamed to be from the same country as Uwe Boll! <br /> <br /> PLEASE, KEEP IT TO MAKE MORE MOVIES !!!!!
