I do not know if the problem I had with this film is that I could not capture the way the movies were made in the past, but I think that it did not fail to make use of any of the fashion conventions available in the 1940's to make a movie. If you have nothing better to do, my advice is that you do not see this movie, but read a book or go for a walk.
