This movie is so bad, you can not imagine it. The acting is terrible, even worse than in the third class soap operas. And it is a pity that this film has been the most successful in the last 20 years in Switzerland. The interactions between the soldiers made no sense at all. The story could have been taken from a brave photo-story, the dialogues were as wooden as Treebeard and the holes in the plot were bigger than the black hole at the center of our galaxy. But today it does not take much to satisfy the public. The actors were handsome, for example, the former Miss Switzerland and the main character was even hanged (woah!) And certainly there was a lot of drug abuse. That's really cool man! Especially for teenagers of 12 and 13 years. But the media created an atmosphere in which he was not allowed to reject the film because they manipulated the dynamics of the peer group by implicitly telling him that you are a nerd if you do not agree with the other "sheep" and he says. Exactly what it was when I was in the army / that's exactly what I'm going to do when I have to go to the army ... to every corny action that has to do with drugs and coldness. And do not think I like the army. I was there and I hated it, but this movie is worse than cleaning the sticky toilet with a toothbrush (what I was forced to do because I offended a lieutenant) It is not necessary for each film to be sophisticated. Sometimes you just want to be entertained for a few hours and forget about the problems and I think it's not a bad thing. But this type of film has a great influence on teenagers by showing them a great lifestyle that, in fact, is just stupid and makes them ignorant without brains and egocentric idiots. But as now I think my opinion is not very popular, now I will be quiet and I will recommend that you avoid this terrible film at any cost, and for that to save your wit. <br /> <br /> 2/10 <br /> <br /> (sorry for my bad English)
