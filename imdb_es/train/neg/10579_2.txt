According to IMDb, the Horror segment of Takashi Miike, Imprint, was banned in the United States. So I thought I would translate the Swedish review I just wrote ... <br /> <br /> It was hard NOT to have any expectations regarding the Ichi episode The Killer-Takashi Miike in the Masters of Horror series. And the Imprint DVD cover actually looked very promising. <br /> <br /> The story takes place mainly in a remote Japanese brothel, sometime in the 19th century, and tells the story of a journalist looking for Komomo, the woman he left behind and who promised to return. Tired and dejected, he arrives at the brothel, hoping that this is the end of his long journey. It turns out that one of the prostitutes, a deformed and calm girl, knows about Komomo, and the desperate man makes her tell him where he is and what has happened to him since he left. The story she tells him is as deplorable as it is hard to swallow ... <br /> <br /> The first thing that struck me about the episode was the unnaturalness of the Japanese speaking fluently in the United States. -English. But I'll leave it like that, it's not a big problem. What is a big problem, however, is how miserable the rest was. The story of Miike moves at such a slow pace that I could not help but look at my watch several times during the 63 minutes. The extended bull scene, which takes place somewhere in the middle of the film, felt so unmotivated, and pornographically intrusive, that not even that scene became interesting. I felt that I was violent only because of the violence itself, with no sense of style or purpose. The only scenes that caused me any kind of emotion were the images of bloody fetuses rolling through the bottom of the fast flowing water ... and, in all honesty, the only emotions they provoked were feelings of disgust. <br /> <br /> The journalist who seeks the love he left behind is played by Billy Drago, for me, the most memorable as Frank Nitti - Al Capones, the killer of Brian De Palmas The Untouchable (1987). I have always found that the representation of Nitti in Dragos is very cold (and I say it in a good way), and that is probably the reason why I almost got upset when I found him so terrible (NOT in a good way) in this one. His performance seems to flow between the absence of feelings or empathy at all and the demonstrations of a really bad overacting. When his character is supposed to react to the horrible things that Komomo has been subjected to, I was sitting on the couch, twisting and twisting in an attempt to escape the horrible performance that Drago had presented. I'm grateful that most of the story is told by Yuoki Kudoh (Memoirs of a Geisha, 2005), who plays the deformed prostitute. <br /> <br /> The ending is probably supposed to be shocking, maybe even disgusting and horrible, but I just found out it's kind of ... you know ... "blah" (and I looked at my watch new, for the first time, wishing that the shit episode would end). Maybe the ending made me smile a little, but that's only because I could not help but think of an episode of Red Dwarf, and the lies backwards of Craig Charles and Danny John-Jules, with eyes glued on them to make it come as extraterrestrials ... Good luck, if you've seen that episode and now you decide to see Imprint, I will always have ruined the final images for you. <br /> <br /> My first thought, when the impression finally ended, was that the only thing that made the pain of seeing it worthwhile, was to listen to the title theme of Edward Shearmur (the same music that I think is used in all episodes of this series), and that, in any case, is a great warning, do not you think? <br /> <br /> One could point to costume design, by Michiko Kitamura, and say that, at least, there is something that is NOT lacking in style and refinement ... but there are many other movies and television shows that They are much better at showing Japanese "geisha fashion". This is just inferior and I am disappointed. The Masters of Horror episode by Takashi Miike is boring, boring and pointless. In other words; It's really, really BAD!
