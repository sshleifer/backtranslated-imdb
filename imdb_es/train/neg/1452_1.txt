This Germany from 1919 to 1933 does not look like a Czech capitol after the Second World War. Oh, I'm sorry, it's the Czech capitol and it's 2003, what fun. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most horrible history films from the nearest past. Röhm is a taller head than Adolf and looks so good that Göring seems to be 40 when he's only 23 and the "Führer" always seems to be 56. And the buildings, the people, even the buildings have been young, sometimes. Especially 1919 were many houses in Germany almost new (the First World War does not reach the German cities!). Without plaster falling apart! Then the Reichstagsbuilding. There have never been urban cannons around this building, ever. And this may sound like a miracle to all: in 1933, the Greater Berlin fire department owns many vehicles with engines, some even with revolving ladders, but none with a hand pump. <br /> <br /> One The latest: What kind of PLAYMOBIL castle was this in the final sequence? For me this was a kind of "Adolf's Adventures in Wonderland"
