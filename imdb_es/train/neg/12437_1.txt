'Home Alone 3' is the first of the Home Alone films that does not feature Culkin in the main role and the same villains. However, the plot is very similar to the original film "Alone at home". Instead of two comic villains, we have three or four of them. This movie involves some traps, but it also has a long scene with a car with remote control. Slapstick humor is also consistent, but the boy and the villains do not really make an impact on this movie. (I did not intend to make any pun). This film does not offer anything new or different from what the previous films did, and there really is not the warm and festive feeling of the other two films. It's more of a pure comedy, but it did not make me laugh because the characters did not really do it for me. I would not recommend this movie; It's pretty boring If you're looking for a good family holiday movie with comedy, see the original movie "Alone at home".
