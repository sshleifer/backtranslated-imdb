The wicker man. I'm so angry that I can not write a proper comment about this movie. <br /> <br /> The plot was ridiculous, it was very close and, for the rest, simply silly. Nicolas Cage ... the fault is yours! I assumed that since you were in it, it would be at least decent. It was not. <br /> <br /> I felt that large parts of the film had been left on the floor of the cutting room, and even if it is complete, the film was simply extravagant and silly. <br /> <br /> In the end you are left speechless, with a dazed mind and good taste offended. I had never heard so many people leave a theater on the day of the inauguration with so much hatred. People complained about it in small groups at the mall, four floors down from the theater near the entrance. It is so bad <br /> <br /> I heard it compared to: Glitter, American Werewolf in Paris and Gigli. My boyfriend was so angry that he would not even talk about it. <br /> <br /> Grrrr!
