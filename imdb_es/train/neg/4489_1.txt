`The Matrix 'was an exciting summer blockbuster that was visually fantastic, but also curiously stimulating in its' Twilight Zone' mode. The general rule applies here, and this sequel does not match its predecessor. Worse than that, it does not even compare to that. <br /> <br /> 'Reloaded' explodes on the screen in the least professional way. In the first seconds, the first impression is generally good, since Trinity is shot in a dream. Immediately after, the film dives. After a disastrous first 45 minutes, gradually gains momentum when they enter the Matrix and the battle of Agent Smith takes place. But it is lost at full speed when it reaches the 14-minute car chase sequence and gets even worse in the big turn at the end. Worst of all is the long scene of 'Zion Rave'. Not only does it have absolutely nothing to do with the plot, it is also a pathetic excuse for porn and depressive dance music. <br /> <br /> The bullet aspect of 'The Matrix' was a good addition, but in `` Reloaded '' they are used excessively to make it look boring. In the first there were interesting twists in the plot, but here it is too linear to be remotely interesting. Basically, the movie is just a series of fun distractions that prevent us from realizing how empty it really is. It works on the wrong principle that the bigger is better. It seems that the franchise `The Matrix 'has descended quickly to the special effects of the miserable fire that other franchises have like the saga` Star Wars'. <br /> <br /> The performance standard is deficient for the most part. The best character, of course, is "Agent Smith" by Hugo Weaving, the only one who is slightly interesting. Keanu Reeves is the definitive Neo, but in all special effects, there is little room to make a big impact. Laurence Fishburne, nominated for the Academy Award, is reduced to a monotonous mentor with poor dialogue. The part of Carrie Ann Moss as the action girl could have been much better for any other actress. <br /> <br /> A poor and united film, 'The Matrix Reloaded' is a disappointment. Those who did not like the first one probably will not go to him. This is only for intransigent fans. Even in the movie's own subgenre of special effects bonanzas (Minority Report, The Matrix, etc.), this is still quite poor. My IMDb rating: 4.5 / 10.
