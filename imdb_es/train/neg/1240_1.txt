I think everyone was quite disappointed with this science fiction movie. On the one hand, it was directed by Tim Burton. Another thing, it's a new version of what is supposed to be a classic. I found it boring, disgusting and ridiculous. If you've seen it, you know what I mean. Almost everyone in Imdb says it's crap, boy, they're right! If you have not done it, avoid it. It is a snorer. 1 out of 10
