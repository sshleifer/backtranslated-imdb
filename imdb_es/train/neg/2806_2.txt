The worst kind of movie. Basically, the Declaration of Independence of the United States was replaced by a plasma screen and this fooled the security of the museum for several days. Hey? <br /> <br /> The plasma screen that, in theory, would work for less than 2 seconds with the clock battery, assuming it had an internal resistance low enough to supply the necessary current, which would not happen. > <br /> It would be possible with a dozen large car batteries and an inverter, but that system would not fit in the case. Sorry for being anal, but this is not even plausible. The rest of the movie was not much better and I wonder why the budget could not have been donated to charity or to me.
