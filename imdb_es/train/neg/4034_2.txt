Oh darling. Good deal, but writing and directing is an art and writing wit and directing wit is a bit of a chore. Even making a good comedy you have to have the right time and moment. I did not leave everything, there were parts in which I laughed out loud, but that was very rarely. The main focus for me was in the fast and fluid dialogue, which caused some people in the movie to get upset. It may sound great as you read the script in your head, but taking that out and taking it to the camera is a different task. And the work of the handheld camera energizes some parts of the film. In general, the direction was good, but the script was not all that for me, but I'm sure I was reading the script in his head and it would sound good. Sorry.
