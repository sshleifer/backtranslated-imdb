I can not say much about this movie. I think it speaks for itself (as do the current ratings here). I rented this about two years ago and I totally regretted it. I even tried / I liked looking at it twice, but I could not. I can safely say that I have absolutely no desire to see this waste of time ever, never again. And I'm not someone to tear a movie apart, but I really think that this was horrible. It was not even funny in the least. The only parts that I enjoyed were the few scenes with Christopher Walken in them. I think this movie ruined both Jack Black and Ben Stiller. All I can think about when I watch one of his movies today is this terrible movie, and it reminds me not to waste my money. Amy Poehler is also very upset. <br /> <br /> In general, well, I think you understand my point. The stars are for Walken, by the way.
