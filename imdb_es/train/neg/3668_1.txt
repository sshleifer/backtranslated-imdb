['This movie is so bad that you almost feel contaminated by it. Actually, there&#39;s a great sense of relief when it&#39;s over, relief that you can now put the cassette back in the rewinder and turn this on at the video rental store before it contaminates the rest of your video collection. When we rented it in jest, I suggested that it looked like the kind of movie where William Hurt would &quot;call&quot; his performance. I meant that he would not try very hard. But behold, in a lot of scenes in this movie, Bill Hurt is really ON THE PHONE! Our realization of this irony was the only pleasure we derived from this confusing mess. The cinematography and editing are murky and confusing, the story is chaotic and the soundtrack is barely audible. There is a little resemblance to &quot;Falling Down&quot;, but that movie had a boldly disturbing plot, great writing and acting, and an attractive soundtrack. &quot;Contaminated Man&quot; is just a kind of broken old European tourist trap, and seeing it is like driving on an unknown road in an unknown country where the language is not spoken with constant rain just after dark while the windshield keeps fogging. they give the image? Do not get this.']
