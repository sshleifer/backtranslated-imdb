Given the title and the extravagant art of the box, I was ready for almost anything. Maybe my expectation was forced just a little high, because they left me a bit dry. <br /> <br /> A film crew that works on a soft sex movie ends up in a strange house when they get lost in the Fog and decide how best to spend the night is to have sex. Where has this configuration not been used before? The difference here is the perverse nature of sex. It is not allowed to show all the products (groin intakes were illegal in Japan for a long time, what is shown is tarnished). The film strives to show the viewer how unnatural sex can be. <br /> <br /> In the middle of all the mischief, a mud monster (whose origin I can not understand) appears and begins to murder the men and rape the women ... and then kill them too. Some of the places of interest are a little too important, especially a woman whose vagina has been taken out by the vagina or another woman spitting a drink of ... things, but otherwise, blood is a pretty standard. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, the movie is shot down by its own designs; It is too sexual to be a horror image and too frightening to work like a sex movie. The media can work, but there must be a balance. <br /> <br /> 4/10
