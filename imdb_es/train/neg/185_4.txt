The five really good westerns that Mann did have no equal as a set in Hollywood. Even John Ford never did so many with such quality. The curious thing about all of them is how uneven they are. Ford's My Darling Clementine is worth about two and a half of any of them. Or at least two. <br /> <br /> The true hero of them, besides Mann and Stewart, is Chase. Chase being responsible for the bright red river. Chase wrote distant country, bend of the river, and probably some others. But none of them is as finished as My Darling Clementine, but then very few films, western or other, are. <br /> <br /> Each of the five Mann films has big holes, or six, let's see. Bend, Far, Man of the West, Furies, Winchester 73, and yup, six, Naked Spur. Each one has a magnificent scene after another magnificent one, with quite evident lapses. However, so does Red River, which remains the largest and only western ever made. So perfection is not everything. <br /> <br /> But The Far Country has huge and huge holes. It is immaculate, and really comes alive only when Stewart and Mc Enter are closing their horns. The rest is quite pedestrian, with the usual exception of Mann's camera. Mann's camera is a man's course in cinematography. It's almost as good as anyone who's been behind a moving film strip. He's almost never in the wrong place, ever. <br /> <br /> The distant country has an incredible moment. And as usual it comes from Stewart. No one in the history of cinema received physical punishment with the authority of that man. It is absolutely amazing: look at it in Bend, Far, Winchester and Man from Laramie: in Bend it has been hit and is hanging by a thread so credibly and with such boiling hatred that it looks like someone displaced from Dachau, in the Far. he pulls a raft with such violence, it seems so convincing that you wince, and of course, when you drag him through the fire in Man, well, you find yourself looking for burn marks. What an actor Not to mention the moment in Winchester when they hit him early in the hotel room, just as anyone has done. <br /> <br /> But that was Mann's territory: look at Gary Cooper fighting with Jack Lord in Man of the West. As painful as any fight scene ever recorded. Cooper, though not as convincing as Stewart, however, is somehow his equal at being exhausted at the end of the fight. In short, nobody, except anyone, never showed the human being in extremis as much as Mann. <br /> <br /> What a great, great director. <br /> <br /> Look at every western I've done. They are its true monuments, even if they are all scaly. And that. When it begins to roar with its great scenes, they are as good as any, including Ford. And his six westerns as a whole are the best that anyone has done, period. <br /> <br /> Thanks, Anthony.
