The back of the DVD box says that Ellen Page co-stars in this movie. She does not even appear until they finish two-thirds of the movie and then her role is less. Nor do I consider it a support function, but a "small" part. Also the plot has many inexplicable elements. Some examples are: why does the main character reject his older son? Why does your youngest son go to the train? He says it's for a "dumb" bet that does not explain anything. Obviously, the screenwriter does not know the definition of a silly bet. This movie is not worthy of the rental price in my opinion. Save your money and watch it for free on television if you think you need to be seen.
