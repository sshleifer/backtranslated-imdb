I read all these reviews here about how this is such a good movie. God, this movie was predictable and quite boring. The performance was below average most of the time, especially by Mckenna. I have not seen a more pathetic attempt to turn someone into a movie. Oh man, this movie was a disappointment. I also read somewhere that this could be a cult classic. I know there are followers of the director, but this movie was just an average piece of the movie. <br /> <br /> The script was sparse, for the most part the performance was sparse, this movie was lame. <Br /> <br /> Oh, and pray for the boy who used to be in Cheers. It looks really bad <br /> <br /> The best actor in this movie was probably the guy in Office Space, and he was only in this movie for about 8 minutes. <br /> <br /> 4/10
