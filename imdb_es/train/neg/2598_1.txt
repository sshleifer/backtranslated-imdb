Even in a bad movie, there is usually a redeeming feature, something that can be said yes, that was terrible, but that there was that performance, or that part of the script, or that special effect, this was just terrible everywhere. The acting was ridiculous, the script terrible, complete with many inexplicable references to Breakfast at Tiffany, and even the special effects were of poor quality. This was a very bad movie and one that even Drew Barrymore wanted was erased from the story. Look at it if you want to: a) Suffer rough pain inflicted by yourself. b) See how bad a movie can be. This is a film in which I can use the clich√© "there are ninety minutes of my life that I will never come back" with some justification!
