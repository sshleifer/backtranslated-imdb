This is, without a doubt, the most offensive "girls movie" I've seen in years, if not ever. The writing and the characterizations are so full of stereotypes that the film borders on parody. Before leaving the theater an hour and five minutes of this disaster, we were subjected to the following topics: having a baby solve all their problems, "types of artists" are a miserable disaster and musicians can not be good mothers unless They launch their dreams for a more conventional lifestyle. What a waste of a talented cast and some outfits and disguises of excellent appearance. When Natasha Richardson told Toni Collette that, unless she lives a more conventional life, she will end, trembling, "alone", I felt dizzy. I can not believe that this movie was premiered theatrically. It's the kind of rate expected from those "female" cable channels that always happen when I navigate the channel. I am a woman and I am over 35 years old, so I should be part of the target audience of this film, but boy, "Evening" does not reach its goal.
