This film that was released directly on video must carry a warning label that is dangerous to human health and can expose the viewer to terminal boredom. It is another religious film of the "rapture", slightly veiled, with the good (the believers) disappearing suddenly and the bad (the non-believers) left behind. It is an interesting concept, especially because we see that it happens on a flight captained by an unbeliever who is having a sinful adventure with a stewardess on board (it goes without saying that the sinner does not disappear either!). Unfortunately, with all the pilots who were not believers, the plane did not crash or the movie would have ended mercifully. Although this could have been interesting without the strong religious cult, on the whole, the laborious film makes us a joke, the acting is horrible and the simulations, obviously generated by computer, are very false. In addition, it is another film shot in Canada that claims to be the city of New York. Save me ... I just read the Bible.
