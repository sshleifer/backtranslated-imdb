I found this movie as an interesting study in cause and effect, but little more than that. The basic plot follows the lives of a handful of people and how their actions (deliberate and otherwise) affect the lives of others. The premise of the film is very promising, but I feel that it does not fulfill its promise. Too much time is spent telling the audience about chaos theory and too little time to prove it. As a result, I never had a real feeling of any of the characters and I never had a good emotional connection with them. At the end of the movie, he had an attitude "so what?" Of all of them. A stronger direction in the development of the character would have made this movie great, but as it is, it's just something like that.
