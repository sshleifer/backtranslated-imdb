B movie at the best. The sound effects are pretty good. Licks concept, decent execution. I guess it's a rental. <br /> <br /> "You put some olive oil in your mouth to save yourself from the poison, give the cut of the bite and suck the poisen.You'll be fine, Tommy." <Br /> <br /> "You stay on the phone, when Agent Harris calls you, call me!" "Give me a fire extinguisher." <br /> <br /> "Weapons: we need weapons, where are the cutlery, all we have is this, Sporks !?" <br /> <br /> Dr. Price is the expert snake. <br /> <br /> The local ERs can handle the occasional snakebite. Alert each ER in the tri-city area.
