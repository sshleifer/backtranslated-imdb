The screenplay for this television soap opera is so bad that even A. Hopkins at some point had to play as a undergraduate drama student to bring some life to his dead script character. I do not know if this was the director's purpose, but Hopkins' Ciano only reeked of vanity, fear and lack of self-esteem. The real Ciano was possibly all that, but then, why make a movie about him? Mussolini was a bit more convincing, and his way down was as if he were closer to the truth. Edda Mussolini was simply ridiculous (not for Sarand√≥n, but for the impotent script), while she had to be the central character of this supposed family drama. Watch it only if you like the Venezuelan soap opera.
