I am the kind of person who always goes to the horror section 2 when I'm choosing a movie, so I chose five in the eyes, I was disgusted with this movie and I thought there was not a story and no point where you could enjoy it. My skin crawled at the thought that people like to watch movies that only foment violence because it was a low budget and very rubbish! I think I could have done better myself. I think it was the worst movie I've ever seen and I should not bother watching it. The actors were nonsense. The camera was horrible. The image was bad and the sound was not up to par. I think it was a bit. A bit like a cheep rip from the packer that projects and has not worked at all was a fault.
