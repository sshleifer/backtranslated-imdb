As a Southern Baptist, it hurts me that I must award a below-average grade to an openly Christian film. Certainly, there are not so many that I want to discourage the filmmakers of a genre that is terribly underexploited. However, I must honestly say that "Love's Periding Joy" is a typically low budget, low profile and consciously Christian movie. The plot is predictable, the acting mediocre (I'm being nice) and the atrocious editing. As a television movie, it could have been slightly above average, but as a feature film it leaves a lot to be desired. Keep trying guys You have to have a movie about real Christians inside of you somewhere. May I suggest you look for G. K. Chesterton or C. S. Lewis to inspire you?
