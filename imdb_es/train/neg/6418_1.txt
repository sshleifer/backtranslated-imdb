Let me start by saying that I am not a fan of horror movies. I never see them. <br /> <br /> Let me tell you about my experience ... <br /> <br /> The only reason I saw this movie was because my girlfriend and her friends wanted to see her one more time. Happy Feet <br /> <br /> ... I've never seen Happy Feet, but I'm sure it's better than this ... movie? Anyway, we did not expect it to be good ... we really went in just to laugh at that. Fantastic with me ... I have a problem with ruining the movie for other people in the theater, but as only other couples talked and kissed, it did not matter. <br /> <br /> After 15 minutes, the 2 other people left to go to Borat, a movie that I would have gladly seen again about this. The movie was not scary, and it was not stupid, so it would be funny ... it was just boring. It was not terrible like "Baby Genuises", it was terrible like ... not entertaining everyone. Avoid. <br /> <br /> Now I'm not an expert, but it seems that the problem with the horror industry these days is that you can have a horror PG-13 that is boring and not scary, or you can have an R Una Terrible horror movie that is too bloody or too disgusting for people. <br /> <br /> Do you want a horror PG-13 that stinks but is fun? See "The grudge". Avoid this movie like the plague ... because it can literally bore you to death. <br /> <br /> 0/10
