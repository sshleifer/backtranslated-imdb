I am very surprised by the positive comments because four of us saw this in a screening and we all went out. Personally, we felt it was painfully slow to watch and could not sit for the entire movie. And we really try to continue with that. In particular, those in the group who really wanted to like it because of their personal experiences with alienation because of sexual orientation in the school years described did not like or identify with it at all. :( <br /> <br /> That said, it's great to see that this movie really resonates with a lot of people here on the boards and with the critics.That's the beauty of the film's subjective art form. :)
