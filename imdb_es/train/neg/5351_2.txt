If you liked the first two movies, I'm sorry to tell you that you're not going to like this one. This is the really unnecessary and unnecessary sequel to the video, probably the sequel to TV. The still idiot but kind scientist Wayne Szalinski (Rick Moranis) still lives with his family and has his own company, Szalinski Inc. Unfortunately, his wife wants to get rid of a statue, Wayne is so stupid that he shrinks with his statue and himself. his brother. Then he also shrinks his wife and sister-in-law. Now adults have to find a way to make the children of the house grow. More or less a repetition of the other two with only one or two new things, for example. a roller coaster of toy cars, swim in immersion, etc. Pretty poor!
