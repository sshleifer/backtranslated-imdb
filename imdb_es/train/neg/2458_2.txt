I can not describe how terrible this movie is. Am I the only one here who finds the way his animation is totally disgusting? The Men of Rohan look 100% fake with their hair of poor colors, which do not even look like what the actors look like. The orcs looked terrible. Why is gandalf with a bad limp? Why can not they pronounce things correctly? Saruman is not Aruman. There were others that sounded like a terrible pronunciation * sp * of the Tolkiens characters. Everyone is happy that the study that did this disconnected him from the sequence, it was just a terrible terrible adaptation. Go see the hobbit cartoon for a better caricature of Tolkiens' work. Hell, even the cartoon version of ROTK is better than this dribble. 2/10
