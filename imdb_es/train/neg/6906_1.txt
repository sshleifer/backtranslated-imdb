This film not only has a bad plot, a bad direction and a terrible performance, but also opens a new meaning to racism. <br /> <br /> In this film the "white" chicks are the whores, "white" boys are the gangsters of Wana-be, and successful (yes, again) the "white" businessmen are disgusting of the bathroom trash <br /> <br /> I wonder what would happen if I did exactly the same movie with the same storyline and script, I only did it about Caucasians. "Dude, it's good to see that you finally stopped dating those black girls." <br /> <br /> No one seems to notice, but look at this movie again and you'll puke at the way they portrayed the new Zealand "white boys". Suddenly, whites are the main cause of gang aggression and take to the streets for a rapid explosion. Only the Samoan girls have a heart, there is no white girl who is not a slut. <br /> <br /> I dislike that they could not make this movie without giving the New Zealand Caucasian community a repulsive profile. If you think I'm overgeneralizing, go see this movie and see what you think of the "white boys". Just because the Samoans choose to call us "white boys" in real life does not mean it's funny. If I said hey black guy, I'll lose my teeth. <br /> <br /> I do not see this movie. Do not waste your money. Do not be racist.
