Possibly the worst movie I've seen. When did Hollywood ever make a successful movie that attacked Republicans? Why do not they learn? The Dixie girls have not done it. These lefties live in their own elite bubble interacting with each other; oblivious to the fact that most of the United States has much more reason than them. <br /> <br /> The best Hollywood productions are not partisan and are rarely political. <br /> <br /> The imitation of Cheney's Dan Akroyd was bad. <br /> <br /> I thought Cussack could have gotten better movies. <br /> <br /> It was not funny.
