Synopsis: a loving couple decides to engage in some extramarital affairs in a flashy car. Then they get stuck (literally) in a compromised position, while that car wanders aimlessly through the countryside until the hapless couples are rescued by the authorities. <br /> <br /> That's it. That is the whole movie. There may have been some dialogue here and there, but nothing comes to mind. It should already be obvious that this movie not only does not make sense, but it is really painful to watch. The fact that they starred in two of the best emerging actors in the UK (one of which is now sadly dead) only adds to the horror. <br /> <br /> Ian Charleson was exceptional in the well-deserved Oscar - Winning 'Chariots of Fire'. Let's remember him for that role and try to pretend that this particular celluloid abomination never happened.
