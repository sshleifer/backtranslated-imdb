I love special effects and witnessing new technologies that make science fiction look real. The special effects of this movie are very good. I've seen most of this movie, since it's been playing on HBO for the past few months. I must admit that I MAY have missed some scenes, but I am generally attracted to movies and have seen some scenes more than once. But every time I see something of "Hollow Man", I feel depressed, almost like a "black cinema". I'm not sure why; Maybe I do not want Kevin Bacon to be evil, and that disappoints me. But I think he is witness to how the implacably evil becomes. In any case, I can recommend this movie for fun (although some parts move slowly), but I do NOT recommend it for young people under 14 (maybe 12, if they are mature).
