Thanks Hollywood Another classic of the movie completely ruined by a cheap, superficial remake, with lots of effects and redundant. The original "Planet of the Apes" was an intelligent film that evokes reflection, with a very clear message. It was a film that focused almost entirely on dialogue, which sounds very boring, but in fact it was very interesting. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this movie seems to have eliminated almost all the dialogues. Instead of a great movie, we get an incredibly stupid two-hour chase movie. The dialogue has been reduced to a mere minimum, the interaction and development of the characters do not exist and most of the time it is extremely difficult to find out what is happening. Instead, we get a lot of meaningless action scenes, some rather oddly marginal phrases and some very empty quasi-intelligent conversations. <br /> <br /> The only thing worth mentioning about this movie is that it looks absolutely fantastic. The makeup of the apes is magnificent, and the sets and backgrounds are also beautiful. However, this does not distract from the fact that "Planet of the Apes (2001)" is a very superficial and simplistic film, full of characters as thin as paper, a stupid dialogue and an almost non-existent plot. Please, Hollywood, stop ruining great movies by turning them into box office successes without meaning. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, the end did NO SENSE OF ANYWHERE. <br /> <br /> * of **** stars, mainly for visuals <br /> <br />
