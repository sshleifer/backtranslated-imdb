Ahh, the boring t.v. Shows and pilots that were slammed in the 70s to do t.v. films! Some examples would be Riding With Death (the most hysterical cheese of the lot), Stranded in Space (confusing and uninteresting), San Francisco International (terribly boring and incredibly confusing), and this tremulous touch of glamor by Quinn Martin. <br /> <br /> Shooting in Hawaii (although you would not know by the external shots), apparently is a failed pilot for a spy show. The real problem is that you do not like most of the characters, including the main character Diamond Head, who seemed to be half asleep throughout the film; his boss, "Aunt Mary", who had a really strange delivery of his lines and his black and white hair, as well as the tan that looked like it had been stuccoed; The girlfriend / partner of Diamnd Head (hell, I do not even remember her name) is a skinny, wooden woman with a flat form of speech that is neither sexy nor interesting; and singing partner Zulu (again, I can not remember the name of his character) that was not bad in small doses. The most interesting person in the whole production was Ian McShane, who sucked like a bad guy but still showed his skills as an actor. While the makeup works that this so-called "chameleon" used to disguise itself were simply ridiculous. I have no idea what he was doing or what he was trying to steal from the laboratory that led him to dress as a South American dictator and a US general. Neither I care. The plot simply was not interesting enough to keep his attention for even ten minutes at a time, not to mention the hour and a half that continues. Just call this one - Hawaii Five No!
