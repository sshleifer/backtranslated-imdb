Chris, an adopted son of a moral family, a loser who works in the school newspaper with Kate (Christine Lakin, from the horrible presentation "Step by Step" of ABC's acclaimed ABC show), discovers that he is simply inherited an empire porn of their biological parents. I lose sight of what true friendship and love is, and blah, blah, some other nonsense. He also has to deal with an uncle who wants control of the family business and a shrewd lawyer (is not it?) A comedy for teenagers a little below average that steals comedies for better teenagers (the opening is just HIGHLY American Pie-esquire), hits you in the head with morale whenever you can, and wastes the only star talent you have (Wayne Newton, Lin Shaye, and if I'm really stretching the word star, Martin Starr from "Freaks and Geeks" , and Justin Berfield from "Malcolm in the middle"). Exactly, it's not bad, but it's far from good. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: some extras are topless <br /> <br /> My rating: C- <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Starz on Demand (available until 29) of September).
