First of all, I would like to say that if I had to honestly rate this film from 1 to 10, then I would give it a -4. It's not that I'm a hard critic, it's just that this movie is SO bad. Everything, from the story to the direction and editing, is horrible. To begin with, the story is not even half decent (you can not wait long, since it is based on a videogame, something that was not aware of entering the film), but the direction and editing did it still worst. The film cuts into uncomfortable points and goes to scenes that have no relation to the previous ones; Some, like a quick sex scene in the middle, do not even make sense to be included in the story, since the characters do not show any feelings between them. You could go into this movie expecting to see a lot of trash on the screen for an hour and a half and you would still be disappointed. Honestly, if you pay to watch this movie, you're wasting your money and, if you do not pay anything, you'll still be wasting an hour and a half of your life. So do yourself a favor and do not look at it.
