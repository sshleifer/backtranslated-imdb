Painful. Dolorosa is the only word to describe this horrible interpretation of a play by Shakespeare so funny and interesting. I gave him a chance, but I was terribly disappointed and could not stop seeing him. For the person who wrote a novel about how wonderful this turn of Much noise was, I pity you and your brain boring. That their pretensions about the young spectators be raised without retribution. Please, do not even bother with this heartbreaking and disgusting excuse for a performance of an acclaimed Shakespeare drama. You will be forced to induce vomiting and you will need a toilet near the TV with which you choose to watch this shit because involuntary defecation will occur.
