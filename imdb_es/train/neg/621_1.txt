Holy @ #% and this movie was still warm and juicy thanks to the pile with which it was made. I tried to see this pile of decomposed waste, but it was easier for me to cut my wrists and remove a handle of the Lysol floor cleaner that withstood more than half of the garbage on my screen. I classify this far below anything I've seen in movies or TV, and that's saying something. I once witnessed cow shit in a field. I watched the steaming pile for an hour and a half, who knows ... it might have moved or something. Well, that was a better spent time than seeing this gut. The performance did not exist, the plot was somewhere other than in this movie. I think I saw a cut seen early in the place where the plot managed to escape and was advancing in the background in the back of an old truck that was heading to Portland in the hope of becoming a shi77er of Steven King. Please tell me that the principal is receiving the medications he desperately needs. It is quite clear that he needs heavy medication and I was willing to pay the necessary money for his investment of the lobotomy. Bah ... I can not give this review the full blow it needs, because nothing so painful can be done justice only with written words. Let me tell you that if you are looking for a movie to hang out with and see this Chilton on the shelf, walk to your car, turn on the engine and then put both fists directly into the fan until you can feel it. Your bones are already vibrating. Make sure you have your wallet in your hand also because you were going to spend the money anyway. You could have the privilege of losing it yourself. <br /> <br /> By the way, I saw it after a "friend" of mine sent his girlfriend so he could see it. He did not come close, she did too. What's worse is that she had to see this $% and @ TWICE thing! I heard they got married and he visits his balls once a month. I hope it was for this movie.
