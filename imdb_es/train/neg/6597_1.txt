This is much worse than those horrible cartoons of Laurel and Hardy of the sixties. They were terrible, but at least they were simple scams of a resurgence of Stan and Ollie. The new audiences had rediscovered the comic genius of the couple and the caricatures were a mind-boggling garbage designed to charge the interest of the children. It was expected. But how do you even try to rationalize this work of ...? I can not even think of a word. I'm sure the creators hoped it would somehow inspire another revival of Laurel and Hardy, but you can not inspire interest in the past with a superficial, nondescript caricature of what made the original so appealing. The Impressionists (I hesitate to call them actors) make an act of Las Vegas and that's where it belongs. The plot is even weaker than those used in the old days, trying to extend the ideas of two reels for a feature. If this movie was someone's first exposure to the REAL Laurel and Hardy, I'm sure the viewer would discard the reputation of the original duo as crazed senility. The only movie I hate more than this is I AM IN YOUR SEVERE. And, you know, these filmmakers basically did the same thing with Stan and Ollie.
