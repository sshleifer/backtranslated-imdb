The views of the Earth that are affirmed in this film have been falsified by NASA recently have been compared with the historical data of the climate for the moment of Apollo 11, and show a good coincidence between the cloud patterns in the video sequence and the actual rain records in the day. <br /> <br /> This would seem to undermine the entire argument in the film that the image of "the whole Earth" is actually a small part of the planet framed by the window of the spacecraft. <br /> <br /> I'm waiting for Bart Sibrel to claim that the historical climate data have been falsified by NASA, although that would undoubtedly involve them in replacing each archived newspaper copy with a weather map. , and those in private hands There is still a problem. <br /> <br /> Ah, one answer: "Trying to discredit this movie by referring to NASA's meteorological data, I would say it's a charming argument, but weak and gullible." What about the rest of the? In the movie? A certain wise man once said something about sifting Mosquitoes and camels that swallowed. Do you somehow feel that maybe this could apply to what you are trying to do here? :-) This movie is replete with irrefutable evidence against the assertion that the United States government once made that missions to the moon were a success, and that man is now a true master of the universe, things are almost never what they seem. Just watch the movie, and I mean you'll see things a little differently than before. " <br /> <br /> First, the meteorological data does not come from NASA, it is international agencies from around the world. Second, meteorological data undermine an important claim in the film. Third, far from being "full of irrefutable evidence", the remaining claims in the film have been completely discredited. Sibrel thought he had a piece of film that was previously secret, so he edited it and added his own interpretation. Unfortunately for him, his film of origin is in the public domain, and the fragments that Sibrel edited contradict his claims.
