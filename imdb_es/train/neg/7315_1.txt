OK, let's go to the point. We have five recent college graduates (they must have graduated in the F word) going to a weekend camp. They meet someone who needs help, but instead of trying to help, they decide to set it on fire. Good group of people Then some of them start to get sick, it must be something in the water in the cabin where they are staying. However, the neighbors seem to be fine. Well, when things start to get very bad, lock one of your colleagues instead of getting help (by the way, try with your neighbor). Some locals do not like it. They chase one at high speed through the forest for many kilometers, until the truck decomposes. Somehow, ten minutes later it appears in the cabin (it is a mystery how you can find it and how you can travel at the speed of light to get there). Another member of the brain surgeon type in the cabin realizes that something is wrong, so he hides in a cave to let this happen. Then he decides the next day to return to the cabin believing that it must be some kind of sanctuary. He's dizzy with relief for having survived (he must have thought it was a 24-hour error). Unfortunately, he meets some not-so-friendly cops. Another couple decides to have sex while the insect that eats meat is doing its magic, and then the women realize that they need to shave their legs (take a lot of sick skin with shaving cream). Anyway, you understand the idea. Nothing makes sense here. These are five people with whom I would not like to be a friend. I was encouraging bacteria that eat meat. Other characters were introduced that were also fun but totally unpleasant as well. 90 minutes of good life wasted here.
