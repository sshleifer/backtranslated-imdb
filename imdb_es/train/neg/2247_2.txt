Kris Kristofferson, at his peak drugged in the mid-70s, is barely able to squeeze the screen along with the huge ego of La Streisand and the feminism of the discount stores. <br /> <br /> None of the characters is really nice; I was so happy when Kristofferson's Ferrari crossed that hill and crashed. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good movie about rock and roll stardom, try _ The Buddy Holly Story_ (made only about a year and a half after this dreck).
