If you were to judge by just the movie, the committee that gave the Pulitzer Prize to the musical stage "A Chorus Line", and the Broadway public that kept the warhorse for 15 years, they were all in heavy narcotics, because a sensation singular this movie certainly NO. <br /> <br /> What anyone who thought Richard Attenborough owned was right for this material completely baffles me, but he makes a musical that deals almost completely with movement, he just sits on the screen like a piece of clay. <br /> <br /> Not happy with the original score the way it was originally written, someone decided that what the film really needed was a new song to give the film a little taste. Therefore, we are attacked with the Oscar nominee (!) "Surprise, Surprise". Well, surprise, surprise, the song sucks, and also the movie. <br /> <br /> Grade: D
