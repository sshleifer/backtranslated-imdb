My God, what a stupid movie! Incredibly cheap with fake special effects (the creature is played by a guy in disguise) and a stupid plot. All the dialogues are incredibly bad and these actors (HA! HA! HA!) ... are just ridiculous. For example, I have never seen characters as annoying as in this scrap (these silly children or a pregnant woman with her husband and many more). All this is great entertainment if you are drunk. Avoid it. I like the plague. I'm drunk? I do not think so ...
