Another horror movie in which a foolish teenager fights with a madman and his supernatural partner who want to take over? Yes, but the fact that this one was from Canada gives it a slightly different feel. "The Brain" has the troublesome teenager Jim Majelewski being subjected to a treatment whose leader turns out to be a cult leader aided by a big ugly "brain". Can Jim stop it? I suppose that since our northern neighbor has achieved everything he has achieved, they have the right to make at least one ridiculous horror movie. But still, they'll probably want to be known for having national medical care and all that. <br /> <br /> The bad guy had a brain. Why not the people who made this movie?
