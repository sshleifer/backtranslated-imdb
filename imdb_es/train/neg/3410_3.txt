Yes, this movie makes the children go to the space camp and it starts well enough, as the children meet and learn the ropes. Then they present Jinx, a robot that could not possibly exist in 1986, since now they have nothing with that kind of artificial intelligence. The child becomes a friend of the robot and the robot returns the child's kindness by shooting him and a group of other children in this camp in outer space with a very limited oxygen supply and radios that do not have the signal to reach the space . This camp is not very fun either, since these children receive real training and the instructors overcome them by failed missions or by not doing things well. Give him a break, they're there for fun, so they do not become astronauts yet, just give them the experience of a space flight, not like a military camp. However, you can see Joaquin Phoenix in a fairly early role. So in the end, a film that tries to be realistic in some areas, but with the introduction of Jinx and other factors, could also make children fight against space aliens over everything that was happening in the movie, like I would have done it. The movie a little more pleasant at least for me. Probably for some others too, who else would like to see Kate Capshaw's face torn apart by a strange super-alien creature.
