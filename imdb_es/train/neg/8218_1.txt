I never finished this movie for a reason, it was scary and that's just acting. I was not even sure what the movie was about, but it did not make much sense and the violence was terrible. I mean, I usually like some nude in a movie (laughs) but I was sick because of what was happening. ALL the characters bothered me and I was full of screams and the camera was shaking in some parts and it looked like a sequel to the blair with a project but without good qualities. This is one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time and I would like to recover my time, please. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, I would not even consider it. (NORTH)
