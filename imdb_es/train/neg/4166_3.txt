Complete waste of time ... This film is not a comedy, it is not a drama, it is not a romance ... not even a teen comedy at least! The story ... it should be a change at one extreme ... but it's so disappointing! When the film has a twist in the end, I hope the change makes the film even better (exp. "Fight Club"), but this change makes it even worse ... When I watch a comedy for teenagers, and no do that very often, I expect bad jokes and a lot of nudity ... The jokes are too bad and there are no nudity ... You only have one ... very handsome, I must admit ... girl, and that's that ! And the whole movie is completely dressed! Acting is bad ... like a series of soaps ... Do not waste your time! There are porn videos with better story and performance! <br /> <br /> (sorry for my bad English)
