As an inspirational director, this film was exciting to watch with the critics in mind. Take with low-end digital camera probably with 35mm adapter for DOF. The editing is good acting decently, the sound effects are not too exaggerated. I would have given him a 7 for an independent film, but the story is not that interesting. It is more on the side of the drama, the character developments than a horror movie. <br /> <br /> It is not for those who want to be scared, scared, mugged, or sit down with popcorn to enjoy. <br /> <Sincerely, this movie would be good if we were still in the 50s. <br /> <br /> This movie is about a family that has a dry field, and that's just that.
