The extravagance of the potential movie, set in the 19th century, could not produce. With renowned actors such as Maggie Smith, Albert Finney and many others, there was no reason for the film to fail. However, the film lacked an ending, had a regrettable excuse for a plot line and collapsed with its continuity. A typical story of a rich girl and a poor boy, reunited by love and destroyed by beauty (or lack of it) and disapproval, has a moving side to the early death of a mother and an absent father. The father, played by Finney, is a disturbed man, who torments his daughter both in life and in death. He believes that his daughter's lack of good looks would ruin her fortune by marrying below her social status. The actors tried in vain to save what was left of the story. Washington Square is a black hole of ruin and destruction, which wastes precious time from those who observe it with sadness. I give this movie a 1 instead of a 0, only because of the actors' attempts. Save yourself, stay away from Washington Square.
