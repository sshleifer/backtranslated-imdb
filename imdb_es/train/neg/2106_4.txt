Bela Lugosi is great as always, but the movie is nothing compared to Dracula. He is probably the only one who played a perfect role in this movie, but not even a legend like Lugosi could save the evil from the idea of ​​this movie and, unlike most nonsensical horror movies, this film does not create very good humor. Even in the worst case, any of Bela's movies is mediocre.
