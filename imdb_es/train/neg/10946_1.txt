"That 'Malcom' show on FOX is really killing ... can not we make our own version?" I speculate and paraphrase, of course, but in our hearts we all know that it is true, and that the only thing NBC added to the 'Malcom' metric was sex. And, boy, they added sex ... <br /> <br /> Tucker, thirteen years old, gets an erection and covers it with his skateboard. Tucker accidentally approaches his aunt in the shower and she accuses him of watching and hitting her. He spies the cute girl in the next house from the window of his room, and she knows that he wants to see her topless, but teases him by smiling and closing the window. And all this is in the pilot. <br /> <br /> Take it from an adult man: a boy's puberty is so crazy about sex and testicles that it's impossible to make it fun for a general audience. The only times someone has approached has been in movies, and you can count them with one hand. So it's no wonder that "Tucker" has the warmth and appeal of a strip club. Did the network really believe that we would like to see children deal with puberty? Is not this why people go to jail? If you doubt the depravity of the program, consider this: 13 episodes were recorded, but NBC canceled it after only 4 episodes aired; Then they made the unprecedented move to "burn" the remaining episodes by transmitting them at MIDNIGHT so that no child could see them. Ironic since the children were originally the target audience. <br /> <br /> In addition to his general bad mood, Tucker presents a voice-over of the main character to shape the poor quality of the writing. Even in 2000 it was horribly outdated, with its incidental music and super sarcasm. I could not like any of the characters to laugh at the jokes and the jokes did not reach exactly one mile per minute ... Shame on NBC for this dirty scam ... they are better than that. <br /> <br /> GRADE: C-
