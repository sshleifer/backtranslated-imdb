After watching this movie on DVD, I saw the trailer. The voice-over describes the film as surreal. Well, there is surrealism, and there is surrealism. <br /> <br /> Actually, only part of the film seemed surreal, but frankly, it was more confusing than surreal. The other unusual images, particularly the dining room scene where everyone is on the floor, were so absurd that they made no sense. I do not care about images that mean nothing, but these scenes seemed irrelevant. <br /> <br /> My impression is that the director was trying to convey Logan's inner monologue. I do not know what else would explain what was happening. Unfortunately, nothing I saw gave me any clue as to what Logan was thinking, what his perspective was or even his emotional state. All he could say was that he was not particularly happy with his physical appearance, and that he was in love with an older child. <br /> <br /> I thought the ending indicated what the relationship between the boys had become, but not much more. The deliberate juxtaposition of ambiguous scenes with those that were simpler seemed more like a police exit than an artistic decision. <br /> <br /> Even so, so tedious and free of content that the movie was for me, it was a definite change of pace. I really liked Madagascar Skin, and I had the feeling that this film aspired to that kind of narrative, and perhaps even to style. He did not even come close. For me there is no doubt about it: this film deserves an A for effort, but a D for execution.
