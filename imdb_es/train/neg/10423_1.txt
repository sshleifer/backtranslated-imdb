so ... it's really sexist, and classist, and I thought that it might not be in the early stages of the movie, like when Stella tells Steven that he would really like to change and start talking the right way and he says She did not change well, she certainly changed her tone, and it seems that the other reviewers followed her example. What at first seems to be a love story is really about social placement and women as sacrificial mothers. The end of the film does not make her a hero, it makes everything sad. and it's sad that people think it makes her a hero. Maybe that's the comment of the movie that people should take away. Positive reception reflects continuing patriarchal currents in social consciousness. disgust
