It's a bad movie, very bad. <br /> <br /> Well, for the people it's a good realistic movie. For me it is not. Life is also predictable, bad, unpleasant, trivial, meaningless, sometimes. Maybe that's the reason why people say that this movie is real. <br /> <br /> Too many commonplaces: you're black, you're a criminal, you're damned and cursed, whatever you do, you'll end up shooting or being shot by someone; Do not let children play with weapons, it could be dangerous; and then there are those who go to church, and then they're fine, very good ... <br /> <br /> Before this, I had not seen such a bad movie. That is perhaps the reason why I never realized how important photography is in itself in a movie. In this, every scene taken during the day, outdoors, is clearly blue and annoying. They did not even care about correcting the color balance. Oh! I have "qualified" more than 300 movies in this database so far, and this (3/10) is the lowest in my history.
