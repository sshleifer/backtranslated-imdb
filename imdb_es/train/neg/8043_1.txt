Normally I do not have problems to get away from a bad movie, however, this was a unique case. This movie was so bad that I actually sat all the time almost praying because I would have a good minute of film to justify the hour and a half that was wasted. Needless to say, I was brutally disappointed. Located in a house on the beach where a group of friends from the university celebrate holidays, this film has numerous problems that make it not worth seeing. First, there are parcel holes open. Secondly, very few of the actors on the C list (I do not even dare to call them B) can act with grief, so any scene that has potential will fail miserably. Third, the pace of the film is very choppy and uncomfortable to watch most of the time, which makes creating suspense difficult, which leads to very few surprises for the audience. Fourth, and most importantly, the ending is completely anti-climate, partly because of how it ends (configuration / who turns out to be the murderer) and partly because the dialogue is simply atrocious. For the credit of the movies, it's the only movie I'll say is the worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen many. <br /> <br /> So, like a bad joke, you would have like you never heard me happier, the next time someone asks you if you want to know a secret, you will shout no, you really do not do it while you run in the opposite direction.
