The worst movie I've seen in a theater. I saw this film at the Austin Film Festival in 2004, and I was surprised that this film was accepted at a festival. It was an interesting premise, and it looked like it could go somewhere, but it crumbled every time it tried to do something. First of all, if you're going to do a musical, find someone with musical talent. the music consisted of a piano playing that sounded like they were playing on a stereo in the room they were filming. the lyrics were terribly written, and when they were not obvious rhymes, they were rhymes that induced moans that showed how far they stretched to try to make this movie work. and you'd think you'd find people who could sing while doing a musical, right? not in this case fortunately, they were half talking / half singing in rhyme most of the time, but when they did it made me tremble. Especially when they tried to sing in harmony. And that only goes to music. Part of the performance was pretty good, but a lot of the dialogue was terrible, as were most of the scenes. obviously they did not have enough coverage in the scenes, or they just had a bad editor, because they constantly jumped on the line and used terrible decisions when cutting the movie. at least the director was willing to admit that nobody wanted the script until they added the hook to turn it into a musical. I hope that investors make sure that someone can write music before making the same mistake again.
