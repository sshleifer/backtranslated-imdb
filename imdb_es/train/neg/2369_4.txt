Sixth getaway for Freddy Krueger in which he has finally managed to kill almost all the young people in Springwood; now he wants to expand his horizons and (** SPOILER **) he needs a family member to be able to do it. <br /> <br /> A failure like a horror movie because it just is not scary. It works better as a dark and dark macabre comedy, to tell the truth. Freddy Krueger has now been stripped of all his ability to calm this spectator. (Too many jokes, that's for sure). The actors are not interesting (except Robert Englund, as always, and an obviously poor Yaphet Kotto) and there are simply too many visual effects. The end is fine, but it does not provide as many sparks as I think one could expect. <br /> <br /> By adding a new twist to the story of the family dream killer, it gives Englund the opportunity to do more makeup. scenes like never before. <br /> <br /> There are cameos that are worth mentioning: a cameo set by the then-couple Roseanne and Tom Arnold that lacks entertainment value, a proper look and feel of veteran hit rocker Alice Cooper, and a fun cameo by Johnny Depp who also recognizes the pop icon he had become. <br /> <br /> Debut in the cinema of Breckin Meyer, who plays Spencer. <br /> <br /> One of the best things about it is the reproduction of key scenes from previous entries during closing credits. <br /> <br /> 4/10
