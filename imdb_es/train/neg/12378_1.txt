Spook creepy and lascivious. The young "Red" wears full-length makeup, shorts and extremely short robe. About 20 minutes passed and I realized that it could be a pedophile's dream come true. The music "upbeat" is very similar to something I would listen to in a strip club. In fact, I think this movie is a joke, it's not a family movie. Brutus, I'm glad I've been watching this with my daughter, I do not want her to think it's normal for families to see porn of almost children together. Very bad, very sad, sold as a family movie, Joey Fatone is probably ashamed to have been in it. And what about publicizing it as "spectacular special effects"? The effects are low budget, horrible gawd.
