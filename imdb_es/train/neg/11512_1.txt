*** WARNING! SPOILERS CONTENT HERE! *** <br /> <br /> This is a semi-autobiographical look at what could happen to Madonna if she were ever stranded on a desert island. There is no challenge for Madonna in this role, and it shows. She's just Madonna playing Madonna, and she can not even understand that. I know what you're saying, you're saying, "How do you know this is what Madonna really is, you've never met her!" Right, I have not, but we all remember "Truth or Dare", is not it? I know Kevin Costner does it. <br /> <br /> You would think, in the year 2002, that Madonna could have learned something, in one way or another, from the ladies of the "crossover" who also made their way through the silver screen. For the love of God, has not Madonna seen "Glitter"? Mariah Carey showed the world of cinema. HOW IT IS DONE! Mariah kicks Madonna's butt on the edge of beauty, talent, presence on screen, charisma, characterization, whatever. All we see from this look at Madonna's world is that she is the only one in it. <br /> <br /> If there's anything to be said about Madonna, it's that she's consistent. When she was a beloved girl on MTV, she established the world of women's fashion in 20 years. Now, in the cinema, she has returned the roles of women to cinema AND to society for 20 years, by glamorizing all the hated, horrible, reprehensible and odious qualities that women have been considered to have imprisoned in them, qualities that have been trying so desperately. proof that they do not really possess. <br /> <br /> *** HERE ARE THE SPOILERS !!! DO NOT READ MORE IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO KNOW ... *** <br /> <br /> This is the only good thing I will say about this movie, and it really impressed me. They did not go for the "Hollywood Final": the character of Madonna lives. In the typical and happy ending of Hollywood, the character of Madonna would have died on the island, and his long-suffering, oppressed and flogged husband would have had the freedom to finally settle down with a good and decent woman, a woman who would be the exact opposite. of his late wife, and both live happily ever after. But in this extremely depressing conclusion, she is rescued, and once again, this poor victim of a husband is once more saddled with his wife demon, and his life will once again become a living hell. <br /> <br /> *** THE SPOILERS COMPLETE ***
