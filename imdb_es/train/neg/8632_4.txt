I'm a big fan of Charlton Heston. He is undoubtedly one of the best actors of all time, but what was he thinking when he made this movie. Normally, if he made a bad movie, he could blame the scriptwriter or the director, but in this case it's all him. The suction of this movie is all his fault. This shows that not even Heston can make a Shakespeare story interesting. I lost 2 and a half hours of my life in this dream festival and I will never recover that time again. This is, by far, the worst Heston movie I've seen. If you are a Shakespeare fan, you may find this film entertaining, but if you do not do it, do not waste time, you will regret it in the long term.
