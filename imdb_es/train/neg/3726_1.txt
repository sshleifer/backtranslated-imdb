I was forced to see this whole series of movies as a child and they told me they were REAL! Talk about child abuse. I would have been less afraid of Dracula or Frankenstein. This series is only good for people who believe in this ridiculous and who want to indoctrinate their children to believe the same. In addition to the obvious problems associated with brainwashing and indoctrination, there is also poor performance, bad writing and BAD "special effects". They are just terrible, terrible movies. Yes, credible (and horrible) for a child, but I can not imagine an adult buying in this shlock. Although, I must say, I would be interested in seeing you today, as an adult. It is possible that they have a certain feeling of midnight movie / worship for them.
