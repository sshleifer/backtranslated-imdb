Hayden Christianson and Jessica Alba, two of my least favorite actors of this century, come together in what is possibly the flattest attempt to remake the already terrible The Butterfly Effect. Awakening is so boring and so uninteresting that you would be better off sleeping. Terrance Howard is still recovering from the diabolical August Rush organizing a decent fight as the sadistic doctor who seems intent on killing Christianson and after seeing his performance, would gladly help him. <br /> <br /> Dawn, still recovering after the Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver Surfer. Naturally, it is disastrous and equally indecipherable as it always was. Only once has she been so brilliant in that she was in the safe hands of master director Robert Rodriguez in Sin City. It could be possible that Jessica Alba is not an actress as poor as most give her credit and it is possible that her acting skills are being reduced by a poor script. If so, that would explain Awake. With a script that would embarrass Plan 9 from outer space. <br /> <br /> Jessica Alba, Hayden Christenson and Terrence Howard star in director / screenwriter Joby Harold for the first time in the suspense and psychology film about a man. who experiences the frightful common surgical phenomenon known as "aesthetic awareness", in which people placed on the operating table remain very aware of what is happening around them despite remaining completely paralyzed and unable to ask for help. When a successful young man (Christenson) goes through the operating room and realizes that the anesthesia has not done his job, the horror begins quickly when his worried wife (Alba) waits anxiously and a terrifying drama unfolds in the operating room. <br /> <br /> Hoping to do for the operating tables what Final Destination did for the planes, this first effort by director Joby Harold revolves around a blood-frosted figure. The sequence of pre-credits tells us that one in every 700 people suffers from a phenomenon known as "anesthetic awareness", where the patient remains conscious but paralyzed during surgery. An unfortunate individual is Clayton Beresford Jr (Hayden Christensen), who is fully awake during a heart transplant ... and can feel every slice. <br /> <br /> Intermittently inventive as he explores his tortured Psyche, Awake fails to inject real terror into his new premise. Spiraling from chilling simplicity to absurd conspiracy, it is hampered by forced turns of Christensen and Jessica Alba. Would you like to have taken a sedative before looking? <br /> <br /> VERDICT: Awake is, in the best of cases, extremely undemanding. A "pull no punch" movie that definitely looked better on paper. As a movie, although it is very generic and extremely derivative. Awake does not manage to inject terror in its novel premise. The final result is quite bad. Alba and Christian are the least of your worries, since the main flaw of the film lies in its inability to scare the audience. Awake is a movie that you probably sleep with.
