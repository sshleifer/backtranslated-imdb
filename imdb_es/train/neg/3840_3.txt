A while ago, a friend of mine had heard about this movie and recently she got it on DVD. There was a lot of anticipation and excitement, since we both had heard that this was a terrifying movie, really terrifying. How disappointed? VERY!!!! Apart from that scene (we all know what part) NOTHING happened! I expected to see the woman in black a few times and that she would do some more exciting scenes, like showing up at the window or walking down the hall or something like that. <br /> <br /> Almost all the reviews here say What a terrifying, exciting and atmospheric film this is. I just did not see it, I'm scared. Maybe there is a difference in what people fear in the United States than in Britain. <br /> <br /> A big disappointment after all the criticism :(
