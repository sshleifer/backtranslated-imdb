Even though an animated movie really bored everyone with less than 6 years. <br /> <br /> As an adult who grew up in an area with wild horses and Native Americans, he felt that this was a combination of PC mixed with too many fantasy movies created by people who never lived in the area they shot. Talk to those who have lived on horseback, most treat their animals as family members, regardless of origin. Regardless of the background, we have dealt with good and bad breaks of wild horses. I had to explain that it was a real life problem for us, since the filmmakers saw the children who were surprised to see how PC showed a different world from the one they really knew. <br /> <br /> The normal Disney or Dreamworks view of the cute talking animals that burn the screen was nice from the point of view of the previous viewer. But if you live in an area similar to the one shown, you may end up answering questions.
