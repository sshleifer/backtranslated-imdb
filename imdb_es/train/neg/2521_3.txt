There are a number of problems with this movie, but the bottom line is that he tried to do too much with too little. The base story is pretty good, but the money just was not there to do justice to the story. The nonexistent budget really killed this movie. Stuart Gordon (the writer / director) has credit for writing in 'Honey, I Shrunk the Kids', which was a blockbuster hit. However, that movie had a serious cash backing from Disney. Honestly, this is a good example of when not to make a movie. If I had waited a few more years, technology would have cheapened the realization of many of the effects. (Not to mention that he could have found a company with money).
