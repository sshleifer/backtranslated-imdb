We can start with the woodwork but this movie is a disaster. Having grown up in New York, I can tell you that this movie is an insult to anyone who is familiar with the community or the people. No way, I'm not even an advocate of culture and I discovered that it was a piece of Hollywood junk that fit their own fictitious and ridiculous presentation of culture and language that anyone who sees Seinfeld knows that it's inaccurate. This is a colossal waste of time and, what is worse, it is not exactly interesting, since the result is obvious and the scenes of confrontation are ridiculously bad. Who acts in this way? No one. <br /> <br /> The writer's name sounds like an Israeli or something, but it is clear that he has no idea about the subject he is writing about. Looking at his biography, it is surprising that he lived in New York and wondered how much real connection he had with the community. Even mediocre movies like "A Stranger Among Us" are better and closer to the truth than this dreck. Reading the credits of this type is not surprising that he has written scripts in all the films of grade C that somehow have stars. shocking. Maybe he knows someone because this script is even below average for a bad movie by Dolph Lundgren.
