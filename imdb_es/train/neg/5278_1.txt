When a comedy movie flaunts its wonderful soundtrack on the back cover, you know it's not a top-notch movie. I rented this movie with friends who expected to have some giggles, but in general to get most of our laughs from each other by mocking the movie. We could not have chosen a worse movie. <br /> <br /> The movie could have been fine with some changes. First, the comedy was painful. The physical gags were poorly made and placed. The fat kid in the movie made us want to kill us, bless him for trying out the scene and scene, but he was like a puppy asking for love. If they had taken it out of the movie, everything could have been bearable. There were some funny jokes, I think one of them was when the group of guys stole one of the parents' porn movies and it turned out to be gay porn. But to summarize the comedy better, I will simply tell you the initial gag for the fat kid. He wears a shirt stained with vomit and talks about not knowing when something is done. <br /> <br /> To finish, the movie editor could have saved the movie by eliminating the fat kid, eliminating 20 minutes of the movie. Scenes from the school and make an end of more than thirty seconds of random disputes. <br /> <br /> Oh, by the way, there are two good elements that the movie owns. Kadeem Hardison plays his role beautifully and makes jokes so that no one gets lost or underestimated. The other redeeming element of the film is the beautiful Mrs. Ali Landry. His character is ignored most of the movie, which is a shame. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time even when renting this one. I was not attracted and I was part of the target audience (18 men).
