Since I started visiting this site, and I voted for movies, I have never given a movie a grade of 1. Even the disturbing "Dance! Workout with Barbie" got a 2. There is a reason for this. <br /> <br /> Every time I find myself seeing what I think is a really bad movie, I have to stop and ask myself the following question: "Is this movie really as bad as the horrible soul-sucking beast that is 'Theodore Rex'? "And I've never been able to answer" yes ". <br /> <br /> I would give anything within reason to know what the nut said "Hey! Let's redo 'Blade Runner' with Barney in the Harrison Ford Role!" and decided it was a good idea to spend the time and money to dedicate it to filming. Also, I want to know what kind of market they would sell this if they had not straightened out with the video. This is that weird monster: a movie that is too violent for children and too stupid for adults. I was wondering "what were you THINKING?" but in this case, it could be really redundant. <br /> <br /> Anyway, all you need to know is that you should only expose yourself to this monstrosity if you are one of the five or six rabid fans of "Howard the Duck", or if you are curious to see the movie of Evil Insane of all time, or if you really want to punish yourself.
