Okay, I went into this movie and I did not expect much. I thought of an action movie similar to The Fast and the Furious. Some pretty cars, some pretty girls, something like a decent plot. Unfortunately, I must say that this was probably the worst movie I've seen this year. Do not get me wrong, the cars were fine and the girls were fine, but the way they put the film together was just bullshit. The story never made you worry about the cast and the movie seemed united. So, overall, this movie was not the worst I've ever seen, but if you're looking for a movie for this weekend, I would broadcast it for now.
