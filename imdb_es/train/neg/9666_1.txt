Having seen "Triumph of the Will", I can only say that this film is frightening, even compared to the historically low "standards" of the time. Naturally, everything is totally manufactured and harmful. This is what one would expect from the German propaganda of 1930. Unfortunately, the quality of the presentation, in itself, is trite and cheap. It is also so blatantly ridiculous that even contemporary Germans must have left the theater wrinkling their noses. In a genre recognized for its attractive base, its lack of originality and its lack of apology, this film does not even qualify as "bad". It would have to improve significantly to achieve that status!
