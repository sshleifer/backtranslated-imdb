The most surprising thing about this semi-musical ensemble in Berlin in the 1920s is the wonderful photography and editing. It is the first line of First National in these departments. The story is slightly attractive and similar to the plots of the other two Miller movies (SUNNY, SALLY), in which the working girl is in love with a rich boy with family disapproval, complications and definitive problems. All four musical numbers are grouped at the beginning of the film and we go for a long stretch without any additional musical float. Miller sings parts of I THINK OF BABY and repeats DUE TO YOU. Also, NEVER BE BLUE and, THEN, NOT THE FIRST. <br /> <br /> Miller here is very attractive and charming, remember Irene Dunne quite a lot for her form and delivery. Sad does not dance since that is his strong point. SALLY is still his best film, with this second place and poor SUNNY a very inferior sub-champion. His life was tragically truncated by a sinus infection before the days when hospitals and antibiotics made such tragedies preventable. It is worth visiting these movies, however, to see the main star of the twenties Ziegfeld.
