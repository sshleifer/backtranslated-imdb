This was a classic case of something that should never have been. Gloria was now a single mother, her husband had left her because she would not live in a commune with him (he was angry because Reagan had been elected and wanted to turn his back on society). Right at that moment I had problems with the series. Come on, I say to myself, is this the same noble Michael Stivic who countered the right philosophies of Archie Bunker? The series continued, but simply did not have any pizazz. Whatever the impulse that Sally Struthers got from All the Family was gone. Maybe, if the series had been given another name and had been presented as totally independent of All In The Family, it could have worked. Oh, well, that's show.
