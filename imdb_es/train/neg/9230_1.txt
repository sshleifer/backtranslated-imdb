I should rate that title, now that I think about it. The payment is not completely useless. I had the chance to see it twice, and the second time I laughed a lot at the expense of the movie. So I guess it's worth it for that. and it's also worth it for the excruciating pain it caused me on my first visit. As another critic pointed out, this film is trite in every sense of the word. not a single original thought came into this film (which makes the comment below about the originality of the premise completely disconcerting to me). The film is nothing more than a long line of clich√©s that come together and parade like a movie. Definitely not the next Clerks, it is definitely not original, and it is not absolutely "good, clean". The film is an absolute agony for the uninitiated (after seeing it for the first time, the second time it can be quite funny, in an insulting way). As I looked around the theater, it was obvious that almost everyone, except perhaps the elderly, was completely bored or hurt by this movie. During some of the particularly emotional scenes, such as when Nick chews on his mother, the audience actually cringed because it was so badly made. I even heard someone * moan * in the theater, something I had never witnessed before. I do not care where you have the opportunity to see this movie, be it at a film festival, in an independent cinema or anywhere else. Do yourself a favor, skip this movie with a vengeance. unless you're like me and I can not resist the chance to see what the worst movie that has been done could really be.
