So Angela has grown up and received therapy and an operation to turn her into a real-life daughter, instead of the son she was born in, and now she has a job like - wait for him - a camp counselor! How appropriate, right? I know, I love it. Anyway, the first sequel to the Sleepaway Camp franchise obeys all the rules of the aftermath of terror: more blood, more imaginative murders (which are not imaginative, but even more than the original), more nudes, a more elaborate plot , and in general Worse than the original. <br /> <br /> It's entertaining in the same way that the original was, because the characters and cabinets are so ridiculous and so authentically 80 that you can not help but laugh. At one point, a boy asks Angela to leave and she says "I'll call you" and then quickly walks away. The guy says to himself: "How are you going to call me? I do not have a phone!" and then he smells his armpits, wondering what turned it off (it's hair, dude!). <br /> <br /> It is a well-known fact that in the films of the 80s, the murdered teenagers were more often than not being punished by their killer for some kind of bad behavior, usually for being too promiscuous. When I started to get into horror movies and saw the movies on Friday the 13th for the first time in the mid-90s, I did not realize this. I learned it in a film class one or two years later and I was surprised that there was some method for madness. I was quite impressed, not only that the films transmitted some type of message, but morbid, but that really something was thought. <br /> <br /> But not in this movie! At a moment just before Angela kills one of her victims, she says: "Let this be a lesson for you, tell no to drugs!" Very subtle screen writing, guys. On the other hand, dialogue is the most entertaining part of the film. Angela (who, by the way, went through all that therapy and those operations and all those problems to clean up her past and reinvent herself as a normal, well-developed person and then changed her name from Angela to, umm, Angela) says In a moment: "I do not like being the wicked witch of the West, but I know what happens when things get out of control". (People start to be murdered ... by me! HA!) <br /> <br /> Then, later, she demands that one of the counselors, Mare, apologize, to which the girl responds : "I'd rather die!" I'm sorry, Mare, but you really got into that ... <br /> <br /> Two years ago, I was a camp counselor at a sleeping camp, similar to the one described in this movie (except the camp I taught at had more than three children for the 15 or 20 counselors and also had rules, which the movie does not have). This made me notice the great amount of discrepancies in the film of what camping life really is like. <br /> <br /> Although it's fine, you can hardly make a movie like this with many 9-year-old children running, although there were some 10 or 11 year old children killed in this movie. I had not seen that kind of thing much before. <br /> <br /> Definitely in bad taste, even for a cheesy movie of the 80s ...
