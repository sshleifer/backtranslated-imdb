This movie is so bad that it made me want to throw up. Of bad production, a complete zone free of laughter. Why, in the name of god, would you simulate a movie that, to some extent, is a parody (and a very funny one) in its current form? The sets are ridiculous, the effects are so bad that they are not even ridiculous, and they act like a farce. It is a complete mystery why you would even consider seeing this pile of garbage. Once, National Lampoon created Animal House, which people still consider complete and absolutely fun. Now they have been relegated to making television movies like this lump of ****. Name your expletive, and it could be used accurately to describe this movie.
