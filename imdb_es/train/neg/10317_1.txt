Until this new season I have been a big fan of 'Little Mosque'. However, the new season had absolutely RUINED it. <br /> <br /> The new Christian vicar has destroyed all the intention of the show. Always tried to live together to overcome prejudices. The new vicar ruins that premise and shows Christians with a very bad opinion. <br /> <br /> I'm not a Christian or a Muslim, but I loved watching the show and seeing the camaraderie between Amar and the Reverend. No more. <br /> <br /> Just cancel and finish. It is not worth seeing anymore. <br /> <br /> It is possible that it is still saved, but it would be necessary to make many changes. <br /> <br /> Retrieve the old format.
