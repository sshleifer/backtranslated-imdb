Superdome is one of those movies that makes you wonder why it was made. The whole plot refers to someone trying to sabotage the superbowl, and all attempts to stop them. How the careers of Tom Selleck and Donna Mills managed to survive this surpasses me. However, the most frustrating thing was that there was NO FOOTBALL IN EVERYTHING! Avoid this if possible.
