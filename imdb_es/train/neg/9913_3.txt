This is one of those television movies made at a low price where the characters seem to lose all sense. The premise of the story, the kidnapping of a child by the father of the child, is very good. But history simply seems to beg for belief. When the mother is advised not to do anything that you know well, she will do it. It is a little exaggerated and not worth a visit.
