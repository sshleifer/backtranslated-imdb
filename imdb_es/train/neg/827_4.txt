Hot saddles! It is a fight between two separated brothers (Dennis Quaid and Arliss Howard), which can ignite the fire mentally; They face the differences of childhood, with Dippy's interest in love Debra Winger caught in the middle. Director Glenn Gordon Caron (the television kid behind "Moonlighting") stifles the dark textured comedy in Vince Gilligan's script with such an elegant presentation, the film resembles an entry of an overly enthusiastic film student with a subsidy of fifteen million dollars. It has the spiny energy of a great commercial characteristic, but a formless style that reveals nothing of the characters, except their extravagant eccentricities. These are not even characters, they are plot functions. Just released in theaters, the film is a disaster, although strictly as an example of style on the substance, it looks good. Winger is the only standout in a cast that seems genuinely perplexed. * 1/2 of ****
