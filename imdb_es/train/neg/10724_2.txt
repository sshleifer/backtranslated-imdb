This is the perfect example of something great that goes terribly wrong ... therefore, can I advise anyone to see it? Well, I was a little grateful for the fact that I was in the tiff competition (I still can not believe I won) ... and I just stayed until the end because the director was there for a question and answer section ... but that It was also Anything less interesting ... what is it about? Well, the first half (which is worth seeing) has three characters: a prostitute, a musician and some kind of officer. The first two lie about their professions. But the third is the true liar. The second half (do something) another thing ... do not ruin a good night) include some old breasts and drink excessively ... but maybe you'll see it completely different ... the jury tiff (were you drinking vodka?)
