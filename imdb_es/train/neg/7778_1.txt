This has to be the stupidest, stupidest and most delayed monster movie of all time. It's a complete joke that this even came up in the theaters. This is something like seeing the Loch Ness monster in rural America. This movie deserves to be thrown in a toilet and completely forgotten. John Carradine, it's your fault. The people involved in this mound of moronic garbage need to be lobotomized. I waited! Maybe I'm giving them too much credit. I'm sure they were lobotomized before filming. How else can you explain the absolute and total stupidity contained in this garbage can? Do not waste a minute of your life watching this. Do not even waste time sending a review.
