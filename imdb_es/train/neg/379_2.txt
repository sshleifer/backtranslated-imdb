The television guide calls this movie a mystery. What is a mystery to me is how it is possible that a culture that can produce such complex and complex classical music and brilliant mathematics can not produce a single film that would rise above the despicable level of trash that this film represents so perfectly. This is Bollywood at its best / worst moment, I honestly can not tell the difference. Sweet niches, kitsch clich√©s in each level, history, situations, dialogue, music and choreography. To put it bluntly, you must be a delay to enjoy it. I watched him to satisfy my cultural curiosity, but there were times when I had to get away from her, because I could not take it anymore. The only redeeming quality of the film is the exquisite beauty of the leading actresses. <br /> <br />
