The plot of No One Sleeps is not a bad idea, and the subject is quite interesting. But, as we watched this movie, we would say aloud: "These filmmakers take the trouble to find good places, the lighting is good, the makeup and hair are good ... why is the sound so bad?" Throughout the film, the sound was echoy, confusing and much of the dialogue was unintelligible. <br /> <br /> There's a good performance in this movie, and I think Jim Thalman is really a good actor. This story, with some of the same actors, would have been worth doing as a high-budget movie. <br /> <br /> I just can not reiterate enough: if you have a limited budget, devote more to good sound. . Sound is as important a part of a movie as an image, and it's worth doing well. I could have won a 6.
