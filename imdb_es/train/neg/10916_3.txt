For the domestic audiences I can see how they would applaud this movie. For outsiders, without vested interests, it did not make much sense. The Germans were portrayed as incompetent and the Russians as heroes. The supposedly romantic angle was superfluous and a distraction. How a young woman could "love" the lieutenant simply because she had seen him was silly. How could I, as mentioned at the end of the movie, never get married just because of this infatuation? It was impossible for me. I mentioned that the Germans were portrayed as idiots and that was exemplified in the persecution of the swamp. Several hundred German troops advanced, pushing the Russians into the swamp. So the Russians hid and the Germans stopped at the edge of the marsh and stayed there listening. I guess they did not want to get their boots wet, but I'm sure an officer would have ordered 20 or 30 men to enter the water to search the swamp. But that would have ended the story. In addition, the Germans entered the barn where the Russians hid in the attic and did not bother to shoot at the ceiling. In the worst case, some soldier would have tossed a grenade into the attic and would not have climbed a ladder to look. <br /> <br /> I saw some critics who said they cried at the end. I wonder why? You knew that this little band would perish and they were nothing moving in that.
