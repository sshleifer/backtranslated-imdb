That is all. This is the one indicated. This is the worst movie ever made. Forever. It overcomes everything. I have never seen worse things. Remove the trophy and give it to these people ... there is simply no comparison. <br /> <br /> Even three days after seeing this (for some reason, I still do not know why) I can not believe how insanely horrid this movie is / it was very bad. Far from anything that could be considered a movie, a story or anything that should have been created and brought into our existence. <br /> <br /> This made me question whether humans are really placed on this earth to do good. It made me feel disgusted with ourselves and our progress as a species in this universe. This type of film hurts us sincerely as a society. We should be ashamed. I can not really emphasize that our global responsibility as people who live here and create art, is that we need to prevent the creation of these gross distortions of our reality for our own good. It is a shame. I do not know how on earth any of these actors, writers or the director of this film sleeps at night knowing that they had a role in the creation of "Loaded". I do not know what kind of disgusting monsters enjoy watching this kind of movies. <br /> <br /> That said, I love a good "bad" movie. I love Shark Attack 3, I love bad taste, they are HILLS. I tell all my friends to see them because they are "bad". <br /> <br /> But this ....... this crosses the line of "bad guys" in a completely new dimension. This is uncomfortably bad. This is the evil where you know everything that is going to happen, every line, every action, every death, every sequence BEFORE it happens; and not like a second or two before, I mean, after seeing the first 5 minutes before. <br /> <br /> Each cheesy editing "effect" is used brazenly over and over again to a disgusting point. I never really want to see the "drug buzz" effect of the camera "shaky" or the cuts of jumps or abrupt cuts or ANY FANCY CUT EVER. This is meticulously boring, repetitive and simply tortures the audience. <br /> <br /> But ....... and let me be specific here, the most DISTURBING of this movie is that given the production, it seems that a decent amount of money was actually put into this excrement. Personally I will grab the director's shoulders if I ever see him and shake him to submit, demanding that he run home and swallow two gallons of Drain-O or I will do it for him. <br /> <br /> If we ever need a new form of inhuman torture for our prisoners of war abroad, just keep showing them this film in a padded cell again and again. Trust me, I think they will become more extravagant with the methods of suicide after the 72nd time we go through this. <br /> <br /> Stop these films, they are the vilest facets of all of our society. Please. Having. NOW.
