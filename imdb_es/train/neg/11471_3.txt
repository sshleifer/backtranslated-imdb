Is it a coincidence that Orca was made two years after Jaws? Orca is not exactly a "jaw theft", but it is obvious that he tried to take advantage of Jaws' success. First of all, Orca, in my opinion, was a bad movie, not terrible, but definitely not good, average at best. <br /> <br /> The plot is basically a male orca (killer whale) after seeing his mate and his unborn child Killed by a fisherman seeking revenge. I could not bear to see this movie again. The direction of this film is deficient and, compared to Jaws, it seems that the director, the producers and the writers have almost no talent. <br /> <br /> As for the acting, it was very normal and credible, however, the real characters are not at all pleasant The effects were good at the time and the orca images looked pretty good. <br /> <br /> Violence is confusing, bloody and is not recommended for more sensitive people. The music is exaggerated and is very loud, drowning out the sound effects and sometimes irritating. I hated the way they exaggerated the intelligence of the killer whale (orcas do not mate with a single mate as shown in Orca). <br /> <br /> In general, this movie was poor / poor in my opinion, due to the reasons listed above. Some people may appreciate this film more because of the concept of revenge between animals and humans, so I'm not going to criticize this movie and I can understand why some people may like it. <br /> <br /> My rating: 3.5 / 10 (but by your concept possibly a 5/10)
