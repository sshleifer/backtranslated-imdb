This child is pretty bad, but in no way make him the type that beats adults and can thwart experienced thieves at all times. No, he is not so much a brat, since he is a child with serious emotional problems. A good couple that seeks to adopt is trapped by him and, while the husband is a little more willing to give this child the opportunity, the mother is not. Through a strange character of Michael Richards and the always annoying Gilbert Gottfried, you have a pretty bad movie with some laughs here and there. In fact, I prefer the sequel to this movie because I like the fact that they brought Amy Yasbeck back as a more sympathetic character, since there are one or many characters in this movie who are completely unpleasant. Even the child is quite annoying at first in this case, and they also relax it in the sequel. The plot is simple enough, but when the future parents are going to adopt this child they think is great because of the way the orphanage is organizing a party when they leave, they soon realize that they themselves have a little hell . Add to this that this little hell comes into contact with some convict of some kind. I'm not sure about this character, at first I thought he was supposed to be his real father or something. Not quite right, but I'll choose this before that Culkin kid any day of the week.
