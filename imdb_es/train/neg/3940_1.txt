This movie is a joke and Quinton should be ashamed of himself, trying to pass this off as a Modesty Blaise movie. If you have trouble sleeping, then everything means renting this movie. The stick figure they call an actress who is supposed to be Modestia Blaise has to be the most boring person on this planet. Maybe it could be used as a support for hats in the background of a real movie. Five minutes of nothing thanks, whoever invented the fast forward button. If you see this movie, if you can call it that, you can run. I can not help but think that the third country in the world could have used the money wasted on this shit. This movie is boring. The actors are boring. The waste of color is a waste of air they breathe. If you want to see the Mostey Blaise movie, look at what they did in the 60s, maybe what the director should have done.
