I tried to finish this movie three times, but it's horrible. Case in point: Mom and daughter drive to bed and breakfast, mom stops to look for gasoline, crazy gas stations, crazy with her husband, whose B & B owner tries to rape her. She escapes, goes to B & B and, instead of her husband getting angry and wants to call the police, the story continues with a lukewarm behavior on both sides. Wow <br /> <br /> Other deficits of action logic abound. The performance is also lukewarm, and the warning from the next-door neighbor is delivered in a really cheesy, ill-acted moment. <br /> <br /> Moments of intense gore / death unevenly interlaced with lukewarm scenes of time-filling interaction between characters. <br /> <br /> You would have appreciated less focus on the gore, more focus on the mood and the story.
