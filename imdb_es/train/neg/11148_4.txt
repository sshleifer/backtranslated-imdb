This is the best example of low budget, earning what would be a good story. Bring Samaire Armstrong (having seen his work in the OC, I know he can do better), then look for a better script and a better budget. <br /> <br /> The special effects were so bad, and mostly badly generated by computer, that I almost lost myself with the first time the wolf was seen on the screen. And the change (warning!) Of Samaire Armstrong in a werewolf was made by reducing her at the beginning to a bad figure of GCIF before she starts to change (the humans of Final Fantasy, as well as those of Pixar made her laugh , think of the figure as a nude Barbie). Doll). <br /> <br /> The story was interesting, although the idea of ​​the bloodline in werewolves is nothing new. As also entered into the balance between evil, (maybe) not so evil, and the possible end of the human kind if the two lines come together. The secondary plot of a "werewolf lineage book" that affected some of the other characters in a manner similar to a spell was effective, but could have been expanded further to explain what had happened in the past. <br /> <br /> Bring a better script and direction, and I would go back again.
