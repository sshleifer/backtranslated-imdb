The only good thing about the movie is its title. In this case, "Snake On a Plane" is an example of not judging the book by its cover, the title does not say anything about the film. When I went to the theater, I did not expect Citizen Kane, I was waiting for Independence Day, a movie that is pure fun with popcorn, but instead, I got that horrible Roy Liotta movie called "Turbulence". Yes, this is how bad the soap is. . The only thing that makes SOAP better is its title. And it's not even the proper title for the movie, it was not even a "snake" or "plane" look 40 minutes into the movie! What false advertising! If it were not for its title, SOAP would simply be another cheap and unforgettable summer B-grade film. And the R rating? It has to be the most undeserved R-rated movie of all time! The creators of the film only add a few words to make this an R, all the violence remains at the Pg-13 level. Do you know what R is really classified? The superstar rated R Edge! See him in Summerslam instead of spending his money on a snake!
