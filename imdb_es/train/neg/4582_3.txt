If you want to learn the basics of quantum mechanics, spend your $ 9 on a used textbook, not on this movie. I am a little worried that the money I spent is being used to buy Kool-Aid for shipment to Guyana. <br /> <br /> I do not think the directors really had any point of view, but it seems that maybe they were trying to do several things: 1) Science can explain everything we do, which means that our lives are deterministic; 2) Science can not be used to explain everything we do, which means that we have free will; 3) Science is, really great, brother; 4) We are God; 5) The world exists only in our minds; 6) Sarah Norman is a difficult role to follow and 7) here, put this little square of paper in your mouth and you will see some really cool things.
