This movie stunk! They took something from my childhood and they raped him in a dependency! This movie was so bad that I wanted to go home and hold my dvd "Dukes" and cry in a corner. The cast was terrible! It was not "The Dukes", it was Stiffler and Jackass driving a car. When was Chief Hogg evil? When was Rosco a tough guy? They never went! Boss Hogg was greedy and Rosco was an idiot. When Jesse smoked pot? He never did! Now, do not get me wrong, I'm very liberal and there's nothing wrong with a little chiba, but it had no place in this movie! The only good thing about this movie were the advances before the film and the final credits. It was a waste of time and money. Avoid at all costs !!!!!!!!
