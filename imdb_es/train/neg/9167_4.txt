"The Leap Years" is a film adapted from an electronic novel by the Singapore writer Catherine Lim, which became the first novel / novel in Singapore to be sold over the Internet. The film had a tortuous program of postproduction: it was filmed at the beginning of 2005 and it was released at the end of 2005, but only 3 years later appeared on February 29, 2008, leap year. <br /> <br /> Before saying anything, first I must admit that I am not a fan of the romantic genre, so I may be a little predisposed against this movie; I saw it simply because it was a Singaporean production and is available to borrow. in the library of my neighborhood. Here are my two cents in the movie. <br /> <br /> Let's start by saying that apart from KS and Wong Li-Lin from Qi Yu-wu, everyone who is here of the note seems to be a Eurasian. The love interest is an Eurasian (Ananda Everingham), and the trio of friends of Wong are all, er-hem, Eurasians. Does this film perpetuate the stereotype that falling in love and associating with the Eurasians is more "in" than the common Chinese (or the Asian race?) I do not know, it seems that way. Also, everyone in the film speaks with an "angular" mystical accent that does not exist anywhere, certainly not in Singapore. It's the kind of "semi-perfect English" that we would like the authorities to talk about, but that does not exist anywhere, for example, the MTV channel. The effect is that the dialogue of the film sounds forced and forced, not helped by the lack of real blue Singaporeans in the cast. <br /> <br /> The screenwriter seems to be trying too hard to string a phrase after one-liners. After twenty minutes, the "ingenuity" of the film begins to weaken and the film begins to serve its usual plate of clich√©s. <br /> <br /> I guess I did not enjoy the movie because the whole premise of maintaining a romantic relationship for 16 long years seems incredible. <br /> <br /> There are other disbeliefs in the movie. I can not believe that KS (played by Qi Yu-wu) would fall in love with one of Wong's girlfriends. And the scene in which the boyfriend says: "Go, before he changes his mind", has been used in a hundred East Asian TV series (Korean, Chinese, Hong Kong, Taiwanese, etc.) .. . <br /> <br /> So 4 stars for this movie. The production value is fair, and Wong Li-lin does everything possible, but the script has not helped her. Joan Chen has a small part of 15 minutes in the film as the older Wong and is perhaps the best actress of the group, but, hey, her role is simply a cameo. <br /> <br /> If you come across "The Leap Years" in the rental or in the library, you may want to place it in the DVD player out of curiosity, but otherwise, for people who do not exactly enjoy the Romantic genre, you can decide whether to put it aside or not. .
