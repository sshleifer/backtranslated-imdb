Another weak entry of the third season, 'Is there really no beauty?' however, it has at least one key element of the plot that is very different and, as Spock would say, fascinating. The main character is an alien who must be carried in a black box because his appearance is so terrible that it drives humans crazy. It is a pity that the episode can not live up to this incredible premise. Obviously, I think it was a mistake to "show" the extraterrestrial, since its real aspect in no way approximates such a discouraging accumulation; all we get is the standard Star Trek psychedelic light display used for any number of things in different episodes, usually when the ship is going through a magnetic storm or something similar. In any case, Kollos' appearance can at least be tolerated by Mr. Spock, and only if Spock wears a special visor. (For a long time, I thought that the alien's name was 'Carlos', which I thought was funny, but I'm rambling). Spock is required to merge with Kollos at one point so that the alien can drive the Enterprise to safety. This is achieved, but when Spock / Kollos return to end the mental fusion, Spock forgets his viewer. UH oh He goes crazy but finally recovers with the help of Kollos' assistant, a blind woman with psychic powers. This could have been a really strange and excellent episode, but it is misdirected and appears as a most poorly executed show of the series from last season.
