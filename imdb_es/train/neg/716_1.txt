This movie is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. There is absolutely no story, the gags are only for those who are left behind and there is absolutely nothing else that makes it worthwhile to watch this movie. Throughout the film, Fredi (oh my God, what a funny name, ha ha) does not ask himself once how he came from an airplane to Middle-earth. There are a lot of stupid and totally unfunny characters whose names should sound funny. eg: Gandalf is called Almghandi, Sam is called Pupsi ... and so on. I did not even smile once during the whole movie. The gags seem to be made by people whose IQ is negative. If you laugh when someone's coat is stuck in the door (this happens about 5 times), then this movie may be for you. Another fun scene: try to guess the key word for a closed door (do not ask why, never ask "why" in this movie) and the key word is (ha ha): manure. So if you laugh at these examples, you would like this movie. For everyone else: go to YouTube and watch "The Lord of Weeds": it's much more fun.
