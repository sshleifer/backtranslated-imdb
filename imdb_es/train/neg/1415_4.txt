I had great expectations for this indie after having examined the many positive comments. Then ... <br /> <br /> Here are my 'two cents' in addition to the one published, excellent 'lost in translation'. Premise: Morgan is 'stuck' in a dusty little town where he meets the lovely Scarlet who works at the local supermarket. Can Morgan help raise the lovely Scarlet of her life from the trash of the trailer? <br /> <br /> Realistic dialogue? DO NOT. What about shopping at Target. First, Freeman looks inside the Target as if he had entered Harrods. Then, it has fallen on a shelf for shirts, which confirms that it has NEVER been in any store visited by the charming Scarlet. Morgan detaches herself from all aspects of Scarlet's reality and is shown as cheerful in her ignorance of everyone and everything in Scarlet's life. <br /> <br /> A car in this case, requires that she physically attack her ex-husband. Is Freeman running in his defense ... now ... he's cowering in disbelief and totally incapable of dealing with such a forceful aspect of his very real, I'm so sorry in life. <br /> <br /> Freeman's character believes that a car wash and a tight-fitting new blouse is the key to Scarlet's job interview. Another sign that Freeman is CLUELESS. The endless 'talk of the stage' of Freeman, where all aspects of the reality of Scarlet are reduced to one or the other, the experience of Freeman related to the stage was irritating. <br /> <br /> Freeman is right to emphasize that Scarlet is young with her future ahead and then conveniently ignores the brick walls she faces in front of: uneducated, unskilled and white-collar experience, VERY POOR, no Supporting family and a lifetime of low self-esteem. Freeman learns lessons from Freeman's life like: Some people pay $ 100 for a shirt and a revealing blouse can open doors instead of their lack of education and white-collar job skills. In the end, Freeman offers Scarlet little more than a weird fun with a "star", without even paying for the gas of Scarlet's night. Go back to your life unchanged in a city whose name Freeman worries about not knowing.
