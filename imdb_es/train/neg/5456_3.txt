This is just one more of those horrible movies found on Lifetime TV that show the abominable behavior of a disgusting woman empathetically. Along with other unpleasant films like "The Burning Bed", "Enough" or "Monster", this film takes an unpleasant criminal and tries to show the viewer why he is not such a bad person after all. Give us a break! Here is my question for the filmmakers: if LeTourneau were a man and Vili were a 12-year-old girl, would you have taken a picture that sympathizes and empathizes with this person? Answer: No, hell. <br /> <br /> Imagine changing gender in this movie, and then you will see why I and others here consider this a worthless piece of junk. If the genders were changed, there would be no attempt to empathize with the criminal. Instead, they will probably treat us with a representation of a monstrous and horrible man who takes advantage of a girl, his lewd behavior takes him to jail and his brainwashed victim who suffers from the Stockholm syndrome. The only reason why LeTourneau does not receive the same treatment in this movie is by virtue of his sex. <br /> <br /> Let's call shovel by sword. LeTourneau is a pedophile. Plain and simple. No ifs, ands, or buts. She is a criminal who belongs to prison and deserves our mockery and contempt, but certainly not our compassion or compassion.
