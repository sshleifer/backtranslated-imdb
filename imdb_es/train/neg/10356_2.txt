(This may be a bit on the spoilerish side) I would like to start by saying that I did not see the whole movie, nor could I because it was not obvious that I would be incredibly disappointed from the first hour from the first hour. Of course, that's the problem with taking, what many believe is an incredible book, and turning it into a Disney Made-for-TV movie. <br /> <br /> A wrinkle in time should have become an incredible movie a long time ago. It has a great story that could hook children and adults. In addition, it has built-in quality sequelae. But Disney-fying was not the way to go. The problem with the film is that all the things that changed to turn it into a visual story silenced the wonderfulness of the book. It is a complicated and emotional story for children. There was no reason for Charles Wallace to be purely "psychic," because that was the easiest way to explain it. There was no reason to write a fight between the three Mrs. W as additional tension, without that there is enough tension in the story. There was no reason to take off Meg's glasses ... which deprived us of what could have been a very sweet scene between Calvin and Meg that happens in the book. <br /> <br /> I was able to find days for days about little things. , but I also think bigger things, like the art direction was an off. Take, for example, the way they made Camazotz look, with its strangely dark skies. The chilling thing that appears in the book is that Camazotz could be Earth. It looks like the earth. It has people who look human. The skies are blue, the grass is green and there are children playing. But something is a little off. The directors decided to turn Camazotz into a complete complete instead of taking the lesson from the book and applying it to the general direction of the film. The lesson, of course, is that Camazotz could very well be Earth, that is, if we forget how to love. It would have been much more spooky to have a beautiful afternoon as they walk down the street with the kids bouncing their balls at the same pace. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately I did not see the end. Maybe someone can tell me how Disney ruined the end too. <br /> <br /> In general, an artistic disappointment. <br /> <br />
