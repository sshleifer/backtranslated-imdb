This is possibly one of the worst movies of giant killer animals I've seen in my life. It follows the typical premise of a laboratory experiment that went awry and a giant crocodile with a rapidly growing chemical escapes. The monster looks a lot like a dinosaur, with large rear legs like Tyrannosaurus, when it should look like a large crocodile. Everything about this film is not original and constantly oozes "clich√©", minute by minute. Why are there always two drunken redneck hunters out of the darkness separating? In addition, there is always a boy and a girl who share a loving and obvious love interest while in life threatening situations. I've already said a lot for myself and I feel like I'm wasting my time writing this ...
