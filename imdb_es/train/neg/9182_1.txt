As all the others have said, the performance is horrible, there is no history or anything, it is a bad direction. About the SFX, the 360-degree dot-style shooting, 1 shot is stupid enough, but for each character. I mean, give me a break. And what about all those videogame scenes, just to remind us that it's a "videogame adaptation"? Jesus, you should have fired whoever you thought of this idea. <br /> <br /> 0.00001 / 10
