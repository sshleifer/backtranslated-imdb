I should have trusted my instincts better: no expectations, no disappointments. However, instead, I expected to experience a similar masterpiece like Koyaanisqatsi (1983) and I felt brutally disappointed. In my opinion, Powaqqatsi is nothing more than a cheap attempt to capitalize on the cult success of his predecessor and, artistically, it fails miserably. It seems that some producers collected excess material from Koyaanisqatsi, threw it hastily, put it all in slow motion and obtained some pop artist under the pseudonym of Philip Glass to put together some banal background music, which is repeated incessantly. Where Koyaanisqatsi entertains the viewer with smart changes of slow and fast motion, Powaqqatsi is a long sequence of mundane images in slow motion (if you see them in your VCR in quick preview mode, you will see what I mean). However, what disappointed me most was the soundtrack of Philip Glass. I could not, and still can not, believe that these commercial-type New Age drones, which could easily have been composed in an afternoon by any 14-year-old child on a Casio calculator, were from the same composer who, therefore, composed Brightly emotional music and perfectly synchronized for Koyaanisqatsi. In short, a great waste of time! My advice: Forget about commercialism! Look at Koyaanisqatsi again in his place!
