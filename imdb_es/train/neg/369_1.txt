I almost called HBO and asked him to give me back the money of the month just because they had broadcast this movie. I can just see the executives of the movie saying: "Okay, we should come up with something that is like Home alone, we will just add a lot of money to the child, we will hire actors at reduced prices, and oh yes, we will do it much less fun! "<br /> <br /> Well, maybe it's not the last part, but that's basically what you have here. It's not even worth seeing if someone else rents it. And as a movie for children? Forget this. I would not let my children see this, not necessarily because of bad taste jokes, but because I would not want them to say: "What were you thinking about showing us that piece of garbage, dad? !!!"
