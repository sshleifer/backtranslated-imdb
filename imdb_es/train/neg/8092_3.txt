The satirical novel of Tom Wolfe's life, brilliantly observed among New York snobberies, looks bright here, but nevertheless it is not well served. The film suffers not only from the mistreatment of every man Tom Hanks as an indifferent Yuppie, the Kewpie doll Melanie Griffith as a southern manipulative beauty and Bruce Willis (?!) As the pampered child of New York literati. The most serious miscegenation was in the director's chair. Robert Altman could have given life to these unpleasant characters and made them interesting, but Brian De Palma, for all his visual sophistication, has never had an eye for the nuances of human experience. The resulting film looks good, but it seems blah to its theme of dehumanization in favor of status. Honestly, if a satire does not make the viewer angry, what is the point?
