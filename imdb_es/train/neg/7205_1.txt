If you enjoy watching what must have started as a 2 hour movie in uncontrollable uncontrollable explosions, you will love this movie. Otherwise, you will simply wonder how they could have made a movie of this type from something as easy to translate to the big screen as the Inspector Gadget. <br /> <br /> In the previews of the movie, many scenes were shown that were not in the movie, and within the movie, some scenes simply do not make sense. While the movie is a little less than an hour and a half, I can only think of a truly memorable moment, and it's just before or during the credits! <br /> <br />
