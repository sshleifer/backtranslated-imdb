Critics mentioned it to death when, honestly, it's not so good. Of course, "CHAOS" and "INSIDE MAN" are literally the same movie, only with variations in suspense. But I found "CHAOS" more enjoyable because it was a bit fast like the stupid movie "Swordfish". The reason why this film is more popular is because it was released in the United States and "Chaos" was broadcast worldwide at film festivals and foreign theaters, but it has yet to find a distributor in the United Kingdom and the United States. <br /> <br /> It's true that this film does a lot of homage to classic movies like DOG DAY AFTERNOON and other Spike Lee movies, but that does not mean it's a nice movie to watch. <br /> <br /> See if there's nothing else on TV, but you'll probably get bored after a while.
