Last night I stayed up late at night watching this thing. The only thing that could say good about this horrible movie is that it could be used by film schools to show how not to make a film. There is no proper character development, wait, I'm not even sure they were characters. The configurations were very complicated and the excessive use of split screens was wasted, since sometimes they could not even be synchronized with alternative shots. If I could give you a grade of zero or less, I would. Unfortunately, it's not even worth spending time to laugh. <br /> <br /> It's just a sad example of money wasted by Hollywood, and now I'm wasting my time thinking about it.
