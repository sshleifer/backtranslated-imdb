I saw it with my mother and we were like ... <br /> <br /> What the hell? We do not get it at all. I may be wrong, but a chair had something to do with the death of this woman's father. That movie was terrible! This is not a movie for those who love a good thriller. Bad thriller! * shake the cane in the movie * I will never see it again. And I'm also a big fan of movies for life! They need to stop trying to make films out of books. I'm going crazy! <br /> <br /> And Whit was very ugly and yet, she loves him more than Hugh, who looked a little bit nicer. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/10
