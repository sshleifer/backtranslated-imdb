Undoubtedly, one of the most embarrassing productions of the 1970s, it seems that GAOTS really REALLY wants to be something important. The tragic truth is that it lacks value at all levels and that one can not help but laugh. Reaching despair over the earthly elements of Ingmar Bergman's films, the day of a couple of cities in the desert continues ... they walk a somber path, all while pontificating as an American. Berkeley coffee hit. Almost all the lines of tarradiddle dialogues that are offered here are terribly bad ("I feel that life itself is composed of as many small compartments as this pomegranate ... but is it so beautiful?") After what seems like an eternity of absolutely nothing. happening (well ... it's okay ... we are treated with a bit of nudity and a scene of soft and warm sex), finally there is a VERY anticlimatic confrontation involving a couple of Nam veterans who are doing the scene of the nature and performing fairly hard folk ballads With an acoustic guitar. <br /> <br /> Nothing happens at all or interesting in this whole movie. I thought that the Larry Buchanan image "Strawberries need rain" was a weak example of a tribute from Bergman. "Golden apples" is equally bad, but the incessant random verbiage that makes it memorable. 1/10
