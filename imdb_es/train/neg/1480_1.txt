He took the guys the guts out of his ass! That's a parody, right? Nobody really writes that it just happens as if the improvisation went horribly wrong. I think somehow. This movie must be a parody because who would say that they wrote that script in another way? Can anyone imagine the entire cast sitting while the director and the writers review the storyboard? <br /> <br /> The director says: "Next, our inbreeding villain uses his 24-inch machete to untangle our creepy token neighbor, to take the casings out of his well" <br /> <br /> "Brilliant!" The entire cast proclaims it. <br /> <br /> In no way can that happen, nobody writes so stupidly! I have to be a parody. <br /> <br /> I loved the part where the thin, introspective galley defeats the madness of inbreeding with the cast-iron skillet it finds on the floor of the cave. He was not sure that the types of blood cannibals bothered to cook much. Maybe that explains why the pan was lying on the ground in the dark at just the right time to kill the malformed hulk. It seems ironic that after the strange boy had outdone the porn queens of martial arts experts and a pair of door-type fanatics, he falls so easily into the pan of a thin, helpless girl next door. <br /> <br /> What the hell is the boy Richard Greco doing in this? Did you fire your agent or something? <br /> <br /> Can someone explain the end to me please because I did not understand it either? I can not understand why the good hero girl wanted to kill the funny lady who was making her some tea. It does not matter, I do not want to know.
