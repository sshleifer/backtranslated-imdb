I think I've seen all the Grisham movies now and, in general, they're all very poor, except The Rainmaker, but this one is so bad that it's amazing. <br /> <br /> WARNING SPOILERISH <br /> <br /> It's one of those movies where the character does the great irrational things that nobody would do. He is a lawyer for the love of God. Why does not he call the police when his children disappear? Oh, yes, it's because all the cops hate the lawyers, so they just ignore it and let it attack. <br /> <br /> When they arrest him for murder, they release him, they lock him in a cell. Waiting for a bail hearing. <br /> <br /> Why would you drag your children to the middle of the country when you could easily protect them at home? <br /> <br /> The police do not bother trying to find an escaped mental patient, they do not bother to interview their daughter. <br /> <br /> As for the ridiculous ending ?? <br /> <br /> In short, silly, very unrealistic and a complete waste of time. <br /> <br /> 0/10 ?? One of the worst movies ever made.
