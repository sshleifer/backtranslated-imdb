In the first Howling, we are introduced to a world where werewolves exist and are somewhat organized. The plot in that movie made some sense; A television reporter investigates this and tries to discover the truth. She ends up killing many of them, including her boyfriend, who becomes one of them. Then she shows the world that they exist by transforming themselves into live television. The special effects were just ridiculous in the first movie and do not improve in this one. Be it the transformations, the bad puppets or the cheesy computer graphics that show the superpowers. <br /> <br /> The plot line is not that bad; They must kill the werewolf leader for some reason. This will not destroy all the werewolves and it does not really end with the threat of the werewolves, since ... they just want to kill her. I think there was a murky reason for this, but it really gets lost in the movie. <br /> <br /> After the movie "ends", we have a 10 minute montage of the movie we just watched and each scene is one. where the werewolf leader tore off the top exposing her large breasts while a Devo-esquire band plays for a crowd of werewolves. <br /> <br /> The only thing that makes this movie even visible is Christopher Lee.
