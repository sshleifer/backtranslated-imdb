but Thomas Ian Griffith simply does not have the polish that a very money actor has, since it was made more than 5 years ago. Some of the humorous lines could have been timed to do this not only action, but comedy. And how do you get KC from Katia Koslovska anyway? Plummer's character was so corny, he would have fit better in a Bullwinkle toon. Personally, if the action movies are going to show skin, I would have liked to have seen the same time between women and men, otherwise I will not show any.
