Ah yes, the VS series, MVC2 being the pinnacle. It has been said before, this is what you get when half the crew fell asleep at work, unfortunately half of the game did. Do not get me wrong, this is fun, but you get tired of crushing buttons. Regarding the summary of the plot, AHAHAHAHAHAAAAA ... There is no plot. Beat that guy at the end and win! Hey, who plays this on their own anyway?
