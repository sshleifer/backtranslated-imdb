It has a great name, but that's it, and you will not get more than that for your money, in fact, the first 30-40 minutes of the movie will seem fun, but then the story goes from one side to the other with no particular reason and you simply can not understand what is happening until the action is gone. <br /> <br /> And, nevertheless, the producers (Roberto Angel Salcedo) call him an actor, but I do not think the way he does it is called nothing but overacting !! .... period. The little boy who plays like his son has no sense of acting and I think it was just a favor he did or something like that because he had no idea what he was doing. <br /> <br /> For some reason while doing The casting they thought that by releasing comedians they did it, but they did not! and, sometimes, cheap and tasteless humor is so bad, I do not buy it. <br /> <br /> But I hope this is as bad as possible. To make people accept those DVDs for the tasteful public, they will have to offer some food that could work. <br /> <br /> Maka
