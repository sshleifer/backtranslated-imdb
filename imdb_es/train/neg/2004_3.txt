I read the book a long time ago and I do not remember the plot specifically, but remember that I enjoyed it. Since I'm at home on the couch, it seemed like a good idea and Hey! It is a movie of a lifetime. <br /> <br /> The film is populated by actors and actresses of degree B. <br /> <br /> The female cast is outside of Desperate Housewives. I have never seen the program, but there are many announcements for the program and I understand the essentials. Is there nothing original? Sure, but not Lifetime. <br /> <br /> The male cast has a pretty effeminate look and feel, but girls need husbands, I suppose. <br /> <br /> In one scene, a woman is struggling with a male, for her life, and what does she do ??? He kicks it in the testicles. What else? Women love that, but let me tell the girls something ... It's not as easy as it has always been to look. <br /> <br /> Not everything was bad. I got chills once or twice, so I have to give someone credit with that.
