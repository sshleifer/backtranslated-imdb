['Despite the criticism and positive projections at international festivals, this film is not for everyone. <br /><br /> The story is very similar to other films, in which a teenager from the immigrant family needs to overcome many common personal problems of her age and also fight against the pressure of ethnic traditions in her family. She does that by choosing a type of sport, and with the help of a local child, who for some reason falls in love with her, faces her problems and wins. <br /><br /> In Girlfight it&#39;s boxing, in Bend it as Beckham is football, and now it&#39;s Kung Fu. <br /><br /> But Fighter is a much inferior product than these two, it was simply embarrassing to see it. Semra Turan, the &quot;actress&quot; who plays the role of a teenager, may be able to do many things, but one thing she can not do is act. His presence on the screen is anemic and clumsy, the dramatic situations, in which he tries to show emotions, are terrible, his body and facial language are amateur actress, poorly instructed by the director. The rest of the cast is a bit better, but they just can not keep this clich√© movie with stereotypical characters and shallow plot. In addition to some relatively good moments, this movie has nothing new or interesting to offer. <br /><br /> Even the fight against kung fu is not a reason to see this, it is so boring. The slow motion was really unnecessary, the choreography was basic and lacked inspiration, and most of the kung fu scenes are just training or standing in all kinds of kung fu positions, not fighting. Not to mention how ridiculous it looks when a small, thin girl fights big, muscular guys and knocks them down. <br /><br /> The only reason why this movie has been noticed is because it is European. It is very easy to make this film known: a first martial arts film from Denmark, but do not be fooled, it is not. It&#39;s just a drama about the stupid teenager and her problems, which, by the way, are not really convincing. <br /><br /> Bad movie with shameful lines, acting and history.']
