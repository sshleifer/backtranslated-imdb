I know that John Singleton is an intelligent guy because he made Boyz N The Hood, so how did he write and direct this? It's like the pilot of a bad "going to college for the first time", a parade of boring stereotypes of stereotypes and clich√©s with a bit of gratuitous violence to turn it into a commercial proposal, I suppose. Who would have guessed that the victim of a rape would throw sausages to eat seafood? The angry loner would be prey to a group of neo-Nazis (and he would stay with a black man and a Jew, just to laugh!) Even the creepy reactionary story of Laurence Fishburne. The teacher just pissed me off and I love the boy, it's like everyone involved in this movie just lost the plot. Except Busta Rhymes, of course. Big up.
