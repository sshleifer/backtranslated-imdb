A study in bad. Bad acting, bad music, bad script, bad editing, bad direction and a bad idea. The schlock pieces are not funnier or involuntarily more fun than this ... thing. At the end of the "movie", you're left wondering why they got upset in the first place. Poor Malcolm McDowell, did he lack money or something? Are you still thinking about seeing this? * SPOILERS AHOY *: If you have not died of laughter in the first thirty minutes, when you see the city populated by cyborg called "Cytown", you will. Avoid this, my friends who love the movie. Avoid.
