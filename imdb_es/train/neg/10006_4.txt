I do not know who to blame, the timid writers or the clueless director. It seemed to be one of those movies in which the stars were paid so much (Angie, Charlie, Denise, Rosanna and Jon) that there was not enough to make a movie. This could have been very entertaining, but there was a veil of shyness, even cowardice, that hung over every scene. Since he got an R rating anyway, why was the ubiquitous bubble bath scene filmed with a 70-year-old woman and not Angie Harmon? Why does Sheen walk at night through potentially hot relationships WITH TWO OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND ATTRACTIVE ACTORS in the world? If they were just looking for laughs, why did not they launch Whoopi Goldberg and Judy Tenuta instead? This was so predictable that I was surprised to discover that the director was not five years old. What a waste, not only for the spectators but also for the actors.
