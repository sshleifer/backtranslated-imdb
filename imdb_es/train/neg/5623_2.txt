Hollywood's attempt to turn Jack London's life into an "Jack London" adventure movie is not a bad idea; Certainly, he led an interesting, and sometimes adventurous, life. This film, however, ends up flat and unsatisfactory. Most importantly, it lacks integrity. Michael O'Shea (like London) has some speeches from London; and it's nice to see his bearded Jack receive "The Call of the Wild" after spending a nice moment alone, in the snowy mountains, with his dog, "Buck". Virginia Mayo and Susan Hayward are very nice. The film draws unfortunate parallels of the "yellow danger" between the life of London and the Second World War, which are both tense and insulting. <br /> <br /> ** Jack London (11/24/43) Alfred Santell ~ Michael O'Shea, Susan Hayward, Virginia May
