After the first one, you think the Wayans brothers could make some new jokes. Although I suppose not. If the first one was not bad enough, this one is so bad that it hurts to look. With all the actors that they had in this movie, you think they could come up with something a little smarter. Although they could not, they had to take all the same obscene and not funny jokes of the first and somehow put them into this movie thinking that people would laugh again. Although the thing is that I did not laugh at her the first time. They tried to turn these films into parodies, although they failed at all levels. Most of the time only random jokes are inserted, which are so disgusting and rude that it is difficult to see and enjoy them. Then, when they try to make scenes that are parodies of movies, they end up doing a 20 minute recreation of the scene with maybe a joke inside the whole scene. Also for people who say it is not for the younger and older audience, which fits in the age range for which it is supposed to be fun. While people say that different people have different ideas of what is funny or not, if you find it fun, then you probably are not one of the most mature or intelligent people that exist. It does not take as much skill to write that kind of script, although if you want a smarter and more fun movie, go see the movie Spaceballs. It is a parody of a movie that is really good and well made and did not have to use foul and obscene jokes to make it fun.
