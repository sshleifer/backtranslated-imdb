In an interview, David Duchovny said he has not been able to see even the first hour of this movie, and neither should you. The scene in which he asks the owner of a house where a murder was committed if he can look around: he changes the name he gives and could have raised his performance of almost any episode of the X-Files. It's on autopilot for the whole movie. Brad Pitt comments horribly.
