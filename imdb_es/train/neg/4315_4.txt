Seriously, the only good things about the ceremony this year were the winners. <br /> <br /> Although the ceremony itself was quite short, it was still somewhat boring. I think it's time to look for a new director and producers for the show, who can create something REALLY new. It is quite obvious that they tried to make the show more "modern" and attractive to a younger audience this year by allowing Beyonce to introduce herself and allow P. Diddy and Prince to present a category. Also allowing Chris Rock to be the presenter was an attempt to renew the ceremony and make it more attractive. None of that worked. <br /> <br /> Sure, Chris Rock is a fun guy, but he was not really a good presenter. I really only saw him as a boy who spoke from time to time between the different categories. His presence was not really as "big" as, say, Billy Crystal's. <br /> <br /> Also the delivery of the prizes was quite silly at times. Not letting everyone take the stage, but also delivering some of the prizes in the center of the theater was simply strange. <br /> <br /> However, I do not remember being more satisfied with the prize winners. None of the films really eliminated the prizes, since the last couple of years had always been like that. Does that mean it has been a good year for films with many competitive contestants? I do not think so. I think most of the films will be largely forgotten within 20 years, with the exception of "Million Dollar Baby" and "The Passion of the Christ" maybe. Of course I do not agree with all the awards that were given this year, for example, Caleb Deschanel should have won for the best picture, it's not that I do not like the work of Robert Richardson, he really did an incredible job for most of Oliver Stone I work but I really feel that Deschanel deserved the prize much more. I would also have liked to see Jim Miller and Paul Rubell winning for best edition and John Debney for better music. But hey, there's no way that the Academy Awards can please everyone, of course, I understand. There will always be people complaining about the winners. <br /> <br /> It was also fun to see that most of the award presenters were much more nervous than the nominees and the winners. Did Prince say at the same time any of the names of the nominees? And where is Sean Penn's sense of humor? Al Pacino and Jeremy "I hope they are lost" Irons was the best host of the night. <br /> <br /> In general, it was an unforgettable show but with good winners. <br /> <br /> 4/10
