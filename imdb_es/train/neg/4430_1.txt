Thanks to a boring, dimensionless screenplay by Neil Simon, and Robert Moore's lack of brightness, Chapter Two becomes a shrill showcase for Marsha Mason, who received her third of four Oscar nominations for Chapter Two, which she offers the same performance here as that of Cinnderella Liberty (73), The Goodbye Girl (77), Audrey Rose (78) and Only When I Laugh (81), only this time she does not have a child to drag. Chapter Two is the third and last feature film for Moore who previously directed The Cheap Detective (78) and Murder By Death (76) by Neil Simon. Caan is an error, the characters are one-dimensional, the dialogue is too analytical and there are practically no establishment details. The first half is less than captivating, you find yourself with a cute and shy romance between a spectacled Caan and a Mason chipper, and the second grim half makes you long for the first half. The locations of New York City, as well as Joe Bologna and a painfully thin Valerie Harper are irrelevant, but at least they provide a pleasant distraction. And last and least, a horrible song plays during the credits.
