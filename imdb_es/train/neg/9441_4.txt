This movie was banned in England? why? tom savini, george rosemary, dario argento, lucio fulci and others had done much worse before and have continued like this since ... <br /> <br /> this movie has all the basic elements of a decent horror of the 70s or Early 80's movie. Beautiful girls (who can not act to save their lives, by the way), a terrible thunderstorm with a torrential downpour, a scythe, a crazy brother who roams the family farm, and actually a very good turn at the end. but forbidden? seriously. When the English Parliament banned this film, the Italians probably laughed at the thought of how backward and prudent the British really were. <br /> <br /> There were perhaps two minutes of total screen time devoted to violence and blood (which was very poorly done). There was nudity but not sex, although allusions to sex were made, obviously. but absolutely nothing worthy of being forbidden. <br /> <br /> I would like to see what could have been done if the filmmakers had a decent budget to work with. As it is, the film is entertaining, but the lack of image and sound quality eliminates the final result. <br /> <br /> forbidden ... what a joke ...
