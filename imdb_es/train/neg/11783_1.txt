What a horrible movie! The worst of the worse! This movie is as entertaining as a dead slug. Without talent, what-so-never-actors, stupid plot. Who wrote this script? Was there ever a script for this silly movie or did the director just accidentally press the record button on his camera and then decided to invent the movie as they went along? Is this supposed to be a movie for children or a comedy or what? My younger brother of my friends is in sixth grade and he and his classmates made an amateur movie for their school project that surpassed this geek movie. This is by far the worst movie I've ever seen! There is simply no excuse for this movie!
