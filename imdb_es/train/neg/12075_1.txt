This Hamlet made for one of the most boring MST3000 episodes in history. I'm not a fan of Shakespear, but I do not think he intended his works to be so slow and monotonous. It is also one of the most difficult films to find because there are many Hamlets listed. As I said, although this is pretty boring. It is black and white, the pace is slow and the stage is minimal. The actors are also dubbed, so that does not help. This is the only MST 3000 that I can not see in a single session because the person who plays Hamlet says that his lines can make anyone sleep.
