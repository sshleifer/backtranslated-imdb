I hated the way Mrs. PÃ©rez represented the Puerto Ricans! We are not all ghettos, and we do speak Spanish, not Puerto Ricans! I can not speak for the uneducated people you have encountered. But our language is intact, our island is our pride. Puerto Rico is better economically than any other Caribbean island! Am I happy that we are not like Cuba, the Dominican Republic or Haiti, free of US influence? Free in real poverty, not in the poverty standard of the United States. We are not victims, we are resilient, humble, honest and intelligent people. Our ancestry includes strong African roots, but not "black" roots. I have nothing in common with black Americans (not research). <br /> <br /> The analogy between Pedro Albizu, Che Guevarra and Martin L. King could not be more out of place. <br /> <br /> MLK was a great hero, a true revolutionary, an honest man who saw a day when we would all be free. <br /> <br /> Che Guevarra helped Castro create the Cuba he is today, is that why Cubans full of ships risk their lives to come to the United States, because Che made them a better place? You had a great, brilliant idea, but you copied it too much. We have many things to be proud of as people: do not embarrass our people by victimizing us. I'm not a Nuyorican and maybe that's why I can not share their opinions. I am Puerto Rican, I speak Spanish, I am not a victim and I have achieved many of my goals in the United States. If there is a part 2 in the future: less politics, more history, more stories of triumph, there are many. <br /> <br /> Damaris Maldonado
