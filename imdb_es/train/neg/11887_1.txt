The world may be over. Unfortunately, this film survived as another testimony of Canada's inability to make films that go beyond the execrable. Maybe it's because all of our really good people (Norman Jewison, Martin Short and others) go to Hollywood.) In fact, it's very bad that Short has not been chosen in this overwhelmingly pretentious and banal movie. He could have given her some credibility. The Canadian government should realize, and this movie is a great example, that putting money in the trough does not result in a good movie. If the people who had spent these public funds had to compete, they might have been forced to find something worthwhile. As is the case, they have produced another embarrassing shame.
