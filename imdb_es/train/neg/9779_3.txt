Tirelessly stupid, an "image of war" without a budget, made mainly to show the attributes of the spectacular Eve Meyer (not a bad idea in itself), but that should be a shame for all who are related to it. A "script" that can be laughed at, performances that would not be approved in an elementary school Christmas contest, inept "action" scenes, confusing address of normally competent documentary director Louis Clyde Stoumen, who apparently is not sure if is doing a comedy, a philosophical treatise on the futility of war or a T & A story (in the early sixties, anyway) travel diary of the magnificent body of Eve Meyer, and a general air of poor quality and incompetence. It's worth seeing to see Eve Meyer show her things, but that's it.
