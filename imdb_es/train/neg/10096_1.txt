This movie has to be the worst I've ever seen. The title of the film tricks the public into thinking that there is hope. The story line of the film is laughable at best, with the acting so poor that you just have to tremble. The title 'Zombie Nation' implies a lot of zombies when, in fact, there are six in total. This can not be categorized as a horror movie due to the introduction of the cheesy music of the 80s when the zombies "attack". Zombies really speak and act like human beings in the movie, with the only difference being the makeup that looks like something out of a La Roux video. If you ever have the opportunity to buy this movie, do it and then burn the copy.
