Before watching this movie, check the reviews available on the Internet about the falsification of the film's events, in particular its predictions about the widely accepted fact that 7-8,000 Muslim men were taken out of Srebrenica and shot by Serbian paramilitaries. The documentalist also belongs to several pro-Serbian American organizations. Please watch this movie critically and read the reviews in advance. Most reviews argue that the documentary maker takes his arguments too far, even if he raises questions that point to conventional wisdom regarding the war. A review in the New York Times by Stephen Holden states that it would be "inaccurate to label this documentary as pro-Serbian", but one should question both the presentation of the facts, many of which are taken from reliable sources, such as the omission of those facts that Inculpate the Serbian forces. I do not discourage watching this documentary, but I warn you to examine it with a particularly critical eye (as it should be done at all times).
