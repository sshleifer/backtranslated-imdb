I love movies, and I'll see them until the end, just to give it a try. Finally I can say that I found a movie that I can not watch all the time. The acting is terribly stale and monotonous, the CGI seems that a computer geek did it in his mother's basement with minimal software, and ... the long scenes of ... walking !!! And this movie lasts three hours! I did not even do it for 15 minutes until I quickly re-sent the DVD. The scenes with the aliens are very short. Ummm, instead of naming this "War of the Worlds", let's call it "War of Long Distances Walkers". This costs 5 million dollars to do! What do they spend the money on, the dramatic opening song? <br /> <br /> Oh, but on a positive note, one scene you need to see is when the aliens start killing people. That's funny, not because people are dying, but because when they turn to skeletons, they still twist for 20 seconds afterwards. <br /> <br /> Then, like I said, if you're a bored fan, Obsolete movies, no action, here's one for your DVD collection. But I did not write this for you, I wrote this for the billions and billions of people who will hate this movie. It's not worth your time or your money. <br /> <br /> I know it's because of the book, but the book is not that long, and I'm a worm / nerd / geek / any other complete book, but why? what? ? Just get Steven Spielberg's version, it's not that good, but it's 10 times better than this! <br /> <br /> I give this a GREAT ZERO FAT of 10.
