This movie is amazing. I saw him the other day with my cousin Jay-Jay. He said he was fine, but I think RULEZZZ! I mean, it's so cool. Ted V. Mikels is so brave and intelligent. He made a totally different movie from those terrible Hollywood movies, like Matrix and STop or my Mom will Shoot. Although it could have been better. I like ninjas and pirates. I also like that big claw that the funny man saw. I think he's the coolest guy since that claymation guy from Domino Pizza. This movie not only looks really cool, like the movies out of focus that my father made of my birthday when I turned 6 years old. BUt tells a complex story with dozens of characters that seem to have no relationship, but all are in the end. It's great how this network is woven to make everything come together. I would like Ted V. Mikels to make a sequel. But you need more aliens. And a pirate.
