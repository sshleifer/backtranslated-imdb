This scam of the 1984 hit "Gremlins" is possibly the biggest train crash of a movie ever made. Even for a 'B' grade film, all other cheap horror movies on the same platform totally dwarf this movie in terms of plot, acting and kindness. <br /> <br /> Start with an old security guard at random and the youngest punk security guard whose name does not matter. Why? Because within a few minutes of entering the film, he enters the "forbidden" safe, and dies while living his fantasy of being a rock star in a cheap pub. <br /> <br /> This is just an appetizer for the scandal. -content main course. The main character, KEVIN, fights several times to prove he is more than a total kitten. Maybe it will be successful within the film, but for the public it is shown as nothing more than a bad actor. Kevin gets a job with the former security guard and is guided through his security shift in the abandoned study lot (wait for him). Yes, why bother making a set when you can use the studio? Back to the movie. Kevin somehow opens the forbidden safe and releases the Hobgoblins. The Hobgoblins force people to live out their wildest fantasies and then kill them for some reason. They must be returned before dawn or else ... or else, what? Exactly. <br /> <br /> Other characters include NICK, the "macho" friend of Kevin's army; DAPHNE, the "woman" of Nick, whose character has no more substance than a slut-bitch attitude and costumes worthy of a prostitute. There's AMY, Kevin's "reserved" and manipulative girlfriend, whose deepest desire is apparently an ill-like image of Cher in fishnet stockings with a pair of blue grandma's underpants on top. Do not ask me how it works. Possibly the most entertaining character of all is KYLE. How are such groups of friends made? Kyle is a pervert who can not spend an hour without self-stimulation. Their hobbies include calling sex chat lines from other people's homes and they are most likely sniffing underwear. <br /> <br /> The story unfolds as the heroes look for the Hobgoblins: knee-deep creatures (also known as hand puppets) who, for some reason, try to travel no farther than the borders of the neighborhood local. Each of the characters eventually lives his wildest fantasy that has never anything to do with having millions of dollars ... or the movie with a big budget. <br /> <br /> WARNING THE ADVANCED SPOILERS: The turn at the end of This movie will leave the observer wondering "What?". The Hobgoblins are returned to the safe by ... their own will. Maybe they lost patience waiting for the dawn to wreak havoc, or maybe the writers of the story had a cramp in the writer and decided not to worry about the end. Upon returning to the safe, the old security guard reveals "What he learned in the army" and detonates the explosives that destroy the safe, signaling the end of the evil Hobgoblins and the end of this roller coaster; better equipped for a ride on an escalator. <br /> <br /> The sheer wickedness of this movie is enough to make someone cry. If you plan to see it, I recommend you take some alcoholic beverages beforehand so as not to think about the movie.
