The worst movie ever made! Please see the reviews of real movies of the professionals in this movie. See Rotten Tomatoes on the web to get some good independent reviews about this movie. The comments made on this site are apparently from people with some financial interest in this movie. I find the positive comments very deceptive. I find it incredible how negative comments are so bad in this movie and the positive comments sound like a speech from the Academy Awards. Do not lose your hard earned money !!! This movie is delayed !! I can not believe that a movie like this was ever made. Why would Hollywood waste its time on that garbage? This movie is an attempt at nothing. I wonder what looser would really sink their money producing such garbage. I went to blockbuster and the assistant even told us not to waste our time or money. I did not listen and I lost my time and money. Please, do not make the same mistake! It really is the "worst movie ever made!"
