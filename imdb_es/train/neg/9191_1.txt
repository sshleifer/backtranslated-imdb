Well, I had to sit on the computer and write the review immediately after seeing this puddle of mud. Why? Because I have to let you all know how bad this movie is. It is incredibly bad. Just to inform you how bad it is, I will offer you this little detail about the movie. During scenes of chaos, which generally consist of people shooting or kicking zombies, interspersed scenes of the game. Yes, you heard correctly. This movie really sucks. In fact, it makes me think about the fact that it costs ten dollars these days just to enter theaters these days. And to see corn full of shit like this? There's not a story to talk about and the movie basically has nothing to offer other than the occasional shots and really cheap deaths. I'm really disappointed with this, knowing that I saw it. Ok I'm stupefied It's so bad that I can not even find the words. QUALIFICATION: ZERO of *****.
