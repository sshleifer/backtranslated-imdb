If you saw this movie, you know why I said "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus." Hehehe !!! Every time they said "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus" ... I laughed thinking "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, why did I rent this movie"? I can not believe how the Oscar winners like Freeman and Spacey appeared here in the background while Timberlake and LL Cool J took the screen. WTF is Timberlake? Acting sad I think someone like Joshua Jackson could have done a much better job! This work was perfect for Joshua Jackson and believe me I'm not very funny with him ... but I really prefer an actor, not this android named Timberlake. And his girlfriend was superficial, hollow and annoying as hell. I felt happy when they both went out into the street. <br /> <br /> The story was good and I think Dylan Mc Dermott did his evil role very well. The movie was entertaining, but I think Timberlake ruined everything. It would have been very nice without him. <br /> <br /> By the way, the music was good, but suddenly, every time it appeared, the movie became an MTV video clip with flashes, low movements and things like that. . Something wrong for this police movie, I thought. Maybe they wanted to make an MTV video clip for Timberlake.
