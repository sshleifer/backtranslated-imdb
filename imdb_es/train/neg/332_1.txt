I'll start this by saying that I could not get through it completely. I picked it up on a rainy day from WalMart like the rest of the critics on this site. I thought there was no way to regret my purchase. Was I wrong or what? Seriously now, who approved this project? They must be forced to watch this movie again and again until the end of eternity. That is the only appropriate punishment that occurs to me for throwing something so bad. The shoot reminds me of the movies I used to do for class projects in a great old VHS camera. The acting is not much better. I think the only difference is that there are some great cameos. Yay, who cares ... Shecky Moskowitz is not funny, and the comedian of the boats is an even bigger loser. That's almost the plot I understood. <br /> <br /> In general, it is the worst movie I have seen in my life. I have it on DVD and I have given it to many colleagues to see it. Everyone comes back and laughs and says "Wow, I did not think I would ever say that I close a Adam Sandler movie 15 minutes in ..." <br /> <br /> My answer is always "Well, now you can" < br /> <br />
