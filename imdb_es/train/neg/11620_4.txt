I gave more than a 1 because I thought there were some moral lessons in this story and that caused my wife and I to reflect and comment. The acting and the dialogue were mediocre and I must confess that I went out as if I had been hit in the head with the god this, God that and Christ is our savior. The film and the story line did not need it. If, as I am, you are a Catholic or Christian in recovery, avoid this and it will cause nausea. The film did a good job of showing the thin line between being a good citizen and how someone could become a potential bully focused on what could have been.
