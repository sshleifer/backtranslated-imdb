I hated this shit, every Friday, as part of tgif, and constantly sucked big with stupidity every week. If you want to see something fun, go to "No On Would Tell Tell", starring Candice Cameron and Fred Savage, it's really funny, it shows exactly why no one goes to a good movie career after doing a terrible TV show. This show really makes me sick, I hate those kids, and Bob Saget needs to go jump off a bridge to do this shit. I've seen more fun things elsewhere, but here. I'm writing 10 lines! Look at 'full house' to see the least that humanity has to offer in terms of arts and entertainment.
