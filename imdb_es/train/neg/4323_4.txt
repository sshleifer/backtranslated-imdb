European Vacation (also known as National Lampoon's European Vacation) is the weakest of Vacation's films (the first and third highest movies). While Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo return as Clark and Ellen Griswold (with new actors in the roles of Russ and Audrey Griswold), this time they are given a weaker script with a very bad dialogue. This makes the rhythm suffer, with the jokes not very funny. To be more specific, what really makes this film suffer is the fact that the "jokes" as they are, they simply stick together in a makeshift script, instead of serving a central plot as do the other 3 films of Vacation. Oh, well, you can not win them all. 4 out of 10
