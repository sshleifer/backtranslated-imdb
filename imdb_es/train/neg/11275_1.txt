This is a truly abysmal clone of "LOCK STOCK" with a star cast and a terrible script. I have no idea why so many important British actors targeted this garbage, they must have been bribed. The mismatch of a story develops forever and ever, and if I had not paid a good amount of money for it, I would have turned it off after 10 minutes. It's not the worst movie I've seen in my life, that honor is for the real pathetic roll of a "movie" (I use the term lightly) "GUMMO" (I want to sue the so-called "director" for the hour lost and half of my life) but this garbage is almost down there with her. Definitely one of the worst 5 movies I've seen. Things like these remind Hollywood that they do not have a monopoly on really horrible movies.
