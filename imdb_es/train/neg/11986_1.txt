What horrible writing and acting. Without personality What, you can not make a good movie with just one character? Hmm, it was done in Castaway with self-talk. <br /> <br /> So this child goes on a trip to see his father. The boy, Jason, takes a plane and the pilot has a heart attack and dies in mid-flight. So the child crashes into a lake and survives. Then he runs around, surviving in the desert until he is rescued. <br /> <br /> During that time he fights with a bear twice. The first time he fights in the lake. The second time he makes a spear from a branch and throws the bear. Two shots of fake blood gushing from the bear's chest reminded me of the "Holy Grail" of Monty Python. <br /> <br /> The child also decides to kick a porcupine with predictable results. <br /> <br /> Gag.
