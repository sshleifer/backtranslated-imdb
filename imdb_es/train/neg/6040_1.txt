Where to start, this movie started badly and ended badly! It consists of an extremely poor performance and unrealistic effects that made me feel in my seat, seriously, my cat could have acted better than this lot. <br /> <br /> Actually, it was kind of ridiculous because it was so amazing, I would have rated this lower but they do not have anything else! Therefore, pay attention to my warning and, unless you are so bored, you are close to committing suicide and I would like to have a good reason to continue your suicide mission, do not bother with it. I'm still in shock that this can be released to the public, this should be a crime and everyone involved should be arrested. I guess you already have the idea, so I'll leave it to you to decide.
