All right. This was not a surprise. Many people will tell you that this is bloody. but all speak "shiztz", this movie is very slow. <br /> <br /> Start with a guy who makes a mixture to not feel pain. He calls her "my son". There are some bloody scenes, but I found them a little weak. You can also skip 40 minutes of the movie and get to the eyeball scene that was surprisingly breathtaking and disgusting. There are some really stupid scenes in this. and they bend the blows and hit with stupid fake slaps that make me laugh! I would not recommend it. keep looking for gore hounds. <br /> <br /> Look at this if you want the final scene of 20-10 minutes, which is still not so surprising and has a random scene of a guy trying to rape his mother ... yes it's weird.
