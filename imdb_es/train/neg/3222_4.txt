I was very disappointed in this 1970 film based on a story by Bernard Malamud. This is basically a story of possible redemption, racial bias and failure to live based on distrust. <br /> <br /> A Jewish black angel is sent to help a struggling tailor and his wife in critical condition. If Morris Mishkin (Zero Mostel) will only believe in the angel (Belafonte), his wife Fanny (Ida Kaminska) will recover. The problem is that Morris has basically given up on life and simply refuses to believe that Belafonte is an angel. <br /> <br /> When she believes it, Fanny improves, but in the end she has doubts and Fanny suffers accordingly. "It would have been very nice if there had been an English translation in the last scene when Fanny, dying, talks to Morris. <br /> <br /> Jan Kadar, who successfully directed Ms. Kaminska in her brilliant performance nominated for Oscar in 1966 "The Shop on Main Street" also directs this film Kaminska is reduced in the film to most of the bed scenes and her kindness in her speech does not really convey the desperate situation she faces. , his daughter, who disobeyed them by marrying the Jewish religion.For most of the film, she does not notice the appearance of the Angel in her apartment. <br /> <br /> The scene in the pharmacy is confused and the scene in which Angel's girlfriend confronts Belafonte in his apartment, it is memorable but all too brief. <br /> <br /> We do not know why Belafonte is in danger and why he died. <br / > <br /> Those who saw this movie of Ben having left the theater in a state of depression and despair.
