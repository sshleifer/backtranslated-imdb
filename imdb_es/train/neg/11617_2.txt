This movie "Joshua" is extremely disturbing and absolutely useless. In fact, it gives me chills to think that there are people who enjoy watching it. Without revealing the story, it's about a child's reaction to his newborn sister, and that's just the tip of the iceberg. During the entirety of this film, the viewer is subject to some of the most disturbing child behaviors imaginable. At the end of this film, adding insults to the injuries, there is absolutely no real result, except the fruition of pure evil at the hands of a child, which surpassed the entire group of dumb adults. There is no redemption, justice is not done, and a whole group of adults who are not smart enough to see what happens around them. Frankly, I did not enjoy watching this movie. It was extremely disturbing. Even for those who can enjoy horror movies, this movie could be too much. Despite the fact that this movie acted well, the story itself is so disturbing that watching it was equivalent to a 90 minute wait in the waiting room of a dentist in anticipation of some painful dental procedure.
