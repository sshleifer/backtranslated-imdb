Here we have 2 misunderstood children who never had a chance against a cruel and poverty stricken existence: Robin Hood was singled out by the police for persecution because they were sometimes a bit wild. Gad! According to this shit, Bonnie was the sweetest little thing west of Missouri, to which a fun-loving boyfriend taught him to be a psycho killer and he did not really want to hurt anyone ... he just wanted things without putting a lot of energy . in getting them. Maligned dialogue, badly filmed, incredible, unrealistic use of weaponry, gore that looked more like grape jelly than the real thing. Avoid this bilge water. Thumbs down. -5 stars.
