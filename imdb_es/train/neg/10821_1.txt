I read the novel 'Jane Eyre' for the first time in 1986. It was around that time that I saw the BBC version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke. It was an excellent version and very similar to the book. Years later, I put my eyes on this version and I was horrified. William Hurt is totally a villain like Mr. Rochester. Mr. Rochester is a passionate character, where, as William Hurt presents it as a block of ice. The same goes for Charlotte Gainsborough. It was like seeing two zombies together. This is a story about love and passion, but I could not see it in this version. No, going back to the BBC version. A wonderful time is guaranteed.
