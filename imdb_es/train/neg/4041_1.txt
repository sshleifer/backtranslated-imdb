How to wear a hair shirt Positively, absolutely, without a doubt one of the worst movies in history. Pure torture. Zero stars of ten. A long, tedious, laborious, pretentious, self-conscious, theatrical and artistic scene, after another. With the intention of being dreamy and impressionistic, the discovered soul is, on the other hand, a morbid. <br /> <br /> Half naked, father and son grope and whisper to each other like lovers. "Homo-erotic" is the point, loud and clear. OK and what? <br /> <br /> Repeated more than once for the son is the line, supposedly raised from "Lives of the saints", "The love of a father crucifies, a loving son is left to crucify." The parallel to God and his son, Christ, is heavy-handed, irrelevant and grandiloquent, like everything else here. <br /> <br /> Some points of reference on the theme of Russian filiality: "Mother and child" (1997); "The Return" (Andrei Zvyagvatsev, 2003); "Little Odessa" (James Gray, 1994); Turgenev, "Parents and children"; and, of course, Dostoevsky, "The Karamazov brothers." <br /> <br /> The credits in English indicate the planned international distribution, which means that you can not use the excuse that you have to be Russian to understand this disaster. <br /> <br /> This is neither as complete nor convincing as Sokurov's last, "Russian Ark" (2003). <br /> <br /> As in his "Mother and Son", an equally powerful soporific, some scenes are filmed from distorting mirrors, although not so interesting. The film is almost monochromatic, taken from beginning to end through beige filters, which makes it as visually as dramatically numb. A haze of soft focus only adds to the feeling of drug addiction. <br /> <br /> The annoying drones of a soundtrack never go out, like a ribbon loop. An old radio constantly plays in the background. Russian romantic melancholy inflates endlessly as "themes based on Tchaikovsky." The presence of a "sound designer" (Sergei Moshkov) means, of course, that all those little irritating, static sounds of radio, noise, distortion and so on are "designed". <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe that someone (Sergei Potepolov) really wrote this thing. Everything seems as arbitrary as the traffic, as if improvised by bored actors, coming out of nowhere to nothing. <br /> <br /> Modern art has finally managed to mean the thing without being the thing, so that what we contemplate is the idea of ​​the idea, empty like a shell, but not even a shell, simply the idea of a shell. Could you ask for a better definition of decadence?
