This movie has so little class in comparison with Strangers in a train or even, accidental meeting in this sense, that despite the similarities of the plot I would not feel good if I compared this with any of them. The character of Yancy Butler was like a fool so foolish that I was too embarrassed that the writer and the director kept looking. <br /> <br /> I do not enjoy many lifelong movies, but I feel compelled to watch one once in a while. For the sake of promoting harmony at home. I often moan in silence, but this movie made me protest loudly, get up from the room and walk around the house muttering, before returning to my normally favorite chair to submit to more tortures. <br /> <br /> Dean Morgan, Rochester, NY
