I give 3 stars only for the beautiful images of Africa. The rest was ... well boring. For about 50min we have the scheme of the plot ... In the War of the Worlds, the introductory part lasted, oh, about 10min? Then it was real action! This is something like: "We are going to take a walk through the savannah and we are amazed at the beautiful sunsets!". And maybe deliver a message, like "Do not kill elephants!" Very ecological I would have expected this from a "new" film by Steven Segal, not from this one ... The main actress makes me think of artificial tanning, dyed hair and too much base! And I did not see a scene where your hair is messy or sweats or your clothes are dusty. She just does not look like a 19th century woman! And in the bar, where they look for our hero, Swayze makes a comment about the commander who looks like Dracula. Mmm, Bram Stoker wrote his book and published it in 1896, and became famous in the coming years. Livingstone and other explorers went to central Africa from 1840 to 1880. Then, unless the action takes place between 1896 and 1900 ... Houston, we have a problem. :) Swayze gives a good impression ... in a few words: hard on the outside, but soft and tender on the inside. It's not like I'd hug you with a nut, but you get the point. He really manages to have that puppy look beaten on his face several times. The movie stank. Too long and increasingly boring. do not see it. Do not buy it! It's a waste of your money!
