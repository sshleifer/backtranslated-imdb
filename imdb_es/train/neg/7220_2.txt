Where do they get the money to make movies like this? I mean, there's nothing redeeming about this movie. None of the actors is known, the writing is terrible, the photography is blurry, the story wanders between being a bad version of Repo Man and a nicklodeon western and the acting is incredible. For someone watching all kinds of movies, good and bad, I must admit that this movie is the worst I've seen since the 50s of Attack of the Eye People. I really do not like to waste the effort of people trying to create some entertainment or, God forbid, art, but this movie seems not to attract anyone. The story is based on the mystical contamination of a person who is a bad version of the Celtic soul devourer, although it functions more like a male succubus without sexual connotations. The bad ones have to associate with the good ones in a city from which they can not escape. Take it from there since, alas, it's the best part. My advice is that unless you're interested in bad mythology, amateur writing, unconvincing acting and tedious adjustments, it's best if you leave it on the shelf when you rent videos.
