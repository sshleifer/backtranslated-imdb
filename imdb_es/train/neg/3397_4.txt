The trailer for this movie interested me enough to justify the rental of the DVD. However, the resulting film is absolutely terrible! It is true that this is not the worst movie ever made, or the worst movie of this year, but it was very close! <br /> <br /> The main problem is that the film does not know what it wants to be: comedy, adult drama, thriller, teen-porn? The story is interesting, as it deals with the pitfalls of brides in charge of sending by mail, but the film is a disaster. What begins as a slightly interesting "comedy" (a word I use in the vaguest possible terms), becomes totally inverse and degenerates into a very dark and disgusting misogynist thriller. Nicole Kidman should know better, and Ben Chaplin is lost! As are Matthieu Kassovitz and Vincent Cassel, to whom I can only assume that they did this for money. <br /> <br /> This is a bad movie in almost every respect. It's not funny, it's so sexist that you can almost forgive Benny Hill for everything he did, and the dramatic elements are simply unpleasant. A movie that should be avoided, unless you have to see Kidman or Chaplin in each of his films.
