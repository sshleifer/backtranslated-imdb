While I totally disagree with a critic who described Charley Chase as a funny character, in this film he certainly is. It's a shame, since I suspect that the other critic should only have seen some of Charley Chase's mistakes and assumed that the guy was not funny. Movies like MIGHTY LIKE A MOOSE and WHAT GOOFY PRICE? They are very good Chase movies, so it COULD be really fun given the good material. Unfortunately, in this movie he has not given anything at all. Even the inclusion of the generally good Oliver Hardy as aluminum foil does not help because the basic premise (the child wants to marry a girl, but the father of the girl thinks the boy is weird) and the gags are very poor. It's a shame, because I really wanted to love this movie but I could not. <br /> <br /> By the way, for those accustomed to Charley's look since the mid-1920s, you'll be surprised. Chase does not have glasses or mustaches, and you see very little as you would expect.
