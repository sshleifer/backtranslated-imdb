God, this movie was so boring apart from the music that I really loved, I want to say what it is about making this movie. Please, anyone reading this review, do not watch this movie, it's a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Emraan can act but it was really pathetic. In this movie, I'm ashamed to be one of his fans, especially in this movie, it was really very bad. <br /> <br /> Celina is just another pretty face without lack of talent, she can not act at all, and it did not make sense that she was in this movie, since for the other girl, Radha, she was fine, I guess, but I could have done better. <br /> <br /> what a waste of time. Please, buy good music and do not watch this movie.
