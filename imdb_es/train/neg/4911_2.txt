First To Die 2003 <br /> <br /> First I will admit my mistake: I did not realize it was a movie for television. I was "fired" for the "R" certification. The plot is strong, but the film lasts about 40 minutes. The direction and continuity were excellent. For the most part, the cast was exceptional and did a good job with their characters. The downside of the movie is that it definitely falls into the "chick flick" genre. Although there are some violent scenes, none of the violence should require an "R" rating. There is no nudity or free sex scenes. Actually, there are no sex scenes. Ona Grauer (who is absolutely beautiful), Kristina Copeland, Sonya Salomaa and Glynis Davies were all invited to the SG-1 series, but this film did nothing to advance their careers as they were all used as low-level support actresses . Robert Patrick was fantastic, as he usually is, and Mitch Pileggi made me think of a modern Lee Marvin. The very talented Megan Gallagher, whom I came to respect as an actor during the Millennium series, had no challenge to show her range of abilities. The biggest disappointment with the cast was Tracy Pollan. Besides being an actress below the average and not particularly attractive, her voice is absolutely annoying. I found myself silencing the television during their dialogue. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys the type of Lifetime TV programs. However, I would not recommend paying money to watch this movie. Considering that I did not find anything that could cause censorship, this is a worthwhile movie just to watch on TV, since nothing will be deleted. Like a television movie, I would rate this as a 5 out of 10. As a feature film with an "R" certification and as a strong cast, I rate it as 2 out of ten.
