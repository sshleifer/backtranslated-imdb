I knew that my summary would attract you. How is this movie like a Pet Rock and Disco? Well, unless you've lived through the 70s or 80s, you probably can not understand WHY someone would want a new Coke or own a Pet Rock (and frankly, at least in the Pet Rocks case, I still DO NOT fully understand it ). They are just a couple of things that seemed to make sense at that time but really baffle the younger generation. The same can be said for Kay Kyser and his band. At that time (most of the 40s), they were very popular and had enough influence for the studio to star with Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi and Peter Lorre in this film. However, if you did not live at that time (it was much before me), you wonder why someone liked this kind of "entertainment". After all, Kyser and his bandmates are incredibly obnoxious and their humor is very, very broad (that is, unsophisticated and cheesy). Frankly, I could not stand his antics or appreciate that there were too many musical numbers in the movie. Due to these factors, the large support cast received a back seat and the fans of these actors will probably be disappointed. <br /> <br /> The film involves Kyser and the band coming to a mansion where a young woman and her crazy aunt live Once there, the bridge is washed and strange events begin. Eventually, it culminates in some attempts in Sally's life and in a session (of some kind). Everything plays for laughs, and it really is not a horror movie despite the cast. <br /> <br /> In general, it is a passable entertainment at best. As a fan of Lugosi and Karloff, I felt cheated by having to see Kyser and his knuckles.
