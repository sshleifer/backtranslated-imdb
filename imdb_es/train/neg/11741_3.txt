His costume drama is badly cast and without charm. <br /> <br /> George Sanders was an excellent character actor. But it is completely unlikely here as a protagonist, an eighteenth-century rogue known for his philosophy and great appearance. Your beating is, of all people, Akim Tamiroff. Some French! Then there is Signe Hasso, in a dark wig, like the virgin daughter of a rich family. Carole Landis does better. The film opens with her in silhouette. She is a soubrette, and a naughty girl in that. She disappears for a while but appears in an unlikely situation. But she is good. She was always an attractive actress. Here she is the closest to her usual role type. <br /> <br /> It's supposed to be a little naughty, a kind of ooh-la-la. It should have had a light touch, but it's a matter of lead from start to finish.
