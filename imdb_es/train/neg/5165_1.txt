I really wanted this ride and I felt terribly disappointed. <br /> <br /> And I have a lot of fun with the roller coaster and amusement parks. <br /> <br /> The part of the roller coaster was fine. - and that was all about 30 seconds of a 90-second trip. <br /> <br /> It was visually boring and poorly executed. <br /> <br /> I was desperately trying to be like a mix of the very superior Indiana Jones and Space Mountain and Disneyland, and failed in every respect. <br /> <br /> It was not exciting or exciting in the least
