What this film does not answer is how wrong this war is (and most of the US wars were made just to get some oil). <br /> <br /> How many innocent civilian victims there have been, how many lives perished and how blatantly the perpetrators are stupid. <br /> <br /> Then, let me ask you: if an American soldier kills women and children other than the enemy, that's fine, but if the government accidentally kills its own forces with deadly chemicals while killing many civilians. good is not it? Your logic fails, gentleman. <br /> <br /> I will give you 5 for solid performance and 1 for everything else, 3 in total.
