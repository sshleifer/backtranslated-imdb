This movie became one of my 10 most horrible movies. Horrible. <br /> <br /> There was not a continuous minute where there was not a fight with one monster or another. There was no possibility of character development, they were too busy running from one sword fight to another. He had no emotional attachment (except the big bad machine that wanted to destroy them). <br /> <br /> The scenes were shamelessly stolen from other movies, LOTR, Star Wars and Matrix. <br /> <br /> Examples <br /> <br />> The ghost scene at the end was stolen from the final scene of the old Star Wars with Yoda, Obee One and Vader. <br /> <br />> The spider machine in the beginning was exactly like Frodo being attacked by the spider in the Return of the Kings. (Elijah Wood is the victim in both movies) and wait ... hypnotizes (itches) his victim and wraps her ..... uh hello ???? <br /> <br />> And the whole issue of the machine against humans was the matrix ... or the terminator ... <br /> <br /> There are more examples, but why waste time ? And someone will tell me what happened to the Nazis?!?! Nazi's ???? <br /> <br /> There was a juvenile storyline that was quick to come to a juvenile conclusion. The film could not decide if it was a movie for children or an adult movie and it did not have much to do either. <br /> <br /> Simply horrible. A real disappointment to say the least. Save your money
