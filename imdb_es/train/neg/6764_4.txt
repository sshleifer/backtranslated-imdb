NATURAL BORN KILLERS (1994) <br /> <br /> Cinema Cut: R <br /> <br /> Director's Cut: NC-17 <br /> <br /> It's an unusual image of Oliver Stone, but when I read that he was drugged during the filming, he did not need any further explanation. 'Natural Born Killers' is a risky, crazy and unrestrained movie that we do not get very often; Strangers, psychotics, artistic paintings. <br /> <br /> 'Natural Born Killers' is basically the story of how mass murderers popularized and glorified mass murderers; There is a big scene in which an interviewer asks some teenagers about Mickey and Mallory, and the teenager says, "The murder is wrong ... but if I were a mass murderer, it would be Mickey and Mallory." Mickey describes it with a situation of 'Frankenstein (the monster) and Dr. Frankenstein'. Dr. Frankenstein is the means of communication that has turned them into these monstrous killers. <br /> <br /> Most of Oliver Stone's films examine the flaws of America, the country that the director loves and admires. I guess 'Natural Born Killers' has to do with the effect of mass media, technology and the obsessiveness of the United States, the Americans (and most of the world) on things like mass murderers and strange situations. . <br /> <br /> The assassins played by Woody Harrelson (Mickey) and Juliette Lewis (Mallory) are executed in an amazing way by two excellent actors who enter the lives of two curiously brutal killers. Mickey and Mallory believe that some people are worth killing, perhaps in the cruel theory of social Darwinism (survival of the fittest). Mickey says in his prison interview that other species commit murders, we, as humans, wreak havoc on other species and exploit the environment; the script is interesting, but it is questionable how much this film represents, in the sense of making us think about society and human behavior, instead of the intensity of a 2-hour bloodbath we have seen. <br /> <br /> The last hour of the film takes place in a maximum security prison; we see the harsh realities of prison life; the attitudes of the warden, etc., the excessive filling of the prisons, maybe Stone is questioning the future, the path that leads society. <br /> <br /> Two other interesting characters; First, a reporter who runs a show on 'America's Maniacs' and is obsessed with raising ratings, says he goes to great lengths to capture the story of Mickey and Mallory. The other is the police officer Scagnetti, an insane, perhaps official sadist who is in love with Mallory; He also has a strange obsession with mass murderers, since his mother was murdered during the massacre of Waco, Texas, by Charles Whitman. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is excellent; Different colors, shadows, styles create a sense of disorientation; The most obvious green color of all is green, to look like the murderers' disease (in the pharmacy when they are looking for an antidote to the rattlesnake). <br /> <br /> The work of the camera is crazy; trembling, busy, you need some determination to get used to it and accept it. Highly unorthodox, psychedelic and unusual. <br /> <br /> 'Natural Born Killers' does not seduce the existence of crazy assassins, it questions it and how we, as a public, can feed this attribute ... <br /> <Although the previous criticism sounds quite positive, I did not like the movie. Quentin Tarantino, who originally wrote the screenplay for the film, was not satisfied with the altered script and asked to have his name removed. I can see why. Although it is slightly interesting at times, Natural Born Killers is a disaster of an image. <br /> <br /> 4/10
