I hate horror movies, that's not a secret. No plot, bad performance and gallons of blood are basic elements of these film errors, and this "movie" is no exception. I can not believe that some cable stations actually run this garbage. (This particular garbage was thrown directly into the video, as a souvenir). Like mentioning any other movie would be a great insult to that other movie, I say this: All the Phantasm movies, all the Jason movies, Freddy, The Chucky movies and most of the Michael Myers movies can be summed up in one word: TERRIBLE !!! <br /> <br /> Qualification (Phantasm III): 0.5 / 10
