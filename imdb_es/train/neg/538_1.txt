Wow, what a waste of talent in acting. My husband and I sit there, both thinking, this has to improve, these actresses are too good to have wasted time on this shit. The unattractive characters, the well-worn scripts and the apathetic rhythm make two long hours. In fact, I could not hack it and I went shopping for groceries (the cat litter is more attractive than this movie). The husband stayed and confirmed that it did not improve: when they killed Buddy, you wanted everyone to be hit by a car and end their miserable lives. It would be infinitely more entertaining. Beautiful landscapes and costumes can not keep this alive.
