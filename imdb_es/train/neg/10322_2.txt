If you're looking to be offended, fun or both, you'll probably have to look elsewhere. LMOTP really is not even very provocative, beyond repeating the usual silly clich√©s. At the end of the second episode I felt a bit ashamed that I really sat through the mess. <br /> <br /> Beyond the subtly veiled premise that attracted all the initial attention in the first place, it is just another. An unconvincing, innocuous and antiseptic attempt to comment and entertain that the CBC often excels in production. And once the "ZOMG MUSLIMS IN RURAL CANADA ROFLMAO !!" the exaggerations exhaust his welcome, it is probable that the program continues with the ether of the cancellation because it is very superficial when it is judged only by its merits. <br /> <br /> Unless you are obsessed with the Muslim culture in the West and / or are easily entertained by the more detailed idiosyncrasies on the subject. I really do not see how you can enjoy LMOTP beyond satisfying the curiosity that came from the hype. Other programs have better addressed the issue of cultural / ethnic dichotomy in Western multi-ethnic societies. LMOTP will never classify between them in entertainment or vision.
