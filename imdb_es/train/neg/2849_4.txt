Some make a comparison between this movie and 'The Last Detail', but 'Chasers' is flatter than a stretch of the interstate in West Texas. And like the landscape in the desert, there is not much that distinguishes it, not even the fact that a prisoner is being transported by two Navy escorts on this occasion. No one in the cast is doing too well; With this script I take that is not surprising. Dennis Hopper, the director, will not give much space to this one if he ever writes a memory, I do not believe.
