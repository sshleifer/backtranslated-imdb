Many fans of King hate this because he turned away from the book, but the film is a different medium and books should change when they make the leap. However, the film fails completely, but fails completely in cinematographic terms. I would like to hit people who tell me that it is the most terrifying movie ever made. I always follow up with the question "Really ... exactly what scene scared you?" Every fan I asked for, remains silent. Occasionally, someone, lost by a decent scare (There is none ...), names the trick "Grape juice coming out of the elevators". If you're afraid of that, I do not know what to tell you, except maybe you're easily scared. I just rolled my eyes to see how these z-grade horror ideas develop in this incoherent and immutable movie. <br /> <br /> A place that deviates from the book and that really is insipid is the tedious work that the film does to get Mr. Halloran went up to the Mirador just to kill him; with the dumbest member of the audience, knowing that Jack is waiting behind one of the columns in the corridor, that Halloran FOREVER to always walk. Really one of the most stupendous sequences ever filmed. <br /> <br /> Oh, and good choice for Mr. Halloran's artwork, Stanley! Afro-nymphomaniacs of black light really contribute to the development of humor and character of a horror movie. Has there ever been an "off", a misplaced picture in a film that has been made? <br /> <br /> I consider it a miracle that I have finally been able to avoid this shit, and I agree that Kubricks 2001 is a truly important film, given the immense 'ill will' generated by this stupid and stupid movie as for the cult of flatterers but inarticulate Kubrick fans, who could not describe an idea in operation with each film resource in the Library of Congress in front of them. <br /> <br /> Mix Jack Nicholson's grotesque overacting, the introduction of simple phrases in moments of tension and the performance of Shelly Duvall, nominated by the Razzies, and have a very horrible movie.
