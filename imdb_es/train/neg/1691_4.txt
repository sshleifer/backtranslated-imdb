This film is really nothing more than a series of tense sequences that are certainly well elaborated and punctuated with an inevitable "gotcha!" at the end of each one. Actually, there is no character development or a real plot to talk about. There is only one of the most skeletal motivations for the characters to do something as they move towards their inevitable fatalities. It's just an excuse to show a spooky ghost (who seems to have mistaken for the family cat in its ectoplasm) and his ghost mother (with long black hair hanging from his face, like "The Ring"). down a pile of cardboard cutouts, two-dimensional excuses for human characters. <br /> <br /> This English version of "The Grudge" is the equivalent of film junk food; it satisfies momentarily, but not really in what you should be living. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
