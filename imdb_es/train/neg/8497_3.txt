My title should be enough. <br /> <br /> I am puzzled that a culture so rich in literary excellence (Dumas, Flaubert, Balzac, Maupassant) produces a cinematic movement "nouvelle vague". Until the 20th century, France had a great tradition of artistic lucidity and intelligent philosophy. But the moment you give them a movie camera, they start acting like WOOOHOOO. HOW CAN I BE POWER! PLOT? TOPIC? BAH! WE CAN FILM A FUN PARK RIVER THAT GOES TO THE ROUND AND THE ROUND! At least this is not as bad as Godard (who has a sickly fascination with the backs of people's heads.) Oh-la-la, quel artiste). No, Truffaut maintains a degree of visual clarity. But so does the security camera in a quickie-mart. The two are indistinguishable. <br /> <br /> Haha, just like a comment for all the nerds of the film school: I bet the vein is coming out of the side of your neck right now. But do not leave without reading the last sentence of my criticism. <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you like French literature, you will hate this. People who like this movie probably have never read other books other than the ramblings of Jack Kerouac or perhaps the "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy". Or maybe they've read the lyrics of The Doors songs, and they think that's deeply moving. Whatever is floating on your ship. I find it ironic that this film injects some (weak) allusions to Balzac, one of the best and most significant writers that ever existed. Good try, truffles. But you're not near the baseball stadium. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie like a syringe infected with AIDS. <br /> <br /> If you're the kind of person you like to think about, then stick with it. Jean Cocteau (ORPHEE), Robert Bresson (PICKPOCKET) and Japanese teachers Kurosawa (IKURU), Kobayashi (KAIDAN) and Teshigahara (SUNA NO ONNA). <br /> <br /> If you are an idiot, enjoy your Truffaut, Godard and Andy Worhol. And, for Pete's sake, push that vein back into your neck. You look like a cabbage.
