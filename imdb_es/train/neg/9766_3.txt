Roger Corman is undoubtedly one of the most versatile and unpredictable directors / producers in history. He was solely responsible for some of my favorite horror movies in history (like Edgar Allen Poe's "Masque of the Red Death" and "Pit and the Pendulum" adaptations), as well as some incredibly cheap and sticky trash (as "Creature of the enchanted sea" and "She gods of the shark reef"). Corman also made a couple of films that are simply unclassifiable and? just put ?? almost impossible to judge properly. "The trip", for example, as well as this imaginatively titled "Gas-s-s-s-s" can be labeled as psychedelic exploitation. In other words, they are very influenced by hippie culture. Half the time you do not have the slightest idea what is going on, who are these characters that walk from one side to another through the screen and where the hell is all this going. The plot is simple and, nevertheless, highly effective: a strange but deadly nerve gas is accidentally triggered and quickly annihilates the entire world population over 25 years old. This * could * be the basic premise of an atmospheric, sandy and exciting atmosphere. The post-apocalyptic science fiction milestone, but the writer George Armitage and Roger Corman decided to turn it into a "trippy" road movie comedy. None of the characters is trying to prevent their inevitable deaths; they simply party in the streets and find small youth crime syndicates. "Gas-s-s" is disappointingly boring and tries to be too weird. The whole script seems to be improvised in the place and nothing funny. Definitely not my cup of tea, but the movie has a base of loyal fans and many fans, so who am I to say it's not worth your time or money?
