The woman with the wig, who "dyes" her hair in the middle of the film (= takes the wig), presumably does not see what the audience can see miles away: <br /> <br /> *** begins the spoiler alert * ** that her husband is having an affair with his best girlfriend and both try to get rid of her. *** end of the spoiler alert *** <br /> <br /> And what a spoiler it was: the title already gives it away, is not it? Bad acting, bad script: loss of time Oh yes: in the end, she lives happily ever after ... <br /> <br /> If you liked this movie, you will really love it "Cannibal women in the avocado Forest of Death "....
