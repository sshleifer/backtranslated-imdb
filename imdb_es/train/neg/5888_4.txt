I saw this recently on an old faded VHS tape, and I remembered it faintly. Look at it now, it seems lovely. <br /> <br /> When it was first released, it was recognized by almost everyone as a parody of dating as a gay teenager. To emphasize the theme, the mother is seen reading a pocket copy of "1 Teenager In 10", the most popular book of the time. David Warner criticizes him as the persecutor of vampire hunters [= evangelist who hates homosexuals], which is, of course, a closet case that hates itself. The list of visual gags and jokes that were included to make sure no one skipped the point would be too long to analyze. The producers were enjoying themselves willingly, and hoped, without a doubt, to enlighten and clarify. <br /> <br /> But I have no idea how an adolescent audience would look in this movie, today. In some places, where there is education and culture, the terrible experiences that gay teenagers had to go through are a thing of the past. But I am sure there are many dark and unpleasant corners of our continent where it is as bad as it always was.
