* SOILER * It's false! The whole thing is false! There are no ghosts or zombies, Alan is a Lord and his cousin or brother or half brother or something like that wants the castle and its title for himself. So he invests this useless, too complicated and unnecessary plan, like SCOOBY-DOO for Alan to commit suicide. Most of the movie is him picking up redheads and attacking them. It is not even killing them. He falls asleep and the girl vanishes and thinks he buried them somewhere. If I looked at Evelyn's so-called ghost, I could say that she was wearing gloves! My God, what a waste of time. Do not bother to see it, rent it and, if you bought it and have not seen it yet, sell it. Quickly! Do yourself a favor and stay away from THE NIGHT THAT EVELYN CAME OUT OF THE GRAVE. I give this stinky the CRAP-O-LANTERN.
