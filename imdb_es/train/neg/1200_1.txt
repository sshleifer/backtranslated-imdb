An exorcist, boring, obvious and tedious scam that presents a Doberman with red eyes, is the scope of the special effects of this model made for television. Richard Crenna is as animated as a toy to chew. Very 70's dress and music only contribute to the torture. I should put you to sleep almost as fast as "The corpse disappears" or "The blue hand". Virtually no value. MooCow says what a stinky dog! : = 8P
