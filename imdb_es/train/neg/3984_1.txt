I saw this movie a few years ago on the BBC, I sat through it. How? I do not know, this is very high on the "so bad that is good" lists. Kidman, Baldwin and Pullman must tremble when they see it now. I think that Woody Allen would have done wonders with the extravagant plot, and Baldwin The part that could have been interpreted with pleasure by Leslie Nelson. It was again tonight. I tried to see her again, but life is too short. The few minutes I saw were for the lovely Nicole, who was so hot around age 93. Has Baldwin ever made a good movie? Pullman played his part in exchanging "good but tenuous" character from the word F that comes out of his mouth when the "frasier" lady speaks ill when a detective accuses him of murder and sounds so bad. stay well away
