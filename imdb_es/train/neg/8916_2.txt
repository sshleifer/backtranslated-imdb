I rented this DVD having seen it while searching for something else. When I saw the title on the jacket I could not believe what I saw. I read Yalom's book about a year ago and I loved it, in fact I admire Yalom's work in general. (I'm a clinical psychologist) I've seen maybe 30 minutes of this movie and I had to turn it off. I'm not sure if I can take much more. On a superficial level, false accents, as others have commented, simply distract, in the best of cases, irritating and vague at worst. The acting is boring when it should be passionate and comical, when it should be serious. The performance of Lou Salome is simply frivolous, and the brilliant Freud appears as little more than a scholar. I see very little of the spirit of the book transmitted so far. I was hoping to recommend this movie to my students. Instead, I will refer you to the book. Imagine that.
