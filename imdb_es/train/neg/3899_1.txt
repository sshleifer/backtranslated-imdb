Where do I start? According to the title of this film, I expected a certain degree of authenticity, in the end I was very disappointed. This is not the story of Lale Andersen or the song Lili Marlene, but it is a Hollywood story (or choose your movie making center) based loosely on some real-life characters. I should have had a clue when I heard a strong English accent that gave the introduction to the film in German; The red blood text (title, artists) should have been the second clue. The storyline is designed (Lale was not deceived by the parents of Switzerland, Rolf Liebermann, there is no information that Liebermann has helped to smuggle Jews from Germany, the original song had been recorded outside the control of the NS regime and was not under control, the game registration at the station was picked up in Vienna while a lieutenant was there on leave, etc, etc.) the costumes are bad and wrong for the time frames (the black uniforms of the SS are used everywhere, from border guards to personnel posts, these disappeared from daily use once the war began, etc.), the characters are stereo-like (SA thugs in a club once they were essentially out power). Do not waste your time.
