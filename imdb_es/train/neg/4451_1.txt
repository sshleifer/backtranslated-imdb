This movie was probably as stupid as The Naked Gun (it was supposed to be). Case in Point: <br /> <br /> 1. To pretend that he is drowning, Roberts is taking swimming lessons in secret at the YWCA. After her "death", the YWCA calls her husband to work to give his condolences. HELLO, how did you get your work number? <br /> <br /> 2. Before leaving the city, drop your wedding ring in the bathroom. Days or even weeks later, her husband finds him in the John. Does this mean that the toilet was never flushed? <br /> <br /> 3. It is not explained how he is paying for his mother's care at the retirement home (since he did it behind his RICH husbands). <br /> <br /> 4. Towards the end of this boring movie, Roberts suspects that her husband is in the house. Instead of running for your life, run to the kitchen to see if the cans are stacked neatly.
