Another insult and a slap in the face to gay men everywhere. This scant attempt at comedy has nothing to recommend. Once again, we have an attractive "direct" hero who supposedly can not make any woman interested in him. Yeah sure! And we also see the gay friend 'nice and attractive' who is actually a fat, bald and ugly old man who is supposed to find the protagonist attractive. I did not even find it attractive and I'm an ugly, fat old man (but luckily I'm not getting bald)! Whatever the acting talent that may be here, has been discarded in a bad script, and in a truly horrible direction. Mr. Sneedeker should be banned from filming, but then it's no different from the countless other tricks that work at Hollyweed.
