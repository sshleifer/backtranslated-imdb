The 1990s began having daytime talk shows sprouting from left to right. Each network had one, and all lacked an Originality. Ricky Lake was just another show to entertain the obese mother of trailers with a Marlboro cigarette hanging from her mouth while nursing one of her dozens of illiterate and toothless children. The English language and other cornerstones of humanity where it was ruined by this shows existence. Titltes that go from Girl you to Pigeon Head and so on. How could someone want to see this garbage pure and absolute? Has our society really become nothing more than a lot of parents of Hill Billy and Dead Beat? The people that appear in this show were Trash. The people who saw this show were Trash. Anyone who wants to see this program broadcast or put on a DVD is TRASH. People wonder why Americans are turning into huge piles of fat and too fat to get a job, their programs like this tell them that it's okay to be 500 pounds overweight and 12-year-old girls act like prostitutes. Having so much garbage on television has ruined the moral.
