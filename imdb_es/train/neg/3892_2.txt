Do you want to see a scary horror movie? Then stay away from this one. There is not enough beer in the world to make this movie enjoyable. <br /> <br /> However, there is enough whiskey. One single malt, if you can handle it. <br /> <br /> If the previous comments were not enough to prevent you from seeing this sober movie, let me help you. NASA sends a man and two extras without paying space to orbit Saturn. A really big solar flare makes Colonel Steve West bleed through his nose. Things go downhill from there, and a madness occurs. <br /> <br /> In fact, I read the adaptation of the book, which was published and published only in the United Kingdom. MILES better than the movie, and the book was awful. At least a pretension to suspense is made, and some kind of explanation of the facts of the author's is extracted (rhymes with 'gas'). <br /> <br /> It does not mean that the movie is completely without merit. Rick Baker learned that he really had to read a contract before signing a movie, and Jonathan Demme found out that he really is better suited to direct. <br /> <br /> Yes, there is an episode of MST3K with this movie, but it is, of course, pretty much edited. Without the obligatory flash of the breasts, even the healing power of whiskey can not save you. <br /> <br /> Please go see the Raiders of the Lost Ark if you want to see how a boy melts. See Space Cowboys if you feel the need to see the astronauts. I can not, with all good conscience, recommend this film to the sober public of the cinema.
