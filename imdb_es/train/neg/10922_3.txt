['Worse than the rating that has been given. This is a typical SciFi movie today: from bad to horrible acting, a badly written script and poor quality direction. From the opening scene where DeMille is burying his game to the end, this movie is terrible. In the opening scenes, this film has Moses (who was Charlton Heston in the DeMille movie), Pharoah (Yul Brynner) and Nefretiri (Anne Baxtor) with a view to a child who was burying a box in the sand. The characters that represented the three icons mentioned above were horrible and had to look like the people who were supposed to be &quot;supposedly&quot;. The fact that this is in the desert away from civilization is hilarious when someone feels hurt and everyone asks for an ambulance. The scriptwriter obviously ignores the fact that there are no ambulances in the middle of the desert. I was deeply disappointed that Morena Baccarin decided to make a film of such low quality.']
