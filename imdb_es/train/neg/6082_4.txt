Although there are many well-known names for "television" associated with "A Man Called Sledge," there is nothing extraordinary about the film itself or about any of the performances. In fact, the only thing that distinguishes him from a television series of the sixties and seventies as "The Pat Patrol" is a bigger and much more violent cast. <br /> <br /> James Garner is the biggest star and apparently he thought he should try to separate himself from all the light comedies he had been doing ("Maverick", "Support Your Local Sheriff" - "Gunfighter", etc.) . Unfortunately, his earthly sympathy works against him, since Sledge is a humorless character written to capitalize on the popularity of Clint Eastwood's spaghetti western persona. But Eastwood's things were not so flat and uninteresting. <br /> <br /> I suppose "A man called a sleigh" could be classified as a western spaghetti, although the pace is too slow to adjust to that subgenre. Fans of the slow television series "Combat" will feel an instant connection when Vic Morrow directed the film and co-wrote the screenplay with Frank Kowalski. Incorporate some of the shots in slow motion and then dissolve, which draws attention to themselves instead of serving a purpose of storytelling. <br /> <br /> The plot is the standard "big robbery" thing (insert "The War Wagon" here) with Sledge planning how to steal a $ 300,000 shipment of gold. His band includes Claude Akins and Dennis Weaver. The problem is that while he is in movement, the shipment is protected by 40 foreigners and while he is detained, he is locked in a vault inside the territorial prison. I think there was an episode of "Alias ​​Smith and Jones" with the same argument. <br /> <br /> The story would be a decent hour for television, but it ages very fast as a very cushy feature film. Garner does not allow anything of his charm to seep into his characterization and the film does not generate enough suspense to maintain the interest of the viewer. <br /> <br /> The thing is finally blocked and burned shortly after the robbery when the gang gets involved. An artificial and totally illogical card game. <br /> <br /> Then again, what do I know? I'm just a boy
