I rented "New Best Friend" with the hope of a movie similar to the funny thrillers for teenagers like "Gossip" and "The Curve". In contrast, "New Best Friend" is much more like "The In Crowd", in which there are no emotions and the performance is incredibly false. "New Best Friend" is boring, and the events during the movie are the same. Skip this movie ... it's a waste of time.
