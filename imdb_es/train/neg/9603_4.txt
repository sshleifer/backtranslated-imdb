"A young woman suffers from the illusion that she is a werewolf, based on a family legend of an ancestor accused and murdered for supposedly being one of them." Due to her treatment passed by men, she travels in the countryside to seduce and kill men with whom he finds himself ... Falling in love with a kind man, his life seems to take a turn for the better when he is raped and his lover is killed by a gang of thugs Traumatized again by these last events, the woman returns to her violent ways and it looks for the revenge against the thugs ", according to the synopsis of the cover of the DVD. <br /> <br /> "The magnifying glass mannara" by Rino Di Silvestro begins with a frontal and twisted dance of the well-formed blonde Annik Borel, who (like Daniella Neseri) mistakenly believes that she is a werewolf. The hottest part is when the camera catches background fire between your legs. The opening flashback reveals that his hairy ancestor was (probably) a lycanthrope creature. Mrs. Borel, unfortunately, is not a werewolf; she is just a very strong lunatic. <br /> <br /> As a movie, "Werewolf Woman" (in English) would have been better if the Borel character was really a female werewolf; With its sexual victimization a great characterization. But, as far as the skin and blood films of the 70s are concerned, this is hard to beat. Bouncy Borel is naked or sexually dressed throughout the film, which presents a good amount of free blood. Dazzmar Lassander (as Elena) and Hunky Howard Ross (as Luca) are good support players.
