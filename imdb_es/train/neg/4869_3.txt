This movie could not explore the humanity of the animals, which left me with an empty feeling inside me. [Spoiler ahead] I was not convinced that Dr. D really had a compelling reason to give up the big purchase deal to help his furry friends. While Babe (the original) rejected the trend of big budget successes by focusing on the human virtues of animals compared to their human counterparts, all the animals in this film were nothing more than comic cartoons that one could include in the meat grinder (even more if one could understand his babbling without meaning). Without the stupid behavior of Eddie Murphy, this movie would be a failure.
