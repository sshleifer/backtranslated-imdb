The movie itself is so pathetic. It presented deaf people as cynics to hearing people. It is true that some deaf people distrust to go out with people who listen, but they are not necessarily angry, since the personage of Marlee Matlin was present in all the history. Deaf people do not go to the bar and dance like Matlin did. All in all, the movie itself is more boring than pathetic. It is so boring that I would like to believe that it is a film cured by insomnia. If I have trouble sleeping, I can simply appear in Children of a Lesser God and look. I will sleep <br /> <br /> Keep in mind that this is a deaf guy who speaks.
