I entered the theater with the intention of spending a pleasant 90 minutes entertaining if they did not enlighten me. I did not come out neither entertained nor enlightened. This movie can not decide what it wants to be and ends up being little of anything. There are some funny lines and some references of incredibly pretentious films (The 400 Blows, for this character? Leave it now!). Although none of the characters is treated with much respect, the more than thirty homosexual men get the worst: all predators, fat, sad, lazy. If you feel like watching a movie about homosexual relationships, check out Parting Glances, Longtime Companion, Trick, All Over the Guy, Red Dirt, Maurice, Philadelphia. You will thank me. <br /> <br />
