I gave this one 1. There are so many twists in the plot that you can never be sure to encourage. Total chaos. All are killed or almost like that. I'm tired of crossing my hair and changing my mind. I can not give the plot. Convoluted and crazy. If I had paid to see this, I would ask you to return my money. I wish the reviews were more honest.
