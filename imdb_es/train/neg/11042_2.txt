I wish I could say that this show was unusual in its banality, but it is usual in every way. He has the foolish husband, his most intelligent but boring and conventional wife, along with the idiot companion of the "comic" relief he desperately needs. The predictable jokes, with even more predictable reactions from the laughter band, mark the lines of the nauseatingly unimaginative plot of this harmful mental narcotic to leave me physically ill, or in a deep sleep more like that of an induced coma. But it could last a while yet because it gives the average American a character they can really identify with. A "normal" type like you and me. I live in the south of the USA UU opposed to escapism. Down here, that nasty character is everywhere, in one way or another. Watching him on television is a brutal exaggeration.
