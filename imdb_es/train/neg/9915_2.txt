I just finished "Dark Chamber" also known as "Under Surveillance" and I'm stunned. Stunned, not by the movie, but by some of the favorable reviews I examined, which influenced my vision. The story was so destroyed by the holes in the plot and most of the actors acted in a flat way, categorizing it as a comedy that seems appropriate. Seriously, I found myself shaking my head and laughing in bewilderment as I endured this movie. <br /> <br /> Justin abandons the limits of living at home with a mother addicted to painkillers to go live with her father, despite the mother. warnings that dad is not good. When a young woman is found murdered, Justin suspects the tenants residing in the adjacent apartments. With the help of a couple of friends, install secret cameras to control these people. When the truth begins to unravel, Justin discovers an unexpected secret. <br /> <br /> One positive point is that Felissa Rose is HOT! I would have generously slapped one or two additional stars here if she had fallen off a bit, but there was not so much luck. It would have been the potential salvation of the movie. Eric Conley played Justin very cleverly, I thought, and I would not be at all surprised to see more of him in the future. <br /> <br /> The general premise of the film, though riddled with clich√©s, could have worked if it had not been for the ridiculously empty "performances" of key cast members, especially Alexandra Eitel (Kayla) and David H. Rigg (justin's father). The horror! (sorry for the play on words). <br /> <br /> I have nothing against low budget movies. In fact, I think that independent cinema is our only hope for decent cinema in the coming days. I will reduce the low budget movies a lot when it comes to special effects, lighting, even musical scores and the overall image quality. However, I do not grant concessions for the performance of stick figures and the script of a Swiss cheese lover. There are a lot of low budget movies made by the competition. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. I can not help but suspect that at least some of the critics who have praised "Camera Obscura" here are somehow affiliated with its production.
