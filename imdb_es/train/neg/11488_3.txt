It is hard to imagine that someone could find this favorite as their favorite if they have seen most of their shorts, but I know that humor is VERY subjective. I have seen all his sound shorts (by far, the best of his things, OMI) and I found this one of his weakest efforts. <br /> <br /> In the year it was made (1930), Stan and Babe made 15. Shorts and a feature. They were extremely popular and their boss, Hal Roach, took full advantage to keep them working constantly. Also, this was a time of experimentation for the writers and Stan. I would say that this was an experiment that did not really work. As someone else said, he does not play with his strengths. Too much dialogue and plot. <br /> <br /> For me, the best part of this is the largely improvised sequence with Stan as Agnes the maid and the great Thelma Todd talking about "girls" things. <br /> <br /> If you really want to see the guys in their most creative and fun way, visit Blotto or Brats of the same year. <br /> <br /> They made so many shorts in such a short time that I think you can forgive for getting a few less than short pair. They did something like 108 movies in total. Very few (except those made on FOX) were direct failures, but there are some. County Hospital, Me and My Pal, The Live Ghost, The Fixer Uppers come to mind as essentially weak. But aside from that, I find something wonderful in almost all of your shorts. A whole record in my book. <br /> <br /> If you've seen and enjoyed all your other shorts, of course, check it out, but I'd be willing to bet that this was less memorable for Stan. and baby
