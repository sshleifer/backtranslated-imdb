I've seen my fair share of ill-conceived endings and final turns in movies, but I do not remember any movie that committed such an absolute suicide. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers clearly expected that the big turn would "surprise" us all ... and it did, but maybe not in the way the directors had expected. I was surprised that Connery, Harris, Fishburn and Capshaw had something to do with this turkey, individually or collectively. <br /> <br /> The film until the last thirty minutes was quite attractive and I like the way the story was developing and the nature of the film in general. But once the turn was revealed, the holes in the plot and the inconsistencies were remarkable, the underlying motive for revenge was ill-conceived and the ways in which things went so well for Bobby Earl were ridiculously far-fetched. What is worse is that, once the turn was revealed, the rest of the movie became unbearably predictable. <br /> <br /> Harris had an excellent performance and Connery is like Morgan Freeman in that he never gives a bad performance, even if the movie is not so good! So, in general, it starts well and the display keeps the viewer interested. The last 30 minutes is one of the most memorable dives in the history of cinema.
