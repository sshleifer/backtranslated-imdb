As for HEIST movies, this one is pretty weak. The continuity is quite bad, there is not enough character continuity to feel that you understand any of the characters. Peter Falk is great, and it's one of the reasons why it's worth seeing. Falk has some great lines, like "he'll be right back, he'll go buy some saugages" or something like that ... there are some nice scenes, although they are totally due to the efforts of the actors. The direction, the script and the editing are pretty bad.
