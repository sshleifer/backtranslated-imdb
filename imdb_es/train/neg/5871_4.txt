For me, the only reason to take a look at this remake was to see how bad and fun it could be. There was no doubt that it was funny and bad, because he had seen "Voyna i mir" (1968). Should we start? Here we go ... Pierre Bezukhov, Robert Dornhelm & Brendan Donnison, a thin guy who lacks the depth of the original; Robert Dornhelm and Natasha Rostova of Brendan Donnison - a scarecrow, his image can cause insomnia; Andrej Bolkonsky, by Robert Dornhelm & Brendan Donnison, an acceptable incarnation who, like the lean type (see above), lacks the depth of a Russian soul and "inner struggle"; Napoleon by Robert Dornhelm and Brendan Donnison - a pretty impressive leader; Robert Dornhelm and Prince Bolkonsky by Brendan Donnison - a turd with an English face; Robert Dornhelm & Brendan Donnison's Count Bezukhov - a spineless freak show ... <br /> <br /> The rest of the characters are not much better. <br /> <br /> The movements of the actors and the way They look and talk are often atrocious. They behave like modern EU citizens dressed for a one-day masquerade. Everything seems cheap and never comes close to the standards of our Russian men and women of the early nineteenth century. <br /> <br /> A good piece of entertainment to examine and tease. We had a few giggles in our office when we remembered this modern product, which had been shown the night before on our television. <br /> <br /> "User Rating: 8.0 / 10 (29 votes)" - I guess, many young people have never seen our movie ("Voyna i mir" 1968) or have a strange sense of the quality of " Tarantino-Spielberg. " Do you remember the scene in which our hussar is saving his friend, turns around, shoots and the bridge goes off? It looks like a CGI explosion. <br /> <br /> It does not make sense or trade to create a better version of the novel, which was projected correctly in our country once. But I'd love to see a Russian remake of "Gone with the Wind." Hey, directors, wake up and be busy with that, instead of ruining our classics. <br /> <br /> Now let's go back to common sense. No kidding. What I mentioned earlier is nothing new, although exaggeratedly deadly. <br /> <br /> Making foreign actors try to pass through the Russians (while participating in very serious epics and dramas) is a gross mistake and the filmmakers are making this mistake. and again. Of course, it gives rise to numerous laughs, especially Clemence Poesy is uncomfortably ridiculous and his way of dancing and singing makes a Russian spectator think: "This sucks so much that it's fun!"). <br /> <br /> To say something new, I would like to mention the rhythm of the movie. In my opinion, this new version is very irregular. The narration and the scenes do not flow naturally, they wobble and appear as in a modern video. Again, I have to remember our "Voyna i mir", where the action is so natural and the narration is so easy that you simply sit down and enjoy "going with the flow". <br /> <br /> I thought that maybe The Battle of Borodino would be great (to rehabilitate in some way numerous inconveniences) but it has not turned out to be a rival for the scenes of war filmed in 1968. <br /> <br /> There should be something good in this movie after all. And there it is. The actors seem to be trying to make everything work. They did not have an opportunity from the beginning, but they still joined the "team of losers". More 1 point for that imprudence. It makes a Russian spectator feel uncomfortable: some scenes are ironically ridiculous, although they are destined to be dramatically powerful and the actors are doing everything possible. Everything evokes pity and, sometimes, it adjusts to laughter. <br /> <br /> What I still like about this series is the last part. It shows very vividly how everyone receives their "salary and taxes". Also, judging from the film's advances, I thought the movie would have an adult sex scene, which would definitely kill the whole project. But, fortunately, it does not have so much garbage. And that is a great advantage. <br /> <br /> "Voyna i Mir" is not "Harry Potter" and today, even us, here in Russia today, do not have enough art to film it correctly. Do I have to say that the moral quality of our lives has deteriorated enormously? Fortunately, a suitable film was screened during our Soviet times. The American version of the 1950s was justified to some extent, ours did not even exist yet. Then there were extenuating circumstances. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 (1 point is awarded from the beginning, 1 point for recklessness and 2 points for the last part of the series.) Thanks for the attention.
