"The Bank" (1915, Chaplin) "The Bank" was one of the 1915 films of Charlie's Essanay. While this group of films is more visible than its 1914 counterparts, it seems to be a little below average. The gag with the vault of double combo with key and the end of bad luck that has to Charlie waking up of a dream, in which it caresses the hair of the leader woman, only to caress the head of a mop that had used like quasi. Pillow, are the two classic moments of Chaplin. Both are ironically the beginning and the end. The medium is full of fights with the rival work partner and robbing a bank to win the girl. The mop is probably the best physical accessory of this movie and Charlie uses it to get an expert comic effect, whether it is his character's intention or not. The mop seems to be Charlie's alter ego doing things he wishes he could do but would not do with his own hands. Interesting things but there are better.
