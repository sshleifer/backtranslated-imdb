First, Zorie Barber (Zeke), could be one of the worst actors I've seen in my life. As a character who is supposed to be a hypnotist, he is a Village writer in martial arts and is proud to be mysterious, why is he so hyperrealistic, dramatic and just plain horrible? Did you know anything about your character before they started filming? Director? Do not martial arts teach discipline? Apart from that, this movie loses its purpose with its jokes and bad humor. Hand in the bathroom? <i> Trainspotting </ i>. Masturbation? Hmm <i> Fast Times at Ridgemont High </ i>, <i> American Pie </ i>, the list goes on ... A bad dialogue: in a sequence, Eric says "it's none of my business <i> but </ i>. ... "and 30 seconds later, Mia says" why is this your business? "Bad editing: at least five minutes of film are wasted in traffic shots in New York. <hr> It is also impossible to believe that the four main male characters would be a group of close friends in any world. I can not comment on what makes everyone laugh, but if you enjoy the humor and the basic insults of the bathroom, of course, enjoy it. If you want something a little smarter but on the same line, see <i> Boomerang </ i>. If you want a solid romantic comedy, go for <i> The Tao Of Steve </ i>. But anyone who thinks that <i> Whipped </ i> is witty and dating from a precise representation, well, I can not agree.
