I'm not ruining anything when I inform you that you can see a woman having sex with a goat in this movie. If that's your thing, then your movie has arrived. <br /> <br /> A woman and her husband go to see their sister in the family mansion in the forest. His sister is a spooky woman, at least, and seems to have interests that go beyond family love. Next, a group of unpleasant characters appear and begin to perform all kinds of pagan rituals. <br /> <br /> The plot is quite weak and the characters are quite silly. The woman remains standing even after her husband becomes an idiot and spends time with the pagans, even continuing to have sex with him. On the exploitative side of things, there is a lot of uncovered meat and a couple of perverted couplings, but nothing that has not been better elsewhere. Oh, and the goat sex scene mentioned above. <br /> <br /> Most viewers will not reach the end. The fanatics of the exploitation will take advantage of it, but they will be left wanting more. <br /> <br /> 4/10
