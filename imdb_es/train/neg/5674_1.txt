My God, what's happening? A Uwe Boll movie and positive comments? Wow! <br /> <br /> It's good to keep in mind that most of the positive reviews come from the newbies in Boll's work. Myself, as I said in previous reviews of Uwe Boll, I only see his films with the hope that one day he will do something good. I mean ... YOU MUST SPEND A DAY! <br /> <br /> Oh! The seed is not that day. I'm not sure where to start with the scant attempt at a horror movie that is Seed. What you have to remind people is that all the sick in the world are like that because they have seen several acts of sick people in video or on the net ... or so Mr. Boll believes. I still can not, for my life, find out why images of abuses and murders of real animals were needed in the first 10 minutes of this movie. I understand the concept that Seed (the murderer) is sick and enjoys seeing those things ... but I can not understand why Mr. Boll thought that working with REAL images in the film would work. Maybe to surprise us? Hmmm ... well, for my part I'm not apprehensive and I can handle seeing anything in the movie. However, I do not believe that the use of real images of animal cruelty is entertaining in the least. If you were trying to surprise me, it did not work. It just reminded me how bad the world was because those things happen and also because Uwe Boll is allowed to continue making movies. This type of context may have worked for movies in the 70/80 (Cannibal Holocaust) but not in today's market. <br /> <br /> With that out of the way, we can move on to the fact that Uwe has managed to give the movie a very cheap feeling like BloodRayne 2. You can say there was not a lot of money for production. <br /> <br /> As usual, Mr. Boll really does not care for making a decent story since we are treated to boring images of cops watching several videos of Seed victims in the first 25 minutes. Each of these videos ends in an accelerated decomposition of the victim. Everything is very boring and tedious. I will not comment on the scene of young children, as it is ridiculous and just another factor of cheap shock. <br /> <br /> If you manage to sit for the first 25 minutes, you will be served by the walking police officers A very dark house to catch seeds. The lighting here is horrible and Uwe has the old 'I'm not using a fixed camera' fiasco he made with BloodRayne 2. Notice how the cops die in increasingly stupid ways until Seed is captured. This scene is so stupid that you have to see it to believe it. The policeman actually tells Semilla that he could have shot him. For some unknown reason, the police officer does not shoot him. Given that Seed is a sick person who kills both children and adults, at this point in the script you would have thought that sense would prevail. <br /> <br /> From here we are invited to a stupid execution scene, followed by the police burying Seed alive (and they know he is alive ... why not shoot him in the head?), followed by Seed coming out of the ground and then killing a woman at random with a hammer and then kidnapping the only one of the policeman's family. <br /> <br /> What I am trying to convey to all of you here is that it is simply STUPID! The horror of Hollywood is not even stupid ... just silly. Uwe Boll can not direct ****. Anyone with a little taste would agree with that statement. Anyone who sees this movie and finds it entertaining in any way or form, should be considered seriously as a person. <br /> <br /> Once again we are treated with a piece of SU badly written, directed, illuminated, produced and scripted.
