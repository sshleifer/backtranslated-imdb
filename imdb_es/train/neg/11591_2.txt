This movie is so incredibly bad that I almost felt sick to see it. Up to this point, the other quotas had at least one good thing about it. Part 1 was suspense and bloody. Part 2 was out of rhythm and entertaining. Part 3 was interesting with great effects. Part 4 had good music, good special effects and a new entertaining Freddy Krueger. Part 5 is more boring than anything I've seen before. Alice, a much prettier blonde, from Part 4 is back with her boyfriend Dan. In some parts, this supposed delivery of Elm Street becomes a daytime soap. The newer characters seem tough, and even that sweet Alice has a chip on her shoulder. Freddy seems to be completely out of this. He seems tired, and he does not seem so frightening. Your one-line phrases seem out of place and different, where, as in Part 4, they could be quite funny. The story of Leslie Bohem never takes off and the direction of Stephen Hopkins is so bad that it makes my grandmother look good. The whole plot of this movie is ridiculous and unrealistic. It is also confusing and quite stupid. Avoid Part 5 at all costs!
