I found the mediocre characters and the story uninteresting. I never had to read this book (thankfully), or it would have been a painful experience. I got the tickets for the preview for free, but it was still not worth it, or my friend's. I think this story is not worth telling. It's like saying that older people have a past before getting older (no kidding). The lives of the main characters were painful to watch, one generation no better than the next to avoid stupid mistakes. However, I think the actors did the best they could with a boring story. I've always been a big fan of Ellen Burstyn. I am writing this review to counter the positive reviews that, unfortunately, convinced me to try this movie.
