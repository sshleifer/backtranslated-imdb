I rented this movie to see what a bloody, non-stop movie could be, and I got this low-budget action drama too sentimental and super cheap that makes Kickboxer look like Die Hard. Lou and Reb are in Vietnam and when Lou saves Reb from the ghosts, he is shot in the head in what is easily one of the worst effects of the story. The scenes of Vietnam were shot in someone's backyard, I swear! Lou now has brain damage and he and Reb live together and own a bar. Super homoerotic Lou is convinced to fight in a cage for money and Reb goes off on a spree to get it back. There are no good fighting scenes, the blows are two inches away from a person. The personalities of the characters change in a matter of seconds. A boy is bad and in the next scene he is good. The acting is horrible and the music is a song that sounds too sentimental of Frank Stallone that would make you sick. I hated this movie.
