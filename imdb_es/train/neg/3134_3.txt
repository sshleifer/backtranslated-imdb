"The fallen" falls under the category of loss of life (WOL). It saddens me that I am now two hours older than he did not linger. The other members of my family also watched this movie and threw in degrading comments on the screen and searched for the mummy. I felt sorry for the actors (Wagner). I have read other negative reviews and I can not add anything else to this film that can not be reduced to 25 minutes, so I could take a space of 30 minutes on television without losing the plot. It reminds me of a dish that has several good ingredients, but when served it is tasteless and has no flavor. In my humble opinion, the 42-foot mummy should have been 8 to 10 feet and have improved the plot by eliminating the mystic and replace it with several people who want to ignore the facts and want DNA samples for evil reasons. The heroes are discredited and thrown into their ears by their colleges. Later, after everything was ruined by the evil people. The heroes would save the day and prove that everyone was wrong.
