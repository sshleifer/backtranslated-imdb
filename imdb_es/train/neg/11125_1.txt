Hey, look, deal with this, there are much better portraits of the difficulties of black America than this. Although I think this story is weak, my criticisms focus on the bad execution of the story, which I mentioned, blows. <br /> <br /> This was done in the mid-80s and it's horrible in the music / score department. It's funny to see Oprah as a last-minute prostitute. <br /> <br /> The scene where Bigger puts Elizabeth McGovern in the incinerator. Pure classic cinema. First of all, I do not care how drunk he is, he will react to the flames of 1200 degrees F (no matter how bad his performance is). But they really milked that scene ... it was funny. However, I will tell you that I was very pleased to see Elizabeth McGovern burn in a false death; she annoys me.
