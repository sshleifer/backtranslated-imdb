The extremely thin "plot" of satanic rituals or some of these mumbo-jumbo provides Hokey's excuse for joining large numbers of sex scenes. Direct vanilla sex, masturbation, lesbianism, S & M, bestiality, incest and some other cases of sexual proliferation have their moment in the spotlight here. The problem is that the story is so boring that unbridled sexuality becomes quite tedious after a while. Who knew that a movie with an intimate goat / girl encounter could be so boring? Ok, now yes. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Venessa Hidalgo shows it all; Helga Line provides T & A (both on display quite frequently); Female viewers get the occasional penis. <br /> <br /> My grade: D + <br /> <br /> Region 1 DVD Extras: "Pick Up" trailers, "Legend of Eight Samurai", "Do not answer the phone "," Prime Evil ", &" Sister Street Fighter "(also the same DVD contains a second movie" Evil Eye ")
