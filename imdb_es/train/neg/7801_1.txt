I will keep this as short as possible, since this piece of garbage hardly deserves a mention. ZOMBIE 90 is one of the worst movies ever made, right next to the other horrible entrance of zombies of Schnaas, ZOMBIE DOOM (also known as VIOLENT SH! T 3). These films are so bad that everyone involved in their creation should be filmed. Somehow I managed (barely ...) to sit through ZOMBIE DOOM, but ZOMBIE 90 is terribly inept, even compared to the other horrible Schnaas movie, which I had to fast forward on everything after the first 10 minutes. ZERO acting skills, inept gore, horrible camera work in the style of a camcorder, ridiculous dubbing ... it just goes on and on. I really can not find anything that I can redeem about this garbage, and I can usually find SOMETHING redeeming in ANY movie. This is really one of the worst movies that have been made, we have warned you ... 1/10
