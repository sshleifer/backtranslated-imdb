I was fascinated by how bad this movie really was. Was the viewer supposed to learn something, or reflect on something here? What happened to the pumpkins? Was I supposed to impress myself with the motel shots? Does it matter that there are some garbage bags on a roof across the street from a hotel? Why the narrator mocks unsuccessfully the people he interviews (it's so obvious that he edited the really informative parts of his interviews to make a mockery). The best part of the movie was the interview with the film teacher who tells us how bad this movie will be before it even ends. <br /> <br /> I'm really amazed. I think the creator is struggling to become an intellectual or is trying to impress the intellectual community.
