I could barely avoid assenting or simply putting out this shit, but I decided to keep it alone because of the reasoning that maybe "something" would happen. This is the work of a special writer / producer / director / fx, Kenneth Herts, who wants to make a statement about the ecological damage while making a monster movie. That's what he wanted, anyway. What results is a lot of acting, whether it's a bit hammy or just mundane and without much merit, and scenes that seem to repeat themselves like the monster ATTACKED in the river waters (oh, and what luck, a woman just happens to be naked in it. .. although there have already been DISAPPEARANCES!) <br /> <br /> This is just a pointless thing, but I guess it is not too harmful; it is not very unpleasant at least, and once or twice we have a semi-interesting look at the Brazilian "culture" (which is the father who walks through the city with his flock or other pieces of an 'hey' appearance, this is NOT America! '). But whatever hope the director had for choosing Mitchum or Carradine, it was wasted at best, in the worst case, and in the worst case in a silly and banal dialogue. It does not help that when we finally see the monster and the "action" happens, it is also stupidly organized and with only a sordid appeal. Usually, I would feel bad for a filmmaker who had a lot of trouble finishing a particular image, in this case, he took most of the half of the 70, but with Monstroid or Monster or whatever his name ... nah . <Br /> <br /> If you get Elvira's double DVD of this (Blue Print with poor transfer quality) with Blue Sunshine, be sure to skip this one. Unless, of course, you are an intransigent Elvira and can not help yourself to listen to his delicious comment; personally, I would prefer Joel or Mike Nelson to be with the Mystery Science Theater robots in this roast turkey.
