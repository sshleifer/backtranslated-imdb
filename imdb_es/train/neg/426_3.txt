Do not get me wrong, the film is beautiful, the shots are impressive and the material is dramatic. However, it was a big disappointment and, in fact, I was very angry about what Disney had done. <br /> <br /> The Planet Earth of the BBC was all the above and more. It was subtle. He had a general feeling of balance and showed the full circle of life and death. There was tragedy and triumph, loss and gain. It was balanced. <br /> <br /> The Disney edition of Earth is nothing like this. They tried to turn it into a movie that Americans would talk about. They did DRAMATIC. They put an exaggerated musical score to scare us. They made the predators bad. They did wrong to the WALRUSES. They showed each encounter as negative. He tried to be suspense and succeeded, but at the expense of the balance lesson. The film had an hour and a half of negative portraits and only about 10 minutes of positive results. <br /> <br /> I am in favor of preventing the global warning, but this was above the political and environmental garbage. <br /> <br /> That's another thing, I went to see it on the big screen, but I was disappointed with the quality of the image. It looked better on my TV at home. <br /> <br /> If you want to see something like this and get the full picture, go out and buy, rent or borrow the Planet Earth series from the BBC. It's better lessons, better sound and (if you have Blu-Ray) better image quality.
