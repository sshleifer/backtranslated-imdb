I saw this movie in New York City. I was waiting for a bus the next morning, so it was 2 or 3 in the morning. It was raining, and I did not want to wait at the PORT AUTHORTY. So I crossed the street and saw the worst movie of my life. It was so bad, I chose to stay and watch the whole movie, I still have not seen anything so bad since then. The year was 69, so call me crazy. I was left alone because I could not believe it .........
