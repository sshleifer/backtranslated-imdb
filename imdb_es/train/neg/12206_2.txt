I do not see many reasons to enter this film in much detail. Sylvester Stallone is once again John Rambo, author and survivor of "A Season in Hell", recruited in prison by his only friend, Commander Richard Crenna, to return secretly to Vietnam, to take photos of American prisoners believed to be still They are in a horrible camp, and they return without compromising the enemy. <br /> <br /> Great opportunity. What would happen if he really DID nothing but sneak in, take pictures and sneak away? Who would come to see the movie? <br /> <br /> It's essentially a celebration of Stallone's muscles. Preparing for his mission, we see his bulging muscles swollen. (They are greased and bulging throughout the body). There is the ritual harness of black leather, ugly weapons and even uglier knives. The black pistols are cleaned, assembled with loud noises and almost as oiled as Stallone's muscles. The bow is tested and, yes, it has enough weight to drive a lightning bolt through the forehead of an enemy. The knife is sharpened with polished splinters. <br /> <br /> Stallone and one of his prisoners of war are betrayed by one or two of Washington's suits, cynical politicians who, you can bet, were never in a fistfight school of Grammar. There's no guts, you know? Just sit with your feet on the desk and drink some foreign beer. <br /> <br /> The film does what it was proposed, but what was proposed is worthy. It deliberately borrows the popular myth in the mid-1980s that there were innumerable AMI groups kept quiet in the camps of the northern Vietnamese. Bumper stickers were everywhere. (Free our MIA). Why would they keep them? It was never very reasoned, but perhaps to turn prisoners of war into a slave labor force, in a country that has absolutely no other recourse than work. Or perhaps because of its propaganda value as an instrument to humiliate the United States, a propaganda weapon that the Vietnamese kept secret from the world. <br /> <br /> As a captive, Rambo is treated in a medieval way by the North. Vietnamese. Submerged in his neck in pig droppings and then pulled from him by his wrists, his muscles still on display. Then, not happy with the subhuman Vietnamese, a Russian officer is hired to play the role of Gestapo officer: "Vee haff vays of MAKING, remember." As a high-tech guy, the Russian uses psychology and electricity, not just the dumpster. <br /> <br /> Rambo returns and declares that he intends to drift aimlessly until "this country loves us as much as we do". raising another myth that veterinarians returning from Vietnam were spit on and cursed in a uniform way, so I think we elected many to Congress and appointed others to high-level positions. The last three lost presidential candidates were among the despised group. At least, the room on the left of Rambo aimlessly opened for a sequel, which arrived quickly. <br /> <br /> Action movies with Schwarzenegger and Willis and others were peppered with jokes, but Rambo has no humor. March properly through its ghostly ideological swamp, killing mercilessly, barely speaking, barely able to speak. Speaking is a sign of weakness.
