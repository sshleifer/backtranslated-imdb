As a child, in the 1970s, a local theater had children enrolled every Saturday and Sunday afternoon (does anyone remember them?). They showed this thing one year around Christmas. Me and some friends went to see him. I was expecting a good movie from Santa Claus. What I got was a terribly dubbed movie (you can say) and really creepy. <br /> <br /> Something about Santa Claus and Wizard Merlin (do not ask me what those two do in the same movie) fighting Satan (a joker in a silly demon costume complete with horns!). The images had me trembling in my seat. For starters, I always thought that creepy Santa did not help me. The guy in Satan's costume did not help. But what REALLY horrified me were the wooden reins that pulled Santa's sleigh. When he wrapped them up and the creepy sound they made and the movements, I remember having nightmares about those things! All these years later, I still remember leaving that theater more than a little annoyed by what I saw. My friends were also somewhat scared. I just saw an ad on TV and ALL those nightmares came back strongly. This is a spooky and disturbing little Christmas movie that will probably scare any child who sees it. Avoid this, unless you really want to punish your children. This gets a 1.
