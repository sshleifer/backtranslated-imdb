I do not even want to call this movie, it's a movie that should not have won any awards. The acting was horrible as were the silly stages. This is exactly the kind of movie that many people think caters to an NRI audience, but in fact is hated overseas for its discomfort and the overwhelming feeling of "trying" throughout the film. <br /> <br /> I find it strange that so many actors familiar with the English language have so much difficulty doing so convincingly in front of the camera. I am sure that many readers know what I am talking about: all those English phrases in token released in a film, in Hindi and in regional cinema in search of interesting points. There are few Indian films in which English seems completely genuine. Ser Cyrus was recent. Although it's not a great movie, it was a good movie and the language did not seem "put". <br /> <br /> I feel embarrassed that P3 has been awarded the NFA in 2005. The only semi-nice parts of this garbage were Konkana and a somewhat catchy background score. Apart from that, do not even waste your time with this movie.
