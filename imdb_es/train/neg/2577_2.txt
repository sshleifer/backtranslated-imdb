This story had a different angle that intrigued me, enough to buy a VHS seen at first sight. That was a mistake. <br /> <br /> In what could have been a very good story, about severely disabled people in a hospital and their various personalities, it quickly became a very profane soap opera with unpleasant characters. <Br /> <br /> We have "Bloss" (William Forsythe), the racist white person stereotype, who says the word f every other sentence and is so despicable that he did not get a first name in the movie. It's very fun to be close. Then there's "Raymond Hill" (Wesley Snipes), a womanizer who talks fast. Snipes must have liked those arrogant "hip" papers to talk fast because he played in several of them, as in "White men can not jump". Then there is the sweet Helen Hunt playing "Anna", that wonderful and loving person who has an adulterous adventure with the main character of the film, "Joel Garcia" (Eric Stoltz). <br /> <br /> Yes, this is comforting, things to feel good about. It just makes my heart melt at the sight of these good people. But, if you are one of those lovers of sordid characters played by sordid people in this sordid movie ... maybe you like this! Add a dose of Hollywood political correctness and you're done! What else could someone want?
