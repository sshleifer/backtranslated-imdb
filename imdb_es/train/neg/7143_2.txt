This movie has some of the most incredible cars I've seen in a movie, and definitely the most attractive women, but I have to say it's still one of the worst movies I've seen. <br /> <br /> Here is the plot, and if you read it with a little inflection, you also have the acting. <br /> <br /> Starting, bring characters, singing hot woman (obvious lip syncing). The music agent or the producer comes in, thinks she is amazing and asks her to run. She rejects, too many bad memories. Flash to war hero, back from the war, has several fights and becomes a movie hero with the attitude that is better than all. Drive in exotic fast car. Brother runs, then dies. Hero to avenge death, cut to get weapons from a friend. (You've never seen this friend before or since, but he seems to really care about him) Are you sure you want to do this? Yes; I mean, are you really sure? Yes, give me the weapons; are you really sure; Yes; Ok, I guess I can not convince you not to do it, be careful, I love you. <br /> <br /> Now he is going to fly to the house of his uncles who was the owner of the car his brother was driving. Find a woman, he decides to rescue her, she leaves, and he does not finish killing his uncle. Now there will be a race to finish the movie. Oh yes, I need to include one more scene with bad people coming to hit people that do not really matter, but maybe that adds a little plot. The race is not that exciting, of course it ends with two car races, and one that should win in a surprise final. <br /> <br /> Well, I just saved $ 7.00. You can send me all your money, because I should have given you the same amount of fun as this movie. Do not get me wrong, the cars are amazing and Nadija is beautiful, but it's really a horrible movie.
