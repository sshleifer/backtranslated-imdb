At the time of writing this review, it seems that more than 50% of IMDb voters gave this film a rating of 10 or 1. I can only assume that those who awarded it 10 were members of the cast or crew. <br /> <br /> They say that, given enough monkeys and time and enough typewriters, those monkeys, simply by typing at random, would eventually write the complete works of Shakespeare. However, I seriously doubt that, given the same amount of monkeys and time, I could find one to give this film a rating of 10. I patiently watched the first half, foolishly assuming that the movie was in some way. level, develop the plot or the characters, or maybe make some kind of social comment or provoke a barely intellectual thought. Failing that, I was quite prepared to accept action, suspense, comedy, horror or even free sex as a way to keep my attention. Ultimately, I was disappointed and, as a result, much of the second half was seen at double speed while I searched in vain for some small fragments of cinematic redemption. Unfortunately, there were none. <br /> <br /> If "The Choke" was presented against an episode of Scooby Doo, then I'm afraid the cartoon would easily win in terms of mystery, intrigue and unpredictability. And speaking of cartoon characters, the acting skills of the various cast members ranged from acceptable (at best) and embarrassingly poor to Brooke Bailey's portrayal of the death-obsessed, obsessed pseudo goth, London, for being so bad that I almost felt sorry for her. I would have liked to have finished on a positive note, but even the soundtrack, a second-class contemporary punk rock party, did not even entertain, let alone served to improve a very bad movie.
