Based on the dark bestseller of Ray Russell, this bust directed by Hough, John (WATCHER IN THE WOODS), has little in its favor. <br /> <br /> Although it does not lack bloody violence, it lacks narrative sensitivity and "characters". <br /> <br /> The "Incubus" of the title is a demon gifted with a mammoth penis that shoots red sperm into the vagina during intercourse, or, to be more precise, rape. <br /> <br /> John Cassavetes, in the light of his successful directorial career, is convincing as a doctor who questions the circumstances of the strange attacks on young women. <br /> <br /> The horrible possibilities of the victims that generate demonic descendants are not considered, and neither is the tolerance of the public to the slowly moving garbage. <br /> <br /> The reluctance of the script to explore the dramatic repercussions of a fertile premise exemplifies the main problems with this vivid Big-Schlong-On-The-Loose exercise.
