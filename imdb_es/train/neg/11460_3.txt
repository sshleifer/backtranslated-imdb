A pretty funny piece that tries to show how smart the orcas are, but meanwhile (and quite alien to them) makes the audience feel stupid by making the movie more ridiculous. Richard Harris plays with Quint. I'm sorry, that's wrong, he plays Captain Nolan, a fisherman who catches sharks for a living, but he's attracted to the big catch, and he tries to catch a killer whale. When the capture of a female orca goes wrong (do not ask), your partner (do not ask) rages (does not ask) and begins to SPEAK to Captain Nolan (Do not ask). Soon, Captain Nolan realizes they have something in common (do not ask). Pretty amazing people doing movies here. However, I have to tell you that the beginning (with the noises of the whales and nothing else) is quite disturbing and the final credits (with the most fearful song) are quite entertaining.
