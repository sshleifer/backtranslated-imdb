Ok ... I only have 3 words - corny, cheesy and CHEESE! The only feature that redeems this movie is Dean Cain. Apart from that - it's SUPREME cheeseball !!!! <br /> <br /> The movie has some promise in the concept - an underground lab creates a real breathing dragon from the real fire - basically it gives us more of "Jurassic Park" meets "Reign of Fire" ..... There are some great possibilities, but they just do not ... The special effects are decent, although you KNOW that the dragon is CGI, it does not look horrible CGI ... <br /> <br /> I would not blame it on Dean Cain (although he is one of the producers), would blame Phillip Roth, the director and writer. It's YOUR job to make this movie ... and, unfortunately, he failed.
