Let me start by saying that I had read several reviews before renting this movie and I knew what to expect. However, I was surprised at how bad it was. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of werewolves, and I've become accustomed to forgiving a lot when I see one. Most of them have low quality effects, poor performance and weak stories (in the best case, repeated from previous films). So far, with the possible exception of some of the latest films in the "Howling" series, this is the worst of all. <br /> <br /> First, the story. It has been cited several times in reviews on this site, so I will not go into details. However, it is very obvious that the writer (s) had no affinity with the lycanthrope monsters. As often happens when a horror film is delivered to a writer who considers himself "above" that kind of fare, they tried to turn the myth of the werewolf into a new twist. That's fine, but a fan who does not deal with horror and tries to do this, usually ignores the intelligence and sophistication of the horror audience and ends up writing to them. The plot feels like a parody of the werewolf movies, and the events that are shown simply sound so fake that I felt my intelligence was being seriously insulted. Television news images, for example, never move away from the reporter to approach someone in the crowd behind them. Give the characters and the viewer credit for being able to spot the bad guy in the scene without using a neon sign. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. <br /> <br /> As for the effects, I have NEVER seen a werewolf less credible. I would have been happier with Lon Chaney Jr. in the crepe hair. The beast they used looks a lot like ... well, like a guy in a cheap rubber suit with a little bit of hair stuck on it and a bit of really horrible animatronics. And, I know many people have already criticized the GC, but my God, it was horrible. One of the scenes shows a woman who changes, and begins with a completely CG version of the actress, naked but for some reason without nipples. My first thought was: "Hey, why is one of the characters in 'ReBoot' turning into a silly-looking werewolf?" <br /> <br /> Anyway, I like to look positive in any movie, and there were a few. The cinematography was passable (the film was filmed entirely digital, which is interesting) and some of the performances were not terrible. It was also interesting to see Tippi Hedron as the best invented homeless woman in the world, and Kane Hodder as the bad guy in the title. Also, the Yellow Power Ranger grew up and ... well, damn it. And if you're looking for skin, there are some pretty tasty examples. This ends with the male pig segment of the review. <br /> <br /> In general, if you want a good werewolf movie, try "An American werewolf in London", the original "The Howling", "Dog Soldiers", or even "The Wolfen" (although that has more wolf than the previous one). If you are a complete lycanthrope, then take a look. Otherwise, do not miss this one.
