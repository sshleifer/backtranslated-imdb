I do not know what else to say about this horrible movie that has not been said yet. Honestly, I just have to get angry. I should have known better when I saw the title of this movie that would be horrible shit, but I loved the War Games, so I gave myself up to my whim. I will live to regret that decision for the rest of my life. From the beginning, when the government people explained that their super computer could determine who was a terrorist just for the good of playing a videogame, I knew that I expected a walk on earth that forgot good writing. The list of plot lines, dialogues and very, very, very bad performances is so long that I would like to crash IMDb if I tried to publish it. To those people who said they have seen worse movies than this one, please tell me. Actually, I'm curious to see something that can overcome this pile of smoking horse manure.
