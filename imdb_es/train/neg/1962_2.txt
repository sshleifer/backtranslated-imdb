The only scary thing about this movie is that whoever did it could make a sequel. <br /> <br /> From the beginning to the end, "The Tooth Fairy" was simply terrible. It seemed like a misplaced children's movie that got confused, with a "Wizard of Oz" melting and happy children ended up combined with some bloody effects and bad words. <br /> <br /> Half of the cast seems completely unnecessary except conveniently being there to be killed in some way. The sister of the two brothers, Cherise, the aura reader, and Mrs. McDonald make no sense in the film; they could have included them in the main plot of some interesting stories, but apparently they could not be bothered. The people watching the movie know that the characters are there for a bloody death scene, but come on, at least TRY and have a little plan for them. The story in general is weak with the erratic behavior of the characters that makes you want the witch to eat them. <br /> <br /> Add the weak plot and weak action of others (children are particularly wooden) and the film ends a complete failure. If only MST3K could have had an opportunity in this ...
