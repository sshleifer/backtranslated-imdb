It was so terrible. It was not fun to look at at all. Even the scene in which the girl uses a vibrator, even that is not fun to watch in this movie. I repeat, the scene in which a girl masturbates with a vibrator is not even fun to watch. Or maybe if that was the only part of the movie you saw, just girl on the couch using a vibrator. Maybe they should have released that one scene in theaters, maybe then the movie would be nice on some level. My advice, move quickly to that point, look at it, rewind the film, watch it again, rewind, repeat. Maybe you could enjoy 2 hours that way. This movie is next to the one I spit on your grave and the generation of Doom in the category of the worst movies I've ever seen.
