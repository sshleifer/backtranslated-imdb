The movie has several story lines that follow several different characters. The different lines of the story do not feel like a complete piece, which makes this comedy very incoherent and, sometimes, even annoying to watch. <br /> <br /> It may sound weak and cliche, but it's true; You're much better off watching the Crocodile Hunter series on the Discovery channel with Steve and Terri Irwin. It's more fun and even more fun than this movie. I'm sure both the cast and the crew had a lot of fun doing this movie, but the movie does not give us much pleasure to the viewers. For a comedy, it's just not funny enough, and Steve and Terri Irwin are just not good actors, not even when they play themselves! Their antics are simply not good enough to make a whole movie become a long, distracted and unnecessary scene and even annoying at times. <br /> <br /> The movie had a lot of potential, I mean, Steve Irwin is a character that in a strange way is both intriguing and hilarious to watch, so when I first heard that they were making a movie about 'The crocodile hunter', my first reaction was; sparkly! However, the film suffers in large part because of its weak history and incoherent story lines with uninteresting and ungraceful characters. The film has a certain entertainment value, at least enough to make this film can be seen at least once, but even so, I certainly would not recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie was like a waste of time. Even so, this film can be seen only once, when it appears on television, on a rainy afternoon. It has some good moments, but the story lines really completely ruin the film and its potential. <br /> <br /> 4/10
