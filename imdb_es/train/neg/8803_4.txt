I loved "Anchorman" The Legend of Ron Burgundy "and I expected this to be just as funny, but unfortunately, it was not, although some bits are excellent, I thought the sportsman, Champ Kind, who professed his love for Ron Burgundy in the car filled with the other members of the news team was very funny, everyone is ignoring him and he gets stronger and stronger and finally kisses Burgundy, which is not recognized either, but in general, the story does not gel. However, it is a noble attempt to save the unused fragments of the first film, including a complete plot about some fairly benign domestic terrorists called "The Alarm Clock." Maya Rudolph of Saturday Night Live is one of the members and has a couple of funny lines, but basically this unused plot has a good reason not to be used in the first movie.The extras in this record are quite good, the best two are the fi trials With a lot of improvisational comedy, and the false comment with Will Ferrell and an "executive producer" that Ferrell discovers from the beginning was not part of the film. In any way, form or form. It turns out that he is "just a boy" who entered through the side door of the recording studio and pretended to be a producer. However, they are pretty funny things and last about 10 or 15 minutes.
