"Creepshow 2" is little more than a pale imitation of the original, designed with a different purpose than the previous film. It even amplifies the shortcomings of its predecessor, which was often predictable and heavy-handed. Still, the first time, there were enough emotions to make up for their periodic lulls, which resulted in an unequal but generally quite entertaining effort. The sequel has few worthwhile moments, so the transparency of the stories is even more evident. From time to time, delivery, but most of the time, it just stays there. <br /> <br /> As in the original, all the stories revolve around the common theme of revenge and desserts. A wooden Indian comes to life, causing revenge on the killers of its owner. The teenagers are devoured by an aquatic monster. A hitchhiker returns from the dead to chase a careless motorist. None of these premises are intrinsically bad in themselves, but they lack inspiration altogether. There are few surprises and it's not scary. This is an example of a textbook for the creation of movies not motivated by numbers. It does not help that this cheap looking film suffers a flat style of direction, although to be honest, there was not much to work with. In the end, the second story comes out better, but not by much. <br /> <br /> For the most part, the performances are fine at best. George Kennedy, like the ill-fated owner of a general store, does an adequate job, if not particularly inspired. Dorothy Lamour, on the other hand, is quite good as the guilty motorboat, which evokes sympathy for her situation despite the predictable and redundant material. However, most of the characters are quite thin in general. <br /> <br /> One would think that "Creepshow 2" would have been better. George Romero, who directed the original, rewrote the script, based on more Stephen King stories. Makeup effects artist Tom Savini delivers a bloody good job. So, why is the movie a disappointment? I guess Romero really did not want to make a second movie, but he was forced to do it for financial reasons. It was a decade of horrible sequels, clones, scams and all that, so this was certainly inevitable. I can imagine the guy who writes the script hastily, picking up his paycheck and running away. I suppose he had to do what was necessary for his own projects to be financed; We can not blame him. <br /> <br /> Rating: * 1/2 (of ****) <br /> <br /> Launched by New World Pictures
