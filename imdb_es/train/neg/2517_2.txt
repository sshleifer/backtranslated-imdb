This movie is the perfect illustration of how NOT to make a science fiction movie. The worst tendency in science fiction is to make your subject a horrible, sophisticated, pseudo-Orwellian / huxleyana / any other "human future" vision. <br /> <br /> Science fiction filmmakers (and authors), like geeks, take themselves very seriously, given the high proportion of garbage of their gender. I think other genres with a high CTGSR (yes, I invented it, I relax), like horror or action or even romantic comedy, seem to understand a little better the fact that they are not changing the world with some depth ". . "<br /> <br /> Science fiction can certainly be successful on a serious level, as many great filmmakers have shown. But there is an immense drawback in the whole concept, which is represented by "Robot Jox", with its low-cost construction of the "future" (element of good design alone: ​​bizarre billboard ads and elegant look all over the place that I encourage women to have more babies) and their "Iliad" paralelists painfully heavy (IT IS NAMED ACHILLES FOR THE JUMP OF GOD!) In fact, I did not realize this until I saw the film for the tenth time, but I went to public school, so the filmmakers are not exonerated.) <br /> <br /> Of course, if you are a movie madman like me, this disadvantage has great potential. I love movies like this, because bad movies are often funnier and sometimes even more interesting than good ones. I guess it's a kind of Lester Bangs approach to watching movies. <br /> <br /> Note: The protagonist of this movie (Gary Graham? Is that his name? I refuse to go see.) It really is not that bad. . He makes a play. It's a little cool, especially when he's drunk / hungry.
