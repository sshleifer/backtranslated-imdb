Good people, I stumbled upon this movie at night while I was grading papers. My academic specialty is Anglo-Saxon literature, and I can say that nobody has ever done the kind of honor it deserves. The Icelandic "Beowulf and Grendel" is the least offensive I've seen, and I paid $ 3.00 for my copy. This version of science fiction is aligned with the version of Christopher Lambert. Yuck <br /> <br /> What did I not like? CGI for one. Surprisingly bad. More important is the loyalty to the plot, not to mention the forced action. I'm used to both with all the versions I've seen. <br /> <br /> Delighted Independently, Peter
