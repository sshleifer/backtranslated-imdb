['I regret to say that there is no way, in my opinion, that an Enzo can really keep up with a Saleen S7 Twin Turbo. The power of weight advantage that the S7 possesses would be too great. The S7 has a power: weight ratio of 3.93 lbs / hp, while the Enzo has 4.61 lbs / hp. The low end of the S7 is much better too. Sorry, the Ferrari fans, but the Saleen gets it much better. <br /><br /> As for other parts of this movie, I just have to say that it is so deficient as to be pathetic. The story is too weak. The performance in this lemon is worse than day soaps. <br /><br /> I can say that in regard to a treatise on negative psychology, it is a kind of jewel. This film is nothing more than a dazzling definition of what narcissism and sociopathy are about. It&#39;s about these rich punks who take off the stones while showing only traces of feigned regret for all innocent road users that cause injury or even death. <br /><br /> I can not give the movie a &quot;1 star&quot; rating because it did not force me out of the theater. I also think that having an incredibly beautiful brunette with murderous blue eyes like the leading woman prevents her from being completely abysmal ... although there is no way that her singing will put her on the cover of &#39;Variety&#39;. <br /><br /> ps: the guy who plays Jason is SOOOOO, the skating version of James Vanderbeek.']
