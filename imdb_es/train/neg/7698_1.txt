Can I give this one a rating of less? Do not? Well, let me tell you, this is the most atrocious movie I've tried to see. It was painful. Boringus maximus. The plot (?) Is well hidden in several sub-levels of nebulosity. I rented this movie with a friend and, after about thirty minutes of waiting for it to get better, we decided to "move on" a bit to see if things were going to get better. It never gets better. This movie about a guy who has been kidnapped by these two girls, sounds interesting, but, in reality, it's just a bore. Nothing even remotely interesting ever happens. If you ever have the opportunity to see this, do yourself a favor, try "PLAN NEW FROM OUTER SPACE" instead.
