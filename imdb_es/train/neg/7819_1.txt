... This would be the worst movie I've ever seen. Hmmm, okay, maybe tied with Boogeyman then. Terrible, really horrible. <br /> <br /> I had little expectations and I could not fulfill them. Honestly I can not think of a good thing. So here are the worst points ... <br /> <br /> 1. THE PERFORMANCE 2. THE PLOT 3. THE CGI (Xbox 360 has better graphics ... seriously) 4. THE PLOT 5. THE DIALOGUE and finally ... 6. THE PLOT <br /> <br /> There are so many unanswered questions, did they make a movie of 2:32 hours and then they realized that they had not put Lex Luthor and Superman in a scene together and they were forced to settle for the 3 minute bit or did they really think that nobody would notice? That the main hero and the villain have less time in front of the screen than the son of Superman and the henchman who kills? !! <br /> <br /> Was half the budget spent on persuading Kevin Spacey to do it? <br /> <br /> When Superman goes to the hospital, why do not doctors ask "What the hell do you want us to do ?! It's a fucking alien! We do not know anything about his anatomy!" <br /> <br /> What happened in the 5 years that Superman was absent to make the technology advance 28 years? <br /> <br /> Where are the people who wrote good reviews watching the same movie? <br /> <br /> and finally, why? Just because? <br /> <br /> By the way, for those of you who are wondering why Superman could raise an entire continent of Krypyonite, I think I've discovered it ... <br /> <br /> ... from Superman he is not affected by the kryptonite until he sees something green on the rocks, clearly everything is in his head. therefore, the question of the continent is just that he suppresses his fear of the bright green rock ... <br /> <br /> Either that or the writers are lazy with their mouths open and did not think it was a pretty mistake obvious.
