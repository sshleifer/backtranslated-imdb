Normally, I am a very generous critic, but in the case of this movie I have to say that it was incredibly bad. I am surprised at how positive most of the reviews seem to be. <br /> <br /> There were some great shots, but it's a shame that they were wasted in this hole in a movie. It could have worked if "Daggers" was purely an action movie and not a romance, but unfortunately the movie is built around an empty love triangle. There is no chemistry between couples, what exists between Mei and her men seems to be more lust than love, and for the most part the dialogue is simply silly. This may be just a problem with the translation, but the frequent use of the word "flirt" in particular reminded me of 8th grade students, not head over heels, together forever, worthy to die for love; I also felt that we were hit in the head with the metaphor of the wind. The characters are given very little audience to really care, and therefore, very little emotional investment in the film in general. I was wishing a remote control would move quickly, I was slumped in my seat ready to snore, but most of all I cringed a lot. <br /> <br /> ******* spoiler ***** <br /> <br /> Now, the icing on the cake. Or rather, adding insult to injury. The ending was truly one of the most horrible and laughable I've seen. The boys are having their deer fight and screaming and yelling and hacking at each other. Oh, and then it starts to snow. Random Ah, and then Mei (dagger embedded in the heart) suddenly emerges from the undergrowth. Then he throws a dagger that seems to take about 5 minutes to reach its destination, even decelerating conveniently the average screen to hit a small drop of blood. Wow great. <br /> <br /> Well, then Mei finally dies, I suppose, because she threw the dagger that was lodged in her chest and bled to death. Jin sings, sobs, keeps his body close, the screen goes blank. I, and the people around me, are laughing. It is not a good sign. <br /> <br /> Visually impressive, but ultimately it is a failure.
