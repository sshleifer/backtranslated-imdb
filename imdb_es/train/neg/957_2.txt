Then, I got an assignment from this as an assignment for Trent Harris, who teaches occasionally in the U.S. movie department. I guess this is your only real way to get someone to watch your movie ... <br /> <br /> The documentary section at first dragged. Yes, the child is a nutcase out of nothing, but that's not good enough to keep him interesting. <br /> <br /> Seeing Sean Penn dressed as an ONJ is the only highlight ... and after about thirty seconds he loses all humor. <br /> <br /> When Crispin Glover confronts Larry, the storytelling was better, but he could not take it anymore ...
