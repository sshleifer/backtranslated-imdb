Forgive me for saying the obvious, but some movies are good and others are bad. Of course, there are extremes within those two broad categories. Movies like The Godfather, Saving Private Ryan and Star Wars are comfortably in the good category. At the other end of the spectrum there are movies that just do not deserve to be mentioned by name. Occasionally, however, someone produces a truly unfortunate movie. A film that should be highlighted as a demonstration of how horrible a movie can be. A movie that is more than bad. Such a movie is Maiden Voyage. <br /> <br /> Briefly, Maiden Voyage is a story about a luxury cruise ship that is hijacked by a gang of evil criminals demanding a ransom from an evil and evil ship owner. Of course, there is a totally American hero on board, complete with a chiseled jaw and a sculpted chest, which saves the day. <br /> <br /> This is a production that opens new depths. Everything is bad. The acting, the direction and the so-called plot are incredibly poor. In short, it is an insult to the intelligence of any unfortunate spectator. Even an American viewer would be annoyed by his shortcomings. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's so bad. <br /> <br /> I will resist the temptation to compose a list of things that angered me about this movie. . However, your dumbest conclusion should be an adequate example of what I mean. <br /> <br /> Imagine in your mind that you are an evil kidnapper and you find yourself in an open lifeboat in a calm sea. . You're in the company of the hero who has a tick-tock bomb. This hero throws the bomb and throws overboard. What would you do? I do not know about you, but I would throw the bomb as far as I could into the sea. Not this boy. Watch as our hero moves away and then tries to disarm the bomb with unfortunate results (for him). Enough talk. Such a demise would deserve a mention on the Darwin Awards website and could also be an appropriate conclusion for the lives of the production team.
