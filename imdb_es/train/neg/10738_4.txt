This was a blind purchase of used DVD. It totally killed a good buzz I had when I played the game. <br /> <br /> It's a bubble-head comedy, but it's um miserable. The plot is ZANY !, but the characters do things with each other that are so petty, disturbed and conveniently devised that in the end I found it depressing to see them. <br /> <br /> Maybe the box leads me to expect something more than an uneven and silly caper movie. (I know, I know, the appointments in the box and the Academy Award nomination do not mean anything).
