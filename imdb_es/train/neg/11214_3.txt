I also saw this movie at a local screening about a year ago. First, I will say that it looks very good. Cassella is incredibly talented and a fantastic cinematographer. I just wish the movie had been as good as it looks. I would not call this a horror movie. Putting a few pictures of a decomposing ghost does not make it a horror movie. There is no mystery, there is no suspense, you know who did it all the time. <br /> <br /> It's a drama. You know what is happening with both sides of the whole movie. The performance was fine, I suppose, but nothing special. <br /> <br /> And the motto "Revenge can be deadly" ... really? ... they should have checked how many hundreds of horror movies and suspense. Do movies have exactly the same motto? <br /> <br /> It hurts me to say something about this, but I know many of the people who worked on this film, and I know they do not want people to smoke. His ass, that's why I give my honest opinion.
