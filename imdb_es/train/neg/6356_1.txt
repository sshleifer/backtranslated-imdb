If I accidentally found this script in the form of a text, I would read it and maybe I would laugh. However, I would not laugh at the points in the film where the director seems to want me to laugh. Although I'm still not entirely sure where they are. I do not care if it is about Woody Allen, this writer can not write dialogues, or at least he can not write dialogues knowingly and then draw performances of actors capable of provoking laughter from even the most delicate clowns. For example: <br /> <br /> (paraphrasing) "I am an art historian, I am looking for a job in an art gallery". <br /> <br /> Well, he says so, but honestly, do you know any art historian who says that? How would you respond? <br /> <br /> "Really? An art gallery? Who would have thought?" <br /> <br /> The entire script is filled with the kind of quasi-intellectualism in bad taste that I would not have expected from such a respected character writer. I admit that I am not aware of Allen's other work and, judging from this, I do not want to start learning. The characters are disgusting without exception, an attempt to illustrate that we all suffer from the human condition? Or the writing of the really very poor character? You are the judge.
