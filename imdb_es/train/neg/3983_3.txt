Irene Dunne finished her illustrious career with this regular movie. I should have left with desire, being the classy actress that I was, not in this almost unknown film, almost unknown. <br /> <br /> This light comedy is fine, but nothing special. The first half is much better as it becomes quite stupid in the second half. Maybe Irene could see the writing on the wall and resign. Even his high voice became a little annoying here. It is rumored that I was not happy with this movie. One can see why. <br /> <br /> The story reminded me of a television comedy from the 1950s. Speaking of which, I thought that David Nelson from the television show Ozzie & Harriet was in this movie, but it turned out to be a very young Richard Crenna. He looked and sounded like Nelson. <br /> <br /> In general, in the best case and in a final subparado for a great actress.
