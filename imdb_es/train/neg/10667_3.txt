Do not be fooled by all the big names like Burt Reynolds, James Woods and Anne Archer. They are only glorified extra. His scenes were probably filmed in a day or so. Whatever your reasons for being in this movie, if you have an actor like James Woods, it's better that you make good use of him. For me this is a sign of misdirection through and through. The plot itself was not that bad. And the performance of most of the actors was above average. Cuba Gooding Jr., however, was terrible. It was so incredible that I almost laughed at his dramatic scenes. And since this was thought of as a serious movie that can not be a good thing. The action scenes were not bad, but they lacked that special hit to make it more exciting. Again, a better direction was needed. Also the pace was wrong for a movie like this. The main character took almost half an hour to take action. For an action thriller of only 90 minutes it is too slow. The only redeeming factor is Angie Harmon. She does everything possible to make everything work. Too bad the director left it hanging. Yes, this movie could have been much better with a great director. Andy Cheng is too inexperienced as a director to achieve it. And for an action coordinator / doubles of your caliber, I would expect at least more exciting action scenes. Do not waste your time with this. Avoid!
