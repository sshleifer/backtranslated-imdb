Nothing positive to say. No winding sense, huffing and puffing with a "message". The new Russian films (post-Soviet) can be very good (Cuckoo comes to mind), however, many have the cardboard bouquet and the aftertaste of asbestos (Nochnoi Dozor would be a good example). This is a kind of empty "dozor". Acting would be horrible if it were not for the saving grace of a totally unattractive direction and an incompetent edition that is sometimes so horrible that it distracts the impotence of the actors. Special award to the cameraman to ensure that each shot is unstable (would anyone realize that Blair Witch has had his 15 seconds of undeserved fame?) And the shots are aimed at pre-teens with attention deficit that decrease in CounterStrike and the masturbation. The female protagonist poses and tries to appear seductive all too often, the male antihero needs a diction coach (although genetics is not bad: the eyes are rather expressive). One finger (middle) for this irrelevant pile of art. Anyone who reviews this positively will be a cousin (distant) of the "authors".
