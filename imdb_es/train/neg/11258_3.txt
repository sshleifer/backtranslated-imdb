I have said this in other reviews, without a story, you can give the public all the smoke and mirrors you want, but no one will give a shit. <br /> <br /> The director seems to have a great eye for the art deco of the 30s (which I love), and I think the idea of ​​using all digital backgrounds and, in fact, could be the wave of the future in the creation of movies. However, it is obvious that the director was so interested in the digital representation of his film, that he forgot to shoot many scenes that would have greatly helped this surprisingly thin film. (SPOILER) For screaming out loud, they forgot to have a villain in this thing! Okay, they have one, but he died 20 years ago when the movie takes place. Conran loses the point of having a villain. As for the action, well, let's see, Sky Captain (Law) takes down ONE robot, two or three of the wing-wing planes (before Dex (Ribisi) tells him to stop firing), and a couple of robots. , but spends most of the time looking for shouts and getting others to fight their battles for him. Paltrow like Polly or Peggy or Punky or whatever is completely wasted in this movie (the critic who comments on his and Law's lack of chemistry is very accurate) and, for my part, I got a little sick to see Repeated shots from the top of your camera. showing that ONLY HAVE TWO PHOTOS TO THE LEFT, both of which she wasted later in the film, one of them, very rare, one very funny, although I saw it coming 70 years away. No one except Law and Paltrow have significant time on the screen, and that is the true flaw of the movie. An audience does not identify with robots, it needs a hero to encourage and a visible and despicable villain to hate. Without that, in addition to a good attractive story, all the GC of the world will not help.
