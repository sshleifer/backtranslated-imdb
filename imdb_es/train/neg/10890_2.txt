I thought that this movie was pretty boring. If you are looking for cheese, you may like this. I, myself, do not mind a good amount of cheese, but this was ridiculous. The progression of the film bored me and the story was very weak. <br /> <br /> The only entertaining thing about this movie was the zombies of a day, but even that is not enough reason to see this movie.
