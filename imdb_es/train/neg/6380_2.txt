Well, what can I say about this movie? I am speechless. I could go on talking about how stupid this movie is forever, although the only thing that I REALLY forgot was music. And to top it off, someone commented how much he LIKED it. For them, all I have to say is that it was ripped from one of the best martial arts movies of all time, Fistsof Fury starring Bruce Lee. If he were still alive and would ever meet this movie, he would be horrified. The rest of the movie is absolutely ridiculous and a loss of tape. I say tape because a movie like that could not have been filmed in a movie. Now I feel more stupid to lose 30 minutes of my life watching her. The only reason I even saw it was because my roommate discharged it out of morbid curiosity. What is this world about?
