This is an art film that was made in 1969 or 1972 (the National Film Preservation Foundation says 1969 and IMDb says 1972). Regardless of the exact date, the film definitely seems to be very indicative of this general time period, with some camera and pop art designs that are pure from the late 60s and early 70s. <br /> <br /> The movie consists of three simple images that are distorted using different strange camera tricks. These distorted images are accompanied by music and there is absolutely no dialogue or plot of any kind. Obviously, this was thought of as almost a form of artistic performance, and like most artistic performances, it is interesting at first but it quickly becomes boring. The film, to put it even more clearly, is totally boring and would not appeal to anyone, but perhaps to those who made the film, their family and friends, and perhaps to some people too current and "with it" so that the let's understand deadly
