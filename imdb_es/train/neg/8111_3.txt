Another great film by Costa-Gavras. It is a great presentation of the situation in Latin America and the participation of the United States in Latin American politics. The facts may or may not be exact, but it is a fact that the United States was deeply involved in the blows and support of Latin American dictatorships. <br /> <br /> Despite this, the spirit of the film follows the example of the typical leftist / communist. The propaganda of the Cold War era. Costa-Gavras is a well-known communist sympathizer and his films are always partial. For example, it presents the actions of the United States as brutal and inhumane, while representing the extremist activities of Tupamaros as something positive. <br /> <br /> It turned out that it was a blessing for Uruguay and the rest of Latin America that the United States got involved. Europe is full of poor prostitutes from Eastern Europe. I never knew about the poor Uruguayan or Chilean girls who prostitute themselves en masse as in most Eastern European countries. The United States was waging a dirty war and may God bless all the monsters of Soviet communism that were defeated. It is regrettable that the United States has had to do what it did in Latin America (and elsewhere), but sometimes you have to play dirty. This is not an idealistic world like Costa-Gavras and Matamoros like to believe. If Matamoros had come to power in Uruguay, we would have had another Ukraine in Latin America. <br /> <br /> Together, this film follows the ideology of corrupt and bankrupt lefts of the past and tries to pass it off as idealist and morally. Right.
