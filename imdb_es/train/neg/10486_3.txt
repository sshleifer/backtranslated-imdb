My main comment about this movie is how Zwick was able to get credible actors to work on this film. Awesome deal ?? even for the supporting characters, none of which really helps this movie. I have to admit, however, Tom Hank's cameo almost made it worth it? What was that about tom? Did you lose a bet? However, the best cameo of the film was Joe Isuzu, a classic by far! The premise is good. The character of Basinger, who struggles with the existence of a Pink Lady, heads towards the Las Vegas motel, launching the glorious cosmetic sales pyramid. This happens when the character of Corbett goes to Las Vegas to give Elvis a suit to his ex-wife, who will soon be motivated by extortion. While both make their way, they have numerous encounters with Elvis impersonators heading to an Elvis impersonating convention in Las Vegas. Soon, the FBI gets involved and begins to track down what they think is a serial Elvis impersonator. Unfortunately, the premise does not mean that the movie was good. <br /> <br /> When you watch this movie, imagine you're back in first grade? When the lines of history and continuity are not really important. It's much nicer to see Basinger look beautiful in her Pink Lady outfit, instead of wondering why what she's doing makes no sense. The film tries hard, but in the end it is very short. Ultimately, it is full of ideas that might have been theoretically fun, but in practice they were not so much. <br /> <br /> It's not the worst, but you may feel like you want to leave the building when you look at this. one???? Do not say I did not warn you!
