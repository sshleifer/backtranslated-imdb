The costumes, the dialogue, the historical accuracy are terrible. For example, - Stacey Dash and the hanging scene. The rope was accurate (as far as I could see), but that type of rope broke the person's neck. Mrs. Dash hangs at the end of the rope without negative effects until the rope is fired. This guy did not strangle the person, he killed her at the end of the fall. <br /> <br /> And just before entering to rob a bank (in a flashback), they stop in the street for a group hug, with their handkerchiefs hiding their faces, that would have been obvious for the people of the street . <br /> <br /> The bad edition - it's a battery pack under that shirt and it's obvious, the "long trip" clip shows them as they travel, then reverses the movie. <br /> <br /> I liked the fact that they kept the scene with the horse throwing a shit, it seemed symbolic. The whole movie was crap.
