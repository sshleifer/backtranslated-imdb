If only I had a camera that was accidentally stuck to the floor, enough film for a single shot of each shot, and then I would lose the whole movie and have to find some dollars to buy some digital video tapes, and I was forced to do a movie of more than 2 hours about the French Revolution, that did not have any sets and that my autistic son of 4 years painted the backgrounds, and also the only actors that I could find were the people who did not do the auditions of the soap opera that year, and I was also forced not to use music throughout the movie, and the camera's zoom function did not work, except on one occasion when I accidentally started to zoom in and could not. Stop, oh and if I hated my audience, then I could do something like a horrible, but erroneously hilarious, waste of time worthy of Hell. The almost grandiose, but completely fake-looking backgrounds reminded me of some of George Lucas's latest creations, which made it all the more disappointing because throughout the movie, there was a small ray of hope in the back of my mind that the climax movie in a laser / duel battle with lightsabers I do not want to spoil the film for those who have not seen it, but that is not how it ends. The only thing I can think of that wasted more time than watching this movie was writing this review. Peace.
