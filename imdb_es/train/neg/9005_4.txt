If Alien, Jurassic Park and countless other science fiction horror movies are your cup of tea, add a lot of sugar and you'll get this one. The film begins in old England, cheerful around the year 1100 and then jumps to present-day California. Our hero Carver (Dean Cain) is the new Head of Security and Military Advisor for a science lab 400 feet underground. He arrives (Carver is also a helicopter pilot) with the Chief Scientist and we soon discover that it is a cloning lab and they have something new to clone. Is it a dinosaur or what? As with the previous films, all hell breaks loose and our characters begin to be eliminated. The special effects in the Monster are pretty good for a movie "direct to the video" and Dean Cain does what he gets paid. But forget about the rest of the group, as we discover why we have never seen them before. Again, do not enter with high expectations and it will be fine.
