This was my first and probably the last Angelopoulos movie. I really wanted to get into it, as I was presenting Mastroianni, one of my favorite actors and it was a movie by Theo, from whom I've listened a lot. The opening was promising, a very remote possibility for a jeep of soldiers crossing the Albanian-Greek border. IN AGREEMENT! but that was it. Nothing remains. The movie had big holes and I do not know which one to mention first. The main plot of the story is revealed to the journalist by the old woman. during a long walk. It's like a 15 minute monologue, which kills the action and the patience of the spectators, nothing happens on the screen for 15 or even 20 minutes, apart from the fact that this old woman tells a story. Everything that is supposed to be shown through the action was simply told to the camera by the old woman. At one point, the television crew was heading to the bar. They turn the corner and winter immediately begins! Probably, shot on different days, the continuity leaked. Many of the problems with storytelling, went from being absurd to irrational, never stuck to a style, which made the viewer ask questions that never get answers. Poor Mastroianni, given a role that lacked integrity or charm. On the other hand, as many Greeks or Albanians or the Balkans would agree, the films showed a lot of historical, ethnic or political errors, just for making a film about "humanity" as a red in another review. A lot more to say, but there's no time to waste in a poor movie, which was not a movie at all, but the follies of a person printed in the film and paid for with state money.
