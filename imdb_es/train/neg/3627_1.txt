I never really like classic movies. Movies like Patton, Going My Way, How Green was My Valley, The Godfather, Casablanca, Annie Hall, Gone With the Wind, Lawrence of Arabia and Citizen Kane bore me. However, I'd rather watch any of those movies 3,469 times while I'm tied up in a chair than see An American in Paris, once in the most luxurious suite in history. If I did the latter, I would probably be sleeping all the time. <br /> <br /> The direction of color art and music did not interest me, neither Gershwin nor non-Gershwin. Dancing and singing could help an insomniac fall asleep. The dialogue does not coincide with Singin 'in the Rain. Basically, this movie is boring. The only other movie that I fell asleep while watching was Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid. But you can not blame me. I only slept 5 minutes the night before. <br /> <br /> 1 star / 10 (Too bad we can not give zeros).
