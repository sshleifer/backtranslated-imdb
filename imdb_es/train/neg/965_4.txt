First I liked that movie. I thought it was a good comedy with some silly moments. Costume designer Albert Wolsky did his best! The same as the wonderful stage decorator Robert R. Benton: this man really had very good taste! But the writers disappointed me a lot. The best ending would be the scene on the stairs, but instead, they decided that the father and his daughter should be together. I do not like the ending. The father becomes the boyfriend of his own daughter and his ex-wife knows it and finds it well. It would be fine, if the writers, for example, said that now there is a different soul in the body, but they did not, they just deprived him of his memories. The actors were good, they were really fun. Cybill Shepherd was charming, Robert Downey Jr. was very funny in the dance scene :))) ... But some of the moments spoil even the impression of a good performance. For example, Corinne Jeffries, played by Cybill Shepherd after her husband's death, was waiting for him for 23 years (it's a long time!), She was faithful to him, she did not love him more than him, and when She met and it was about making love to her, after a scene with her friend Philip Train (Ryan O'Neal), she easily betrayed the man she so longed for. It would be a good movie, if not the end and some human psychology lost.
