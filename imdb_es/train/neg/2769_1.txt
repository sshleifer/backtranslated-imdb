This film serves as a timely warning for anyone who thinks they can write and direct their own film. Accept it, you can not. Because that way there is no one around you to tell you when you make big holes in your plot, have meaningless, trivial transitions, unmemorable dialogues and manage to turn a rather great Korean legend into a bunch of celluloid mob. <br /> <br /> I wanted to like this movie like a poor quality popcorn movie, I really did it; I like a lot of fucking movies. But once I have been forced to wonder what the hell just happened and WHY, DEAR LORD, WHY? more than a couple of times, I really can not take it anymore. <br /> <br /> Also, I would love someone to explain how LA became the last scene in Mordor.
