It was not good The characters were underdeveloped and the only personality was the memories he had of the previous film, which contrasted with the "new" personalities (or the lack of them). I seriously thought that the opening scene was a nightmare for Ariel because of how absurd it was. It was serious It just reminded me of all the annoying characters on the Disney channel: they are all hyperactive and the story jumps from the action to embarrassing scenes without any real connection. <br /> <br /> The most disappointing part were the horrible songs, not catchy, not surprising. In the original, Ariel had an incredible and powerful voice and all the songs are catchy and fun. You remember them and you want to sing them. But the songs in this movie were not creative in the least; It is as if they were talking with an annoying, sung voice, rather weak, disappointing. I do not have the feeling of wanting to sing them that you usually get from a Disney movie. <br /> <br /> It's as if nobody wanted to make this movie, so they barely made an effort. . . this movie would need a new story, new catchy songs and more warmth and enthusiasm without the annoying "look at me! look at me! I'm so annoying!" Mentality of this generation of disney. : '(
