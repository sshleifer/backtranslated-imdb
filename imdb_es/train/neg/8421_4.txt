It's funny that they forced me to review this movie, but here I am. <br /> <br /> I am reviewing it, because recently, I had the opportunity to witness the rebirth of R.C. Sheriff's play "Journey's End" on stage in New York, at the Belasco Theater, starring Hugh Darcy, Boyd Gaines, Jefferson Mays and others, as well as being masterfully directed by David Grindley. <br /> <br /> I left the theater shattered. I'm not exaggerating, I was stupefied. After almost two and a half hours of a recreation and a very claustrophobic representation of the life of a soldier in the trenches of the Somme (specula), during the First World War, brought to life vividly, by all involved, I left the theater with the shaking. <br /> <br /> Of course, I'm not easily surprised, nor am I too sensitive. I am a theater actor and director, so I know that the buttons are pressed to achieve certain effects, both emotionally and psychologically. <br /> <br /> But what I just witnessed, took a lot of life. , I had chills on my spine when I left. <br /> <br /> None of these emotions came to life, while watching "Aces High", the movie based on this work and even adapted for the screen, in cooperation with RC Sheriff himself, shortly before he died. <br /> <br /> The adaptation of the screen takes place in the heavens of France. Then, the claustrophobic environment has disappeared. <br /> <br /> The only advantage of the film is the aerial battle scenes, which seem outdated in their special effects, compared to current standards, but they are still very valid in the flight tactics adopted in the screen. <br /> <br /> Of course, there were a couple of screen adaptations of "All Quiet on the Western Front" by Erich Maria Remarque, which takes place in the trenches, and not in the sky, but that was the vision "German" of things, if one would like to be demanding with those things. <br /> <br /> "Journey's End" is just the other side of the medal, and I would have turned it into a Great movie, if it had been left alone and intact. <br /> <br /> The transfer on DVD is poor, although on a wide screen and adapted for 16: 9 TV screens, the quality of the film itself is that of a cinema. Nothing more and nothing less. It has several defects, such as small scratches and dots, although the copy, for the rest, is clean. <br /> <br /> If you want another World War I movie in your collection, especially for those who love and enjoy watching it. Aerial battles between veterans, then this is an image for you. But I prefer to suggest "Von Richthofen and Brown" as an alternative, although it is also a film full of inaccuracies. <br /> <br /> For the rest of you, those who love good acting and drama, I would go this out Buy the play. Go see the play, if you have the opportunity to achieve a decent rebirth near you, but stay away from this possible adaptation. <br /> <br /> It is a film against war, granted, but the weakest. I have ever seen in my life. <br /> <br /> The presence of actors like Trevor Howard, Ray Milland, Richard Johnson and John Gielgud, is just a bluff, as they only look at very weak and very short cameo roles throughout the film . <br /> <br /> McDowell, the talented Christopher Plummer, Simon Ward and Peter Firth, all offer very weak performances, not because of their lack of skills, but because of the lack of truth. and solid direction. <br /> <br /> There are too many holes in it, and as it was said before, it crawls to the dubious end. Doubtful because in the original work, none of the men we know and sympathize, is still alive. All of them are killed in a fatal and useless mission. In the film, everyone dies, except Malcolm McDowell, who somehow manages to stay alive another day, being the wing commander of the unfortunate group, only to receive three other pilots to fly and die for another lost cause. <br /> <br /> The end of the play leaves a bare stage in total darkness. You only hear the roar of cannons, machine guns and the impact of grenades throughout the theater. Then, suddenly, peace and total silence. The curtain rises. Lights. And here they are all. Aligned, standing, straight and rigid. Obedient bodies ... <br /> <br /> Much more interesting and much more impressive than the end of "Aces High", which is also dragged by the hair. <br /> <br /> It's up to you to judge. <br /> <br /> For me, if I had the money and the contacts to do it, I would take the game and develop it, the way it was intended. Adding here and there some scene of action in the field, just to visualize the "external" horror and the massacre occurring in the "vicious fields of France", around the men involved, but then, concentrating strictly on what is happening, in that little "hut" on the edge of sanity and the world ... <br /> <br /> Do you want a movie like that? <br /> <br /> Then ask for it. <br /> <br /> This is not it.
