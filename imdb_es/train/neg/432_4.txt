This movie had the potential to be much more than it was. But not only is it not fulfilled, but it also provokes nausea that preaches with justice and rectitude at the same time. <br /> <br /> John Cusack is even flatter than in Midnight of the Garden of Good and Evil. The difference is that this time he is supposed to have a Southern accent, which he notably loses several times in each scene. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino does his trick, but he seems to be walking through this movie and cashing a check. It is good as always, but it hardly stands out. <br /> <br /> Support for the cast: submerge the female romantic interest that added little, in any case, to the story. Speaking of history, a twisted tale of "who cares", where Cusack is the fair child of the mayor, who only has to look for "the right thing" to do. <br /> <br /> People do not act in this way. The character of Cusack loses all credibility in the end, of which, without revealing it, it is preaching and feeling nauseous. The final scene makes the penultimate stupidity seem profound. It is also completely inaccurate, but I will not enter into the law. <br /> <br /> This is a bad movie, by the numbers. It seems interesting during the first 40 minutes and then it is really a film of preaching, proselytizing and self-righteousness during the last hour. Better with meaningless shit than this pile of garbage.
