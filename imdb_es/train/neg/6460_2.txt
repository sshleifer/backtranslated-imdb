* Can anyone tell me WHERE IS COMEDY? <br /> <br /> * (Charlie Sheen) is a very weak comedian, (Thomas Haden Church) looks so weak (with him!), and everything is so silly! <br /> <br /> * Did you try to make a live comic that turned out to be a super bloody comic nightmare and was not even funny? Like the plan scene in the bathroom; He was so good with his cinematic imagination but there's nothing else ... except PAIN! <br /> <br /> * Donald Sutherland ??! Your relationship with your daughter ??! <br /> <br /> * This is actually a kind of work they did to do it and earn some money with it, but it became a crime when THIS money would be stolen from ourselves to those who cheated us with so little Art work and entertainment did not have any entertainment at all! <br /> <br /> * Well, it would have been uglier if it were a big production and starring Brando in his Golden Years with a REAL star. <br /> <br /> * Sheen's family here. Just keep that in mind! <br /> <br /> * Anyone who is admiring this movie or -God Forbid- loves it! Then you must go directly to therapy before becoming more dangerous and hurting any other person! <br /> <br /> * (Brando), undoubtedly, is a genius, but the movie is not! And I did not intend to be one here after reading this for sure !! But the big main problem is that no one else has worked on this trying, or wanting, to be smart for a short time or even good! (Sorry, I'm crying now! The torture of the movie is amazing!). <br /> <br /> * There is a scene where (Brando) hits (Mira Sorvino) for his shoes! That was so realistic! Maybe he was seeing himself in her, so he was punishing himself for being in a shit! <br /> <br /> * For millennium time: This could have been better (or less worse)! The script, until the train robbery, was nice and I figured they would escape to chase him as if he were another (Smokey and the bandit) but with (Brando) as the sheriff. In fact, any of those chimeras was much more merciful than what I've seen! <br /> <br /> * Why did not this masterpiece receive any Razzie awards? Do you want to make me believe that there was a movie lower than THIS? I do not think so ! It's a situation in which the Razzie's supervisor must win one for his negligence! <br /> <br /> * Martin Sheen is also here as a guest star, perhaps for supporting his failed son but, ironically, the father was as unsuccessful as his son! And why is that ?! All right ! Because I hate Martin Sheen, maybe more than I hate comic movies were not as good as his ambition! <br /> <br /> * It's not a comedy movie, it's NOT ... It's a horror movie! And I hate horror movies, especially those that have spread like comics! <br /> <br /> * Something good about this? Hmmm! Well, this is compared to another monster movie by Marlon Brando (The Island of Dr. Moreau - 1996) would be close to (Casablanca)! <br /> <br /> PS: if you still want to know what they are or who are precisely the bad guys, the ugly ones and the very ugly ones in this movie. Just say your last prayers and go see it. May God help you. You !
