* Sigh * Let us, the Finns, take a stupid idea, exaggerate it and try to market it as great. Lordi is, in the best case, a mediocre band, and a single trick will take you so far. <br /> <br /> To all of you, marketing idiots: this is the reason for the inherent minority complex that is often encountered when Finland tries to export something. <br /> <br /> Lordi is not scary. Lordi is lame. Lordi has FINISHED. <br /> <br /> I want to apologize to the rest of the world for this idiocy with a plastic face. Sure, they won the Eurovision. <br /> <br /> No, wait, they won the Eurovision. That's. I rest my case.
