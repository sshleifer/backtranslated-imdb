This movie is a shame for the cinema. I can not believe that it was even cataloged as a comedy, it's not funny. Not only the script was atrocious, but casting people should be shot. Gail O'Grady is a great actress, but beyond that ...% 99 of the rest of the cast ... oh. Almost everyone else ... wow, it's hard even ... wow. Here is rule number one about the comedy "DO NOT TRY TO BE FUNNY." There are many very talented actors in Canada who can do drama and comedy, none of them were used in this movie. Canadian directors of nepotism and casting are helping to perpetuate bad film production in Canada. I realize that technically it is an "American" movie, but look at the director, the actors, the location, etc. I just saw this in Bravo; They should be ashamed to have bought the rights to show this movie. Once again, there are many great movies out there that do not have broadcast time and show this shit.
