** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> This is a BAD movie. Seriously. Acting in an absolutely horrible way, the FX are terrible and the plot is terribly bad. But hey, it's so bad that it's fun to watch it! The script is so bad that it's nice! You just have to shake and laugh at lines like "I guess that's what you call" KNOWLEDGE. "While women throw their breasts at the crocodile, I mean COME ON, that's funny because it's so bad! It has such horrible jokes that They are fun! But after a while, it only becomes a lot when the film turns into garbage.I really started to fall asleep.However, believe me, the plastic crocodile foot stamped on the leaves and the constant movements of the tail of gallo will make you laugh for a long time, although I have to say that it had an interesting part when the crocodile tore that guy in half and he stayed there for a while thinking what to do. , which MUST be nominated for the MST3K line !!
