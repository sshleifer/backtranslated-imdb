Having heard so many people talking about this movie, I thought about trying it out. Apart from being incredibly slow, I do not always care that the wait is worth it, but it is not. As many others have said, there are many inconsistencies and much of this movie just does not sound true. The reaction of the 4 men changes from shock, horror to find the body to complete the indifference while fishing. Surely, if they were the kind of men who would continue to fish happily, they would have reported the body and said they had discovered it after their fishing trip ... why on earth tie the body to a tree, go fishing and then tell it to all of you who found the body 2 days before? It is so difficult to see a movie knowing that the behavior of the main characters is so inconsistent. As for the rest of the townspeople, well, one would think that at least one of them could show some curiosity about who actually killed the woman! The body itself, naked, except for the panties ... What scenario leads to that? If she was raped, why still the panties? If she was raped with her clothes on, why remove her after cutting her panties? If it was not raped, then why remove all the clothes from the bottom of the panties ... letting themselves be carried away by the evidence? I really can not think of any realistic scenario that leads to that, other than killing someone to steal their clothes, so you can fill your jumble sale stand! Oh, well, you can see it, but only and only because, despite the bad script, the performance is strong.
