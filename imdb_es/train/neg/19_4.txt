I'm a big fan of Arnold Vosloo. Finally, seeing him as the star of a recent movie, not just a small part, made me happy. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I appreciated the cinema at university and the only thing I can say is that I did not like it. that the film was made in an abandoned part of the city and there was no background traffic or lookie loos. <br /> <br /> I have to say that the acting leaves a lot to be desired, but Arnold is an excellent actor, I have to attribute it to the dismal direction and the supporting cast leaves something to be desired. <br /> <br /> I love Arnold Vosloo, and made the film visible. Otherwise, I would have written it as another lousy movie. <br /> <br /> The scene of the rape seemed brutal and unnecessary, but the actors who escaped at the end were pretty good. But the sound effects of the shooting were pretty bad. There are some flaws in the movie (continuity) but they are negligible considering the low caliber of the film. <br /> <br /> In general, I enjoyed the movie, because Arnold Vosloo was in it. <br /> <br /> Jackie
