The trio of Bill Boyd, Robert Armstrong and James Gleason play the Coney Island carnys competing for the hand of Ginger Rogers, a working girl who sells saltwater candies. With the outbreak of World War I, the three get ready and chase Ginger from afar. The first half of this RKO Pathe production is difficult, as the three male protagonists walk the stage with annealed anneals and an "agile" dialogue that quickly becomes boring. The second half concentrates on action sequences while the US Navy. UU It pursues both a German merchant cruise and a submarine. These sequences are animated and well filmed, but in general it is a comedy drama too long and unsatisfactory with a flat ending. Only for the fans of the stars.
