The effect (s) without cause is generally not possible in the real world, but in the world of Hollywood remakes, it is not only possible, it is required. Haunting has received the computer treatment courtesy of a first-class director of photography, turner and director who once showed promise (Jan de Bont-Speed), but has since produced a large-budget garbage chain (Twister, Speed 2). <Br /> <br /> The actors are superfluous in a movie of this kind and seem to realize. Liam Neeson and Cathrine Zeta-Jones act as if they wanted to be anywhere but in this movie. Lili Taylor tries to add something to the procedures, but it is unknown what it may be, since the script seems half missing. Events simply happen, good and bad ghosts appear without rhyme or reason, and then the story ends with a not unsatisfying event destined to envelop the last 90 minutes of madness. <br /> <br /> There is really no reason to see this because of the effects, since we all know that now you can put anything on the screen. Why not see the effects at the service of a good story instead of just for its own sake?
