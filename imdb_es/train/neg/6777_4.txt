While I recently gave a positive review to OPERATION PETTICOAT, I really did not like this movie even though it had many similarities. Both were made a few years apart, both starring Cary Grant and both were comedies of World War II. However, the general tone and style of the films were quite different. KISS HER FOR ME, in general, seemed like a cheaper movie, with little writing, little energy and some VERY broad performances, even compared to the PETTICOAT DE OPERACIÃ“N. I think at least a large part of the blame for this lies in choosing Jayne Mansfield. The combination of his extensive talents and his limited acting ability really made this film with a limited budget seem to come from a third category studio. Also, there was not much chemistry or energy in matching her with Cary Grant, an actor generally loved for her grace and class. It's something like uniting Sir Lawrence Olivier with Marjorie Main.
