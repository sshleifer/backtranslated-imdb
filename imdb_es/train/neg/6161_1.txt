This is possibly the worst swordfighting movie, sword fight that has ever been made. That's not just because the so-called sports fencing is poor, but because the plot, the characters are so weak that they have to launch a scene of semi-naked sex and, later, a supposed group dancing around a scene of fencing in the club of fencing. , I guess to keep the interest of the public. What a waste of the talents of F. Murray Abraham. You better serve exaggerated movies like Zorro, Scaramouche, anything that has Basil Rathbone as the villain. As a fencer, I recognize the almost impossibility of capturing fencing as a sport in a movie, but if it ever happens, it must have fresher and better drawn characters, and a plot with more depth.
