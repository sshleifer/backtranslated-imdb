Very bad performance, and a very superficial story. Not even a decent B movie. <br /> <br /> The events that were supposed to be shocking as the humans who climbed aboard an alien ship were boring and very boring. <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst science fiction I've seen. I saw the 5.0 stars and decided to see it because I like the genre, but it stunk. <br /> <br /> Now there are very few good films about ALIEN, I think most of them are low budget. <br /> <br /> I give it 3/10
