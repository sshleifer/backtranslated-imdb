The majority of university students are lost in the bubble of the academy, isolated from the communities where they study and live. Their conversations are carried out with their peers and the faculty of the university. Steven Greenstreet's documentary is an excellent example of a disillusioned college student who judges the entire community based on limited contact with a small number of its members. <br /> <br /> The documentary focused on a small group of people who were portrayed as representing large groups of the population. As usual, the people who shout the most receive the most attention from the media. Apart from its misrepresentation of the community in which the film was shot, the documentary was well made. My only contention is that the feelings and the fuss described in the film were attributed to the whole community rather than to the few people who expressed them. <br /> <br /> Naturally, it is important to examine a controversy like this and make people aware. of the differences that exist between the political points of view, but it is ridiculous to involve a whole community of people in the actions of a few radicals.
