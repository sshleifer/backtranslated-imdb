Life in some future fascist or quasi-fascist state that severely restricts personal liberties is a recurring theme in both modern literature and filmmakers. Such works publish warnings about undesirable tendencies in our society to which we must be attentive; But to be effective they must also be entertaining. Unfortunately, most books are probably more effective in publishing warnings than to entertain us enough to be really read widely; while with the movies the problem is usually the other way around. The first work of this type that became really known was probably the "1984" by George Orwell (first published in 1948), and is still available in the form of a book and as a film. <br /> <br /> See or read it: and then, when you feel a little depressed by man's inhumanity towards man, look for Cinderella 2000. This is a low-budget film comedy based on the same theme as it provides a vision without effort but without reward; and like in 1984, the calendar has now gone beyond its previous period. Most of the comedy is set with a palette, although there are only a few really fun moments. To exercise your mind in the long intervals between these, you can focus on the question of whether this movie will gain a new extension of life when it is released as a DVD or if it will finally disappear into oblivion as copies of the existing tapes become available. deteriorate after redemption. There are many worse movies that appear as DVDs these days, and frankly I do not care much what happens in any way. <br /> <br /> Until now, the best of the films of this genre has probably been "The Tale of the Maids", but I would happily exchange them all for a well-made movie of Jack London's imposing novel " The Iron Heel. " As ambitious as it is, it still seems incredible that no modern filmmaker has dared to try (the IMDb only lists a silent version of B / W made in Russia in 1919).
