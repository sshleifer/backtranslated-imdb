... but it's certainly not without merit. Screenwriter and director Preston Sturges is experimenting with unusual cinematic effects by telling his stories, creating characters and situations with a broad but distinctive drawing, and writing intelligent, compassionate and unexpectedly intelligent dialogues. (No wonder that the next film by the Coen brothers is going to be a tribute to Sturges). <br /> <br /> The main problem is that the plot has not arrived yet; It lacks surprise, the unexpected twists of the plot and the sudden changes of fortune that make the spectators guess. The coffee slogan is a bad thing to hang the plot, and the end is completely predictable. Frank Capra does this kind of thing much better. <br /> <br /> If you are new to Preston Sturges, check first "The Lady Eve" or "Sullivan's Travels" or "The Miracle of Morgan's Creek". If you have already seen this, then go and look at this.
