Imagine the scenario: you're in the cinema just because you're in Washington for the weekend and it's raining and you're done with the Museums. You think you could go see the Sarah Marshall movie, since the trailer looks like this, and you do not have to compromise your brain. Is it sold out. Options? - The Bank Job, In Bruges, The Leatherheads or Prom night. You've seen Bank Job (surprisingly decent theft movie) and In Bruges (again, pretty good), so you have two. You do not want to see Clooney or the sympathetic office run in 1930 football uniforms, so go to graduation night, right? Incorrect. You take the $ 8.50, you approach a stranger on the street and ask him to hit your face for $ 8.50. It would be better to spend the money. <br /> <br /> Actually, it's more of a comedy than a horror thriller or whatever it is supposed to be. If I were financing that film and they would show me that, as a final cut, I would not know whether to laugh or cry. Probably both. An insult to the intelligence of anyone ... my roommate was laughing out loud for most of the movie, so for the performance, they could have chosen robots (or maybe dogs) in the papers, they would have been more realistic . The detective must possibly be the worst actor I've seen (Ben Affleck and Hayden Christansan (I hate his performance so much that I do not care how he spells his name) he feels relieved in his title (s)) <br /> <br /> So in summary 'it's not good'
