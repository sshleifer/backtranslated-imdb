Sorry, my neighbors in Nevada City, but this is bad. <br /> <br /> Brian must have had too much botox because he had very few facial expressions in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Alice It seemed like she had a table tied to her backside. I was rigid throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> I looked at Alice and Brian and I was surprised to see the extensive biography of the work. I would have guessed that they were freshmen. <br /> <br /> Ed Asner and Peter Jason brought the film down with their jokes and ease with each line. Ed certainly has not lost his charisma. I wish I had taken the time to meet him while he was here. <br /> <br /> I love the snow scenes and the scenes from the shops and the church because I've been there. I make Nevada City my home and I was anxiously waiting for the premiere. Unfortunately I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry.
