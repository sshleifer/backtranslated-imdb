Robert DeNiro plays the most incredibly intelligent illiterate of all time. This movie is a waste of talent, it's really unpleasant. The script is incredible. The dialogue is incredible. The character of Jane Fonda is a caricature of herself, and not funny. The film moves at a snail pace, is photographed in an ill-advised way and is an unbearable preaching. It also connects on each clich√© in the book. Swoozie Kurtz is excellent at a supporting role, but so what? <br /> <br /> Equally annoying is the new IMDB rule of requiring ten lines for each revision. When a movie is worthless, it does not require ten lines of text for other readers to know that it is a waste of time and tape. Avoid this movie.
