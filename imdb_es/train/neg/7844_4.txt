Nobody goes to a movie like The Hills Have Eyes 2 and waits for the second coming of Citizen Kane. The same is true for most low-income horror films, especially those that Roger Ebert has dubbed "Dead Teen Movies." The Hills Have Eyes 2 definitely qualifies as a movie for dead teenagers, only here, teens have been given the superficial appearance of military trained. <br /> <br /> Some will argue that "it's only a movie" when the questionable facts came up in a movie review, but I've always been a firm believer that all good fantasies must be rooted in reality to be effective . In Hills Have Eyes 2, we must believe that the main characters are military in a training exercise, but they look and talk like high school kids camping in the desert. The dialogue is horrible and often too vulgar. Although the films are not nearly comparable, I kept imagining that these "soldiers" were in the squad, and I shuddered with fear. <br /> <br /> Very little about the characters evokes a soldier other than rifles and uniform: radio transmissions are made as telephone conversations of teenagers; A Colonel is directions like "hey, asshole" by a Private. And nobody seems to have the slightest idea what to do, or any sense of the command structure, when things start to go wrong. I think of the soldiers of James Cameron's Aliens, a film of pure fantasy, and how even those futuristic marines behaved like true soldiers despite their fantastic situations. Fantasy rooted in reality. <br /> <br /> I try to start watching a movie like a 5 on a scale of 10, and judge its strengths and weaknesses from there. You have to allow concessions for the material; There's no way Star Wars is a movie as good as The Godfather, all things being equal. But both are excellent examples of their type. <br /> <br /> In that sense, while Hills Have Eyes 2 is a pretty terrible exercise in amateur and immature writing, it's only modestly worse than the typical Dead Teenager. Movie. From a technical point of view, the film seems to have decent production values ​​and is pretty well made from that perspective. Scenes that are intended to impact, or that are intended to evoke urgency or suspense, generally work. So, while watching The Hills Have Eyes 2 may be a fate worse than death, there are certainly much worse horror movies in circulation. <br /> <br /> It's worth watching a watch for those who enjoy this kind of thing without the usual fanboy baggage, or those who do not tend to think that every movie they watch is the best of all or the worst of all. If you do not "understand" the horror, especially the Dead Teenager variety, you're not likely to have a good time with it. <br /> <br /> 4/10
