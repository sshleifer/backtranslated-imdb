Ok, I like the idea of ​​this movie a little. I'm in the demographic era, and I identify with some of the stories. Even the dialogue, sometimes in bad taste and without meaning, seems semi-realistic, and in a different movie it would have been forgivable. <br /> <br /> I'm doing everything I can to not destroy this movie like the others did, but it's not so easy when the filmmakers did not try it at all. <br /> <br /> The edition in this movie is terrible! Possibly the worst edition I've seen in a movie! There are things that you do not have to go to film school to learn, leaning to a good edition is not one of them, but identifying a bad one is. <br /> <br /> Also, the photo ... Oh, my God. God shots, just horrible! I can not even go into details, but sometimes we just see that random things come up, and that, along with editing, will give you the most painful movie viewing experience. <br /> <br /> This film is being made in low or no budget with 4 cast and the crew is not an excuse as well. I've seen short films on youtube with much more artistic integrity! Joe, Greta, I do not know what the hell you were thinking, but this movie is nothing more than a masturbation of your two egos. You must be ashamed of yourselves! In conclusion, this movie is like what would be a really lazy amateur porn movie if it was full of 3 or 4 lousy sex scenes separated by long and boring conversations and a disgusting masturbation scene. If that's not your kind of thing, avoid this at all costs!
