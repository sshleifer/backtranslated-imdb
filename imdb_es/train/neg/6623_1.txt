First of all, sorry for giving even a rating of 1 to this movie (nothing less is available). The film fails in all departments, whether script, direction, characterization or performance. <br /> <br /> 1) To begin with, the name of the film is really class C (although the movie matches the name). 2) Amitabh Bachchan does everything possible to be up to the character, but the weak script, along with a pathetic direction, makes it a humorous character. 3) In Sholay Gabbar Singh he has a reward of 50,000 for him (which was convincing). Here, in Aag, the figure was 100 million rupees for Babban (Amitabh Bachchan, but the poor man was beaten by our so-called hero and had only a few man bicycles to commute (with all automatic pistols)). It does not seem convincing. 4) As for Nisha Kothari, someone has to tell her she does not know how to act. Why Ram Gopal Verma is throwing it again and again? 5) Mohanlal was good, but he has almost nothing to do. 6) Sushant Singh and Rajpal Yadav, who are great actors, are wasted in the movie. 7) The legendary role played by Lila Misra (Mausi de Basanti) in Sholay is replaced at low cost in this film by Gangu Mummy. Ramu, please, grow up and understand that there must be some intellect in your movie. Enough of stupid characters in your movie like Shiva and Aag. 8) I should not say anything about modern Jai and Veeru ... what I'm most passionate about. <br /> <br /> In short, I was surprised to see this movie because it seems like a cheap and comic translation of the original classic. Please, do not waste money and time in this movie. I think watching Aap Ka Surror (which I thought was the worst movie possible) would be a better idea than seeing this horrible pack of stupid characters, bad songs and a miserable address. <br /> <br /> Thanks, Saurabh
