Gday Mates! I just watched the Croc Hunter movie. It was fine, but the show seems more real. This just seemed like a longer episode of AnimalPlanet with more fun lines and more characters. Some things: Steve described the Fang snakes as hypodermic needles. Yeeeowch! You really know what hurts. and can not jump high? Everyone grabs them by the tail and those things. There were two MAIN spin split shots in this movie. When Terry finds that baby, Joey says, "We have to take care of them, like a baby." Woah I thought she was going to get up and breastfeed that child. PG-13 would have done that, however. While in Terry, did anyone notice the movie and much of Terry's knowledge of ritual pairing? she knows her sexual things. The film takes place in Queensland, Austrailia. I want a koala, dingo and joey! <br /> <br /> Steve's dog, Sui, actually has a purpose in this movie. even a small one that is useless against the beauties that handle dynamite. <br /> <br /> Oh, and if someone else looks at this, try and agree with me by saying that that fat peasant with the dog pack was right. Shotgunning the crocodile. He was eating his sheep! I would also be angry!
