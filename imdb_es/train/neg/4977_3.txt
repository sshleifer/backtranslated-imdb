This is a recount made by TV and quite unnecessary of the science fiction channel of Beowulf's history, especially after the recent 2005 film "Beowulf and Grendel". This movie does not really delve into Beowulf's story, but it takes us through its battle against the voracious beast known as Grendel, as it leaves a kingdom in absolute fear and agitation, while the mighty Viking warrior, Beowulf, You must get rid of them. The fuss of the monster. If this is successful, the king will no longer have to sacrifice the children to keep him at bay. After some failed attempts, the creature is killed, but it is an angry and vengeful mother who soon attacks, letting Beowulf, again, lend his powerful acts of courage and strength to defeat him. "Grendel" seems to have been filmed in a small budget and the effects of CG are terrible. As I said, this movie is absolutely unnecessary.
