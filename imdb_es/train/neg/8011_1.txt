I really should have captured a different movie from the rest of the commentators on this site because last night, in a screening of the film, the audience was so mortified by the dialogue that (I'm not even kidding) half left. Filmed as if the filmmaker thought he was approaching a new and daring territory by presenting a history of homosexual majority, the film uses images inspired by David Lynch with the action inspired by Fassbinder. The performances in this movie are so boring and boring that I thought one of the actors was going to faint because of how uninspired they seemed to be in the script. What is worse is that it is colored like an episode of Miami Vice. I do not know who this director thinks he is; maybe he has pretensions of the surrealist like Bunuel, Jordowsky, etc. But the problem is that all the directors mentioned above show a level of scholarly sensitivity that is very deficient here. I could understand the meaning of this movie about ten years ago, but when we have masterpieces like Bad Education, Mysterious Skin and Show Me Love, why bother with this movie? There is nothing new to see here.
