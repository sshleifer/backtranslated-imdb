The main reasons to see "Red Eye" are Rachel McAdams, who offers stellar performance, and Jayma Mays, who is wonderful as an assistant hotel manager. On the other hand, Cillian Murphy exaggerates so much that he becomes caricatured. The rest of the movie is full of plot holes, which I'm going to elaborate on. <br /> <br /> Please, do not read anymore if you do not want to know what happens. <br /> <br /> Here is a synopsis of the plot. The character of Rachel McAdams (Lisa) runs a hotel where the new National Security Director plans to stay that night. Rachel returns to Miami from a funeral, but receives calls from her assistant until the plane leaves. Meanwhile, someone is stationed outside his father's house, Joe (played by Brian Cox), ready to kill him if Cillian Murphy (Jackson) calls. All Lisa has to do is call the hotel and move the Director's suite to one where the Jackson cohorts plan to fire a guided missile (from a fishing boat) to kill the Director and his family. <br /> <br /> So, here are some of the plot holes or the absurd coincidences: <br /> <br /> 1. Jackson finally convinces Lisa to make the call, and in the middle, the phones on the plane lose the connection. Lisa tries to pretend that she is making the call, but coincidentally, a guy who is on the other side of Jackson is also making a call and starts hitting his phone to indicate he is dead. Jackson notices and grabs Lisa's phone. <br /> <br /> 2. At one point, Jackson hits Lisa and she, of course, is knocked out ... but only for 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> 3. Jackson catches Lisa writing a note in the bathroom mirror (extraordinarily large), and he hits her a little. Miraculously, the only one who hears something is an 11-year-old girl whose word, of course, has a discount. <br /> <br /> 4. Lisa stabs Jackson with a pen in her throat as the plane lands, steals her cell phone and rushes to the exit, standing in the aisle between the seats and 18 rows of passengers. foot. Despite knowing that there is a passenger with a pen stuck in the throat, the hostesses force Lisa to open the jet-way door. <br /> <br /> 5. OK, all those are reasonable (if it is not highly unlikely). But this is where he gets really stupid. Lisa enters the airport terminal in Miami and there is no cell phone signal (all major airports in the United States have an excellent cell phone reception). <br /> <br /> 6. She runs through the airport with Jackson in pursuit, and no security officer delays them. <br /> <br /> 7. Jackson, who lost Lisa at the airport while the train door was leaving the terminal, lost a bit of his voice from the feather in his throat, but it can still be something understood . However, he does not bother to call his man out of Joe's house. (PS: There is no train at the Miami airport, but the one they showed was very similar to the Orlando airport). <br /> <br /> 8. Lisa steals a car and leaves. Of course, this time, when you are going to make a call, the cell phone says "low battery" and soon it turns off (when will you stop using this inane plot device?). <br /> <br /> 9. While the phone kept saying "low battery", Lisa had arrived at her assistant just in time to save the Director and his family from the guided missile thrown by the fishing boat to the window of the Room on the 40th floor where the Director had been. moved. Of course, they expect us not to realize that the hotel is surrounded by the ocean on 3 sides, so probably the missile could have been launched in the first suite, thus denying the need for Lisa-Jackson's complete plot. What is the story here? Was the Director's original room on the 38th floor one of the only rooms in the hotel with a horrible view? However, they all come out just before the missile leaves. <br /> <br /> 10. Lisa drives to Joe's house to save her father just to see the killer outside. Although she runs over him (while he is shooting him) when he crashes his Jeep in the house, nobody in the neighborhood seems to notice or bother to stop. <br /> <br /> 11. Jackson arrives at Joe's house and knocks him out (we do not see how ... maybe another headbutt). Then he explains to Lisa that he still had not killed dad because he wanted dad to see Lisa die first (Give me a break, what's this, cartoons on Saturday mornings?). <br /> <br /> 12. During the rest of the movie (about 20 minutes), Jackson chases Lisa around the house and she, with resources, fights him. Of course, a real killer (that is, one perhaps played by Jason Statham) would have eliminated Lisa (or, for that matter, anyone who is not a trained killer) in the first 30 seconds. During the course of this chase, Jackson tramples Joe at least once without bothering to kill him. <br /> <br /> 13. Finally, Jackson prevails, and is about to kill Lisa when (you guessed it) Joe shot him. <br /> <br /> So, this is my suggestion ... tell Wes Craven to limit himself to horror. Or maybe you should meet with Michael Bay (who led the equally stupid "The Island") and make "Red Island".
