Well, I could not enter the plot, but that's just me maybe. However, this camera has a lovely vintage quality. The acting is genuine at times and entertaining with the occasional chase sequence involving ladies with little clothes, which was nice. The climax is confused and disjointed, but still ... errant, thanks to Stella Stevens. <br /> <br /> The acrobatics are interesting, especially due to the backdrop of the 70s in Las Vegas. There are some abrupt movements of the camera at the end, which keep me guessing, for a while. But I do not think I'm chasing the DVD, yet.
