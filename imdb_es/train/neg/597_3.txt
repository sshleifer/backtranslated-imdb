This movie is a perfect example of the recent crop of horror films that simply have not been made at all. There are two routes to follow in horror movies: either you do not really explain what is happening (or who is the killer, as in Texas Chainsaw Massacre) or you give a lot of history and characterization to the characters so that everything is explained (potentially Halloween it could be an example of this). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Creep fails in this area. I see absolutely no reason to give a small part of Craig's background story without fully capturing the essence of his character or his motivation. No character is fully realized, although the circular nature of Kate's character in the film is the most successful part of the story. <br /> <br /> In the end, this story is for the most part unmotivated and none of the performances gives it the touch. Necessary life to make it fascinating or interesting enough to overcome the lack of context and the realization of empty films that drag down the film. <br /> <br /> This movie will become another movie example (as most of it is) That could be much better, although it would never be great. The only thing that was used correctly in the film was the setting: the characters, the story, the direction and the writing in general would have benefited from a serious facelift. <br /> <br /> The creep has a purpose like a fool, Silly horror movie without intellectual or emotional investment, but unfortunately, that's all ...
