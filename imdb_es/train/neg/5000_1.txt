This is probably the worst excuse for television programming, since, oh, I do not know, WHAT HAPPENS NOW? NOTHING happened in this ridiculous "series". Although most of them are filmed by Britney and Kevin, you do not get any good detail in their personal lives. They are mostly just people who do nonsense, jokes and act like white trash. Look, I love Britney's music as much as the next baby, but this show is just the fill of a nation so addicted to Britney that they would see her cut her toenails (yes, that could be a real episode). Thank God, these two separated, because they were PERMANENT bored together. This show is TOXIC!
