My first opinions about this movie were, of course, bad. I expected a horrible performance, bad quality, bad entertainment, ridiculous special effects film. What I got was not really that bad. The special effects were absolutely horrible, but I found the film itself. Pretty interesting, and the script was pretty good and decent. The performance was not SO bad, and overall I had fun watching this movie. It's still a pretty bad movie, but it's not completely useless as I thought it was going to be, and I'm glad to know that this movie managed to surprise me, even when it was not so good. In general, it is a film that should be avoided, but for me it was not as bad as I expected. be.
