How can you get Disney? The tastefully rich girls act like idiots, buy a lot of things and learn a lesson. Is Disney trying to send a lesson to himself? What maybe buying everything should be human? Whatever the psychoanalysis, this movie stinks. <br /> <br /> The girls want a rich party for their rich lives. But then the money disappears and they have to use their wealth so that the milk plant (yes, milk) is going to employ the workers. They keep it afloat until dad comes home. And the man at the beginning, who seems to be the one who takes the money, is the one who is. But the end is mute. Webcam in the Cayman Islands? Eh It's not worth my time anymore. <br /> <br /> But it's better than Howl's Moving Castle. "RE-"
