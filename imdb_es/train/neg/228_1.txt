I thought it was a movie located in New York: bad! It is a small British country setting. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a comedy: bad! It's a drama ... Well, until the last third, because after the story it becomes totally "abracadabrantesque", the symbolic word for a French presidential mandate. It means, almost meaningless, even if the motives want to bring a sincere feeling. <br /> <br /> What do I have left? Maybe, a good actress duo: Yes, I know, they are 3 friends, but the redheaded police is a bit invisible to me. The tall doctor surprised by his blow, and McDowell offers a good performance as always, all in a delicate, soft and almost silent. This kindness baffles me, because like other artists or directors, the same pattern repeats itself over and over again. In his case, it's like, whatever the movie is, it's always the same character defined by his feelings, his values, who live endless different stories. I still do not know how to establish the limit (or fusion) between artists and works. <br /> <br /> Another positive side of this film is its feminine touch and the different interesting points of view. Women each have their own way of life, even if they are all single. It brings a lot of tolerance and we learn to observe how a unique and unique reality can be perceived in as many ways as people. <br /> <br /> Finally, the film is quite visible, but the grand finale cuts the desire for a next vision
