This is an atrocious movie. Two demented young men seduce and torture a middle-aged man. There is not much to give away with respect to a plot or a "spoiler". I would only comment that the ending is almost the most absurd part of the movie. Much of the film involves Locke and Camp cackling with hatred, while he smiles psychically at the camera. Add to this a soundtrack that is repeated over and over again, including a Vaudevillian song about "dear old dad" that suggests an incestuous quality that the viewer never really sees. The music is annoying at first, then ends up subjecting the viewer to a worse torture than the one shown on the screen. The theme here is that of uncontrolled youth, understood as a reaction to the 60s, but made with little imagination or style. Avoid it!
