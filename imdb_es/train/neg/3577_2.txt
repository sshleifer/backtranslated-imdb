This first vehicle of Pia Zadora followed a familiar formula of Harold Robbins: the ambitious main character turns into decay while continuing the path to the top of a glamorous world, chosen randomly, in this case the film industry. But despite being so formulated as to be completely predictable, this film manages to be completely incredible at the same time. Zadora (to call her inexperienced as an actress is to be charitable) never convinces as a screenwriter. One would expect a movie about film making to have an idea of ​​its own industry and creative process. But the script does not grant any of the qualities that make writers interesting movie characters: observance, skill with words, a love-hate relationship with their own creative abilities. Your character is as empty as a donut hole. And this is just a sample of the incompetence shown here. The cinematography is so murky that sometimes it is difficult to see what is happening. And the scenes never come together, so everything seems like a succession of random moments in bad Hollywood parties. Avoid.
