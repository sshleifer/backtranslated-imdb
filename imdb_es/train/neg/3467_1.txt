The cover of the box of this film has the name of Kyle Minogue, but she has the same destiny that Drew Barrymore in "Scream". That's the first thing that makes this movie lame; They are trying to market a movie with someone who is in it for 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> Of course, we have to have this film in which young university students participate who do not realize that there is a murderer out there. To top it off, Molly Ringwald of the fame of the 80's teen movie is the star of this beautifully written movie. It's a good career move for Molly to get some money making a shitty movie in Australia so they do not ridicule her in the United States. <br /> <br /> Either way, this stupid movie is about a horror movie that was never over because this dumb creature kills everyone in it. Throughout the movie, we're supposed to guess who the killer is. In short, remember our little friend Molly, she saves the day ... or not? <br /> <br /> This movement is just bad, fix it if you feel like torturing yourself or just ruining it. Floor your local video store if you see it on the shelf. Do not spread the horror.
