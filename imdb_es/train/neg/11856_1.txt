I just watched this movie last night at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2006 and I really wonder if the people at the festival really show the movies before selecting them. The film was just horrible, I say that without exaggerations or ulterior motives, it was horrible. The days of Matthew Modine as protagonist are over. Gina Gershon wore an inexplicable and unnecessary English accent; You should be ashamed of your participation in this movie. Gloria Reuben had a strange little cameo in it, she should also be ashamed. The script was terrible and they gave us no reason to worry about the characters. I doubt that this is picked up, but again, it is known that people in Hollywood make mistakes sometimes. I really believe that "Kettle of Fish" is a serious contender for the worst movie I've ever seen.
