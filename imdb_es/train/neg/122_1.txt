I would put this at the top of my list of movies in the unobservable garbage category! There are movies that are bad, but the worst are the ones that can not be seen, but you are supposed to like them because they are supposed to be good for you. The sex sequences, so shocking in their day, could not even wake a rabbit. The so-called controversial policy is strictly secondary and second year on the night of Marxism. The film is artistically conscious in the worst sense of the term. The photograph is in a hard black and white grain. Some scenes are out of focus or taken from the wrong angle. Even the sound is bad! And some people call this art? <br /> <br />
