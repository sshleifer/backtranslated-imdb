This so-called "documentary" tries to say that the United States falsified the moon landing. Right year. <br /> <br /> All those who have actually studied the case know differently. <br /> <br /> First of all: there are definitely tests. When the astronauts were on the moon, they brought MANY pounds of rock from the moon for geological studies. These were spread all over the world to hundreds of laboratories, who tested them. And all came to the conclusion that they came from the same planet, not from the earth: because the internal isotopes of the basic elements are different from those found on earth, but similar to those calculated to be on the moon. THAT IS TO SAY. Conspiracy theorists never study anything: they only take what fits their theory and ignore the rest. <br /> <br /> Another erroneous affirmation of them is that there was wind in the hangar where they fired at the landing, that is, the flag moves. There is a logical explanation: the astronaut moved it with his hand, so he moved. And what this proves: well, if the conspiracy theorists even studied the images, they would see that the flag NEVER moves after the astronaut has left it, I.E. the conspiracy theorists are bad scientists, they can not study a topic correctly or they only study it until they have what they came for, so that they can make a lie from that and get a benefit (ie, the so-called "documentary" "). <br /> <br /> A statement says that you can not have filmed on the moon because all the shadows come from different places, because there are different sources of light, the artificial lighting of the studio. Once again, the conspiracy theorists are wrong (as usual), the same would happen in a desert of the earth at night, without sources of light. But I doubt that conspiracy theorists have been out of their grandmothers' basement for more than the days when the Star Treck convention takes place. <br /> <br /> Conspiracy theorists are in denial, BIG TIME. They only see what they want to see. So you invent all these lies to look important, that's a fact.
