What kind of documentary about a musician does not include a single song by the artist himself? Unlike "Ray" or many other movies about musical artists, half the fun in the theater (or on the couch) is reliving the great songs. Here, all the tracks are covers put by uninteresting characters, and these representations fail to capture the slow and striking style of Cohen. More often, the covers are popular versions badly sung. Yuck <br /> <br /> The interviews are as much or more with other musicians and figures instead of with Cohen. Only rarely does the film present Cohen reading his own work (never singing), such as lyrics, poems, etc. The film really did not capture much about the story of the artist's life, nor about its development over the years. A big disappointment for a big fan of Cohen.
