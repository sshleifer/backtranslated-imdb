Be careful: this movie tells many love stories without any coherence. <br /> <br /> The only intention of this movie seems to be to show love in many different ways. <br /> <br /> Each story has only a few minutes, so there is no character development and there is almost no plot. Only a vague idea of ​​a plot. The writer tried to build inflection points that aimed to surprise the viewer. However, that did not work because you did not know the characters before or these "jokes" were just dumb. <br /> <br /> This is a movie about love that does not reach your heart. A dozen times. Or even more, I do not know and I do not care.
