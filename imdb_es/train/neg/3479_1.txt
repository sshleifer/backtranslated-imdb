I went to see this movie in theaters and I was surprised when I entered the room. It was just me and my girlfriend! This shouted that this movie is not very good. <br /> <br /> Not to my surprise, the movie was terrible. Ben Affleck plays a boy who buys a family for Christmas. It is a very predictable narrative with him falling in love with the girl who hates him. His acting is good, but the comedy aspect of the movie is not very good. The plot is poor and the comedy almost non-existent. <br /> <br /> However, there are some good points. For example, the family is falling apart and the mother is very funny. <br /> <br /> I hope this revision prevents other people from wasting their money. I was very embarrassed when I left the room!
