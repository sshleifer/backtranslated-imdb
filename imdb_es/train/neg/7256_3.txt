I bought this movie in blu-ray because it promised excellent images and music. I was also a big fan of a similar movie ... Baraka. The film has a lot of style after Baraka, wide angles, very similar shots with cameras configured to capture long passages in each shot. Even some of the scenes were identical (the street with traffic). While Baraka told a great story, juxtaposing nature, the environments created by man, the spirituality and horrors of the world in a fascinating way and great music, this film jumped from one shot to another without a complete story, a score mediocre musical, and then. ... POOF, it's over! I thought there must be some kind of mistake! History of the world? Half of the film is Egypt and the landscape (it looks like Arizona, but I did not bother to check it). Seriously, people, this is horrible, rent it if necessary, but do not buy it. The filmmakers should be ashamed of themselves for putting this.
