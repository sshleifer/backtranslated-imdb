Being an independent filmmaker and a great fan of Edward D. Wood Jr., I bought this documentary believing that this would finally set the record as to how gifted and brilliant Ed Wood really was. <br /> <br /> What I got was a disappointing egocentric, conflicting and contradictory compilation of bitter self-aggrandizing has-beens. <br /> <br /> Where do people remember Ed Wood Jr., do people really remember the second cousin of the guy with duct tape who knew someone who was in Plan Nine From Outer Space? <br /> <br /> It seems that, at the moment that the interest for Ed Wood is renewed, these people leave the "Wood" work. Just to attack someone who really gave them the chance when nobody else would! After 50 years, I would suggest that many of these people should put aside the fact that they did not get the $ 75 they were promised. <br /> <br /> Ed Wood was a brilliant creative filmmaker who knew how to entertain. In fact that was EVERYTHING he lived for. You can laugh when you see Ed's films, but somehow you're aware that you're laughing with him and not with him. <br /> <br /> But, I'm rambling ... Back to the movie in question. If you are waiting for a movie ABOUT Edward D. Wood Jr., you will not get it here. If you want a movie about irritated and bad-tempered old actors, this is the movie for you!
