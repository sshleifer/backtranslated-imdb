Actually I liked this movie until the end. Sure, it was cheesy and quite unlikely, but it still kept my attention on a rainy afternoon. Until the end, that's it. For her final performance in the prestigious classical conservatory where she has struggled to catch up with the other students of classical training, what does the main character do? Wow them with your understanding and execution of this honest musical tradition? No. She tortures and kills Carmen's great sensual Habanera and turns her into a completely forgettable Brittany Spears-wannabe song. My ears bled! And, in the supreme moment of horror, his teachers gave him a standing ovation! Any teacher who was not in a fantasy induced by Spears would have failed on the spot. Save time, save your ears - skip this movie!
