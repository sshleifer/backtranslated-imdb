With a story and a script that seems to have been written by a high school student, 'The Art of Seduction' fails to offer the sophisticated and romantic experience it seeks to promote itself. The two main characters have the potential to be interesting: both the male and female protagonists are "simple singles (or, in the case of the female protagonist, engaged)", but "The art of seduction" does not even try. Avoiding a frank examination of the personalities of these two characters, 'The art of seduction' avoids any substance by a thin and thin stereotype base. <br /> <br /> 'The art of seduction' is an insult, insulting its characters, insulting men and women and insulting the expectations of its audience. Take the terribly beautiful people we all know and play their painful interactions while we wait for them to idolize. Ji-wan is an immature, spoiled and manipulative bitch. The spectator is expected to like and forgive her for her defects because she is beautiful. Min-jun, well, he is exactly the same. They are not good people either. The "humor" in this film revolves mainly around Ji-wan and Min-jun's outlandish attempts to outdo each other in the honorable art of lying and manipulation. No character development occurs, and we never learn why Ji-wan and Min-jun are like that. It is simply expected that we take them as they are, and not that we ask questions, they are cute, and that is all that matters. The abundant references to the celebrity of the main actors in the reviews of the filmmakers of azn cinema can indicate the lack of depth of 'Art of Seduction'. <br /> <br /> If you're still in high school, you liked Grease or if you're a victim of yellow fever, you might like this movie. <br /> <br /> Despite its "Romance" tag, this is not a good dating movie.
