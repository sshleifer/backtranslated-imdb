This movie is "fascinating" but in the same way that a car accident is fascinating. It is difficult to look the other way. In general, this film is nothing more than an incredibly irresponsible social experiment, and a vain and impartial experiment. The filmmakers are manipulators and seem to have no problems to obtain the minimum possible denominator. The way in which money is presented to Ted is pure exploitation. The intermediate steps in which the filmmakers force Ted to participate (meeting the so-called experts) were empty and lacked any substantive attempt to connect with Ted. Instead, it is painfully obvious that they serve to cover the filmmaker's later ones and to further exploit Ted's situation. The worst thing is that the filmmakers stop following Ted after 6 months; and, apparently, they are completely isolated from the subject they had followed so closely months before. If they had cared, they would have found better "experts" to help Ted. If they really wanted to see what Ted would do, then they should have let him spend the money without any intervention. This film is, in the best of cases, a Jackass trick and not a documentary. It is sad to think that $ 100,000 could have changed the life of a homeless person if it had been put in the right hands.
