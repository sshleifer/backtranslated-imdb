Growing up, Joe Strummer was a hero of mine, but even this movie left me cold. For better or for worse, The Future Is Unwritten is not a simple documentary style "Behind the music". Rather it is a biographical art film, replete with interviews, images of performances, home movies and, for the most part, useless animated sketches taken from "Animal Farm". The film is coherent, but it lasts for about half an hour. <br /> <br /> The format of the campfire, although taken into account, is actually quite annoying in the execution. First of all, without titles, it is difficult to know who half of these interviewees are. Secondly, who really needs to listen to people like Bono, Johnny Depp and John Cusack who suck their buttocks on man? They were not relevant to Strummer's life and his opinions add nothing to his story. <br /> <br /> This image is better when Strummer, through recorded interviews and conversations, touches aspects of his life that most people did not know. about the suicide of his older brother, accept the death of his parents, the joy of fatherhood. For me, they were very touching because it showed Joe Strummer not as the punk icon we all knew and loved, but as a normal human being who had to deal with the joys and sorrows of life that we all have to face. <br /> <br /> There have been better and more direct documentaries about Strummer and The Clash. (Westway, VH1 Legends and Murt's documentary by Kurt Loder from the early 90s come to mind). Joe Strummer: The Future Is Unwritten is for fans only.
