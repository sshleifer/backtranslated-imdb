A dark and comic serendipity about a cosmetics saleswoman, with strange ties to Elvis Presley, colliding with a sea of ​​Elvis impersonators while they talked at conventions in Nevada ... and accidentally killing each of them on their own. Kim Basinger, a still attractive actress of considerable merit, likes to choose extravagant movies to play, but this terrible script (by Mitchell Ganem and Adam-Michael Garber) does not have a bit of a good mood. Stereotypes and low gags are not meant to be classic comedy, but even on a shameful and shameful level, the image is crude and sloppy. If you look, see if you can count how many strange shots there are of Basinger at the wheel of his pink Cadillac, his hands always in the same position and a scared look on his face. Let's hope that both she and Elvis were well paid. NO STARS OF ****
