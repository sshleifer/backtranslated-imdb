This cult movie of 1977 has two crazed lesbians (Sandra Locke and Colleen Camp) who appear in the house of the wealthy socialite Doctor George Manning (Seymour Cassel), hoping to find help in locating a residence that looks like They can not find. But these two have other plans in mind, when they discover that George's wife is out of town, they end up taking control of the residence, tying the George, killing a delivery boy and destroying the place in one night. Strange and disturbing film, but both arrive rewarded in the same way that the film ends. Most will not like it or be trapped in this ridiculous movie after about 30 minutes. Either way, some even consider it a cult classic. <br /> <br /> Larry Dodson
