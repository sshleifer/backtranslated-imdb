I could not agree more with another critic who mentioned Jodorowsky. <br /> <br /> Barney seems to be completely bored and lacks inspiration "in content". It can produce candy for the eyes (and I like sweets), but its pretension and fundamental artistic emptiness only diminish all the joy. <br /> <br /> I am afraid that many people do not distinguish between similar works (but really only on the surface) of Jodorowsky or even of more linear filmmakers like Tarkovski or Kubrick (I love the 2001 Odyssey and I was never bored to through the final scenes ...) That type of art like M.Barney's creates confusion and drives away viewers who might otherwise begin to appreciate experimental cinema. Typical "modern" empty of conceptual art. And review your interviews. I just do not buy it, I'm sorry. And so boring. <br /> <br /> I never got bored watching the Alejandro Jodorowsky films, while Drawing Restraint 9 was a total disappointment. Especially while offering the possibility of being something, of saying something in a non-linear and unorthodox way (like the beginning and the great choreographed dance and the preparations for the ship to sail.) The boats "gather" in the sea ... Ideas of the feces as an object of value (if it were feces) Those "pearly" divers ... Everything could build a great surrealist film with some content, but it was not like that, and those horrible pretentious scenes of dressing and false tea ceremony ... How vain and false and philosophically pretentious but empty can it be? <br /> <br /> I have some colorful scenes, but the whole movie became so boring and pretentious and completely empty and fake that it made me Physically ill . <br /> <br /> And it does not have a good rhythm, I like slow-paced movies, but this was just boring in some scenes, because it was pretentious and fake, so I was forced to witness prolonged scenes of artistic vanity a ... <br /> <br /> That kind of movies just kill art and fantasy in my opinion. <br /> <br /> I want more Jodorowsky !!!
