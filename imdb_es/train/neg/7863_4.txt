THHE2 is entertaining, since you will laugh a lot and you will shudder and probably say "oh, sh * t!" and "move your face away from the damn hole you're silly" or similar things, but I do not know if it's really worth seeing. I got very angry with the horrible military characters that do not seem to know the first thing about combat. <br /> <br /> Yes, there was more violence, more gore and a greater number of bodies than the first, but I'm still debating whether that cancels my feelings throughout the film about how ridiculous it is (and not a good ridiculous as Dead Alive or Feast). My time would have been better spent watching the new version of Aja for the fifth time. <br /> <br /> So go for some laughs, or go for something bloody, but do not expect to leave that satisfied.
