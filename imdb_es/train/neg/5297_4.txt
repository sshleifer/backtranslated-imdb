It really baffles me when someone encounters a movie like this and claims that it is one of the worst movies of Slasher. This is not, by far, one of the worst, it's still not a good movie, but it's not the worst. Go see something like Death Nurse or Blood Lake and then come back with me and tell me if you think the night that brings Charlie is the worst. The film has a decent camera work and editing, which is much more than I can say for many more extremely dark slasher movies. <br /> <br /> The movie does not show up on screen deaths, there's a death where you see that your saw pruning tore in the neck, but all the other deaths are not interesting. But the lack of graphic violence on the screen does not mean that this is not a slasher movie, just a bad one. <br /> <br /> Obviously, the movie was not taken seriously. The film arrived at the end of the second cycle of matriceros, so it was certainly a reflection on the traditional elements of the killers, made in an ironic way. For example, after a murder, Charlie goes to the "welcome" poster of the city and marks the population less. This is something that can only make you laugh. <br /> <br /> If you like slasher movies, definitely give this movie a watch. It's a bit different from the usual Slasher movie with the possibility of two assassins, but not by much. The comedy of the film is practically telling the audience to relax and not take the film, therefore, damn it. You can forget the movie, you can remember it. I will remember because I love the name.
