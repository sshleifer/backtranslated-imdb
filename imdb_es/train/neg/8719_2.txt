Well here I go with another film from the industry B It is quite sad to see some bad movies, but I do not care if an industry B or C produces the movie. Show some effort in your work. The characters are really bad. The performance is not in question in this (surprise), but the plot is. How can a united squadron see how they kill two of their fellow soldiers and then continue as if nothing had happened? What made me sick was how the writer even threw the remaining members a scene in which they joked about how pretty the doctor's ass was. Give me a break.
