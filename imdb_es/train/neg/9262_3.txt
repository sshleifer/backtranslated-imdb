On the surface the idea of ​​Omen 4 was good. It's good to see that the demon child could be a girl. In fact, sometimes, as in the Exorcist, when girls are possessed or diabolical is very effective. But in Omen 4, it stunk. <br /> <br /> Delia does not make me think that she could be a diabolical girl, but that she is a girl with problems. Problems that maybe only a therapist, instead of a priest could help. She does not look scared or devilish. Rather, she looks grumpy and in a bad mood. <br /> <br /> This movie had potential and if it was made by the same people who had made the previous three films, it could have worked. But it's quite insulting to actually make a sequel to one of the most favored horror trilogies, like a special movie for television. <br /> <br /> On so many levels, disappointment. It looks cheap, the performance is hammish and the effects are typical of a television drama. The characters do not bring any sympathy, and you do not direct for them. I recently saw it again after someone brought it to me for Christmas, and it has an awful date. <br /> <br /> If you're thinking about seeing this, I suggest you do not do it. Look at one of the others, or look at the Exorcist, or look at the Good Son. Just do not waste your time on this fool!
