I guess this movie is based on some kind of real story ... It's about two young girls who sexually abuse an adult man for 48 hours; I do not see where terror comes into play here ... There are some "strange" and "surreal" sequences in the film. And the two girls (Sandra Locke and ... ah ... oh well) play the roll of two who hate the psycho-man man up to the hilt ... they do a pretty good job (although some of that is a little exaggerated ). The movie is not good, and it's not horrible; It's really very old-fashioned! I mean, this thing is dripping with the 70s ... It's not bad if you like that kind of thing ... you know ... Thang?
