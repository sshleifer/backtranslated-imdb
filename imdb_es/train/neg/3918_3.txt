This movie may have been the biggest disappointment I experienced when renting movies according to the IMDb reviews. In general, I just discovered that this is a second-rate movie. <br /> <br /> Leslie Cheung is certainly passable when the antihero and Ma Wu manage their character with cheerful competition. On the other hand, Ma Wu's makeup (facial hair) is so obviously false that he simply could not take it seriously. He looked like an overweight teenager dressed for Halloween, complete with a $ 4.95 adhesive beard. <br /> <br /> The special effects were more or less, although the "undead" in the hold were pretty good. The tongue of the tree looked like something from a bad monster movie of the 1950s, although the POV shots from the sight of the tongue were more like the shots of Sam Raimi in the latest "Evil Dead" trilogy. The pyrotechnics was boring and the final battle is as boring as you can get. (In fact, it reminded me more closely of the episode "Lost in Space", where the Robinsons are caught in a sandstorm and ...) <br /> <br /> The plot was not particularly original and was He has said innumerable Times in the form of European fairy tales. There was no suspense or twists in the plot. In fact, you know immediately when you are introduced to the characters who is good, who is bad and who is going to survive. <br /> <br /> I just returned this movie to Netflix and then I sat down to write this review. The first thing I did was verify the production date. Yes, it says 1987 ... not in 1967 that I thought it could be. And that sums it up pretty well: production values ​​and FX are typical of the sixties. The plot and the action seem much older, since Hollywood was producing some interesting and challenging films in the 60s. <br /> <br /> ** of *****
