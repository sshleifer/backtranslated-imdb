A largely dense road movie with some comic relief provided by the excellent John Cleese (although he is actually sending his performance at Fawlty Towers). It seems to go from the superior slap to the muddy sentimentality in the blink of an eye, and the worst part of the movie is that Martin and Hawn have to "meet", who they are, etc. See it at your own risk.
