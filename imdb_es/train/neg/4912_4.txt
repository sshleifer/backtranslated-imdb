Having not read the novel, I can not say how faithful this film is. History is a typical mystery material: target murderers of newlyweds; The researcher falls in love with her partner and they diagnose a deadly disease. Yes, it sounds like a telenovela and that's how it plays. The first 2/3 are boring, except for the murders and the last 1/3 make a partial reappearance as the speed increases towards its twisted conclusion. <br /> <br /> Acting is strictly below average, although it is difficult. Blame only the actors: the script is atrocious. During the last 1/3 stop you notice because the movie becomes interesting, but that is only the last 1/3. Director Russell Mulcahy is very involved in his element, but there's not much he can do with a television budget and the network censors on his back. He is quite limited to fast cutting and distorted lenses, although he managed to squeeze a couple of pictures "under the floor" during the murders in the club bathroom. Unfortunately, since this is made for television, the great details of composition that it uses so well with a larger image are nowhere to be found. Note to producers: Give this man a reasonable budget and an anamorphic lens when you hire him. <br /> <br /> Summing it up: this movie is bad for film standards and mediocre for TV standards (instead, see CSI). If you are in the mood for a movie like this, I have some excellent suggestions: buy a copy of Dario Argento's "Deep Red" (my highest recommendation, excellent film), "Opera" or even "Tenebre". They are stronger in all categories.
