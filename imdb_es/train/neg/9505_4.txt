I'm not going to criticize the movie. There is not much to talk about. It has good scenes of animal actions that were probably quite amazing at that time. Clyde Beatty is not exactly a matinee idol. He is a bit light and is not particularly handsome. But that's okay. He is the man in that lion cage. We know that when he can not take the time of his lions to attend to his girlfriend, he will end up on an island with her and will have to save the day. Someone said before that it is a history lesson. The scenes in the circus are from another day, especially the children who are out there. I did not realize that, even in the thirties, they sailed on three mast schooners. It looked like something from 1860. I guess that's the archival material they had. No wonder the thing was destroyed. They are always talking about fixing it. There is even an airship. It tells us a little about male female relationships at that time, a kind of laughing nonsense. But if you do not take it too seriously, you can have fun watching it.
