I can not believe how someone can make a comedy about a subject like homelessness. Of course, Brooks has not done a comedy about really helpless people. There is no mention of drugs, prostitution or violence in these streets. The people we know in this movie are not home in Fantasy land, so the only difference between them and us is that they do not eat with the same frequency. Brooks movies have gotten worse and worse over the years. This is just another nail in the coffin.
