Dreyfuss plays a mafia boss who lost his head, but now he is "fixed". Lane is his girl who has been playing with her Number One (Goldblum), which is supposed to have something with Lane's sister (Barkin). <br /> <br /> With what anyone could consider a star supporting cast (Burt Reynolds, Gabriel Byrne, Kyle MacLachlan and even an appearance by Richard Pryor can not avoid this plot, since Dreyfuss proves that he is not "fixed" "And try to kill everyone in sight. <br /> <br /> You know, it's not like you do not know what's coming." The first ten minutes were just kids trying to tell Goldblum what I was waiting for him when Dreyfuss leaves, but I'll save him all the trouble: skip this movie. <br /> <br /> The real reason I chose this movie is because lately I've been on a kick from Diane Lane and I've been trying to see all of her films.The real disappointment to me was not only the terrible plot, but also the fact that she does not appear until the last fifteen minutes of the movie (although we found out about her throughout the film). Even being a fan of more than half of The cast can not help me enjoy this movie. The parts where the suspense was supposed to be mounted found me laughing at what was really going on. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 stars.
