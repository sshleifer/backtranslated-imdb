The wicker man has done the impossible! It replaced Cat Woman as the worst recent movie in my mind. Yes, it's really that bad. So bad that when I sat down to write this review, I thought: "If I had the option of seeing this film again or of having needles in my eyes" I could actually opt for red-hot needles. <Br /> <br /> Neil LaBute created a rare film in which Joel Schumacher could sit down and say with comfort and a mind free of guilt "Yes, that is a bad direction". <br /> <br /> I think the first clue for me should have been the line on the label: "Some sacrifices must be made". Of course a sinister line may sound to intrigue you, but the sacrifice will be on the public side of the screen. Trust me. The people responsible for this movie must be accused of a hate crime ... or at least a fraud for trying to pass this off as something akin to entertainment. Seriously! The film is about an island where men are just there to reproduce and I would still rather be stuck on Gilligans Island with just photos of Condoleezza Rice and then stay stranded there. <br /> <br /> The most entertaining part of this The movie was the guy that started the loudest fart I've ever heard in a movie theater. That is not a joke or a fiction. I've never been in a "thriller" and I heard so many laughs throughout the movie. I can not tell you with certainty if the laughter was intentional in some effort to relieve the cinematic tension or if you really thought that this crap would really fly. Honestly, I found myself looking for a blackout or maybe a fight to go out at the movies, anything to make this more interesting, which is pretty sad since Deez, Powder and I had 2 beers before the movie just for a little mentality. anesthesia (it will soon become a law before all Nic Cage movies, write to your congressman today, do not delay). In a moment, I really thought that maybe this movie is really a parody and that Anna Ferris is going to present herself. Oh, how I wish. <br /> <br /> Nic Cage throws so much ham per frame that I'm thinking. Have a cholesterol test done today. To think that I once thought Sean Penn was a player for criticizing Nic's performance, oh, he's still a dog, but less than one. Yes, Sean Penn's game was reduced due to this movie. Do us all a favor. Nic plays with your strength and stay with being pathetic losers and drunks. You can not play Superman, you can not play strong hunky roles, go straight to jail, do not pass, do not charge $ 200. His best moments in this movie are when he finally breaks down and actually hits a big woman to steal his bear suit (like fart, it's not a joke or a functional moment during this review) and then it starts to work as that of Conan O'Brian. Bear masturbating, but with half the hilarity of a bear hitting his garbage. Fortunately, it finds its end shortly after, when it turns out that it will be a sacrifice for the crowd in the new hybrid show of Burning Man and Lilith Fair. Yes!!!! I simply ruined the end for you and if you knew something better, you would build statues of mine in my adoration and sing songs of my legend. I sat through this crap-fest so you do not have to. <br /> <br /> Halfway through this little misadventure, I thought to myself that Jack Bauer would have finished this case in 20 minutes of real time. .OK 35 minutes if Kim is attacked by a mountain lion first. Even Steve Martin, like Inspector Clouseau, could have discovered this in less than an hour, and you, sir, are not Inspector Clouseau. <br /> <br /> If for some reason you are captured and have the option to watch this movie or take a bullet, take the bullet. <br /> <br /> Somewhere, Uwe Boll is laughing at all of us.
