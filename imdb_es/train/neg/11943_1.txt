The landscape is beautiful and the dog is cute. Apart from that, this movie has absolutely nothing to recommend. Jack Warden is pleasantly friendly as always, but the script is so horrible that even he goes wrong. The plot does not make sense, the dialogue is silly and there are many smaller flaws. But the dog is cute ...
