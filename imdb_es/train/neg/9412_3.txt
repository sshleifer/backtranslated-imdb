This film was screened as part of the Sydney Mardi Gras Film Festival of 2007. I had no expectation of the film, since someone else chose it for me. <br /> <br /> I really like the films that are slow to develop, movies that allow the characters to develop and the story to flow. Stillness is good. However, this movie was simply slow. <br /> <br /> The credit should go to the two main actors. There was a feeling of tension between them when two totally different people, really maladjusted, unite in a very uncomfortable way. There were moments of tenderness and sadness as we learned more about them. <br /> <br /> I also liked the configuration and the way it was filmed. It was claustrophobic and monochrome, which added to the intimacy of the film and reinforces the rarity of the characters. <br /> <br /> I just do not understand the ending. What was the point of all this?
