My friend bought the movie for 5 ?? (Not worth 1 cent) because they wrote that it was like the American pie. but we would soon discover that there is a long way from the American pie to that piece of shit. It's not even a comedy, it's more like a really bad documentary. Not only is history bad, the image and sound also stink. They put some alcohol, chicks, dwarves and drunken teenagers. And the result is a disaster. If you watch this movie, do not buy it, instead of spending your money on something else, and better. If you are going to torture yourself, then do not invite your friends, unless you really hate and want to get rid of them.
