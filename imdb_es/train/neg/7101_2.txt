I would have given this movie a zero of ten, but I'll give it a two. The first reason is that Shah Rukh Khan appears in the film, which is not really a reason. The last point is that Rani appears in this movie and makes a kiss with Kamal. I love Rani a lot and I have a respect that she is a great actress. That's why I did not enjoy it in this movie kissing Kamal, but it's not a big deal. Anyway, quite a lot of the bedroom scenes that made this film noticeable, let's talk about this movie. Is good or bad? I think it's a completely garbage movie that made me yawn. Being a fantastic critic, you can see my other more than 250 reviews by clicking on my name, I have great taste. The film is not entertaining is one thing and if this is supposed to be a very hard cinema, why is there no moral in this movie? It is a skewed movie that is not a true story and stinks. Seeing Kamal kissing these actresses makes me sick, the man can not kiss properly anyway.
