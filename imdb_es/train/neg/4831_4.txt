I rented this movie on Netflix after it won all the Oscars, to see if it really was that good. <br /> <br /> The Hurt Locker is a very realistic portrait (for the most part) of a group of soldiers rotation. in Iraq. The film centers around Will James, a reckless soldier who gets his dose of adrenaline for taking risks and defusing bombs. <br /> <br /> Where this film seems to be missing in my opinion is the plot and direction of the film. This movie does not have a clear plot unlike other films like Black Hawk Down. What this film tries to do is to focus more on the characters and their different attitudes about the war. Bigelow does a good job focusing on the characters, but there are many points in the movie where the dialogue seems to drag. Hurt Locker lasts 131 minutes, however, it feels like a 3-hour movie. <br /> <br /> A scene from the movie that was particularly horrible and ruined the film's perfect credibility, was the sniper scene in the middle of the movie. It was unrealistic and very long. <br /> <br /> In general, I thought that this movie was fine, but the reason I gave it a 6 instead of a 7 was that it was a big disappointment to win the Best Film. at the Oscars. I felt that this movie could have been much better considering that Saving Private Ryan lost the Best Film, but it was much better than this movie. Another notable mention is Black Hawk Down, who only won 2 Oscars. Honestly, I do not know how this better image won. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for an action-packed war movie, rent Black Hawk Down. This movie will be forgotten in a year or two.
