Today I began to discuss why so many people complain about modern movies in which I found a curious statement: "the development of the character in the newer films is not as good or interesting as it used to be". Depending on the film (s) in question, this can be attributed to a number of things, sometimes generic special effects and Hollywood garbage based on the plot as War Of The Worlds, but in the case of exaggerated attempts and little Interesting social commentaries and a desperate struggle to put "art" back in the movies, are the films like Dog Days that are to blame. <br /> <br /> I usually have a great tolerance for movies, no matter how boring or useless they are. Find them (ranging from the good and long as Andrei Rublev and Dogville, to those who have considered painful to sit through Alpha Dog and Wild Wild West). I turn off this movie for 45 minutes, which is 30 minutes longer than I really should have done. I was not interested in any of the characters and I did not find anything substantial beyond a thin veil of unfocused pessimism. In an attempt to say something about the rubble of society, this film easily becomes self-indulgent, trite and exploitative in a very sincere sense. Of course, I have seen many disturbing films about the same subject, but there are many better films out there about depressing and pathetic people (Happiness, Gummo, Children, Salo, Storytelling, Irreversible) that actually contain characters of great emotional depth and personality. Dog Days had nothing but the disgust of an eighth grade child for society, chose to ignore any true intelligence about the way people really are and, instead, chooses to be a boring, horrible and desperately little attempt original in a work of "art". This is not a characterization of the unknown or an intelligent observation in the rubble of society, it is simply boring and it is not worth worrying about anything.
