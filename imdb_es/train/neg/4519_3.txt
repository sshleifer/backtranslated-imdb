Three Stooges - Have Rocket, Will Travel - 1959 This was the first feature film that starred the Stooges and is quite bad. It makes THE THREE STOOGES GO AROUND THE WORLD A DANGER (since 1963) look like a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The Stooges are janitors at a rocket site. They climb a rocket and go to Venus. They come across some things, including a unicorn they call "Uni", that they bring back to Earth with them. "Uni" talks like an average and nice person - 'Oh, hello. How are you? Beautiful planet here. I hope you like it.' Hilarious. <br /> <br /> Very few gags and many of the scenes go on and on and on. <br /> <br /> The Stooges return from space and the film ends as far as the story continues, but no one told the filmmakers that the image continues for another 10 minutes or so at a party where nothing happens . The Stooges leave the party and then the movie is almost finished. <br /> <br /> Highlight of the film: the end where the Stooges sing a little song about their trip. Larry and Curly Joe hit Moe in the face with two cakes. Brutal. <br /> <br /> Another writer mentioned the good musical score. Eh The only music I noticed were two classic melodies: TOMARÃ‰ ROMANCE and VUELVAMOS TO MAKE THE SONG, both of which are played at the party. And * that * really is the highlight of the image: the music of the old Columbia movies. <br /> <br /> The sexy and tall blonde was nice. <br /> <br /> It's horrible, a new VHS video from The Shop for only 99 cents.
