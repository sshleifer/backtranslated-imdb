Usually, when a movie receives a vote of one, it is because someone simply dislikes and resents that it does not have a lower rating, so they decide to drag it down as much as they can instead of simply giving it a low rating. This is not the case here. <br /> <br /> Bonesetter is a perfect example of a 0/10 movie. He does not do anything right and he does not have the opportunity to do it because he really does not try to do anything. There are threads of a kind of evil D & D plot that does not hold together and a complete lack of any kind of acting. It is clear that no one involved in this project made any serious effort, since even the hard work of a completely patent person would not have more value. A really horrible movie.
