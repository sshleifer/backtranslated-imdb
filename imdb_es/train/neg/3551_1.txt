This movie is just terrible !!!! Slow, slow acting to get to the point and wooden characters that simply should not have been there. The best part was the presentation of Iron Maiden singing in a video in a theater and that's it. The ending was worth seeing and waiting for, but that was it! The characters in this movie put me to sleep almost. Avoid it!
