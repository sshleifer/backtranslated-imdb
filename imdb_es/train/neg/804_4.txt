I qualified this movie with a 1 since the plot is incredibly amazing. Judge for yourself. Be careful, the following will not only reveal the plot, but it will also spoil your appetite for watching the movie. <br /> <br /> A computer virus, designed by a frustrated nerd, sends a code through television screens and computer monitors. When the code, in the form of light, enters the eye, you can access the "electrical system" of your body. What it does is force the body's cells to excrete calcium. A few seconds after infection, the patient reaches his neck, develops a tunnel vision, his skin turns white to calcium, after which he falls and his hand and skull crack into a cloud of chalk. <br /> <br /> This virus is very smart. When he learns that a blind computer expert is trying to dismantle the code with a hand-operated Braille output device, the device is set to a very high voltage, which causes severe burns to the skin of the head of the computer. expert. The virus also detects the aggression against the remote controls and the keyboard of an ATM. Fortunately, he could stop throwing obsolete desktops on a shelf and electrocuting the nerd with his back on a broken computer and his feet in some spilled water. <br /> <br /> Oh, heavens ...
