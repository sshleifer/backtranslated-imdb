No word can describe my total hatred for this atrocious interpretation of the BTK murderer. Qualifying this movie one in ten complements this truly disastrous excuse for a movie. From beginning to end, there was not a single climax. The whole thing was horribly put together; the script, the acting, the plot, the lighting, the direction, ACT, objective information, ACT, just to name a few. A series of scenes are, literally, laughter to laughter, for the atrocious way in which everything is organized. This review may seem like an unfair and scathing attack on a low budget movie, but this is not the case. Just thinking about the movie that I just saw makes my blood start to boil. How this movie never received production rights I will NEVER know. I'm almost tempted to recommend BTK, because it's really a distinction as to how pathetic and horribly horrible it is. I can honestly say, in all my years of film shooting, this is the WORST. MOVIE. FOREVER. I lost more than an hour of my life in this useless garbage, and I would have gladly jumped out of the nearest building beforehand, had I known what I was in. ZERO out of ten.
