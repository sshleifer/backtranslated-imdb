Slow, Slow, Slow ... There is no mystery or emotion in this movie. If you do not find out who the "mole" is in the first ten minutes, you must be brain dead. The secret service must have been too, because it took them all the film to put it together. There are no convincing characters in the movie (no movie). The pace of the movie is slow, there is no tension. The hit man is an excellent marksman, unless he is pointing to Michael Douglas from what he seems to be able to hit on large glass panels. The funniest scene in the movie is when the president's wife says the key word in the anticlimactic ending. He laughs at ridiculous laughter. At least six people got up and left the movie early. I would have joined them if I was not sitting in the middle of the line. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
