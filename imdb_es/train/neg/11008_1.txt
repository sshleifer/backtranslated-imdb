I bought this in the tower records after seeing the commercial information about fifteen hundred times in the comedy center. In fact, I was really anxious to see this. My God, where did I go wrong? Now, before giving my opinion, let me say that I am a person who can find the best in all the movies. Hell, I have over 1,500 DVDs! With that said, the underground comedy movie is on the list of the worst movies I've seen in my life. I tried to give it a try, but not only was it not funny. It did not make any sense, it did not offend anyone and it was stupid. God who in their right mind thought these pieces of shit were funny? this goes straight to the bottom of the container ...
