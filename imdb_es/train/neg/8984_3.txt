If you've ever wanted to see a movie that emphasizes style over substance, this is for you. For me, Son de Mar is beautiful to SEE, but there is a precious little substance, unless the threads of manipulative, melodramatic and melodramatic love ignite you. This may be one of those famous 'movies for girls' that you've heard so much about. <br /> <br /> We're halfway through this movie before something really happens: Ulises (Jordi Molla) goes out to sea in search of tuna, and does not return, leaving his wife Martina (Leonor Watling)) son to fend for themselves. Then, in a furious six-minute screen time, they bury Ulysses, Martina remarries and her son grows up to the middle of childhood. This rapid transposition is discordant, to say the least, and very careless: after 40 minutes of more or less circling, suddenly we find ourselves in a full-blown melodrama, all in six minutes. I think this is called capricious narrative rhythm. <br /> <br /> Five years later, Ulises (as in the wandering superhero Ulises, do you understand?), returns to her 'Penelope' (Watling) only to discover that she is married to Sierra (Eduard Fern√°ndez), a guy inexplicably rich (what does DO you do to gain all the mass?) That inexplicably keeps crocodiles as pets. When Martina, very angry, asks Ulises about his absence, he tells her that someday he will take her to the island of Sumatra and that she will understand EVERYTHING. <br /> <br /> And here's the thing: he DO NOT take her to the island of Sumatra. The reference simply dies somewhere in the script. He does NOT really explain where he was and why he ignored his wife and son for five years. He does NOT present himself as an honorable guy, and the movie does NOT fill in the holes in the plot that are watching us for at least half of the movie. I can only assume that director Bigas Luna wants us to complete the story lines with the mystical clues (fish, reptiles, the sea) that he offers through an impressive cinematography and an evasive dialogue. It just does not work The narrative 'arch' of this film ends up looking more like a staggering clothesline. <br /> <br /> I'm sure Jordi Molla is a good actor, but I just could not buy his Ulysses as any kind of hero. (which is what was supposed to be the original Ulysses). With wet sensuality, it emits a short stanza of identical poetry by Virgil approximately 2,000 times and each time it excites Martina to explosive orgasm. This boy must be hired to revitalize rancid marriages. I'm sure Virgil would be impressed. He did not go to bed as often as I understand it. <br /> <br /> This poetic 'device' occupies a prominent place in the film, and I had no choice but to assume that it was a genre inversion of the 'famous' siren song' of Ulysses (ie, beautiful maidens They sing in a seductive way to distant sailors, who were condemned if they responded to the call of the mermaid If this is what Bigas Luna is plotting, you can see the problem: he is offering a complex symbolism in an attempt to steal and grab High Art. Again, it just does not work, at least in my opinion. <br /> <br /> Watling is a gorgeous and beautiful young actress, but she gives us a character here who does not seem to have much intellectual or even depth I can not understand how you can fall desperately in love with a guy who sports a rental sign on his face (like in the oily, oily hair of the 60s that looks more like seaweed) and one of those modern beards 21st century. '(you know, I grew up four days, no more, no less). It is SUPPOSED that he is a kind of dream person (I think), but those eyes of his suggest that he might be suffering more from overexposure to an absurd script. <br /> <br /> But, do not despair, this movie is great to watch. Just do not try to connect the dots in the false tracks or think too much about what you are listening to in the dialogue. You can lose the fast forward in this movie (especially in the first 40 minutes) and you really will not miss much.
