So this guy named George is sitting alone at home on his birthday when two women appear. George's wife is in a hospital taking care of her son, so when the wife is away, George gets into the bubble bath and makes love with the two girls. It's not a big scene because it really does not show anything. After that, the birthday boy wakes up the next morning and the girls are still at home. They make him a good breakfast, but George is not hungry. George is not very happy and tries to get rid of them, but when he gets home, the girls are still at home. The girls have had enough with old George and they do not want to cook for them anymore. Both become great psychopaths and use George in their little crazy game. I liked that the girls just did what they wanted and ruined George's house. George was not really that good with his two guests. When George said he was a married man, he really did not seem to want to say that. George looked like Tom Tucker in Family Guy. I went for the two girls all the time.
