A few days ago, I saw a documentary called THE FIFTY Worst MOVIES OF ALL TIMES, and this is where I first heard of THE INCREDIBLE MELTING MAN. Being a lover of awkward movies, I'm trying hard to try to find some of the films in the documentary, not only to include THE INCREDIBLE MELTING MAN. In fact, MELTING MAN is the first "bad movie" I've seen since then and I must say that I'm quite disappointed. Although it really is a bad movie, it is not close enough to include it in this list. <br /> <br /> Now, before watching the documentary, I have enjoyed "bad movies" since I read the book "The Fifty Worst Movies of All Time" by Harry Medved. Despite the same title, the book came out long before the documentary and the creators of the documentary never attributed to Medved the concept. From Medved's book, I've seen about 35 of the 50 films, but I've come to a standstill: the rest of the movies are simply not available on VHS or DVD. Then, I thought about trying the movie with the same name. <br /> <br /> The reason I was most disappointed with THE INCREDIBLE MELTING MAN was that there were some good elements in the movie. First, the special effects of the melting boy were generally really cool and disgusting. It is obvious that a professional (the famous Rich Baker) was involved in making this aspect realistic. However, I must also point out that there were also more than a few cheap and cheesy effects, such as the floating plastic head and the way the monster ran after his left arm was cut off: you could see "Smartly hidden" under his clothes! As for the story, it's stupid. A group of astronauts miraculously penetrates Saturn's rings without being crushed. Then, they comment on how beautiful the sun is, since we see close-ups of it. This is strange since Saturn is very far from that, it should NOT look like this, it must be a big stain. In any case, the scene immediately changes and we are told that one of the surviving astronauts is in a hospital. What happened between the last scene and this one? Yes, nobody knows. Well, shortly thereafter, the survivor escapes and engages in a murderous uproar while his entire body melts. <br /> <br /> Now, considering that they have a running psychopath that looks like a melted palette, one would think the government would do it. pull out all the stops to find it and stop it, right? Incorrect. A general hires a single doctor to find him !! There is no army, there is no police, only a dumb doctor. Even after the bodies begin to accumulate, at no time does the doctor or the general do anything to organize a meaningful search or obtain support. <br /> <br /> Now, given the stupidity of the movie, you would not be surprised to find the following: <br /> <br /> When the guy who melts runs around the doctor's house, the doctor will He gives his wife a powerful sedative and leaves her at home. <br /> <br /> When a beautiful elderly couple drives late at night; naturally, they stop in an orchard to pick fruits and die. <br /> <br /> When a woman sees an uncle that melts, she blocks the door to protect herself. This would be smart if she did not have the back door of the house next to her! Instead of leaving the house and escaping, she just waits! <br /> <br /> When a photographer and his model take snapshots, the boy grabs his assistant and takes off his shirt. Why? Well, to give the audience a cheap thrill and turn it into an R-rated movie. <br /> <br /> When the melting uncle finally meets and the sheriff has a clear shot at him, the doctor stops him , although for now the monster had killed half a dozen people. <br /> <br /> Then, as you can see, the movie is full of stupid elements of the plot. It is a very bad movie. But, given the good special effects from time to time, it just was not a horrible movie as I expected. Sure, it's good to laugh, but it's not close to PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE in badness and it should never have been included in anyone's worst movie list.
