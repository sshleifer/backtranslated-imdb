Before watching this film, I expected a fictional drama based on ideas from the book; instead, it is the book, interrupted with dramatic scenes that illustrate the different "diseases". That did not bother me much, but it hindered my enjoyment of the movie. A story or even two or three long stories with excerpts from the book interspersed throughout the film would have been preferable, in my opinion. If you are going to base a film on a psychology text, you have to find a text that is more interesting (and preferably accurate) than this one. The film is prolonged in parts where it is little more than a video encyclopedia of nineteenth-century sexual psychology and would be completely intolerable if it were not of a sexual nature (because "sex = interesting" to most of us, even to me). Fortunately, there are several stories with the actual development of the character that we are attracted to. <br /> <br /> But, disappointingly, Krafft-Ebing's sexuality theories remained unanswered, for the most part. He hoped that he would use stories to show how the imperfections of his archaic vision of psychology, which is still considered by many today. <br /> <br /> So, in the end, what do you have? A detailed catalog of some fetishes and orientations, with some slightly interesting stories that show the trials and tribulations of some "sexual deviants" before they are cured. For most of the movie, the movie moves with the tracking speed (and mood) of a wake. And, like an obviously low-budget film, cinematography and acting are not exactly top-notch. Although I liked * * the music, the wardrobe and the interior design. <br /> <br /> I felt that the subject of this film was very important, and I still feel that it is a film below average. It deserves a 3/10; A 4/10 if I felt extremely generous. I can not imagine anyone enjoying this if they were not interested in sexual fetishism.
