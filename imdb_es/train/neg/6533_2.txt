It is revealing that from the entry of this comment, NOT women have sent a vote of any kind for this film. It's not surprising that cheesy science fiction does not appeal to you so much ... If you like a good "B" movie, and especially if you like to satirize them while you watch them, you'll like this. If you do not enjoy watching bad movies, this is not for you.
