I remember this movie, exhibition in Barcelona (Spain) in 1970, for a week. Although it might seem incredible, and I can not offer any explanation, this film was shown in a theater dedicated to ... high quality art films (ie, Bergman, Resnais, Malle, Bu√±uel and ... The Projected Man). Few people saw it (fortunately, people) and you can not find any reference on this very boring SF movie in the Science Fiction Encyclopedia of Peter Nichols, or on the author of the original novel. Very indicative I remember that, after all these years, a non-story, many special effects that seem ridiculous effects, in fact, and nothing more. It seems that in some countries the execution time is 90 mm. and in another 77 min. Well, it means a little more pain.
