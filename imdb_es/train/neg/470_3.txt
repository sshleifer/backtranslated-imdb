I used to LOVE this movie when I was a kid, but seeing it again more than 20 years later, it sucks. Up The Academy could have been ahead of its time in 1980, but it has almost nothing to offer today! Movies like Caddyshack and Stripes are much better today than this steaming dogpile. Not a There are no great jokes except for the one-time phrases we have already heard a million times. <br /> <br /> I recently bought the DVD with the hope that it was the jewel I remembered. Well, I was far away! The soundtrack had only 2-3 recognizable punches (not the overwhelming compilation that others had mentioned) and the frequent voice-overs were terrible. For me, the only thing that was interesting was to predict what the character's lines were before they said them. Yes, I've seen this movie a lot then! <br /> <br /> The only reason I write this review is to give my two cents for which I should forget this movie, I'm sorry to say. :(
