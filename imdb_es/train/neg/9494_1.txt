The only thing that surprises me more than the number of people who liked this movie is that it was directed by Clint Eastwood, whose work I admire immensely. The cables had absolutely no chemistry. Not for a second could he believe that there was something deeper than the lust between them. The story just did not seem true. Add to that forced conversation, tons of stereotypes and an incredibly slow plot that, basically, does not lead anywhere, and you have a real stinker. Kay Lenz's nude scenes may be worth it for those looking for some salacious food, but otherwise, it's a colossal waste of time. My thoughts while watching the movie was that it would have been better titled "Cheesy".
