Recherche is a good word to describe this movie. <br /> <br /> Let's say that each movie has a point of sale, a trick. The trick of the Transformers are the impressive effects, as well as the nostalgia of the fans. The insomnia in Seattle's trick is situational in its line of identification: "What if someone you never knew, someone you never saw, someone you never knew was the only one for you?" Many romantics rely heavily on these tricks and some through the draw of big names. Leap Years uses both Irish folklore and circumstance and presents considerably famous names in the country. <br /> <br /> So now the audience is in the cinema, in addition to all the usual elements in characters, conflicts or consequences. , crisis, resolution and outcome, also expect a stimulating dialogue, more absorbing situations as a result of the leap years, interesting subplots and perhaps, to a certain extent, a good turn in the middle or towards the end of a story that favors the circumstances of characters. <br /> <br /> This is what Jean Yeo is trying not to achieve. If they tried, their goal was apparently on the other court, in the other stadium, on the other side of the planet. She and her writer, Alain Layrac, failed to provide a stimulating dialogue. Most of the lines were devised. It seems they have a bag full of lines that they would like to use in their film: "Okay, these are the lines and quotes I've heard or read about the movies I've seen or the books I've read before. If they sound good, they will sound good to the audience, so all I have to do is put them all together, I'm going to use them all. " The result is cathartic. I can not say that the lines were unnecessary and that they have no relation to the story or to the plot, but they seem to come from nowhere, catching you off guard with these quotable quotes. <br /> <br /> On a personal level, I know people who quote quotes based on most situations in our dialogue, trying to make it meaningful to themselves while nodding their heads. I no longer go out with them because the urge to hit them is overwhelming. <br /> <br /> Second, the portrayed characters are silly and one-dimensional. With the exception of the unnatural dialogue that implies their motivation (necessary to drive the plot), there was no sense of conviction in them. I have no idea who they are. All are simple lines that come from the column of advice of a magazine oriented to women. <br /> <br /> The trick in leap years is not enough to drive the story because the circumstances are too shallow. On the other hand, there are movies with less, but they did better than this, they are not there. They did it with my first and second point. On the other hand, subplots are inconsequential (not that it is a bad thing for movies) and thin (bad thing). <br /> <br /> Jean Yeo and the producers are trying to pass the terrible plot with elegant places and passable photography. This is because they probably understand that it is possible and easier to obtain the approval of some viewers than of others with the proper use of cinematography, the soundtrack and the place of filming. These spectators are not demanding. <br /> <br /> It's not even the kind of movie that is so bad that it's good. It is simply bad. Do not look at this
