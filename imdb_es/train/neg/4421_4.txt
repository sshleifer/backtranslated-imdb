The subject is certainly convincing: a group of people take their love of the game one step further by creating a fake medieval world full of warriors, kings, princes and castles. Wargaming is an interesting phenomenon that delves into our collective need to "escape" reality and, sometimes, the mundane of our existence, something that almost everyone can relate to. The characters are the predictable mix of the Lord of the Rings nerds and Star Trek enthusiasts. That is enough for most people to see. However, very quickly, the film becomes an internal vision of the war game with an almost stereotyped touch of the nose to viewers who "do not understand". The filmmakers seem to take the issue of the war game, and this one in particular, is too serious instead of occasionally recognizing the humor and fun of making a film about adults in medieval clothes and beating each other with foam swords. It is quite difficult for anyone who does not sit on their computer for 7 to 10 hours a day playing or designing the last star destroyer to understand what the characters are talking about and why we should care. However, the filmmakers themselves do not seem to mind focusing solely on the theme of the game instead of building a solid narrative with a clear story that anyone can understand. Also, the characters themselves are not so convincing and you quickly get bored of them: a big no-no when you try to keep people's attention for 90 minutes.
