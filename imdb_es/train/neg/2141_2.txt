I had the displeasure of watching this movie with my girlfriend, who, like me, is a fan of the first one. This movie below sucked! He lacked the magic of the first. You could understand every word that the mice said, the animation is horrible, the palace is very different from the first movie, there are new characters that were never mentioned before and they were terrible, luckily the Prince did not have many lines to keep it. to sound stupid. It's basically like the Lion King 1 1/2, except for their different stories, all told by the mice. The reason why I give this a 2 out of 10 is because the songs that the characters did not sing were the most pleasant.
