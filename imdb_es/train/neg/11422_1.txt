I saw him in the theater when he left, and yesterday I saw him again on cable. This allowed me to familiarize myself with the feeling of how disgusting this film is. The whole group of characters are self-absorbed narcotic harassers. Worst of all, it reinforces every negative stereotype about dating in their twenties, even when it pretends to celebrate that people "find themselves." The good guys finish at the end, the abrupt ones are done very well, the fucker ones do it better. The girls are all boy pushovers. Only one character ("Wendy") is seen doing something remotely useful to society, and dispensing with his virginity saved on a night of waste with a scum, in a lush filmed scene that we are supposed to think is romantic. What really is the Hollywood concept of young America: permissive, detached, promiscuous, cocky.
