I imagined that the joke of the movie would be to see a rich white man acting as Chris Rock, and then watch Chris Rock react to the reactions of the people. Instead, you only see Chris Rock being himself and the people who do not understand him. There are maybe 2 scenes in the whole movie where they use their trick. This should have been much better.
