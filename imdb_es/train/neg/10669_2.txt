A set of disinterested and unpleasant characters twist and make their way through a flimsy plot that could be interesting, if only you could take care of yourself. This "twist and turn" of which I speak refers not to history (which contains all the suspense of a recipe for the tuna casserole), but to the inability of the director to keep the faces of the characters even remotely centered in the frame . On the other hand, Angie Harmon has very nice nostrils and left ear. <br /> <br /> The only real surprise in the movie are the big names that convinced them to do it. When you consider that this movie was never released in theaters despite having a star cast, you might be inclined to think that something stinks. <br /> <br /> And, in fact, it does.
