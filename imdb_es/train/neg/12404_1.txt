I must say that this movie is a hit of Mork and Mindy, when I saw it I got chills, I even got a little wet. When that Korean guy with the spiders on his neck started kicking people, I was like, oh sir, Asian people smell and suck because they eat dogs all the time. Either way, Chuck had a somewhat terrible performance and lacked the intelligence of a regular non-robotic human being. Some people compared him to his previous days when he was a car wash analyzer and believed in the Holy Spirit and the past of Christmas. This movie is so bad that I put my newborn child in a box and left it in Mr. Norris' mailbox. He can raise my son. I'm not going to let him into a world where he believes Chuck Norris is an expert in karate. I'll let him see what that attack is like in real life for the rest of his life.
