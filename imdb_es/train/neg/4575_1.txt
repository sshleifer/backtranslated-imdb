I admit that I'm just a college student right now, a student of English at that. By the time I saw this movie, I was a high school student. I mean it's a high school year, but it may have been a year older, hard to remember. My experience with quantum physics goes more or less to my honors course in physics, an interest in quantum mechanics that has led me to read about it in several books on the theoretical aspects of the field, as well as any article I can find in Discover and the like. I am not a PhD student in any way. <br /> <br /> That said ... <br /> <br /> This movie is just terrible. It is designed to appeal to the scientific mind of the average New Age guru who desperately wants to believe in how special the whole world is. My mother is such a person and since she has seen this movie, she has tried to have all her friends see her and they bought a copy of the film. I tried to point out the various flaws and problems I had seen with the logic and science of films, and they are numerous, and she rejected my statements because "oh, a high school student knows more than all those people with PhDs." apparently, it's like that. <br /> <br /> Leave behind the fact that obtaining a PhD does not necessarily require a person to be correct or, in fact, intelligent. Leaving behind the fact that my basic understanding of physics is enough to discredit half of the movie. Leaving that behind, the filmmakers completely manipulated their interviews with at least one of the participants to make it appear that he supported their beliefs when, in fact, he was completely opposed to them. <br /> <br /> I could continue and but I think Intuitor did a very good job of discrediting the movie, so feel free to read it if you want. <br /> <br /> http://www.intuitor.com/moviephysics/bleep.html
