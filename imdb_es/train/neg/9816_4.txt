This movie was like a bad train crash, horrible as it was, you still had to keep watching. My boyfriend and I rented it and we wasted two hours of our day. Now do not get me wrong, the acting is good. Only the film as a whole angered us both. There was nothing positive or good about this scenario. After this movie, I had to rent something else that was a little lighter. Jennifer Tilly is, as always, a very dramatic actress. His character seems manic and not everything is there. Darryl Hannah, although she played too much, does a wonderful job in the situation she is in. More than once I found myself screaming at the television telling him to defend himself or get violent. In short, a very violent movie ... not for the faint of heart.
