Even though the book was not strictly accurate for the actual situation he described, he still had a sense of Japan. I find it hard to believe that someone who participated in the making of this film had ever been to Japan, since he did not feel Japanese in the least. Almost everything was terrible. I admit that the actors in general were pretty good, but they had no chance of saving him. Before the movie started, I was surprised that there were only ten people in the theater on a Friday night, shortly after the movie premiered in Japan. 30 minutes when I was surprised they stayed. I stayed to have the right to criticize him. The whole movie punctuated my moans and suppressed the laughter of disbelief of my Japanese girlfriend. Everyone I saw coming out of that cinema had an expression of confusion and disappointment on their faces. <br /> <br /> To the creators of this movie, you owe me two hours.
