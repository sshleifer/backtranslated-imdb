Daniel Sadek paid whoever wrote "Redline" as a great car movie to promote this bunch of amateur, hot and hot garbage. Easily the worst automotive movie or any movie ever made. This makes Showgirls look like Citizen Kane. <br /> <br /> Take out all the cheesy clich√©s from an 80's action television series, put some really bad special effects and lame characters with no relevance, and have living proof that Daniel Sadek should not write scripts and produce movies, but must stay in the real estate business. <br /> <br /> This is such an unconvincing film with such an unconvincing argument and the most artificial action sequences in history. What offends me is not that the creators of this film are idiots, but that they consider that the film is made public as idiots to fall into this crap.
