There is no real plot for this, just a series of short parodies that represent some VERY old jokes. I chuckled once or twice at first, to my disgust. But even at 73 minutes, this movie wears out, is welcome in a short time and becomes obsolete and tedious (with a little nudity dotted here and there to keep you awake). Even as bad as this movie is (and that's pretty putrid), it's a comical gem compared to almost ANYTHING by Aaron Seltzer and Jason Friedberg (date movie, Epic movie, Meet the Spartans) Also the song is sadly catchy in a sad way <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: 11 pairs of tits, 3 bushes, 3 asses <br /> <br /> My rating: D <br /> <br /> Red Code DVD Extras: Original trailer of this movie; and trailers for "Beyond the Door", "Dead Pit", "The Farmer", "Obsessed Ones", "Power Play", "Sole Survivor", & "Wacky Taxi"
