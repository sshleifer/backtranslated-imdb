['The funniest scene in this movie is probably when our saviors get their medals and plates and all that. So, the basic idea is that the police outnumber these gang members by a million to one, but they are powerless because the villains&#39; weapons are a little bigger. I guess the police ammunition is just a little bit. They decided to film this movie in a documentary style with false interviews and, seriously, what happens to these guys? They speak as if armed with rolled up newspapers. Okay, I admit, it&#39;s probably still dangerous to be in the line of fire, even when the situation is very advantageous for you, but do not go crazy. And why the hell did it take 44 minutes to solve everything? I would say it&#39;s a long time when you have them surrounded and you can shoot. They are ten feet away, they hit absolutely nothing. Then they go and buy bigger weapons to increase their heroism. And then, yes, there you have it, one of the cops actually hits someone. The bullet was probably diverted by a lamp post or something like that. I laughed a lot, I suppose.']
