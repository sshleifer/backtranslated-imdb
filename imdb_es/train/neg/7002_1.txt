I have seen this movie and the other one. Trinity is my name and I find that this is worse than the first. I have no idea why they made another movie. It was stupid and useless, I'm sorry to say that I have them all. I've sat through them several times and it still drives me to turn it off 5 minutes into the movie. I like Terence Hill movies and I like Bud Spencer, but this movie made me climb the wall. If I had a different story or at least more of an argument and more comedy, it could have been more fun and it was worth the 5 dollars I spent to buy all the movies. But he makes mistakes, so I would say save money and do not miss this movie or any of those that accompany it trust me.
