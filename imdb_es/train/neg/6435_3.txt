I find it hard to believe that someone would put this movie in the same context as the Exorcist. Where the exorcist was subtle and creepy, Stigmata was blunt, clumsy and overly formulated. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most visually beautiful movies I've seen in a long time, but the images are not seen. for the downward spiral of condescending exposure that makes it unbearable. <br /> <br /> My interest in this movie peaked when compared to The Exorcist, and my visit to the official website increased that interest. The website had many stories of "real" stigmas throughout history. However, scene by scene, the film is so obsessed with its search for "authenticity" that at first it becomes comical, and then it is difficult to see it towards the end. I began to suspect when the priest in charge of investigating possible miracles enters the beauty salon where our aspiring heroine cuts her hair and, evidently, flirts with the priests. <br /> <br /> The plot: A woman without faith in God begins to receive the wounds of Christ (the stigmas) and is bewildered and annoyed by the test. A priest is sent directly from the Vatican to investigate the case. Frankie is possessed by Satan, or a vessel for Jesus Christ? <br /> <br /> The only miracle in this movie is that it finally ends.
