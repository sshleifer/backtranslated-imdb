In general, an overrated movie that features a strong cast and an intelligent dialogue and, of course, songs by Dean Martin. The problem is Nicholas Cage, there is no chemistry between him and Cher and they are the central love story. Cher almost makes up for this with her reactions to Cage's changing accent and out-of-control body language. The cage simply never sits on its paper. He tries everything he can think of and presents himself as an actor instead of a real person and that is what is needed in a love story. Cage has had this same kind of performance problem in other roles that require more than one Jimmy Stewart-type character. Cage continues to take these roles, perhaps because he likes such films, but his own energy as an actor does not lend itself to them, although he has improved it with repeated attempts. He should leave these kinds of roles to less interesting actors who would completely commit to the film and spend their energy and considerable talent on more extravagant roles and films in which he could be his own interesting and interesting self.
