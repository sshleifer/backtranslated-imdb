WARNING: THE REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS MILD <br /> <br /> A couple of years ago I managed to see the first five films in this franchise and I was planning to make a general description of the entire series of Elm St. However, only two years afterwards and it seems to me that I can not remember enough about them to do it. I guess they could not have made a lot of impression. What I do remember, some of the sequels? Dream Warriors in particular ?? They were not as bad as they often are, although even the original was not a classic. In general, the predictability of the premise (if people fall asleep are murdered in their dreams) does not lend itself to narrative tension. But while I can not remember much of the first five films, I know they never probed the depths of Freddy's Dead. <br /> <br /> An indication of how sick Freddy was at the moment can be judged by the fact that the film was promoted only in the disappearance of the character. The fact that the conclusion of the film is not even hidden, but in fact, the whole purpose of the film's being serves to illustrate how vain, heartless and cynical this company was. <br /> <br /> Taking the morally questionable idea of ​​having a child molester as the charismatic villain, the meaningless interpretation of Robert Englund echoes with laughter. I always thought that Freddy's mockery of teenage victims was less directed at the characters than at the adolescent audience that could see this gut. It's like Englund's crying "We know this is trash, but you're paying to see it, so who's the one who laughs?" And I am sure that victims of child abuse would be discouraged to see such an insensitive description of their situation. Was Freddy's appearance in the movies always so rudimentary? All he can do here is a few "haaaaaaaaaaaaaarr" har ?? har? "If that was the only Elm St. movie you've ever seen, you would never know the character." Even as the character before death in a flashback, Englund portrays him as a pantomime villain with a touch of Transatlantic (that is, exaggerated, out of place and not at all funny). <br /> <br /> The acting is almost universally poor, just look how many times Breckin Meyer exaggerates with his gestures with his hands and body language. Kananga himself, Yaphet Kotto, maintains his dignity, and when Roseanne, Tom Arnold and Alice Cooper appear, you can see almost visibly that the film sinks deeper into the mud.The script, too, is absolutely bad, almost without merit. (Ricky Dean Logan) opens a road map, in which Noel Coward, like Freddy, has ingeniously written "you're crazy." When asked for the map, Carlos responds "well, the map says we're screwed" Who wrote the script, Oscar Wilde? <B r /> <br /> Or what about the scene in which Freddy tortures Carlos, his hearing increases to painful levels? So Freddy torments him by threatening to drop a pin? A potentially fatal sound, given that all sounds are magnified. Interestingly, the fact that Carlos shouts at the top of his voice so that he does not let it fall seems to have no effect. "Nice to hear you, Carlos," Freddy jokes, hoping some better lines will emerge. It is also worth noting that dream dreaming does not occur instantaneously, so leaving you unconscious would not allow instant access to Freddy's world. Although, as part of the narrative, it contains a human computer game and a final raster logic in 3D it is not that high in the list of requirements. <br /> <br /> The teenagers who lead the cast this time are really the most obnoxious, disgusting group in the entire series. Tracy (Lezlie Deane) is the only one who gets to greet Freddy with "call the f ** k up, man" and a kick in the scallops. And incongruous pop music was always part of the ingredients? Freddy is dead. Do not laugh It's not scary. There is no interest. It's not fun <br /> <br />
