Oh brother. The only reason why this so irritating movie prevents me from getting the full "bomb" is because it is at least historically remarkable like the first Three Stooges movie (when they were not alone yet and they still had to carry that painful and unpleasant Ted Healy ). But even as a Stooges fanatic for a long time, I would have to say that young Moe, Larry and Curly are widely used here as three crazy janitor assistants for Mr. Healy's highest chief janitor. They do not appear constantly throughout the film and their silly nonsense from time to time paints them more like overactive hyperactive cartoon characters who try to be funny. <br /> <br /> Most of this toothache is related to Jack Pearl sought in vain to get some giggles from the audience like a man posing as Baron Munchausen (here is a good example of the level of humor : "I oppose!" "Why?" "Ground coffee!"). His partner is none other than a young Jimmy Durante, but even Schnoz himself is a bore.
