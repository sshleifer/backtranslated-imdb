This film, which was once sensational for its forward-looking politics and depictions of free love and sexual liberation, has been reduced by time to mere curiosity. It seems absurd now that this little film, mostly boring, had been banned and seized by governments in many countries. Given the way socialist Sweden came to be, the "radicalism" of its once-controversial policy seems naive and almost dominant four decades later. And their sex scenes, once the subject of sensational obscenity judgments, seem fairly tame in a modern context. However, the film and the documentaries that accompany it, in which its numerous controversies and influences are detailed, can be seen as an early reliquary of the youth rebellion of the 60s. A part of the film that still stands: its self-consciousness with respect to the "fourth wall". From time to time, the filmmakers film themselves making the film. The satirical joy of this still provokes a laugh.
