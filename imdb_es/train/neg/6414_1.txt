This is the worst part of cr4p I've seen in my life. It hardly made sense. It was not terrifying at all (unless you're afraid like loud noises and screams?) Sarah-Michelle Gellar needs to stop with these horror movies. I think everyone else in the cinema agreed with me when I shouted "SHITE" when the credits were accumulated. <br /> <br /> On my list of the worst movies that have been made, this is what would happen: <br /> <br /> 1. The Return 2. Cabin Fever 3. Silent Hill <br /> <br /> The reason why I did Silent Hill 3rd is because it showed some terrifying scenes, but the rest was absolute cr4p. The same with cabin fever, it did not make sense, but the return exceeded that list. It's worse than Silent Hill and Cabin Fever together
