First of all, let me say that this has to be at the top of my list of boring movies. Nothing, and I mean nothing in this movie is even remotely exciting. Most of this is very confusing and, as you go along, you just want it to end! Some people want a movie that makes them "think" through the whole subject, to which I tell them ... "More power for you"! I, on the other hand, just want to be entertained. What brings me back to this stench, entertainment is not. This movie is stupid and a complete waste of time. It seems that the majority here also agrees. Most of this did not make any sense, and by the time you think you have an uncovered scene, another lame scene is approaching and ... well, I think you see where this is going. Avoid, this sucks .... badly!
