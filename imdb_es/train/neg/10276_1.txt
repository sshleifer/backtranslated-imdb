You may be reading some of the comments posted in this movie and you might think, "Hey, there was a lot of RAVE REVIEWS posted on December 30th." The funny thing is that most of these criticisms sound as if they came from the same person or, at best, from a small and coordinated group of "open house" groups. The truth, my friends, is that this movie is really impossible to see. Just because it is "independent" does not mean that you receive a free pass. If you are going to do a musical, either in a movie or on stage, whether on Broadway or in the local community gaming house, you should probably make sure that (a) your actors can sing, (b.) Your actors can dance, (c.) you have a decent sound equipment, (d.) you have a well written score, and (e.) you have lyrics that are witty and charming. Even Anthony Rapp can not save this one. It is one of those unfortunate experiences of films in which I felt deeply embarrassed by all involved.
