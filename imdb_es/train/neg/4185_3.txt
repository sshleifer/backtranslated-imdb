I give this movie a 3 because it's worse than the cult films that deserve a 2. Does not it make sense to you? Well, you do not have to. This is another vampire movie with a stupid plot, no, let me rephrase, incredibly idiotic plot, where the space cowboys (complete with cowboy hats) fight against a spatial race of idiotic vampires. <br /> <br /> Does it get uglier? that this? The only good thing in this movie was Natassia Malthe, with her impressive Norwegian beauty. God, I want Michael Ironside and the DeLuise brothers to stop accepting stupid roles in silly movies! I mean, at least SeaQuest was nice! I know Mr. Ironside for many movies, he has performed in 164 movies on this date! It is true that he was rarely in an important role, but still!
