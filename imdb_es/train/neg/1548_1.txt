Lorne Michaels proves once again that she has absolutely no business to produce movies. <br /> <br /> You would think that after such unpleasant films as "Superstar", "Night at the Roxbury" and "Coneheads", you begin to have the notion that you may not know what you are doing when it comes to movies (and many would say that he does not know what he is doing when it comes to television as well). Trying to make feature films from parodies that spent their welcome the third time they were made in SNL does not make sense. <br /> <br /> I personally like Tim Meadows, and I think it would be great in the right movie. . It's a shame to see a kid with talent wasted in a movie that presents an extravagant situation after a carefree situation, and puts everything in a terribly bad dance scene and song. Any laughter here will be because the movie is so bad, not because it's fun. <br /> <br /> Oh, well, at least we can be grateful that there are many other tired characters in the SNL who will never finish their movies. . It is a pity that this has reached the big screen.
