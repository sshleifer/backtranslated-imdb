Wow. I do not think I've seen a movie with so many great actors who played such an important and disastrous role. Justin Timberlake is perhaps the worst actor who has achieved a great role in a movie with the power of the star and the money behind him that Edison had. <br /> <br /> His performance was PERMANENT to observe. The story was good and all the other characters were played by professional actors, even LL Cool J was fine, as it has had many small parts in which to cut the teeth. How the director and the film company thought that Timberlake was ready for this role, there is no way to understand it. <br /> <br /> Your character spoils the whole experience because every time he's on the screen, he's really supporting corrupt cops. to cover his pitiful ass, and he is supposed to be the hero ... I would not spend money on this in the theater or in the video. Maybe, if you have HBO and you DO NOT have ANYTHING else to do at 2 am on Saturday nights and you're drunk and drugged, this may be fine. <br /> <br /> Seeing Timberlake in this role was like watching a human 'Kermit the Rana acted in a Hollywood Blockbuster, it just did not work at all.
