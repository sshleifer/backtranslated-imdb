Why do people who do not know what a particular moment in the past was like feel the need to try to define that time for others? Replace Woodstock with the Civil War and the landing to the moon of the Apollo with the sinking of the Titanic, and you will get a movie as realistic as this soap opera formula populated completely by the trash of the low life. Is this what children who were too young to go to Woodstock do and who failed in elementary school composition? "I'll show those evil old men, I'll put my own movie and I'll prove that you do not have to know about your subject to make money." Yes, we already know. The only thing this movie did for me was that it gave me an idea of ​​low-class thinking. The next time I see a whore in a bar that looks like Diane Lane, I'm running to the other side. It is child abuse to allow parents who are useless to raise children. It is an abuse of the audience to simply hit Woodstock and moonlanding in a movie as if ipso facto means that the film portrays 1969.
