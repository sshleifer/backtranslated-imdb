The kisses of Jason Lee are back! If that is what you are looking for, look no further. If not, better still ... <br /> <br /> But about the movie. Clich√©s aplenty, some fight scenes ill-arranged but a bit exotic (with JKD) and a lot of bad acting and cheap effects. Poor Lee seems to be suffering throughout the movie, and it's no wonder. It is not a pleasant comeback. <br /> <br /> The movie is not even cut like a B-movie: of course, there was a battered blond from Rutger-wannabe, but not a free sex scene or even a single one. booty shots. Any. Zipper. Nothing Even in Starship Troopers 2 had the common sense to include the obligatory nudie scenes (as for the rest of my comments on that excellent piece of classic film excellence, see our next review on that amazing sequel ...). I had the feeling that the writer was taking revenge on someone with this, so I will not go into the "plot" of the movie or almost anything else related. Except that it had some non-heterosexual nuances, so 'nuff said. <br /> <br /> However, this movie has one thing in its favor: no Jean-Claude :)
