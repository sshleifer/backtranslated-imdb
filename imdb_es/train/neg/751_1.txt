Honestly, I believe that ANYONE who is considering making films should be subjected to this amazing failure. Like the "movies" of Edward Wood, Jr. in the 60s and 70s, this film is a shining example of why real filmmakers spend so much energy rewriting scripts, reissuing their films and reworking their special effects until they finally look This film is also a decent argument for the process of preselecting the studies. If Mr. Hines were forced to endure the honest reactions of a fair hearing, maybe he would have reduced 75% or the scenes of walking / running / walking and edited this movie to 90 more bearable minutes. <br /> <br /> Film students should see this movie as an example of how dangerous it is to think that their work is "good enough". Each performance, each line of dialogue, each digital effect, each filter effect, in fact, each video frame expresses the danger of fighting for mere mediocrity. A beginning filmmaker may be tempted from time to time to think "At least I got SOMETHING" or "Just finishing this will be an achievement in itself". This movie will help you understand how bad a movie can be. <br /> <br /> Critics could also benefit from watching this movie before calling the most recent summer entertainment "the worst movie ever made". <br /> <br /> Beginning writers can learn from this film how important rewriting is, and perhaps understand the need for rewriting. In addition, beginning directors can learn the importance of a GOOD script and a certain degree of respect for how difficult it is to write a script that makes the audience feel emotionally bound throughout the story. Writers and directors who watch bad movies of the week and think "I can do better than ESO" can get an idea of ​​this film about how difficult it is to produce mediocre results. <br /> <br /> I sincerely believe that this film can serve as an educational tool for beginning filmmakers. Particularly those who enter the ship in this post-Lucas and post-Spielberg current environment. There is a reason why filmmakers like these are acclaimed for their ability with special effects. The War of the Worlds clearly illustrates that not everyone can achieve it. Some can not even get close to it.
