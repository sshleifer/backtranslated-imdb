The episodic version of Robert Heinlein's Starship Troopers unfolds at a very slow pace, after Johnny Rico leaves his parents, the girl (not very attractive) he wants, and joins the mobile infantry. The aliens on the show are nothing like the barbarians of the movie, instead of being squid-shaped monsters who fire lasers from their mouths. <br /> <br /> While watching this version, I was surprised by the fruit. They have managed to do the whole thing. The program mainly deals with the relationships between the recruits and the painful and prolonged looks that are given through their battle armor scope, with the 80's pop pop that sometimes arrives * during * the scarce battle sequences that they finally appear in the last few episodes. In terms of construction, they have a debt to Top Gun, which shares a lot in terms of pace and content (and all that implies).
