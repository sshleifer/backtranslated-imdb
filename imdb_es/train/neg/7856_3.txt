This movie is pretty sucked. I am in the army and the soldiers that appear in this movie are horrible. If you are in the army and you see this movie, you will laugh and get annoyed by the way they acted as a squad. It was ridiculous. They acted like a group of normal people in Army uniforms not knowing what to do. It was a pretty bloody movie that would have to say the least. There were a couple of scenes where they try to make you jump. I recommend seeing it if you're bored and want to see a violent and bloody movie. It will be a better movie too if you're not in the army. I would also have to say that the first one I liked more than this one.
