This youthful and insipid film is strictly for teens in bodies of old men, desperate to relive their teenage years with hormonal difficulties. How ? By burning gasoline and equating a fast and reckless car (or plane) with freedom. <br /> <br /> The plot lends itself a lot to the Mister Rogers neighborhood (if it were an oil conglomerate) and the Logan Race (if it was very sedated and lacked a clear sense of style). <br /> <br /> Starring Lee Majors and Burgess Meredith, this film is set in a post-gas crisis world in which an all-powerful government does not want you (* ahem *) to drive your car and burn gas . Something opposed to today's Enron-and-Bush government, which drags oil and pushes SUVs. <br /> <br /> This juxtaposition alone makes the movie ridiculous. But wait, there is more. Although the film is set in the future, there are no signs of future technology, beyond a return to bicycles, golf carts and horses. You will believe that the future looks ... exactly like today. The same clothes, the same suburban houses, the same green lawn that today and when the film was made. There are no solar panels, no windmills, no concessions to alternative energy. <br /> <br /> The performance is flat and tasteless. Even scenes that could have been gritty or moving, friends movie, honor, romance, horror ... all fall flatter than a paper doll under a briefcase. <br /> <br /> Lack of continuity: the plane that flies. The character of Burgess Meredith changes colors and settings from one moment to the next when the filmmakers insult our intelligence with unparalleled archive images over and over again. <br /> <br /> The plot is so absurd and only half as exciting as an episode of Dukes of Hazzard. <br /> <br /> Even car movie fans and SF fans should avoid this movie as a one-month roadkill, unless you enjoy teasing Exxon executives who try to make a movie as empty as the hero's gas tank.
