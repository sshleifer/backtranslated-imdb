"Arahan" does not add anything positive to the Kung Fu genre. Comparing this confused image in motion with the insanity and quality inspired by Stephen Chow's films is a mistake. <br /> <br /> First of all, the fight scenes are nothing new. Everything presented here has been done before and better by people like Yimou Zhang, Tony Jaa and Jackie Chan. Fights in intelligent moving pictures need logic. It does not seem to make sense that they serve blows that do not have a harmful effect as in the aftermath of "Matrix". <br /> <br /> The attractive female lead So-Yi Yoon captivated the screen, but she never convincingly conquered the physical demands of the role as Ziyi Zhang had done so easily in "The House of the Flying Daggers". Having a martial arts background works well in Kung Fu movies. Casting actors with no experience in these skills is a serious mistake (see Aya Ueto in "Asumi") unless you are a very talented director who, like "Arahan", proves that Seung-wan Ryoo is not.
