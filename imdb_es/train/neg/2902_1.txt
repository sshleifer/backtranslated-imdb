Spoiler: group of passive-aggressive people who have a family reunion. The script makes them say and do things that people would never do, at least anyone with a little decency. The hero falls in love with a woman he sees as his soul mate in a bookstore on the day of the meeting, not knowing that she will appear as his brother's girlfriend at the meeting. She tries to defer her brother's affirmation, but she, knowing that our hero is clearly in love with her, teases him mercilessly by wearing sexy clothes and behaving like a stripper, rubbing the whole brother with an excuse that is teaching him how do what. stretch. In a moment, she really gets naked and gets in a shower with him. Try to cover your eyes. Your heart is breaking. She thinks it's funny, until she suddenly decides she does not want the brother and leaves the meeting. <br /> <br /> The movie really goes on. The audience coughed and moved nervously along the road. The writing is unintelligent and incredible. We almost went out, but we still think that something would surely happen that would encourage things, but nooooo. All the lovely comments must have been written for paid shillings, to fool the poor fools like me into seeing shit like this. Comparing it with Little Miss Sunshine ??? OMG. What a shame for them, writers, actors, producers and theaters for letting something so bad get to the screen!
