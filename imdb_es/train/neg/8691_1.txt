If there was a ZERO rating, I would give it to this movie. Today was the second time I tried to see it and I still could not do it from start to finish. I can not believe the multiple stars given by others and I can only assume that either they know the actors or they are publicists in disguise! The acting is atrocious everywhere, the script is blah, the child who plays Nichole shows zero emotions even when she is being threatened. The "southern" accent of the actress who plays Amber's mother is ridiculous. I'm from Georgia and I have friends from Texas. Believe me, NO ONE talks like that! None of his emotions seemed real in any scene. The issue is very serious and deserves a much better deal.
