The only possible way to enjoy this movie is to bang your head against the wall, allow an internal brain hemorrhage, let a lot of brain cells die and once you are officially mentally retarded, maybe then you * CAN * enjoy this movie . <br /> <br /> The only salvation was the story between Raju and Stephanie. Govinda was excellent in the role of taxi driver and also the British girl. Maybe if they had created the whole movie in their trips to India and the way they finally fell in love it would have made it a much more fun movie. <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave him a grade of 3 is because of Govida and his ability as an actor when it comes to comedy. <br /> <br /> Juhi Chawla and Anil Kapoor were wasted unnecessarily. In addition, the Heathrow scene of regrouping was too much to digest. Being an international traveler in the post-September 11 world, Anil Kapoor would have shot himself long before he even reached the sky bridge to profess his true love :) But, again, the objective of the film was to challenge the logic, the gravity and physics. and throw an egg in the face of the audience * GENERAL *. <br /> <br /> Watch it at your own risk. At least I know I've been marked by life :(
