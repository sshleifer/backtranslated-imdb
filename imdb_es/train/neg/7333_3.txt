I enjoyed the feeling of the first few minutes, but at 20 minutes I was generously applying the fast forward button. Too many shots of Stewart (Michael Zelniker) walking from one room to another, through the corridors, through the doors and down the street, and so many shots of him that seem pensive and confused. I got the impression that the story had originally been a brief one (20-30 minutes), and then it extended to a feature as a love work between director Grieve and star Zelniker (they co-wrote the script). <Br /> <br /> It could have been more entertaining if one of the characters had something to say that he had not heard before in many other films, or if the end was not, disappointingly, the one that predicted three minutes. in the movie (atypical for an independent / smaller studio film). At least his heart was in the right place: it was not his absurd Hollywood standard manipulator.
