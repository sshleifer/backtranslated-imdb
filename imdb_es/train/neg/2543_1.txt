Talk about your loss of money ... I wonder why Michael would star in such a special movie. Michael is a great actor, especially in the movie where he plays a man who is dying of cancer ... that was wonderful. while he is recording himself so that his son sees him once he grows up ... Michael is such a talented actor ... so what made him do this? I saw it and I thought it was really silly. I suppose that at some point in their career they have poor quality films. Especially "The Squeeze". I did not understand that. I think his best performance was in "Pacific Heights.", His character really scared me ... and I really enjoyed "Multiplicity." .that one was so hilarious !!! and it was perfect for the role of "Batman" ... and I liked "Night Shift" and I love "Johnny Dangerously" too ... just really bad, some of them end up making lousy movies ... like this one. ...
