I recently decided to revisit The Omen trilogy only to discover that {insert demonic music here} is a quarter. I did not expect much from that, and in that sense, it certainly lived up to my expectations. If you like to watch bad movies to laugh at, then this may be the movie for you. Oh, where do we start? <br /> <br /> From the beginning, the "made for television" aspect was obvious. The music often coincided inappropriately with what was happening in the film and, therefore, distracted (at best). The script had all the suspense of an 8-year-old fiction work. But one thing that should be said is that the missing script matched very well with the atrocious performance. Numerous scenes left me contemplating whether it was the script or the performance that was the source of ridicule. <br /> <br /> The story itself is quite thin, centered on all the follies of the daughter of Damien Thorn, adopted by the evil doing and the misunderstood nuns. There are most of the mysterious and complicated deaths that personally made me yawn as the "drama" developed, and the usual investigator on the whole thing. Later, through some medical phenomena, Damien Thorn Jr. was born and that practically involves the plot. Everything runs quite bad from the beginning with the lack of suspense that makes the film a monotonous and / or ridiculous scene after another. <br /> <br /> There were many WTF?!? Moments too that provides the involuntary relief of comedy. For example, what about the major overreaction at the beginning of the movie when the baby scratches the mother's cheek? Just an omen of 360 degrees. I also laughed at the excessive reaction at baptism. The baby cries, and everyone looks very worried. The anguished mother runs out of the church and the priest is very alarmed as he crosses. Eh Then there is the nanny of the new era who seems to have carte blanche on the exposure of an 8 year old child to all kinds of alternative spiritualism. I laughed when the nanny suggested taking the problematic Delia to a psychic fair to meet the hippie friends of the nanny and the mother just shrugs and allows it. "Yes, that's great, it fills my daughter's head with problems of 8 years with all this mysticism, that's great, I do not need to be there." Of course, this would be expected from a mother who allows her daughter to adopt a fully grown Rottweiler with whom they will meet on the street and who could bite little girls as snacks. The whole scene at the psychic fair is pretty comical in a way, from the horrifying reactionary looks of the psychics to Delia, to the hell that follows. <br /> <br /> I also laughed at how the nun's death is considered. an "accident freak". Here we have a religious fanatic, (who is described as part of a cult), who is fanatically preaching in a pit full of rattlesnakes to show how the Glory of God will protect them. She becomes angry with the snakes when handling them and SOMETHING HOW she is bitten several times. Hardly a strange accident. More like a successful suicide attempt. <br /> <br /> The snake scene against nuns was not the only comic death. There is a low-speed car accident that causes decapitation in the parking lot of a school. Then there is the demolition ball in slow motion that goes directly to the detective. I think I went and made a coffee when the slow motion started to return to see that the wrecking ball was still going directly to the "worried" detective. Then there is the quintessence of who fired, who clich√© death, where he fires a gun and both act as if they had been fired for several seconds while exchanging looks of horror. Then someone falls down the stairs revealing who was the real victim. In addition, the death of the priest at the beginning of the film seemed a bit strange and meaningless. He runs around looking at the architecture of the church. Obviously, finding this quite distressing, he eventually collapses, grabs his chest and dies. Apparently, something demonic was happening, since this is what the music was suggesting. Ummm. IN AGREEMENT. <br /> <br /> I am surprised that others have reviewed this film favorably and, in particular, as a "worthy sequel". It's hard not to notice the non-sensual script, the unrealistic acting and the inappropriate musical score. The film lacks suspense, relying heavily on Delia's "demonic gaze" to provide a sense of horror, which becomes quite annoying after a short time. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell: this is a bad movie with the unique redeeming feature, as it has unwanted potential to be a comedy.
