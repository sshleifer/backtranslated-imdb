The idea was incredible, the actors were incredible, the story could have been very scary, but the writing was poor and there was no depth. I really could not get into this movie. I could not feel for the characters, there were a lot of cliffhangers, and the movie ends very strangely. Was it a happy ending? I do not know. Was it a sad ending? Once again, I do not know. You leave the theater feeling dissatisfied. The movie had a lot to give, but it could not. Just because you can edit does not mean you should, right? I really would not recommend this movie because you can not say that you left the movie as if it had been completed. You will only be confused. Trust me, you will probably thank me if you do not see this movie. <br /> <br /> 3/10
