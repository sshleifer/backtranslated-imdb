This movie is entertaining enough due to the excellent performance of Virginia Madsen and the fact that Lindsey Haun is charming. However, the reason why the film is so predictable is that we have seen it before. I have not read the book A Mother's Gift but I hope that for Britney and Lynne Spears is completely different to this movie. Unless you consider finishing a movie with what is essentially a music video an original idea, the whole movie brings to mind the word plagiarized.
