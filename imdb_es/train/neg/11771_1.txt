This was shown as part of the 59th Edinburgh International Festival, although for reasons, it is better to leave it in the hands of the powers. It seems that much has been said about the fact that it is the first film in Thai language, made with Thai actors and equipment, but directed by a Westerner. It is not necessary that you have bothered to be honest, since this movie is boring, boring, boring. Why insinuate something, why surround an idea in mystery, why subtly invoke a feeling, when you can mark the point with terrible voices in off, obvious shots and outstanding scenes? There is nothing left for the imagination as again and again Director Spurrier awkwardly produces endless clich√©s. Without insinuations, without guessing, everything is on the screen, without using our imagination. I wonder when the 'scary' bit will arrive. No, you will not, because the soundtrack will become increasingly intimidating, reaching a crescendo of sinister. Hell, I'm inventing words to describe how bad this is. Do you wonder if the summoned demon is real or imaginary? Why collect taxes? It is really a snake, and yes, it is really biting its crotch, and there are splashes of blood everywhere. It is a strange and uncomfortable movie for several reasons. It's supposed to be a horror movie, but it's not scary: the jolts are signalized and obvious. It may be a scathing attack on the more sordid side of Thailand, but the director has a sleazy and lubricating style when it comes to showing just pubescent teenagers. Maybe he was becoming the Westerner who took the virginity and planted the seeds of doubt in my head. Or maybe it was all just pants. Without inspiration, insipid, repetitive, trite, all candidates for the best description, but bored seems the most appropriate and honest. Everything has been seen before, probably better, often with more thought, rarely with less imagination or flash. Sorry. Thumb down on each account. Really serious
