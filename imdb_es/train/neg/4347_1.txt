Wow ... what can I say ... First of all, IMDb says that this is in the late 60's ... which means that Carlito would be very close to going to jail. He left in 75 and said he was 5 years old. They used a lot of actors from nobody, and a story that did not even make sense. They bring back a single actor, Guzm√°n, and he's playing a totally different guy. Why did it end with him and this Puerto Rican girl? Wheres Gale? He said he was in love with her before. Where is Kleinfeld? He said he had known him forever ... You would think he would have been in this. And if this makes sense, where are Rocco and the black in the first? Everything was just stupid ... This is an insult to Pacino and the first movie.
