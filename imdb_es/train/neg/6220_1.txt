This movie was a real disappointment to me. I've been a Gram Parsons fan for a long time, and when I found out they were making a movie about him, I was very excited, I got the movie on VHS when it came out and I got sick from what I saw, This movie was not about his life, about the consequences of his death. I thought it would be a downward movie about Grams Life and Music, but they had to make a movie about his death. I'm tired of hearing about their deaths in books and movies, I wanted a movie about his life, not about his infamous death. I was very disappointed. I wish people saw his life, more than his death. The only good thing about this movie was its soundtrack. This movie is a disappointment for any Gram Parsons fan.
