This is a horrible movie. Yes, the girls are pretty but not very good. The plot that involves a cowboy getting involved with an Indian maid would be interesting if sex did not get in the way. Well, it's okay, it might be interesting, but it's not, because it's so badly paced and only partially acted. I can only imagine how the close-ups of the dances could be seen on a large screen, probably more ridiculous than on television. (I will not even mention the fight with the topless knives between two women who are tied and pass the whole thing chest to chest, never read about it in the old west) This is a film that requires the liberal use of fast forward. <Br /> <br /> I like schlock movies but this is ridiculous. There is a reason why I do not like this type of movies and that they tend not to be very good, since the plot is in the background in the breasts. The original nudie films, as they are originally called, were nudist movies or movies that were not played, but as the adult industry began to grow, the filmmakers tried to be smart or tried to exploit something else to put butt butts in the seats. The most intelligent were very few, which only left tricks that had limited talent. The comedies often came out better with the humor that approaches the first grade level, childish but inoffensively fun. Something that could rarely be said about any other gender of cross dressed as a nudie. <br /> <br /> The Ramrodder looks good and has a couple of nice pieces, but it's not made by being a Westerner or a sex movie. <Br /> <br /> I do not need to see this again. <br /> <br /> Of interest to probably no one, the rapist and murderer in the movie was played by Bobby Beausoleil, a member of the Manson family who was arrested for murdering a school teacher not long after he finished the shooting. <br /> <br /> Obviously, this kind of thing will ruin some people's lives.
