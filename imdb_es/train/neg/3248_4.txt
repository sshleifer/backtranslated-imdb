Why did I go to see this movie? Honestly, because Jim Carrey was in it and in the past he has made funny movies that made me cry with laughter, so you really blame me for expecting that again? In addition, the premise, the funny trailer, the participation of his co-star Jennifer Aniston and the fact that it was a great success in the state encouraged me. <br /> <br /> However, as my "Summary of a line" suggests, I was Disappointed. For several reasons; <br /> <br /> Reason 1: It was not funny. In a 2-hour movie, I laughed for about 5-10 minutes ... all together, the rest of the time I sat thinking "I really should have taken some ice cream". I admit that it may be wrong to judge Jim Carrey in his previous films, but what does he really expect when he does Gem's as' The Truman Show ',' Liar Liar ',' Me, Myself and Irene ',' Dumb and Dumber ',' The Mask 'and the films of' Ace Ventura 'then produce, according to the own words of Bruce Nolan, a film so mediocre? <br /> <br /> Reason 2: The role of Jennifer Aniston was criminally subscribed. I want to say hello! She has been present in the public eye for about ten years, and in this movie she has almost four lines to say. Incorrect. <br /> <br /> Reason 3: A word - Clich√© <br /> <br /> Reason 4: An informal display of specifically American references - Jimmy Hoffa, Walter Cronkite's 'Sweeping Week' - is a clue to The appeal of the film is specifically home. "A teenager says no to drugs and yes to an education - that's a miracle! Do you want to see a miracle soon? Be the miracle!" God tells Bruce, a heavy-handed feeling that seems to have gone haywire in the United States. UU., But that could face greater resistance in markets that retain a hint of subtlety. Also, I still go to school, and that statement suggests that I and all of my friends are miracles ... or maybe it just means that we have brains? <br /> <br /> In this movie there are enough funny moments for Carrey to make you laugh and keep Bruce Almighty from being a total calamity, but we recommend that you start reviewing your expectations downwards.
