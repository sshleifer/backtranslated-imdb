Some people say that Steve Irwin's larrikin antics and his sociable personality are just an act. Watch this movie: it is obvious that it can not act. <br /> <br /> Steve Irwin, protagonist of the small screen in his series * Crocodile Hunter Diaries *, * Croc Files * and eponymous * Crocodile Hunter * (you see a trend of names here, or is it just me?) , throw your character bigger than the fight to the big screen with * Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course * (yes, there is a definite trend of words that start with 'C') - basically an episode of * Crocodile Hunter * combined with a B -Movie. <br /> <br /> On a mission to relocate a large crocodile to avoid being shot by an eccentric farmer (Magda Szubanski), Steve and Terri's wife does not know that the croc is being tracked by American spies (Lachy Hulme and Kenneth Ransom), to retrieve a spy satellite beacon that has been swallowed. Will my credibility lose the saying "They're on a collision course with madness"? (What credibility? - Ed note.) <br /> <br /> The plot is irrelevant, since it is Steve's animal magnetism that drives the movie. If you find that your character is testing, the movie is a failure, but if you are a fan of it (as a businessman, conservationist or just an imbecile) or your television shows, expect more of the same in a variety. budget of the screen. <br /> <br /> John Stainton, faithful liege, Crocodile Hunter's best companion and aide * oeuvre * (can you call it that with a serious face?), writes and directs with the same provincial arrogance that made Steve a buffoon of domestic animals. <br /> <br /> The most jarring aspect of this movie is that Steve (one of the few people for whom you can really hear the exclamation marks that happens when he speaks) and Terri (Steve's 10-year-old spouse, fierce ally and closest friend, treat it as if it were one of his documentaries, breaking the "fourth wall" and speaking directly to the camera, while all the other characters behave as if they were in a bad movie (Â¿well ??). It would not be so incongruous if Steve and Terri were kept apart from the rest of the characters, but when the Bad Americans constantly threaten Steve's life, we get confused. The viewers must ask why the indifferent camera crew does not call the police at least if do not try to put the bad guys in the eye with boom microphones, or run screaming in the bush? nothing but continue filming casually with great lighting, clear audio and seven angles of action. <br /> <br /> While Terri is unfairly painted as Steve's slightly incompetent companion (her performance consists of boldly inept readings and gadgets on pear-shaped jeans that hug the buttocks; finally, I do not complain) Steve is dedicated to his usual role of showing and counting creatures with the intention of killing him, doing all his maneuvers to himself because, well, for him they are not really risky scenes, just a day in the office. <br /> <br /> Of course, seeing the adventures of this crazy koo-koo after his tragic death in September 2006 throws a strange detachment on the process. But for those of us who never met him, this type of malarkey (as well as several incarnations of the * Crocodile Hunter * series in repeated repetitions) keeps him as alive as ever in our crocodile burrows. The heartrending reality of his absence will only be evident to those closest to him. And I really wish you the best in following your big footprints? <br /> <br /> So you enjoy this deviation for what it is? a half-baked movie with a complete legend. He died doing what he loved? interacting with wildlife, and he could never have asked for more of his first feature film by portraying him doing just that. <br /> <br /> (Movie Maniacs, visit: poffysmoviemania.com)
