I admit that I've only seen a handful of episodes, but each one seemed completely different from the next. It seems that after the first season, the producers decided to completely reorganize the program, eliminate characters, introduce new ones and rewrite the entire dynamics of the program. <br /> <br /> As you may have guessed, the program is quite peculiar. , the unpredictable teenager Holly (Amanda Bynes) who moves with her string sister Valerie (Jennie Garth) in New York City. Pretty good premise: strange couple + fish out of the water + high jinche. <br /> <br /> Although I miss the comedies of yesteryear, this show unfortunately loses its mark in funny repeatedly, and it's sad because they have a decent talent. <br /> <br /> Above all, they insisted on changing the program (Val was living with a regular cast for a season, then she left suddenly, so she opened a bakery? What?) When things They change that drastically, you get the feeling that even the * show * knows it's bad. I mean, completely new sets, unsubscribed characters and new regular customers of the program. <br /> <br /> On a side note (this is just a trap), I know this is a TV show and it's not real at all, but Val and Holly end up living in a huge duplex loft (there are stairs ) with a terrace ... in MANHATTAN! Seriously!?
