Disappointing and irritating. The scriptwriter does not have a true understanding of human nature, but rather, chains clich√©s in an unconnected way. The character is not explored in depth. These are puppets sunk in a plot that he confesses openly that he needed a dramatic element, the matter of the mother with her daughter's lover. <br /> <br /> Anne Reid offers an excellent performance even though she has been given some peculiar situations and lines, such as being passively to allow her angry daughter to hit her in the eye. The script portrays Darren (Daniel Craig) as a Dr. Jekyll / Mr. Hyde has no clue as to why, except that he inhales cocaine before the big scene. <br /> <br /> A mature writer could have done much more with this topic.
