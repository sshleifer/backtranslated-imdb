The complaints are valid, for me the biggest problem is that this telenovela is too directed to women. I agree with these nightly soaps, like Gray's Anatomy or Ugly Betty or West Wing, because there are stories that are interesting even with the fact that they will never end. However, when the idea parallels the diurnal soaps that aim to put the hunky men (Taye Diggs, Tim Daly and Chris Lowell) into sexual tension and mischief, and numerous ridiculous difficult situations in a so-called small hospital, it seems to be the General Hospital. ... or a female counterpart of Baywatch. That was what men wanted and they had it, so if this is what women want, so be it, but the idea that this is a high level show (or something that men will see) is not realistic.
