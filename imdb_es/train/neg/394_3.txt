I applaud the films that fill the thematic gaps in world cinema. So after watching the trailer for "Water Lilies," I was hoping that I would like this movie because I thought I had stumbled on something unique: a movie that honestly portrays adolescent lesbian love, a kind of female version of "Beautiful Thing." <br /> <br /> The main characters are 15-year-old French girls. Marie is slender, reticent and pretty in a turbulent manner; Floriane is extroverted, athletic and beautiful; and Anne is loyal, plump and behaviorally immature. The erotic interrelationship between Marie and Floriane is always beating slowly in this movie, if not on the surface, just below it. <br /> <br /> "Water lilies", however, is not about the dawn of lesbian love between two teenagers; it is about sexual frustration, suffering, boredom, adolescents who work with crossed purposes and, in at least two cases, mechanical and joyless sex. It also shows that screenwriters and filmmakers ruin their own creations when they become too manipulative. <br /> <br /> In the additional features of the DVD "The Lord of the Flies", says director Peter Brook, "French cynicism begins with the excitement of sex", which means that the French consider children as angels while considering adolescents and adults with widespread cynicism. Part of the fall of this film is that the filmmaker Celine Sciamma has swallowed a large dose of this cynicism. <br /> <br /> "Where is the joy?" I asked myself while watching this movie. Yes, first love can be painful and frustrating, but it can also be joyful and triumphantly erotic in a fresh and affirming way of life. These positive aspects are missing in this movie; There is no balance. <br /> <br /> Organically, this film wants to be a touching celebration of first love. But Sciamma is too impressed with her own cynicism and intelligence and ruins the film. First, what is the point of showing only the naked chubby girl? I know that there is an established tradition of good taste in adolescent nudity in European cinema, as shown by films such as "The Slingshot, The Rascals, The Devil, Probably, The Little Thief, Murmur of the Heart, Friends, Beau Pere" and "Europe, Europe"; but this instance is an intrusion of an insignificant author: "Look, audience, I can make a movie in which I show only an unattractive naked person". A nudity or evenly distributed nudity would have been an honest way to go. <br /> <br /> There is a scene in a club where Floriane and Marie are dancing. What follows next is not just Floriane cynically manipulating Marie; It is the filmmaker Sciamma, who cynically manipulates her audience. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the greatest betrayal of authenticity and organic honesty occurs when Floriane warns Marie that she is about to ask for something that "is not normal". Marie, understandably, asks: "Who cares to be normal?" Then, Sciamma plays the fake with her audience and the vertiginous impulse of the film, because the request of Floriane is a false, derivative and substitute question, not the authentic and sincere question that the film, the character of Marie and the spectators that have dedicated their time they deserve. <br /> <br /> Here are also two moments that falsely clash with the nerves of the viewer: 1) Since when do the French, of all people, bathe in swimsuits and with a turtle to boot? 2) What teenager, of any nationality, would pounce on an apple heart that was thrown in the trash to taste the mouth of the beloved? <br /> <br /> The three leading actresses are promising and, if They find better vehicles for their talents, they can become excellent actors. Louise Blachere (Anne) is the best actress in terms of technique and could have a successful career in supporting roles. Adele Haenel (Floriane) could become a protagonist, a bomb, or both. Pauline Acquart (Marie) has an unmistakable intensity and magnetism. In the future, she could interpret everything from an emotionally paralyzed librarian to a mysterious and sensual seductress, to a reluctant politician who faces a meteoric rise in recognition. <br /> <br /> In general, "Water lilies" was very disappointing. Will he be an honest filmmaker, please make an authentic film about two young women who fall in love? No, not necessarily for the good of this middle-aged boy, but so that young lesbians can have something of quality with what they can see and identify. And yes, to fill a thematic gap in world cinema.
