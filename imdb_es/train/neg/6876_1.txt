Yes, this was pure and incomprehensible patronizing babbling. We know that the French often have a skewed idea of ​​the USA. UU., It is Puritanism and points of view towards sex. As an American (Hoosier) living in France, I have many opportunities to observe these attitudes. And while some of these preconceived notions may be true, NOT AN ELEMENT of the Midwest city portrayed in this movie sounded real. A man who has never had sex because he was told in high school 20 years before his penis is too big? Where in the world would you find that? A juke box in a bar that only plays vintage bluegrass? A city with maybe 16 people less than two hours from Chicago, but without an important service station, there are no televisions in the house, there are no McDonalds, there are no children ... A population that knows the intimate details of each one , but it meets relentlessly as a great Family that hates itself. The adult males plant Whoopee cushions in the local cafe, they have farms but they do not harvest, they kill the guy they do not like in front of everyone and they seem to get away with it, and all with the same emotion? The liberated French girl who is going to fuck the 17-year-old virgin because of her sexual generosity, the overly carnal guy who leaves the cornfields for the simple breath of an Illinois breeze to help deflower this same farmer 17 years old? HELP! I am so baffled and amazed by the absurdity of this movie that I am not clearly expressing how ridiculous it is. Go see it for the booklet from A to Z on what to avoid. My God, I hope I have not ruined you for you!
