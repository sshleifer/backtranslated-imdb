Even for a tired movie model like the cycle of nature against man that prevailed predominantly in the 1970s, ants are sadly below being even somewhat effective (although entertaining for reasons they did not intend). It is incredibly absurd. Apparently, these ants that are razed near an inn have been consuming poisonous waste for decades and now have adapted by emitting poisonous stings; Seeing the actors of certain notoriety fall awkwardly in the middle of small black specks is painfully funny in a not so good, but very bad way. So many scenes just look ridiculous: a boy trying to fall into a dumpster while being attacked, Suzanne Sommers screaming in horror as she rested in bed, Robert Foxworth and Lynda George breathing pieces of wallpaper, Bernie Casey faking a game leg and the list goes on and on The danger shown ranges from ants crawling from a drain to black ant lines all over the walls. The cast of the film is not bad on paper, but none of these actors seem to believe in the material. Poor Myrna Loy has to sit in a wheelchair through this horror. I hope you have found a good use of money, since it is obvious that that was the ONLY reason why a woman of your pedigree would be in this nonsense. Although it's a pretty bad movie, it can be seen (once for me, and it has many of those bad cinematographic qualities of the seventies), the actors with an initial touch are embarrassed to themselves, that television sensation and the dreaded creatures of nature that stink of revenge in man This time the man must push his hand in a pile of ants to be affected. Really quite terrible.
