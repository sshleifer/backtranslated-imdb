I saw an early screening of this film in New York and I, along with my friends and almost the entire audience, was enormously disappointed. The movie was not as bad as it was good; He was as inert as a victim of a snake bite. Samual L. Jackson was surprisingly tired for most of the time and the effects of the snakes were scarce. It reminded me of one of those silly SciFi movies, except that the corny of this movie was not funny, not even corny. Everything seemed worn out, flat and openly formulated. I'm surprised to say that I actually think Anaconda was more fun. It is easy to understand that SOAP realizes that it is a piece of s * it and plays with it, but what the film does not embark on is a script that is afraid of suspense. It's the worst kind of lame movie: it's sad.
