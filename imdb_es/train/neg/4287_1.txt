I gave Timecop 10 perfect, I gave it to 1 <br /> <br /> His story is very boring and has little to do with the original Timecop. Many things of Timecop were discarded, and new stupid things were put in their place. This story takes place in 2060 (if I remember correctly), but for some reason, the time scale is now more dangerous: confusing: <br /> <br /> And the action scenes are nothing to be happy about, well , most of them are not ... only the first is great ... and there are not many action scenes, and they are all quite short <br /> <br /> At one point in the story, the main character travel in time about 5 times in a few minutes ... do not wait, do it twice ... <br /> <br /> In short: do not waste your time watching this movie, it's not worth it
