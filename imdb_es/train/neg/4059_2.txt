Seldom has such an incredible cast been wasted so much. Griffin Dunne, Rosanna Arquette, Illeana Douglas, Ethan Hawke, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken and John Turturro, got on board, only to be torpedoed by a script that looks like nothing more than a Hollywood joke. Attaching the name of Martin Scorsese to this was probably the draw, but the final result is much less than the sum of its parts. Like a nightmare that went terribly wrong, each scene seems more contrived than the next. "Search and destroy" is nothing more than abstract, elegant and self-indulgent nonsense, and the whole movie is decidedly boring .......... MERK
