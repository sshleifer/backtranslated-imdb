This voluntarily strange adaptation of Borges' short story is typical of Cox. His strong visual sense is, as usual, undone by the horrible performance of most of the cast. The film is definitely in the surrealist tradition of the Mexican period of Bunuel, and sometimes it resembles the opinion of a poor man on Lars Von Trier's Elements of Crime. Cox's apparent preference for individual shots, jump cuts and ambient sound recording work against the effectiveness of the film. It is worth taking a look but ultimately disappointing.
