It was not a blow for Korman, since it was a lot of fun on the Carol Burnett show. He was also good at playing minor characters in Mel Brooks's films ("It comes to mind," High Anxiety. ") However, he is not a person who can carry a movie in mourning roles or less. imitation of "Gremlins", following a tradition of films like "Critters" and "Ghoulies." Nor is it a very good imitation, on a par with "Ghoulies", but with a much lighter tone, since it is not as dark as In fact, this one is too light and sparkling, and unfortunately a lot of the jokes end up falling down.Although I gave it a 3 for a score, this is only because there is a movie that is even worse "Gremlin imitation". If you saw Mystery Science Theater 3000, you know who I'm talking about ... the infamous "Hobgoblins." This guy has a guy who finds a little creature somewhere underground (I only saw this movie once a long time ago, so I did not I remember everything clearly ) and start friendly enough. However, this creature quickly becomes hostile and, of course, generate more and that is the movie. More faults than successes in the joke department, and it is also very bad to see Korman playing the role of evil brother. It is best to omit this, but you may want to check it just for fun.
