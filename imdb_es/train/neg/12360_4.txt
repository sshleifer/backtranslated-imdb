Why would a person return to a person who kicked her in the teeth, not once or twice, but again and again? <br /> <br /> This movie teaches us that in order to find love we must accept abuse (not just forgive it, but accept it). God! No wonder my first relationship lasted only ten years. Obviously I was not embracing my inner masochist. <br /> <br /> As Bucatinsky's writing debut, there are many wonderful aspects of this movie; however, to justify the meeting of Eli and Tom, more character development would have been useful. We never know Eli's masochism, in fact, we are made to believe that he is not a masochist, although Tom's psycho-emotional sadism is very evident.
