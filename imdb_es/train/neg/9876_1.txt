I entered without knowing anything about this movie and I left in half an hour knowing everything about it. It was one of the worst movies I've seen. In general, I am a good person, but if someone told me that he liked this movie, I would probably never speak to them again. Anyone who likes it thoroughly is more likely to have an extremely dry hermit type personality. I will also include that they think that they are also very intelligent, as well as the bags of self-centered farts that make the voices of the film. I know everyone has different kinds of humor, some people may not even like mine, but that's fine; Although I do not think this covers any range of humor. This movie is as flat and boring as Wes Anderson's mind. Come in and prepare to leave; It is better to recover your money too.
