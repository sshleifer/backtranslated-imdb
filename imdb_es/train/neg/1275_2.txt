This is a horrible movie. The three stories are bracketed with a psychiatrist hypnotist line that is unnecessary and all the stories are bad. The first is about the wild wolves and some ladies, there are some things that do not make sense, but the question of hypnotism makes up for it. The second, with Bill Bill Paxton as a manic roommate, should not be seen by anyone. The last, unfortunately the best is almost incomprehensible, which I guess makes it better than the other garbage.
