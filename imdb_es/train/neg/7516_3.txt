I already rented it, so shoot me! <br /> <br /> A decent premise establishes an otherwise uncomfortable story without a real benefit, but at least it is well filmed. The director Jon Keeyes takes the simple idea of ​​a false haunted house with a real danger inside. In most cases, this should be a dunk, but this stinky little derail pretty fast. The cinematography is above average and the acting is mediocre at best, but the story and the writing are simply awful. The slowest scenes are prolonged forever and the fears are too few and far between, without a real climax of the film. At first it creates a strange atmosphere, but it loses its shine before any kind of horror arises, and I found myself bored to death and making another sandwich ... The art on the cover is attractive and I suppose it's worth renting it if you're looking for a low budget dreck with no sense, but if you enjoy a good story and an eventful ending, look for something else.
