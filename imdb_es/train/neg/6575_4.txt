Interesting movie about a real event that took place during the Vermont Civil War. He kept my attention until the end and I do not regret having seen him. I have never read any in this raid incident, so I was curious to see if the rebels succeeded. I enjoy the historical films of that time. <br /> <br /> My main complaint is with the Confederate uniforms. They look great! The acting was a bit stiff at times. I like that the old man ate the mashed potatoes because he had no teeth. The wounded soldier who played with a dog was a bit strange. In general, it was a downhill movie.
