I rarely make these comments, but I feel compelled to spare others the pain I endured when watching this movie. It is so stupid and implausible, both in the general story and in the details, that you simply can not suspend disbelief. The problem begins early, when you see a government investigator looking for a new Porsche and dining with his team in a restaurant that looks like a castle, overlooking the Capitol building in Washington, D.C. That kind of life with a government salary? Jah It only gets worse. Towards the end, when the bad guy begins to kill the good guys, the last group acts so stupidly that you want them to die, to clean up the gene pool. The special effects are pretty good (the money of any producer can buy that) and the main actors have been great in other films, but the script and the direction here are dumb. Many people have wondered if there was any deliberate intelligence behind the previous, partially stupid films of Paul Verhoeven (Showgirls, Starship Troopers), but this movie should stop thinking. He is simply bad.
