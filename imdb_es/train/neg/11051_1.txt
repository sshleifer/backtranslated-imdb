A terrible film that contains a group of Canadian actors from the D-list who seem so shy about the fact that they are in the camera, that their performances are too melodramatic and forgettable. <br /> <br /> This movie is poorly written, badly edited, and misdirected. It is disjointed, incomprehensible and strange, but not in a good way. McDowell does a great job with what he's given, but he's the only one in this movie who does it; It really has a bad story and a script to work with. It's not even funny enough to be fun. <br /> <br /> I still have to see Van Pelleske act credibly, and even sub-characters like Eisen (with his nasal, plaintive voice) confirm that we're a lot in Toronto instead of on an African barge . <br /> <br /> Did not the director see that the "creature" looks like a jazz dancer in an alien costume? The struggle between the blue lightning bolts and the orange blades of 'magic' by Pelleske (! For lack of a better word), is obviously the result of bad actors, without choreographer, superimposed with special effects completely derived. Was there even a director on the set or in the editing room of this disaster movie (not the good guy)? <br /> <br /> Learn from the mistakes of others ... do not even waste time with this, you will regret it as I did. I have nothing more to say about this waste of celluloid.
