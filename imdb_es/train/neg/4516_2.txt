I bought this DVD set, without seeing it, and I wish I had not. The script needed a serious rewrite since it seems to be completely devoid of feelings and pales in comparison to the book. The lighting is horrible, unpolished, but if it were only I could ignore it. The script does not focus enough on the characters ... there is almost no introduction to several characters, which makes it a bit difficult to distinguish who is who (especially on the planes, no idea who dies when). <br /> <br /> I have long felt that the key to a good movie is to get the audience to care about the characters; If you do not have that, you have nothing. He did not focus on the characters at all, you never met them, who they were, what they liked ... what made them do what they do. The series is 5 hours long and is divided into 6 parts ... I bet you're wondering what they did with all this time if they did not detail the characters --- they put a lot of stuffing ... I'll say that at least one whole hour watching them land and take off on their LOL planes (I mean, do we really need to see that again and again?). I would have given it a much higher rating if they had improved our knowledge of the characters.
