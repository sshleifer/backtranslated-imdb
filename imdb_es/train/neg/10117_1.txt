Wow. Tonight I went to the video store because I was in the mood for a bad B horror movie and I found this gem. I looked at the cover and thought that it seemed only the movie for my mood. I brought it home and put it on. <br /> <br /> This movie was not the horror movie B that I had in mind. This was much worse. I wanted a bad movie, but what I got, I did not know there was a shit like this among men. This movie seemed like a 5 year old wrote it and directed it, and that's nice. <br /> <br /> I'm an aspiring director and this movie made me so angry that someone is really paying this guy. Direct movies He has to work in a dumpster picking up garbage where he belongs. <br /> <br /> If you are thinking of renting it or buying it. I'll tell you the same thing I would say to someone who is preparing to commit suicide. "DO NOT DO IT, IT DOES NOT WORK!" I really do not have anything good to say about this movie. DO NOT DO IT!
