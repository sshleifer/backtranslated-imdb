Once again, the same family story about a man (writer here) who sells his soul to the devil to have his most desired ambition in life: success. Carefree script (we must "go home and write better"), ridiculous lines to understand the "strong" message of Christmanish (our only aspiration in life is to find love, respect and a good friendship) and a very long test. scene at the end where agent Hopkins defeated the demon (Jennifer Love Hewitt is not sexy or evil at all) for all the bad things he did to this nasty character. They are not bad efforts of the actors (Baldwin also as director, Cattrall in a role of "Sex in the city" again, Aykroyd with some funny lines in his limited role). PS Also try a not so popular movie from Greece called "Alloimono stous neous", a brilliant adaptation of this myth (an old man gives his soul to the devil to recover his youth)
