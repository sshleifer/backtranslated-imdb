This is the official sequel to the science fiction action thriller '92. In the original, Van Damme was among several veterans killed in the Vietnam War who were revived to be the perfect soldiers (Unisols). In this case, I suppose, about twelve years later, since Van Damme has a daughter that age. Now he is working with the government on a classified installation to train the latest Unisols, whose code name is Unisol 2500, for some reason. As usual, something goes wrong: the super computer on the site (called Seth, like the snake in "King Cobra" the same year) goes crazy for power, takes control of the Unisols and even downloads his computer brain in a new Super-Unisol Body (Jai White). We are looking at the next step in evolution, friends! Most of Van Damme's fights are with a Unisol particularly means (the professional fighter Goldberg) that keeps coming: firing him from a building, it's not good; catch it with a truck - do not go! Shoot it, burn it - forget it! Much of the humor goes back to how Van Damme is now outdated and outdated (it's even getting gray on the edges). But even if he licks, he keeps kicking! Most of the sequels of this type are quite pale: pale imitations of the originals, and although this is certainly not a genius, it manages to be always entertaining, especially if you are a fan of wrestling.
