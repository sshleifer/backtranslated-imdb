Some reporters and their military escorts try to tell the truth about a zombie epidemic, despite the "government that controls the media." The features of the film do not understand that George Romero's zombie movies only worked because he kept his politics subtly at the bottom of most of his films (the Land of the Dead, however). This satire is as subtle as a brick in the face or a bullet in the head is more appropriate for this scenario. What is subversive or subtle when seeing a military guy masturbating to death and destruction? Something nuanced about the various commercials interspersed with the film? No Besides, the acting is uniformly horrible, the characters completely unpleasant and the plot inane. Add all this and you will have the worst and most incompetent zombie movie, since "C.H.U.D. 2" raised its horrible head. <br /> <br /> My rating: D
