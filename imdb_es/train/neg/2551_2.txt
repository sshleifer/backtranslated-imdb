Deceived by the terrible lie on the cover, "fun as American Pie," my girlfriend and I sat in front of the television waiting for a comedy ... and this is definitely not one. You probably will not laugh once if you're not one of those always adolescent minds like Jackass. It's not even an erotic movie, which at least would be something, since it's about sex ... <br /> <br /> So, what is this? The erratic plot is about a boy who wants to lose his virginity (zero in originality, I remember "Losing him" for one) and his gang of friends. The rest of the characters (that is, the girls) simply come and go without any credible reason. Come on, there are even Dwarfs (so simple: "the dwarfs are fun, ho ho" ...) The performance is very similar to that of a television (as is the appearance of the video throughout the film) and definitely amateur in the case of most girls. ... <br /> <br /> Horrible movie. Amateur, poorly produced, and above all NOT FUNNY. Children and teenagers will love seeing him with friends because of jokes and sexual jokes. Apart from that, do not even think about renting this movie.
