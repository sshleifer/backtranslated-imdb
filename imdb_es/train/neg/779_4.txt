Seriously, I mean very seriously, when I started watching the program for the first time, I thought it was good. But the plots got worse. The plot was too boring or predictable. George is not always funny, sometimes he acts stupid. His jokes are exaggerated. His mother is the dumbest character in the show. How can a mother treat her own son in that way? Well, if it was the daughter-in-law, but this was her own son. I give this show a 4/10 just because the first shows were a bit funny. The actors Constance Marie and Masiela Lusha do a great job. I do not know how these shows get to play for so long. <br /> <br /> If you are really bored like me and I have nothing else to do, I suggest you look at it.
