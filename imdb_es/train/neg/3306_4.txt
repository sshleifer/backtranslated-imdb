A very "heterosexual" old woman, desperate to get money to save her house and her possessions, grow "pot" in her house, smoke it with some old friends and then sell it. That is the story of this discreet comedy, which emphasizes the absurdity of the situation and part of the humor that the situation brings. For a lot of the movie, it works. The humor is not the variety of laughter to laughter, but it keeps you entertained for an hour and a half, so I guess it serves its purpose. <br /> <br /> There are funny moments and Brenda Blethyn is fun to watch in the lead role. But the ending really ruined a "cute" movie with insulting messages, which ultra-liberals would like to see happen. <br /> <br /> Like most people, I would prefer a happy ending. also, but not everything should be warm and confusing for those who flagrantly violate the law. Also here are the typical (1) children out of wedlock, but that does not pose any problem and is considered correct; (2) clerics portrayed as morally weak persons; and (3) even a doctor who is also stoned! <br /> <br /> Hello? And the critics here lash out at Hollywood? This is sample A of how a secular society has lowered standards in the United Kingdom and in Europe in general. Hey, people: at least they have a trace of morality instead of nothing more than a message from Timothy Leary "If it feels good, do it".
