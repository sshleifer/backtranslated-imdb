This movie should have been only 10 minutes. I mean there's really only 10 minutes of visible content on this thing (I even doubt it's called a movie). The initial credits of the film were in some way promising. When the movie begins with brief comments from the man himself, you really rub your hands and keep an eye on the images of Cohen's life. Well, Nick Cave does a reasonable job covering one of Cohen's famous songs. The duration of Cave's performance makes you even more anxious to see more of Cohen, whose wit and well-spoken words have already pleased you. But as it turns out that Cave's performance is just the beginning of long, super boring presentations by a group of people who do not even have a minimum attraction to keep you in your seat. I mean, what does the filmmaker really think? The first five minutes of photos of wanna be singers at a fake concert in Australia! What does the filmmaker really think to insult the audience by adding "false applause" to these unpleasant performances? The movie is a perfect torture that shows you very little of what you came to see. There is not a single image of Cohen's past. In fact, with the exception of some photographs of his early years as a singer / poet, there is absolutely nothing! If you add up all the minutes that Cohen talks, you may not even reach 10 minutes. But these 10 minutes are presented tortuously little by little between the disastrous camera work that captures some of the most unattractive people who shout the letters of Cohen. If you ever decided to spend your money on this movie, DO NOT do it! just throw it away and at least save time.
