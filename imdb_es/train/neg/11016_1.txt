Imagine the worst scenes of Saturday Night Live and Mad TV in a 90-minute movie. Now, imagine that all the humor in those bad scenes is eliminated and replaced by stupidity. Now imagine something 50 times worse. <br /> <br /> Understood? <br /> <br /> Ok, now go see the underground comedy movie. That vision that you just had will seem like the funniest thing in history. UCM is the worst movie I've seen in my life. There were some cheap laughs ... very few. But he was lame. Even if the intention of the movie was to be scanty, it was too boring to be funny. <br /> <br /> The only reason I'm not angry about wasting my time watching this is that someone else I know bought it. He lost his money. Vince Offer has not written or directed anything else and it's no wonder why.
