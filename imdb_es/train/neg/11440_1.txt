Otherwise, it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and I never say. My wife and I were bored with our minds in 10 minutes. Not to mention it's boring, it's totally amazing. Women (not lesbians) do not bathe together, nor do they kiss "accidentally". Brothers and sisters do not live together until they are 30 and run dancing together and participating in races at the central park. The men do not know that his wife and sister kissed romantically the night before the wedding and never discussed it with that wife. Absolutely ridiculous <br /> <br /> Heather Graham is possibly the worst actress in movies today. She smiles when she should be crying and vice versa. The only movie that has always been good is Boogie Nights, and that's because he did not act. <br /> <br /> I can not emphasize how bad this movie was.
