I rented this movie the other night because neither my girlfriend nor I had seen it, even though we had heard from a mutual friend that "it was great". <br /> <br /> Now, I'm quite conservative in my opinion. points of view, but I knew that entering would be quite liberal given who directed it. I imagined that before the film began, Michael Douglas would play a popular liberal, compassionate and loved by the masses, and there would be a conservative opponent as his antagonist. But I thought that this is where the political declaration would begin and end. <br /> <br /> Well, the plan was solid: the only president falls in love with a lobbyist. Ok, this has a potential that I thought would be quite entertaining, since the plot was unique. But then the movie became a liberal infomercial. The film became more about gun control and environmental issues than about the relationship between the President and Sydney (Annette Bening). <br /> <br /> There were several ridiculous premises in this movie: 1) The character Sydney interpreting this Lobby of six figures that is a "closer". Could it have been more flying? She was constantly disorganized and seemed amazed at everything. Just a "closer". I am a sale, and she could not "close" by selling a glass of water to a man who is dying of thirst. <br /> <br /> 2) Second, is there anything more ridiculous than Richard Dreyfuss playing a right-wing fan? This is the most liberal man in Hollywood and she plays a right-wing ideologue. Give me a break. I liked how he took his conservative character and made it as sinister as possible. <br /> <br /> 3) The speech at the end was simply ridiculous. The line about "I'm a proud member of the ACLU that carries cards" was a joke. In the first place, no president would admit something like that, being an active member of an ultra-marginal group. Second, why even bring something like that? It has just alienated more than half the audience of the film that is moderate or conservative. <br /> <br /> I thought the plot was excellent and unique. I thought Michael Douglas was a good choice as president. But the movie went from being a "movie" to a left political statement, which is why the film failed. <br /> <br /> It's a shame to see a big plot ruined by the fact that Hollywood has to force its political views. the audience
