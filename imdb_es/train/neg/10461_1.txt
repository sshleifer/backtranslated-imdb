It is interesting to read the comments of the viewers regarding the Omega Code ... many of the overwhelmingly positive comments were almost eliminated word for word from the TBN transmissions ... the film looks like it was made to go directly to the video, to be stored in addition to the three - part of the series of abductions that was made by some other religious group in the 70s ... do not you remember? You will not remember this either in a year or two. This is the first movie I've seen in which it was implicit that it was your religious duty to go to her and buy as many tickets as possible to save souls ... very shameful ... this only proves that if you are the son of a televangelist, you can also play a Hollywood producer of high roll with ten thousand ladies tithe money ...
