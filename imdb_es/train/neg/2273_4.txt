This was not the big disaster I expected, but it's as positive as I can be in my description of the movie. I'm not sure what it was like to be funny with this movie, but I guess it's all a matter of taste. Personally, I do not find it funny to see imbeciles who live their idiotic lives or who cheat themselves on television, but, again, I'm not a fan of Jerry Springer's pathetic daytime talk show. I did not get too bored seeing this, but I definitely was not enjoying it either. If you feel like watching a bad movie, but it's not too painful to sit on, this is a good option.
