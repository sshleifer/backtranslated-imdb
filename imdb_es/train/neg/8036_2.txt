Do you want to know a secret? This movie sucks. Well, I really do not know because if you get carried away by plagiarized versions of original films, then maybe you'll find this amazing movie (this movie is a plagiarized copy of what you did last summer). The first 30 minutes of the film are based on a typical story scenario; a group of so-called great teenagers who enjoy their Florida vacations and behave like the young people they are. The only information we get at this point is to what extent the director managed to illustrate a pretentious sense of adolescent decadence within the characters. The second half hour of the film gains a bit of momentum and begins to illustrate a beginning of unprecedented and unprecedented murders. The third half hour of the movie will definitely remain a mystery to me, because I turned it off before I could fool myself even more thinking that the film could still have something interesting and original to show. As far as history is concerned, it can be easily explained in a few lines. A group of teenagers go to Florida on vacation. While they are busy at the party, slowly (and I mean SLOWLY) they begin to be killed because they know some kind of silly secret. The only thread of the murders is that all the victims were enrolled in a common secondary school. However, one thing that surprised me about this movie was the amount of betty (I'm not sure of his name ... the blonde character) looks like Reese Witherspoon. Another thing that surprised me about the movie was that it made me jump out of my seat several times. Does that make it a work of art? Absolutely not because my 12-year-old niece made me drink a glass of orange juice because I was "booing" when I was about to walk through the door of the guest room ... what is the difference between the director and my niece 12 years old? ???? <br /> <br /> Do you want to know a secret? I'm not sure about you, but I do not ...
