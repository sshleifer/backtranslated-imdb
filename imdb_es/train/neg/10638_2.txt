Proof that not everything Tarantino touches turns to gold. This is definitely plastic, all the way. It is easy to see that without Quentin's participation, this would probably have sat on the shelf for years, and that supposing it had occurred in the first place. It's about a woman with a fascination for death who gets a job cleaning after crime scenes, Angela Jones is not convincing in this role, William Baldwin is better than Serial Killer, who keeps Jones in the job! In general, quite poor.
