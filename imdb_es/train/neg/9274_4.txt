This sequel is a total rehash of the first movie. A completely useless movie. Basically, he only took each sceanrio of the first film and redesigned it in Omen IV, except this time with a feminine antichrist. It even ends in the same way as the first one! The music is too busy and interferes, and since it is practically a copy of Omen I, it is extremely predictable. It is not a horrible movie, it is not made in a terrible way, there are much worse films, this simply does not make any sense. The Omen remake of 2006 is much worse, even more useless than this, so I guess it has that. If someone pointed a gun at your head and you had to choose to watch this sequel or the 2006 reamke, I think you would choose this.
