So do not even think about renting this in stores, because this is a very bad movie. You would think that JJ Abrahams had written this movie. Basically, a rat is pulled down the toilet and somehow has to come back out. Fans of the terrible "Shrek" could enjoy it, but fans of "Wallace and Gromit" probably reject with disgust. Also, why did not they do it in plasticine or clay? I mean, CGI animation? For an AARDMAN movie ?? !! Obviously, Aardman relaxed while letting Dreamworks take care of everything. Evil, bad, INCORRECT! Almost all the characters are horrible, apart from that kind of frog, which is just for a movie villain. But everything else about the movie is DULL, DULL, DULL! I almost fell asleep from boredom watching this movie. No, wait, actually, I fell asleep with boredom watching this movie. It is simply terrible. But fortunately, it's not as bad as "Shrek".
