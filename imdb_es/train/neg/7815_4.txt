As a Superman fan of comics, during the 1950 series, the first two films by Chris Reeves and Lois & Clark, and finally Smallville, I * really * expected something smart with "Superman Returns". <br /> <br /> Instead, we got Lex Luthor to make * another * real estate conversion attempt, another sequence of Kryptonite hit by Superman while wearing and internal inconsistencies: he could not help falling into the Ocean when gets stuck with 6 "of kryptonite, but when Lois breaks 3" of it, * leaving the rest embedded in it *, can it lift * a continent * into space? Actually, the only hero in the story was Lois' partner, I do not remember his name beforehand. He did all sorts of heroic and life-saving things with nothing but guts and dexterity, no superpowers or invulnerability ... just a normal human. <br /> <br /> They keep making Superman so small. Why can not we have Superman fighting Brainiac or fighting to save General Zod's universe instead of Lex's little plans? Oh, I forgot ... they're doing that in Smallville. <br /> <br /> Yes ... I think I'll stay with Smallville ... <br /> <br /> You should probably, too ...
