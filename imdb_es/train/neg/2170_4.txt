This film describes the thin line between satire and stupidity. While a bridge system that has no rules can promote marital harmony, it certainly can not promote the winning bridge, so satire did not work for me. But there were some elements that I found pleasant anyway, especially with the great bridge game between Paul Lukas and Ferdinand Gottschalk near the end of the film. It is treated like a boxing championship. The arena of the contest is not only enclosed in a square area like a boxing ring, but there is a referee suspended between the participants, and the radio station Roscoe Karns offers an uninterrupted talk about the events. At one point, he even lists "One ... Two ... Three ... Four ..." as if a bet of four diamonds were a fall event. And people were glued to their radios for everything, a common event for the boxing championships. That parody worked very well. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, few of the actors provide the comedy necessary to sustain the planned satire. Paul Lukas does not have much talent for comedy and feels bad; The charming Loretta Young and the usual comedian Frank McHugh did not receive good lines; Glenda Farrell has a nice comic twist as a forgetful blonde at the beginning of the movie, but it practically disappears thereafter. What a waste of talent!
