This movie tried to be too many things at once: spicy political satire, Hollywood blockbuster, romantic comedy, family values ​​promo ... the list goes on and on. He failed miserably in all of them, but there was enough interest to keep him from putting it out until the end. <br /> <br /> Although I appreciate the spirit behind WAR, INC., I am depressed to see such awkward effort, especially when your objectives will take it to reflect the lack of a serious criticism, instead of just bad writing, address and production of this particular movie. <br /> <br /> There is a criticism to be made about the corporatization of war. But taunting him in this way diminishes the true atrocity of what is happening. It reminds me a little of TRES REYES, which similarly trivializes a real cause for concern.
