Potboiler incredibly improbable and silly that, at least, has a clear and redeeming location photograph, but it is too incredible to generate much tension. I was hoping that Stanwyck could not go back in time because, in reality, he had to carry the humidity, in more ways than one, husband, and he also had an idiot son ... why not run away with Meeker? But the persistent question remains ... what kind of wood was the spring support made of if a rotted piece did not float? Stanwyck, always impeccable professional, does the best he can with the material, but is undone.
