Considering the potential of this movement, the reality was disappointing. While it's always good to see Jennifer Aniston in a movie, even that could not change this. Most of the action was predictable. The jokes were flat or slightly funny. And the characters were not very interesting. I wanted to like this movie, but it never happened. Ben Stiller was hilarious in "There's Something About Mary". Here it seems that it is only going through the movements. If they have to remove points from the "Friends" plot, they should have known something was wrong. The humor of the toilet should have stayed in the closet :-). <br /> <br /> Look at "50 First Dates" instead.
