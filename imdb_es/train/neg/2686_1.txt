First of all, I am not American or Middle Eastern. Second, I do not have a religion. The closest thing to a religion I have are sports and movies. From here on, I think it would be better to provide an opinion of neutrality and free from bias. <br /> <br /> Most of these short films are an absolute shame. This terrible event should be used to commemorate all those innocent people who were murdered by "some" barbaric and uncivilized imbeciles. Instead, most of what I saw in these short films were conceited attempts to score varied political points. Examples: <br /> <br /> 1) Segment of Ken Loach. Of course, we are all sad because this guy had a hard life in his country, but what does that have to do with the innocent victims of 2001? Two mistakes do not make a right? Whatever is! This movie should have a subtitle for those who have trouble hearing a partially incoherent Chilean-English accent. <br /> <br /> 2) The most disturbing is the Youssef Chahine segment. It is obvious that he has problems with logic. He justified the murders because the United States is a democracy and because some Americans voted for the politicians in power, then all Americans are responsible for the actions and decisions taken by their leaders in the Middle East. Helloooo! Is this man for real?? Some Americans do not even vote! Some Americans do not even know where the Middle East is; some do not even know what religion is practiced there; and most do not know the real political problems that are played behind the scenes. ### Mr. Chahine, the reason we have all these problems in the world is because there are too many people with their kind of logic. The innocent victims in the Twin Towers came from all over the world. The firefighters, rescue workers, office employees, passers-by and flight passengers killed have nothing to do with politics. And yet, we are not allowed to continue with our lives because "some" people think that everyone has to choose a side or a religion. We are perceived as a fair game for extreme politics. <br /> <br /> 3) The Israeli segment showed its own victims bombed. Another filmmaker uses this event to push his own political agenda. Sometimes, it's not about you. Some people always think of the "me, me, me". Sometimes, it's about other people. <br /> <br /> 4) The Idrissa Ouedraogo segment is a joke and another political scorer. Obviously, they want money from the international community to highlight their poverty. Bla bla bla. <br /> <br /> This film denigrates the memory of the victims of "September 11, 2001". <br /> <br /> The best thing is the trash can.
