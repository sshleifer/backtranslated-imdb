OK, I and a friend rented this a few days ago because we like to keep track of the B movies since we make them ourselves. Anyway, the cover contained blood and naked, strange-looking girls with fangs and stuff ... and Tom Savini! There is simply no way this film can fail! Right? incorrect!! It seems a waste! There really was no story, the dialogue was terrible (is there anyone there? X 1000!), The characters were ... well, they really lacked any personality ... The effects were terrible ... and what about these long, artistic shots of scared people running around doing nothing ... with an extreme close-up of eyes and stuff? We were sitting the whole movie waiting for something ... something to happen ... but no ... "Oh, here come the nymphs! Great! Oh ... they're kissing ... again ... and now for Violence! Okay ... nothing really happens ... again ... oh, now they run ... and the close-ups of the eyes ... again ... oh, here's Tom Savini Oh ... he died ... right ... well, maybe now something good or even interesting happens ... no ... oh, great! A severed head! The end ... oh, shit! ... "And finally, since I'm so full of myself ... I'll tell you this! Give me a van, six actors, a strange looking house, Tom Savini, a couple of naked girls with fangs and blood cubes and I could make the coolest movie you've ever seen ... I've made movies without a budget. in two days that has better effects, better acting and a better script than this ... what is this type of Johannes doing? Making great movies is easy! It could have been so great ... I'm really upset!
