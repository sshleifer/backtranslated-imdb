If this is based on the real-life relationship, as claimed, between Mrs. Curtin and Mr. Levinson, I am delighted that I do not know them personally. This is terribly slow, and both characters take stupid pills generously throughout the film, while the theme plays on the floor. Many stupid scenes with people acting stupidly do not make a comedy.
