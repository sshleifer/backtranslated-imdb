At first glance, this documentary / fiction / caricature is quite entertaining and stimulating. Of course, when something provokes thought, it can be examined. The reality is that this film combines metaphysics with unsubstantiated insinuations and conclusions. The link that "What the Bleep ..." would make you see between science and spirituality is not, in fact, rooted in science. The study of Transcendental Meditation mentioned in the film affirms that the meditation of a group can reduce the crime in a certain area, Washington DC, in this case. In reality, the HRA (homicide, rape and assault) crime rate was approximately 30% higher in 1993 than the average crime rate between 1988 and 1992. There was absolutely no decrease in the homicide rate during the study. In fact, each and every one of the affirmations that link metaphysics with science can and have been disproved. <br /> <br /> My conclusion from this information is that this movie is a poor attempt to indoctrinate people or a joke. Either way, I suggest you do not waste your time. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a long film about science that may provoke thoughts, you might consider Mindwalk (1990).
