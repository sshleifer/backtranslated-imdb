There are two types of musicals of the fifties. First you have MGM's brilliant productions with big names and good music. And then you have the minor leagues with a less famous cast, less famous music and second-rate directors. 'The girl can not help it' belongs to the last category. Neither Tom Ewell nor Edmond O'Brien became famous and Jayne Mansfield was famous for her ... well, it does not matter. It seems that every decade has its share of Bo Dereks or Pamela Andersons. The plot itself is thin as a razor blade and one can not help but suspect that it is primarily an attempt to sell records for Fats Domino, Little Richard or other of the rock acts of the 1950s that appear in the movie. If that music appeals to you, it's worth seeing. If not, do not bother.
