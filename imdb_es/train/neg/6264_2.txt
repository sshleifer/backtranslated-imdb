Nightmare Weekend is a positive proof that some people are so desperate to be 'in the movies' that they are prepared to do almost anything. <br /> <br /> I do not mean the countless women who seem very happy to appear completely. Starkers in this terrible piece of garbage (after all, the nude female form is a beautiful thing and nothing to be ashamed of). No ... I'm talking about those who are more than willing to co-star a poorly made puppet named George. Now that is shameful! <br /> <br /> A bioelectronic being created by the brilliant scientist Edward Brake (Wellington Meffert), George (who looks like an insane clown with green wool for hair) is artificial intelligence. interface for an advanced computer system that operates a revolutionary device (a silver sphere the size of a golf ball) that, when ingested, can reverse the upsets of the characters. <br /> <br /> Edward's personality alteration experiments have been successful in the laboratory of animals, but the cautious scientist is reluctant to perform tests on human subjects, fearing that side effects may still exist. His wicked assistant, Julie (Debbie Laster), however, has no such objections, and proceeds to use three beautiful young women as guinea pigs. Inevitably, they all become horrible murderous mutants. <br /> <br /> With special bargain effects, a cast totally devoid of talent and a plot that is almost impossible to follow (I took notes while watching the movie and even then I am not completely convinced that my synopsis is accurate ), Nightmare Weekend is a complete and absolute disaster that even several scenes of soft core sex and a touch of blood can not rescue. <br /> <br /> This movie also features one of the most annoying characters I've seen in a horror movie: Tony (Bruce Morton), a walkman who dresses up an idiot who jumps into music of the 80s in a way that makes me look like Justin Timberlake in comparison.
