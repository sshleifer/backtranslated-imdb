I'm seeing it now in pink (Serbian TV station) and I must say that this is crap. Weak, without action, too careless effects, I mean, who did this series? <br /> <br /> This was a stupid attempt at the studios to make more money on the success of the movie. IN AGREEMENT. The movie was great in 1994 when it came out. But the series? <br /> <br /> Sometimes you can see how idiotic the lines are in the characters' discourse. I mean, did they actually pay someone to write that? Was that relative of someone in the studio? This is not SciFi. <br /> <br /> The movie was the bomb, the series sucks.
