The movie lacks style, I mean the original style. everything is copied, including the action, the first appearances in the film, the songs, the delivery of dialogues, etc. Yes, the errors were original, as at the beginning, a car with the number UP **** is shown and a few seconds later. begins to fall down a hill with the number MH ****. That was one of the many mistakes of the movie :) Something good in the movie? Yes, for the Kareena fans, if there are any, Kareena in a bikini. For fans of akshay, their dialogues and action tricks. That's. nothing else. So watch it at your own risk and do not blame the director or the actors. The director is already crazy and the actors, I pity them.
