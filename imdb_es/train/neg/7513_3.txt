What can I say? I think I have to write "Spoiler Alert" and then "reveal" they used the word F MUCH in this movie, as in every two sentences. I did not like this movie at all, too many hints about sexual perversions, passes and traps. And that oath was totally out the window. I gave this movie "3" and two of those points are for the sensual movements of Mira Sorvino on the dance floor.
