Okay, you have to admit that, as an Orthodox woman who LIVES in Boro Park, I'm going to be a bit biased in this movie. However, it seemed that Boaz Yakin's sole purpose in making this film was to attack the Orthodox. With our wigs, modest dress and separate seats, we are a pretty easy target. Yakin never managed to get past the surface. The result is a film with more holes than Swiss cheese: 1. Yosi tells Sonia to love him more than Gd or his parents. Then he deliberately challenges his father's order not to go swimming because of his poor health. 2. Sonia turns around in her son's bris. Why would a Chassidic woman from Monsey have such a strong reaction? It's hard to believe that she never attended one before. Let's face it, even reforming Jews hold bri milah ceremonies today. 3. Was Mendel sleeping during his chosson classes? He is supposed to satisfy his wife's passions in bed and refrain from kissing her in the street. Especially in the middle of the busiest street in Boro Park! 4. Sonia and Mendel must have been married for more than a year, and now she realized that they were not destined for each other? A small clue: arranged marriage does not mean that the girl has to take the first child with whom her parents have hired her. Nor will it be rejected by the community if the marriage does not work. 5. If Sonia really wanted to get into the jewelry business so badly, she did not have to go through her lustful brother-in-law. There are doctors, lawyers, teachers, etc. orthodox Sonia was more than a weeper than a nice one. Instead of taking control of his life, he sat and waited for things to happen, and then complained that he did not like the result. That is not standing in front of your surroundings; That is pleasing the stereotype. Frankly, I think she got what she deserved.
