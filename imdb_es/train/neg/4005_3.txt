I am a true fan of Cracker's original series, and I own all of them on DVD. Cracker tended to be exaggerated at times, but Robbie Coltrane and the other cast members, as well as the writers, always seemed to carry on in spite of themselves. I have the original Cracker among the great series of crimes of Brit TV of that time, and there is a tough competition: Prime Suspect, Inspector Frost, Morse Inspector, Sherlock Homes by Jeremy Brett and many others. Cracker, along with Prime Suspect, was at the top of my list. <br /> <br /> What makes "A New Terror" even sadder ... <br /> <br /> Ultimately, this was a very pale imitation of Cracker's former glory. I forced myself to sit through the whole thing, convinced that it really could not be so bad, and that some spark would eventually ignite. I was wrong, it was bad from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> Some criticisms: first, to avoid any possible bias from the beginning: I was offended by the anti-American, the fight against war. Rule that followed and continued during most of the show. The main one: the murder of two innocent Americans of any crime and a British Junkie is, in Fitz's words, "understandable, but not justified". I thought: "I wandered for two fucking hours just to listen to this nasty piece of nonsense?" So I had a negative reaction to the antiwar / American tone provoked by my beliefs ... Beyond politics, I had the distinct feeling that this Cracker was simply a support for propaganda, and actually helped to undermine a problem. Terrible script. <br /> <br /> Secondly, how much air time did Robbie Coltrane get? Fitz was almost a little player in this case, as if it were a last-minute idea connected to a story originally written without thinking about Fitz's role. Coltrane could have taken the show with his own broad shoulders and, even so, adequately flaccid, but the writer was apparently thinking about other things, and missed the opportunity, and by a wide margin. <br /> <br /> Third: WHAT IS A ABYSEMAL SCRIPT! There was a bit of a spark, and a couple of fragments of the character's real development (Fitz's son complained that Fitz could not stay at home if he lost his plane to Australia, the Detective who liked to beat his bad artists in the back of his head, and some of the old sparks between Fitz and his lady, but not enough to carry the tedious story. <br /> <br /> Fourth, where the hell was Panhallagan? Now that would have been Interesting ... It was Manchester after all, and 10 years later she would be in the ranks ... Another missed opportunity (or maybe the actress was not interested?) <br /> <br /> Well, there's a lot more to say ( that's bad), but I'll close it with a curiosity: at the end of the show (as broadcast on BBCA), when the announcement announced that the "Director's Cut" was available on BBC On-Demand, I thought AH-HA! Director's version, which, presumably, one has to pay, could have all the thing I expected to see tonight, but I never had them, as a coherent and interesting story. Unfortunately, after convincing myself to sit through the horrible free version of "A New Terror" in the hope of seeing something, anything, worth seeing, just to disappoint me, I have no hope of motivating myself to really pay a second. Potentially longer and more tedious version. Also, it angered me to think that BBCA cut and cut into cubes, and sacrificed the presentation time to accommodate the interminable flow (every ten minutes or so) of commercials, and then turned around and asked me to pay for the version that It probably should have aired tonight. . <br /> <br /> To close, I quote the first paragraph of Variety's review of "A New Terror": it really says it all: "Initial excitement that Robbie Coltrane resumed his role as the clueless, drunk, womanizer of the BBC the criminal psychologist is cornered by the political critic Jimmy McGovern is determined to fulfill this vidpic resurgence At first, his message is shaken, meaning that Americans are a bunch of fools who do not care about anything. " About terrorism before it came to our door, McGovern's breast-cleaning tirade overwhelms the narrative and silences the pleasure of seeing Fitz in the case. "
