I saw this movie in the mysterious science theater when it was called "Live at night". That title is much less deceptive than "Batpeople". In fact it would be called with more precision Batperson. This movie is about a doctor who studies bats that I'm thinking because he wants to make a better cure for rabies. This is not very clear. What is clear is that he and his wife make a tour of a cave and are beaten by a bat. Why a scientist needs to take a tour to study bats beats me. Should not he be able to enter alone? Well, after being bitten, he and his wife go to their honeymoon where they start having attacks. They go to the worst doctor of all. The guy stays in the hospital and kills a nurse. In the end, the guy kills 3 or 4 people and his wife supports him and you're supposed to be encouraging him instead of the sheriff investigating the murders.
