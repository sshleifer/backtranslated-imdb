someone needed to pay for a car ... this is really horrible ... makes the cyborg Jean Claude has gone with the wind ... this is an hour I wish I could sue to return ... fortunately, produced a severe drowsiness ... from which I fell asleep. How can actors of this caliber create this dog? I would rather spend time watching how the algae grow on the side of a fish tank than to partake of this tremendous mix of several genera. Now I use the DVD as a roller coaster on my coffee table. $ 5.99 in walmart is too much to spend on this movie ... if you really have to have it, wait until you throw it away after you've loaded it into inventory for several years and are frustrated not to sell it. <br /> <br /> Please, for the love of God, let this film die of darkness.
