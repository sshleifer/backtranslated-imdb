As one of the few commentators who have not seen the first movie, it seemed like a very disappointing movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, it has a strange and uncomfortable mood if you can bear (very) morally dubious premise. However, it fails abysmally in important areas. <br /> <br /> There is a thin and meaningless plot involving the generous friend of Gordon Sinclair who may or may not be involved in a conspiracy to supply dangerous electronic devices to Third World countries, possibly on free computers. or possibly not. Vague, long-winded and inconclusive. The lack of a substantial ending is so exasperating and what is present is pompous and completely illogical. The film feels half finished. <br /> <br /> The suspension of disbelief is extremely difficult when witnessing a very attractive teacher (Maria Doyle Kennedy) may be attracted by the unimpressive character of Gordon Sinclair, especially when he moves away from his advances. Funny. It gets worse later in the movie when it achieves its romantic ambitions and then throws it all away for some ideals based on very little evidence of ambiguous value. <br /> <br /> Not many movies leave me scammed, but I felt my moment was stolen.
