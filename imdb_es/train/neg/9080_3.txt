Well, I just ordered this on my PPV at home because I was bored and I needed to laugh. I must admit that I chuckled several times, but I do not even remember what parts they were in. I do not understand why this movie was made. He claims to be a comedy, but seriously, I do not find a singer penis or a very funny 70-year-old naked woman. This film tried to fit in the comedies of recent years, such as American Pie and Road Trip, but failed miserably. It was too thick for comedy. Also, why the hell did Cameron DÃ­az attach his name to this movie?!?! The only thing I liked about this movie was when Dave and Angela were in the pool. I thought it was sexy and nice and well done. On top of that, avoid this movie. 3/10
