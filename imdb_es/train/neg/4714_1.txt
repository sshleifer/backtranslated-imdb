So, I want to give this piece of TRASH a zero, unfortunately, there is not, so I had to give it a 1 just to warn you how stupidly terrible this impostor of a family cartoon is. The characters seem to have been drawn by preschoolers, no, wait, I've seen preschoolers do better! I prefer "Misadventures of Flapjack" to this terrible excuse for a cartoon! I'm probably saying what others have said, two words: RIP OFF !! Remember the Dexter's Lab episode when karts ran on that volcano? Yes, Mr. Fellows even got that idea and failed. They even ripped Shadow Lugia off in that episode that parodied Pok√©mon! (He even cashed that franchise!) That character is a cheap Mandark scam from the Dexter Lab! Mister Fellows must be sued for legal infringement for this piece of garbage! Everyone has their own opinion, but those of you who like Johnny's test (RIP-OFF), are lying to yourselves. Do yourself a favor, change the channel when this scam tries to dishonor your screen!
