Once again I took a chance and rented this garbage bag. Announced as a horror movie, there was not one scene, nor one, that was even remotely frightening. NOT ONE!! Of course there was some nudity, but all the lesbian action became a little old. I guess maybe it was supposed to be the salvation of this movie. And Dan, what an annoying ass bag! From the beginning I knew he was waiting for me when the good old Dan spoke for the first time. And was it supposed to be intimidating? How funny!! All in all, this movie is terribly horrible! How the hell are movies made like this? If you want a movie with some emotions, do not rent it. This movie is as exciting as the Teletubbies.
