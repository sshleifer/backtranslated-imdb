I saw this movie last night (about 102 minutes) and I do not know what kept me in my seat. I guess I expected a movie with Gere to have some value in the future, but nothing of value ever appeared on the screen. History is a foolish excuse to accumulate one shot after another of slavery and torture. There is not a character in the movie who does something like real life. The "style" of cut is based on jump cuts, mini flashbacks and overprinting to give weight to this bland configuration of a band of sadists who apparently have been free for years and SURPRISE that the leader is the "victim" of a murderer executed . I do not see how Gere, a Buddhist, got involved in this violent and sexist garbage.
