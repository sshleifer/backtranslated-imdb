This film based on the book is really horrible and a big disappointment. We have been waiting for this transfer for more than a month. Many film critics were hopeful. Also in newspapers and television, it made a lot of sense. When it arrives on April 29, many people realize with regret that the movie is really horrible. Why? In the first place the story was so monotonous. There have been many undefined scenes, sometimes it is difficult to realize what is happening. The actresses, outside of Hulya Avsar, were not attuned to their roles, especially Vildan Atasever. She acts best in comedy movies. In this film, a kind of drama, he could not get rid of his previous role. And finally the movie is too short, only 66 minutes.
