My complaints here have to do with the pace of the film and the material in question. While the use of movies and lyrics gives the film a fresh and interesting perspective, all too often the material selected for highlighting is simply not very interesting (as when Goebbels complains about this or that illness, etc.), or the advertising material of your movie. small German hometown). In addition, the film creeps along the deck c. 1920-1939 and then flees through the years of war. In summary, the film is a bit better than a History Channel documentary, with the exception that the filmmaker has a slightly higher sensitivity than his average History Channel documentary editor and, therefore, can organize the details of life of Goebbels. Still, I found it lacking.
