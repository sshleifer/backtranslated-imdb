Good good good. As good as John Carpenter's first season in "Masters of Horror" was, this is just the opposite. Without a doubt, he proved that he was still a horror master with "Cigarette Burns", but that "Pro-Life" is perhaps the worst I've seen of him. <br /> <br /> It's stupid, totally devoid of a spooky atmosphere and tension. It remains in excess, it is welcome, despite the execution time of less than an hour. The script does not make sense, the characters are irritable and unattractive, and the conclusion is more than absurd. <br /> <br /> And for the fools who really bought the DVD (one of them is me); Did you see how Carpenter describes the movie? He is actually proud of it and considers it his best work for a long time, and praises the script. And on the comment track, where he notices an obvious error that reached the final cut, he simply says he did not feel it was essential to correct the error and that he simply left it there. I'm afraid the old master has completely lost his touch. Honestly, I hope I have proved that I am wrong. <br /> <br /> I want to leave a positive note and mention that the effects of the creatures are impressive, however. Technically speaking, this film is top notch, with effective lighting schemes and makeup effects.
