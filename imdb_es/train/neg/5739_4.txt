A small city is attacked by a horde of bloodthirsty vampires. The only hope is a solitary avenger and a group of ragtag survivors. <br /> <br /> Launched in 1993, "Darkness" gained a kind of cult after its release. It's easy to see why: it's charged (and I mean burdened with) blood, and it's energy and enthusiasm, like the one found in other cult-riddled movies without a budget like "The Dead Next Door" and "The Children of Ravensback ", is actually quite contagious. <br /> <br /> While that may be true, unfortunately it is not enough to save it. The film was filmed in a Super 8, so the image is grainy and dark, which makes things very difficult to see (it would have been great if the protagonists had hidden the frightening red mullet). It is also the soundtrack, composed by the annoying Casio. Keyboard and even more annoying Death Metal (seriously, what about these horror films without a budget and bad Death Metal?) While performances worthy of an Oscar are not expected, the performance is still a strictly amateur hour, since the actors sometimes seem almost confused. Instead of scared or threatened. <br /> <br /> In the end, I'm sure fans of budget gorefests will love this. However, everyone else would wish there was a little more meat in the ribs.
