The 1960s was a time of change and awakening for most people. Social unrest and instability were commonplace when people talked about their views. Racial tensions, politics, the Vietnam War, sexual promiscuity and the use of drugs were part of the daily fabric and daily news. This film tried to encapsulate these historical aspects in an entertaining film and had great success. <br /> <br /> In this movie, two families are followed: one white and one black. During the first half of the film, the story follows each family on equal terms through social and family struggles. Unfortunately, the second half of the movie is almost dedicated to the white family. It is true that there are more characters in this family, and the lines of history are intermingled, but the racial aspects of this century are not taken into account. <br /> <br /> In general, the performance is well done and historical. The images are mixed with original images in color and black and white to give a documentary touch to the film. The film is a work of fiction, but clips of well-known historical characters are used to establish the timeline. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the movie but the situations were predictable and the story was one-sided.
