The film Corpse Grinders 2 by Ted V. Mikels is 103 minutes of unbearable film experience. The plot is practically a mix of meaningless business between people who move corpses in cat food, while foreign cats, who are losing a war with foreign dogs, are looking to get some of this cat food. When I saw this movie, I started looking for any kind of distraction, anything to make sure I was doing something else, besides losing my head inside. <br /> <br /> Several scenes go on for too long, as the characters take an eternity to do simple things. I've heard that Mr. Mikels does not like to use jump cuts too often, afraid to confuse his audience. I'm not sure if this attitude is "avant-garde" or just "stupid". No matter how hard I tried, I could not worry about any of the cast characters unnecessarily large, well with the possible exception of the elders who are the caretakers of the factory. The majority of the cast is a group of untalented amateurs who do not even bother to learn the lyrics of "Amazing Grace" before having to sing it on camera. Although maybe the fault should be the poor quality of the sound, since I only heard about 80% of the dialogue while watching the DVD. <br /> <br /> This is possibly the worst movie ever filmed. I've heard snippets of the comment, and Mr. Mikels introduces himself as a surprisingly sweet old man, what the hell was he doing doing this kind of crap? I would like to hear explanations from elders that they had to be shirtless on a metal conveyor waiting to be ground. The films that I have hated for a long time seem much better. I crave the intermittently appropriate Excalibur music and the constant illumination of Dawn of the Dead. I need to go do something, anything. I do not see this movie.
