The often reliable Leonard Maltin says that this is a "charming romance" and that Sanders is "excellent". Maltin must have confused this movie with something else. Sanders is snide and droll and excellent, as usual, ?? you can imagine his delivery of the line with respect to adultery, "Sometimes the chains of marriage are so heavy that they must be carried by three", but they are boring, wooden and dated, they describe this film with greater precision. The plot itself, an autobiography with Sanders as a gentle jewelry thief, Francois Eugene Vidocq, who becomes police chief but can barely resist the appeal of fine jewelry, is entertaining enough, but has the same kind of Hollow Hollywood historical treatment that marred Epics of the time like * Marie Antoinette *, and certainly the deplorable * Forever Amber * (which screams for a new version with class). Although, in his defense, Sanders tries to forcefully add some depth to his character, it is useless. I'm a Douglas Sirk fan, but this is from 1946, and it's one of Sirk's first American efforts, lacking many of the distinctive touches that would define his florid and bulky potboilers. Sirk is getting his feet wet here, and he made a number of unmemorable films in the next ten years until he reached the gold with * Magnificent Obsession *, and hit his step, bombarding us with estrogen festivals like * All That Heaven Allows * , * Written in the wind *, and * Imitation of life *. But is the scandal in Paris not his best work? a matter of relatively low budget with cheese sets and ineffective costumes.
