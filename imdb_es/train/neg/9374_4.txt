This documentary is at its best when it simply shows the offices of the Ayurvedic healers and the preparation of the treatment. There is no denying the poverty of India and the desperation of its richest clients. However, as an argument of Ayurvedic medicine in general, this film fails miserably. Although Indian clients mention having seen "allopathic" doctors, they are not interviewed, and we have to take vague statements from their patients at a nominal value: "the doctor said there was no cure", "the doctor said it was cancer" . "etc. Well," there is no cure "does not mean" there is no treatment "and what type of cancer does the patient have? The film is weaker when it shows Ayurvedic practice in the United States. to the suggestive suggestion that having a high-powered job on Wall Street can make your stomach ache.
