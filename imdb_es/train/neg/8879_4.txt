I think Cliff Robertson was certainly one of our best actors. He has a half dozen classics for his credit. It does well here as heavy, but the direction is so bad and the pace so tired that it never leaves the mark. The story starts well, although I wonder how he could count on his wife to hang up. Still, he does the cups right and carries things. The death sentence is double. First, if we took the amount of time that the characters spend walking from one room to another or from one part of the house to another, they would eat about a third of the movie. Add to that, Robertson's character sitting on the bed in the blue light, looking confused, could add another part. I agree with those who said that a shorter half hour would have turned it into a fairly decent, if insignificant, movie. The greatest weakness is only a complicated plot that, when all is said and done, leaves incredible questions. I'm not putting spoilers, but when it's over, do not think too much. I can get to ten what happens if I do not sweat. It would have been better if it had been a ghost story.
