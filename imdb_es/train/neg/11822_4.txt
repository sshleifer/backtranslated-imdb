I thought of Harvey Keitel, a young newcomer of the Sex Pistols John Lydon, and then as an extra, the music of Ennio Morricone. I was waiting for an avant-garde Italian police thriller made in the United States. Istead, I received a story that did not make sense and a movie that left me saying: WTF !!! Too many unanswered questions, and there is not enough action. The result: a classic cult potential was flushed down the toilet. Keitel and Lydon work well together, so maybe Quentin Tarantino can bring these guys together with a better script. Oh, and Morricone's score: it's fine, but it's not memorable. <br /> <br /> In general, it is not a waste of time, but it is not a "must see", unless you are a Keitel fanatic.
