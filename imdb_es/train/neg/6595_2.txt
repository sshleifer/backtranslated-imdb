I put this movie in the hotel room to entertain my children the morning we were going home, because I had kept all their toys. (Young children do not like to see "Regis and KAthie Lee" or "The View.") My four-year-old daughter found a scene funny, but she told me that the rest was "too silly". This is a FOUR YEARS, folks. Any person older than, say, nine will want to kill their television instead of letting it play. <br /> <br /> To say that this movie is bad is like saying that the Holocaust was a small mistake. There are no words to say how ridiculous and absolutely terrible this "movie" really is. The acting is bad, the plot is stupid and the script is pathetically not funny. Since this is supposed to be a comedy, the fact that you can not even laugh at the badness of the movie makes it even worse. Bronson "Balki" Pinchot is the worst with some strange false accent (Irish-Pakistani-Bronx-Cockney-Cajun from what I could see), but all the characters are horrible. I have not seen a real movie of Laurel and Hardy in years, but I know that they had to be much better than this. What's the point of ruining a classic comic duo with ... this? <br /> <br /> In a nutshell: derived garbage. Avoid at all costs unless you have some strange Bronson Pinchot fetish. 2/10
