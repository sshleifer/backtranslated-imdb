For months I've heard about this little movie and now I've seen it. I find it cute, cute how so many incipient directors make films where they combine the creative ideas of other people to create their own premise of a movie. Troops, Swingblade, any of the millions of Blair Witch parodies come to mind. If all these directors want is to put a foot inside the Hollywood door, then they are doing the right thing and they should stay that way because the combination of plot schemes is how Hollywood makes films. How many times have you heard the phrase "Is that the House of Animals is back to the future"; "It's Wall Street meets the Dead Poet Society"; or "Shakespeare in Love meets Star Wars"? I remember when independent films meant original and daring, unsafe and predictable.
