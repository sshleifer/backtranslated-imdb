I saw one evening on the cable this afternoon. At that time I did not know that the girl listed as "Shannon Wilsey" was actually the porn star Savannah, but she was so beautiful (and stripped so often, thank God) that, in fact, I sat through this nonsense that my brain was rotting. I like corny movies as much as the next guy, more than the next guy, actually, but this was much more than corny and more rancid. The really annoying exaggeration on the part of the mad scientist and the almost total incompetence of the director's people, writers and special effects detracts from the gratuitous nudity that is the only saving grace of the film. Savannah, before becoming the plasticized Barbie Doll, became a porn queen, it's really interesting to see: she's absolutely beautiful, she bursts into uncontrollable giggles sometimes, looks off camera and laughs and, in general, seems to be having a really good moment, which is more than what can be said for the audience. Even though Savannah and her colleagues spend a good portion of this nude image, she still can not hide the fact that this is an incredibly stupid, ill-made and annoying movie. If you know someone who has it in the video, or if it comes by cable one night, verify it, but do not waste your money on a rental.
