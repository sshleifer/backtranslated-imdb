The name (Frau) of the main character is the German word for "Woman". I do not know if that was intentional or not, but it was sure that there were some giggles from the German audience at the Fantastic Film Festival last year, when it was shown. <br /> <br /> But those were the only laughs that occurred. the movie has not it was a laugh, it's a horrible movie for the love of God! A horrible movie in more than one meaning. It is a pity that a premise like that would be wasted with horrible moments even unbearable for the spectator (definitely not for the weak of Heart!)! And it was not even necessary to show all the things that are shown. I do not even get into a moral obligation (because movies do not really have that kind of task or function) discussion of what is shown here, but this is a new minimum in the whole "torture movement" that has grown in the world . the last years!
