As I'm not a fan of blood and guts, I found that bloody scenes are totally unnecessary (you spell it) and too real for my taste, if you're the kind of person who pounces on beheadings on the Internet or in movies snuff. For example, I think that the type of person dreams of this disease. <br /> <br /> Besides having the potential to be a great movie, the music was also first class (through the film and especially the final credits). However, some parts were a bit unbelievable, as if I had just met your girlfriend trusting in the wait for torture and death and all you do is tell her what happened and how you got there (why did not you ask her if Did he happen to have wipes or even an air freshener or chewing gum while he was in it?), Come on, most probably just yell "Hurry up and unravel me later, let me get out of here, FAST!" Where were the flies, the worms, etc., and when the girl accidentally ran into the place, surely the stench of rotten flesh would have sounded some alarm bells? I would only recommend this film to the friends of Dennis Niellson and the like, I am sure that a video like this would make the sick in this way have a happy Christmas.
