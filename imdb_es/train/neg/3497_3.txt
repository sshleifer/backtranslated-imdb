Unfortunately for Sarah Silverman, this program does not complement it at all. The character is not even remotely nice and it is not a situation where you think "oh she is such an ib * tch that I love her" only that "she is so ab * tch". This character is simply an old just, fair, b * tch. Sarah seems to have a hard time carrying this show because she is the only semi funny in it. The mood, the dialogue is so boring and dry, it's like listening to your grandfather continue and continue talking about the marbles he collected as a child. <br /> <br /> The Sarah Silverman Program is so incredibly boring that I was thinking about changing the channel to see old replays of Married with children. that's funny because the characters are so "immoral" and "rude". I'm sorry, but I can not find a show full of dry and cheesy humor on the wall. Stories about some angry, bitter, lost, angry, bitter life with their annoying as hell sister and gay friends who sound like Keanu Reeves with a cold anywhere near very funny. I can not stand this program, although in general it seems to me that Sarah Silverman says that "I love her because she is a very good character", as in School Of Rock, and most of them stand up. I think this program is boring with characters who think they are bad and say and do things because of their shock value, for example. the constant pube, the diarrhea and the $ hit in general to laugh. The Sarah Silverman program tries to be fun and fails, or you need a laugh track or better writers. Someone compared it to South Park, but it's not even close. I expressed my opinions about the Sarah Silverman Program and will not become an annoying troll, which means that you will not see me as a fan and constantly posting things like "This show stinks" and "Why has not this been canceled yet? " like Sarah Silverman's program if you enjoy it.
