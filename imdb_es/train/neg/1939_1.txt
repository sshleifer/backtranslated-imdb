Come on! Finish with the assault boys of Pakistan. Bollywood can not only make brilliant films, but it can also seriously affect a generation of viewers. <br /> <br /> I'm a HUGE Bollywood fan, but anti-Pakistani films only make me shudder too much to enjoy screenplay, cinematography, action sequences - everything. <br /> <br /> I am very happy to see that viewers on both sides of the border reject propaganda, and there are films like Main Hoon Na that have been done brilliantly, not only because they deserve due to the quality of His Bollywood masala, but also because he tries to say: give peace a chance and shows that there are crazy people on both sides who do not represent the masses.
