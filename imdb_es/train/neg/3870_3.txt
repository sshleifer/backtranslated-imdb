Beneath the dense green glop of the computer graphics, the amazing art and skill of Ichikawa Somegoro shone. Unfortunately: it was lost in all the goo. The scenes of the Old Edo, with the courtesan, drifting from the Sumida, rehearsing and performing at the Nakamura-za, were exciting and attractive, and brought you back to an interesting and rich era. The action on the Kabuki stage, in which Somegoro stands out and excites, was more enriching than any of the absurd nonsense that followed. The skill, the energy in the audience, the colors of the sets, were much more satisfactory than all the nonsense that took over the plot and the performance. What a lost opportunity! One of the best kabuki actors in the world, and lost in the dredge.
