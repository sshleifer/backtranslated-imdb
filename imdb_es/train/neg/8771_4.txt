OK, I got bored and decided to watch this movie. But I think the main thing that brought down this movie was that there would be an hour of recording, basically that same time repeated 4 times. It consists of 1. Gathering the troops and discussing the plan of attack, 2. Flashbacks to the wives of the men 3. Approaching the troops in a long line 4. Men running uphill and firing, usually the first one receives shot in the head then 3 other men rescue him. 5. Defeat the enemy and call the base to count success. 6. Men returning the flash to the wives and singing 10-minute songs. That was the basic movie, and that same order of events happened about 4 or 5 times. and every time he did a flashback to the wives, he showed the man, then his wife and him. There were about 10 men or more who would have a flashback, so this took a long time. Apart from that, men could not kill their enemies except with bayonets or grenades. I liked the music and there was a lot of action, although the action was repetitive. In general, I probably would not see it again, but it was not too horrible.
