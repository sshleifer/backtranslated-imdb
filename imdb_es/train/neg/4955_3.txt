In light of the recent and quite good Batman the Brave and the Bold, now is the time to strike a fatal blow to that error in Batman's life. Being a big fan since the first revival of Tim Burton 20 years ago, I have been able to accept different tonalities in the character, dark or campy. This is simply not credible: too many effects, bad intrigues and very few questions. The good thing about Batman is the diversity of his abilities and aspects of his personality: detective, crime fighter, playboy, philanthropist, etc. The Batman shows him only in his karate days. And, by the way, how is it that the Penguin is capable of such virtuosity when it jumps in the air regardless of its corpulent bulk? And look at the Joker, a mix of Blanka in Street Fighter 2 and a stereotyped reggae man, what fan of Batman could accept such betrayal? I do not anyway. Batman is much better without the "El" article in front of his name.
