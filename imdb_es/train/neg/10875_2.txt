I saw this 'movie' recently and I have to say that it was the worst attempt to make movies that I had the misfortune to see. What the hell was going on with Coolio? Shooting totally provoked to people in distress. Completely non-enveloping, slow, tedious and distant. Worse than Spawn. Long live "Evil dead II".
