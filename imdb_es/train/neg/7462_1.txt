The address should be the problem here. Recently I heard John Cleese talk about working on a sketch for Fawlty Towers. He was supposed to attack his car with a branch. The first branch was too fragile and not funny. The second branch was too rigid to be funny. The third was weak enough to be fun. This type of attention to detail is missing in "Corky Romano". No matter how embarrassingly funny it was a bit funny, it was not fixed and it was not left on the floor of the cutting room. The only value I can find in this movie is like a study of a very flawed movie that somehow escaped the distribution without being repaired. <br /> <br /> I have scanned dozens of other reviews here. The amount of comments that praise this absolute loss of time reinforces my suspicion that some people are paid to promote titles. I can not understand how anyone over 9 years old could qualify this title more than a 4, MAX. I mean, come on, 5 is average. I can not imagine anyone, even those who make money with this, even rating it as average. <br /> <br /> This makes my list of the 10 worst movies of all time. And, hey, I LIKE THE Three Stooges and I can even tolerate Ed Wood!
