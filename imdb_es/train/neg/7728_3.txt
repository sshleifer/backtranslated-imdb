.... this mini does not improve with age. I saw this and it is the sequel when it was originally broadcast, and like many others, it was astonished. At the beginning of 2002 I borrowed the novels for WOW and W and R and I was even more impressed. Then I decided that I had to go back and watch both of them and I invested $ 200 more in the DVD sets. I saw the two minis again with painful detail and I realized that I had done things the other way around. I should have bought the novels and borrowed the DVDs. <br /> <br /> Do not you think it's abominable? Read the novels and see for yourself. Do not you think this is dated? Look at someone who is not old enough to have seen it originally and see the reaction you get (warning: the reactions of these people range from looks of horror to laughter). <br /> <br /> According to the question and answer section for this mini - Dan Curtis himself chose Ali MacGraw and Robert Mitchum. Oh! Quality of production, music, dialogues, a great story became a telenovela in the late 70s by an overly ambitious producer / director who was far from his head. This thing was dated at the time it was completed. <br /> <br /> These two minis were great in the original broadcast and for those of us who saw them, we pulled a nostalgic string that reminds us of the younger days. In my opinion, this mini is not up to its reputation and seriously disappoints.
