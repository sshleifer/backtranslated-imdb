I do not know what the Oscar voters saw in this movie, but they must have seen some pretty difficult things to see in order to reward her with the Oscar for the best movie. All I know is that, fortunately, Gene Kelly was playing in it or it would have been twice as bad as I think. First of all, I do not think that Leslie Caron was really adequate to play that role. She is not so talented, she is not a great dancer and she does not look good at all. It is a pity that an actor or actress could ruin a film as if it were playing it, because if Leslie Caron had not been in this, it could have been a fantastic movie. The story was intelligent, the direction was not bad and, as I said, Gene Kelly was pretty good. Now I'm not saying all these things about Leslie Caron just to criticize her, I'm just saying it because I think that's the worst part of the movie. She is probably a good actress, but I can not say it because I have not seen her in anything else, but I think she was pretty bad in "An American in Paris". So if you want to see it, go ahead, but I tell you that you'll be better off watching "Singing in the rain".
