Ram Gopal Verma has proven to be a very innovative and competent director. He had done a remake / reworking of the Godfather with Sarkar, and it had tremendous success. The same for Lolita, who did as Nishaabd. <br /> <br /> Sholay is the film that, repeatedly, says that it has inspired the most. Unfortunately, he managed to make a disappointing and boring new version. <br /> <br /> The performance varied from decent to very good, with Amitabh Bachchan suitably threatening as the villain Babban. <br /> <br /> The songs were horrible and forgettable. The song Mehbooba Mehbooba became a second-rate music video. <br /> <br /> The worst part was the rhythm and the dialogues, which were forgettable. <br /> <br /> Watching the movie in a theater, I found myself waiting for the intermission, and then the ending. Some spectators were prudent not to wait and watched them leave throughout the film. Ultimately, one of the worst movies made by Ram Gopal Verma.
