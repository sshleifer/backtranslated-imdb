I had numerous problems with this movie. <br /> <br /> It contains basic objective information about quantum mechanics, which is fine. Although quantum physics has existed for more than 50 years, the film presents this information in a grandiose way that seems to say: "You have not been carried away by this!" Well, not really. These are no longer devastating revelations of the earth. In any case, he was already familiar with quantum theory, and the fact that particles must be described by wave equations, etc. It is not new. <br /> <br /> The main problem I have with this movie, however, is the way these people use quantum theory as a way to provide a scientific basis for mysticism and spiritualism. I have no serious problem with mysticism and spiritualism, but quantum mechanics has nothing to do with these things, and must be kept separate. The people who interviewed for this movie start with the ideas of quantum theory and then jump to say that simply thinking about something can alter the issue that surrounds us, therefore, we must think positively to have a positive impact on the world. and improve our lives. The reasoning is completely ridiculous and the conclusions do not follow logically from the quantum theory. For every so-called "expert" they interviewed for this film, there are dozens of theoretical physicists who would completely disagree. They point out, quite rightly, that the unpredictability of the subatomic world does not support mystical notions of our spiritual connection. <br /> <br /> It bothers me that people go to see this movie and eat it completely. up because it leaves them with a pleasant positive feeling. The main objective of the film is based on a total misunderstanding of quantum theory, and is as bad in its reasoning as in any attempt to justify an organized religion with similar pseudoscientific arguments. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie. <br /> <br /> Oh yes. At one point, one of the "experts" says that since throughout history most of the assumptions that people made about the world turned out to be false, therefore, the assumptions that we currently hold about the world also They are probably false. Eh That totally does not follow. And even if he did, I do not see how that helps his argument. I mean, if his ideas ever became common assumptions, I suppose we would have to assume that they are also false, based on his own reasoning.
