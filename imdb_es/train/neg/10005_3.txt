The second attempt of a New York intellectual in less than 10 years to make a "Swedish" film, being the first the "Brother Carl" of Susan Sontag (which was made in Sweden, with Swedish actors, nothing less!) The results ? Oscar Wilde said it best, referring to "The Old Curiosity Shop" by Dickens: "One would have to have a heart of stone to not laugh out loud at the death of Little Nell". More or less the same here. "Interiors" is full of solemnly toned howlers. ("I'm afraid of my anger." Looking into the middle distance: "I do not like who I'm becoming"). The quotes of the director (to use a courteous term) of Bergman are close to parody. The incredibly selfish family keeps reminding us how brilliant and talented they are, to the point of strangulation. ("I read a poem of yours the other day, I was in - I do not know - The New Yorker." "Oh, that was an old poem, I rewrote it.") Far from not caring about these people, however, I found them quite hilarious. Much of the dialogue is exactly like the funny things in Allen's previous films, only that he directs his actors to interpret the straight lines. By not casting himself in the film, he has poor Mary Beth Hurt copying all her theatrical tics, intonations and neurotic habits, making her a shameful substitute (like Kenneth Branagh in "Celebrity"). <br /> <br /> The basic plot - dysfunctional family with a quietly dominant mother - seems to have risen more or less from Bergman's "Winter Light", the basic family melodrama traded with a lot of existential angst. Everything appears in the visual / auditory tricks: the deafening scratch of a pencil on paper, the imposing waves that dwarf people walking on the beach. etc etc. <br /> <br /> Allen's later "serious" films are less embarrassing, but also much less entertaining. I'm going to take "interiors." Woody rarely made a movie more fun.
