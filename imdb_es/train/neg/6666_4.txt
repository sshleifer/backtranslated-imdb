I really wanted to like this movie, but the story is ridiculous. I do not want to ruin this movie, do not worry from the beginning, you know something bad is going to happen, but here is an example of how careless this movie was. The cowboy and the "twig" climb the ridge. The cowboy has a handlebar mustache. The Cowboy and "Twig" are thrown and dispute halfway on the ridge. The cowboy is clean-shaven for the rest of the movie. At some point between the shooting and the trip down the mountain, the cowboy had time to shave, in the dark, on the back of a horse. <br /> <br /> To be fair, the performance of the four main characters is solid.
