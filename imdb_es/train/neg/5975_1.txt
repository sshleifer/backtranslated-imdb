I never wanted to see this movie; then, one day, by a joke I saw her to see how bad it was; My preconceived ideas were confirmed. <br /> <br /> To begin with, I would like to question the politics of the film. It hides behind the mask of women "making big in the city", but the only way women can do great is by using their sexuality instead of their intelligence or skills. These women are nothing but whores. Can not a little less attractive girls succeed? This is not the only right message in the movie, there are hundreds of shots of American flags and huge bundles of cash. A good example of how the only powerful thing in the United States is capitalism and anything of spiritual, moral or artistic value is not even given a look at this movie. Money is described as the only important thing for young people. <br /> <br /> The director of the bar says that she does not allow drug users to enter her bar, and then she goes to the poor liters of strong liquor in her bar. Neck itself and then the necks of your staff and clients. Anyone who knows anything about intoxicants will know that liquor can be as dangerous as heroin and more dangerous than most illegal drugs. <br /> <br /> And finally, why are there scenes in which the main character is a sexual meeting point? interest for the audience (when she is undressing or with her boyfriend) is her father always involved? We watch her being naked with the camera, virtually caressing her legs, while she is the phone for her father. She "auctions" her father as well as "auctions" her boyfriend. I find this very strange. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this film is immoral, fascist, demeaning to women and, frankly, disturbing. But what more do you expect from Jerry Bruckhiemer?
