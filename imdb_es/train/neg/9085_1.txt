One of the worst movies I've seen in my life. Acting was terrible, both for children and adults. Most of all the characters showed no, little or little emotion. The lighting was terrible, and there were too many problems with the time of day when the film was shot (at the river scene where his boat is destroyed, there are 4 shots, the sheriff and dad at night in his boat, Jillian and Molly they swim at night, the rest of the children for the day * when it is supposed that at night * on the riverbank, and the doctor, Beatrice and Simonton at night but not at night come down from their boat.) The best performance in the movie was probably that of the sheriff, Cappy (Although, there is a slip of character when the pulse detector * Whatever it is when people die, it sounds * sounds like Cappy has died, still moves while still can be you will hear a beep, and while the nurse checks your pulse manually, then shows your pulse again, and THEN finally dies, I guess it will not be perfect, since it is an independent film, but it could still be better. see, honestly, even for children. You can also see something good, like The Lion King or Toy Story if you're going to see something you'll remember.
