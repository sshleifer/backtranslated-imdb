There are no spoilers in this review. There is nothing to ruin. <br /> <br /> No plot, nothing; most of the videos show at least trying to join the clips in the plot with a faint stretch, but this did not even do that. Clips, three lines to take to the next endless sequence of boring clips ... Well, maybe they lacked production time, but they would have been better skipping this episode altogether. What a waste of time. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure how this was done, in fact. The bushes are usually much better for subverting tropes, but somehow this was achieved ... Thank God they got back in shape in the next episode.
