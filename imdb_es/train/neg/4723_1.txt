First of all, I apologize for my English. <br /> <br /> Everyone in the ex-Yugoslavia who is not an extreme Serbian radical will agree with me. This film shows the Serbian side, and only the Serbian side. The Serbian crimes were not represented. Fortunately, everyone can see that this movie was made by Serbs, so there is no neutrality. All the "professionals" that were interviewed are not professionals at all. A man only read a book written by a Serbian radical, the other is genocide, denier, etc., etc. <br /> <br /> Even the Slovenians were accused in this movie. And the whole war in Slovenia lasted a few days, and only because the Slovenians were lucky. There were not many Serbs in Slovenia, and YNA could not get to Slovenia through Croatia (after the Croatia-Serbia war began). All Slovenians are outraged by all the accusations in this film. <br /> <br /> Every reasonable Croatian will agree with one thing: independence was too soon. Maybe all major conflicts could be avoided. However, mentioning World War II and some unrelated things was a truly pathetic attempt to justify everything. Just imagine the Japanese throwing nuclear bombs at Seattle and Washington, and saying that was justified by Hiroshima and Nagasaki. You will not find evidence of a strangled YNA soldier and of Serbian civilians killed near Vukovar. But you can find the tape with a reporter who comments that his claims about Serbian civilians near Vukovar were lies. All over the internet. And the director forgot to mention all the bombing of Vukovar by YNA (now on the Serbian side and Montenegro and 100% full of Serbs and Montenegrins) And let's not start with the Chetnik movement. At first, it was simply a resistance movement. But the director somehow forgot to mention the collaboration with the Nazis, including Ustashe, the ethnic cleansing and the fight against the Yugoslav supporters. There are thousands of other things, but all can be easily verified. There are many deceptive things in this movie. Only some of the accusations are true. Every Croatian is outraged by this movie. <br /> <br /> I do not think I need to mention the denial of the Srebrenica genocide, the genocide that has too much evidence. Imagine the film about the denial of the holocaust. This movie is the same. And according to this film, the Bosnian Muslims in Sarajevo bombed themselves. Every Bosnian Muslim is outraged by this movie. <br /> <br /> Somehow, the director forgot to mention the brief occupation of a small piece of Macedonian land (FYROM) by the Serbs. <br /> <br /> Croats, Slovenes, Bosnians and Macedonians never entered the Serbian borders. If you are not Serbian and you really started to believe some things about this movie, you should know that the Serbs have some kind of propaganda that Croats, Bosnian Muslims and Macedonians are actually Serbs who invented their story. Then ... <br /> <br /> Even 50% of Serbs will say that this film is extreme and pro-Serbian. <br /> <br /> And the Serbian radicals are very, very satisfied with this film (there are approximately 40% of Serbs voting for radicals). <br /> <br /> I think everyone understands my points here. In this documentary call there is very little truth, and my advice for all is: find out before watching this movie. After that, you will only laugh at all the pathetic accusations. <br /> <br /> Watch real and neutral documentaries about the death of Yugoslavia.
