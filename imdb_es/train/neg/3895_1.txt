Once, some evil people made a movie about a guy who was shot in space, supposedly to go to Saturn, but really only to some flash images of solar flares, and then the nose is bled, and before that you realize, He is lying in a hospital, bandaged from head to toe, and then an overweight nurse and a uniform that does not fit, goes in and is devoured by the guy, who is supposed to be melting everywhere but it seems that it never loses mass, and then NASA, or at least one guy at NASA, gets mad about it and calls another to look for it, but the guy they sent to hunt the one that melts has go home and have the soup first, and his wife oddly forgot the cookies, so he can not have cookies, and then he has to go out and find the boy who is melting with a geiger counter, and that it really does not work, so it really just keeps the trail of the half-eaten corpses, and then there's something about a sheriff, and two ugly old men in a lemon tree, and a woman with a meat cleaver, some kind of industrial plant with happy security guards, and how not I can tell you how the movie ends, all I can say is that Jonathan Demme is somewhere with a guy with the stupid name of Burr DeBenning, and if there is justice in the world, everyone who interacted with this movie had a death horrible and violent and could not make more movies, and the world lived HAPPY AFTER THE END!
