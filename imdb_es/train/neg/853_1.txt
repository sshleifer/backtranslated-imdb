Ok, I honestly do not see why everyone thinks this is so good. It really is not. There were two good things that came out of this movie 1. The performance of Jack, he was very good, I can tilt my hat for him. 2. Danny's performance was good. There is no other that has become quite stupid. And what was Stanley Kubrick thinking about recruiting Shelly as Wendy? She was so bad She looked the same every time she got scared. The problem with this movie was the end. I would have had more respect for it if Kubrick had finished it differently. And, the movie especially was stupid. The problem with the movie is that the book was much better. So do not watch the movie read the book and you'll be much better. 3/10.
