I watched this movie in a pre-release screening at the Writers Guild Theater in Beverly Hills. As I recall, the producers and the director of the film attended, presumably to evaluate our reaction. <br /> <br /> Many scenes provoked laughter from the audience, which would have been fine if it had been a comedy, but it was supposed to be a horror movie. <br /> <br /> If the audience was not scared, it seems that the filmmakers were. They delayed the launch for more than a year. Out of curiosity I saw him again to see if they cut it; As far as I can tell, they had not. It was the same bad movie, just a year older. <br /> <br /> It almost qualifies as "so bad, it's good", but it's slow and boring.
