As others have said, "No, Luciano" is a title or a more appropriate response to this movie title. For entertainment, the great opera singer should devote himself to singing ... not that he is a terrible actor. It's just that this movie sucks. <br /> <br /> The first 25 minutes were good, a good family movie, but after that it's just a boring soap opera. <br /> <br /> When interpreting a singer properly, Pavarotti, like "Giorgio Fini", loses his voice a few times and the doctor, "Pamela Taylor" (Kathryn Harrold) comes to the rescue. Then, the singer falls in love with the doctor, the doctor falls slowly in love with the singer, the two argue all the time, and so on. <br /> <br /> Pavarotti has a winning smile and is a nice guy. It is Harrold who spoils things and after seeing her here, it does not surprise me that she has not become a star. <br /> <br /> There are good landscapes in the film to enjoy, good photos of San Francisco and Italy, at least in the first half of the film. I got bored and I do not remember much of the second half.
