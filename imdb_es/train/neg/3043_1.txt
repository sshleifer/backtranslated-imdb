This movie is supposed to be a "happy" story about Santa Claus and his "magical and mystical" wonders. But instead, it becomes downright creepy. Two things in this movie that stand out in my mind as horrible are 1) the appearance of Santa Claus. Have you ever seen Santa Claus look more horrible? and 2) the "evil representative of Satan", the simple and strange dances of Pitch are simply disgusting to watch. Just watch this movie if it's the MSTed version or if you like to laugh a lot. I can not believe that this is a movie for children.
