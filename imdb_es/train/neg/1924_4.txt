DR. SEUSS 'HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS / (2000) ** (out of 4) <br /> <br /> If you want to see a holiday movie that will inspire your seasonal spirits and continue with the traditional classic fable of Dr. Seuss: no I see "Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch stole Christmas." If you are old enough to read this review, you are probably too old to enjoy this moving image. It contains a large number of colors, a creative production design and an imaginative creation of costumes and costumes, joyful charging noises, and the characters are made to resemble the real inhabitants of the fictitious village of Whoville. Unfortunately that's where the positive elements of the movie end; the rest of the production is just an excuse for Jim Carrey to laugh on the screen while smiling devilishly, all while pouncing on the script too broad without much to do. <br /> <br /> Many people recognize the story of how the grinch stole Christmas from Whoville, so I will not waste my time writing a detailed synopsis to read it. However, I will say that the story of the film is executed in three main acts; the development of the grinch and the stage, the Whoville festival and Dr. Seuss' vision of the media robbing the Who's of his Christmas. There are many familiar names within the credits here, but there are no familiar faces. As in "Battlefield Earth," I do not understand why producers would hire expensive actors so that their identities are protected by unrecognizable makeup and costumes. In any case, there is SNL's Molly Shannon as Betty Lou, the wife of Bill Irwin, who later played Lou Lou, the father of little Cindy Lou, played by Taylor Momsen. Jeffrey Tambor is the mayor of Whoville, Anthony Hopkins lends his voice bellowing to the narrator of the film, and Christine Baranski is the only lost lover of Grinch. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers try to bring originality to the story by adding unnecessary subplots and focusing too much on little Cindy Lou. The script by Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman seems to go everywhere through the film scene; There is little or no approach from director Ron Howard and the script is predictable, too extensive and elaborate. The only character that is distinguished here is Grinch himself, all the other characters are puppets of the plot, without form and without interest. And the dialogue is too enthusiastic and too cheesy to be anything but pathetic. Example-Grinch: Oh, manliness! <br /> <br /> Redemption factors for the film are in the hands of talented production designer Michael Corenblith, costume designer Rita Ryack and the extensive makeup department. "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" is a very attractive production. The scenarios and the atmosphere created by the filmmakers are detailed and imaginative; It is as if the public were visiting a world like in a dream. The people of Whoville are plastered with makeup, to the point where we can not tell the actor that he recites the lines without humor. Although dazzling, I really can not give credit to the performances, since they have supervised them because the expensive technical department takes its place. <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey is an actor I can talk about. His performance is what almost destroyed the movie. He is too selfish as the Grinch, too exaggerated and comical to allow history to be recognizable as Seuss's work. Surprisingly, although there are some funny moments due to some cleverly clever sequences, there is no laughter from Jim Carry's foolishness. It's almost as if the film was written specifically for Carry to exaggerate her part. This factor only takes the film to a wild but brainless comedy, which is only a pale shadow of the original Christmas classic "How the Grinch Stole Christmas." <br /> <br /> After this film, historians should check the coffin of the late author, Dr. Seuss may have dumped himself in his grave. <br /> <br />
