I read the novel Reaper by Ben Mezrich a few years ago and last night I accidentally went to see this adaptation. <br /> <br /> Although it's been years since I read the story for the first time, the differences between the novel and the film are enormous. Very important elements, which made everything plausible, are simply written or changed to bad. <br /> <br /> If the plot seems interesting: go and get the novel. It is much, much, much better. <br /> <br /> Still 4 out of 10, since it was difficult to stop looking because of the great basic plot of Ben Mezrich.
