This movie is one of my favorites. It really is not good, but it's good to laugh. The dialogue can become incredibly ridiculous and of bad performance (for example, "Manji, can we ask you some questions?" "Sure." "We think you can help us with the answers.") Any struggle is more or less surreal. Be sure to watch out for Brock, the white guy who attacks the main characters. He only has two lines, but he's one of the best guys in the movie!
