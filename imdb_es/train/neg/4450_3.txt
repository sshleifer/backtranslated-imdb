Julia Roberts obviously makes a concerted effort to get rid of her Pretty Cotton Woman character with this spurious spousal abuse thriller, but it's hard to imagine that she would end up presenting such a powerful and compelling (and Oscar-winning) performance as she did in Erin Brokovich based on the back of this garbage. And do not worry, it's nothing more than a Julia Roberts vehicle, but unfortunately, its performance is not the most lackluster. <br /> <br /> The plot has all the marks of a night made. by cable, and do not have the impression that it will offer information about the dark world of domestic abuse, since none of the characters is sufficiently sketched for you to really worry. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, disappointing and unsatisfying, without the name of Roberts on top of the title, I'm sure he would have totally, deservedly failed.
