This movie is really bad, so bad that even Christopher Lee can not save it. A poor story, an even poorer script and a bad direction make this a truly exceptional horror movie, the remarkable part is that it is the only horror movie I can honestly say that I would never see again. This garbage makes Plan 9 from outer space look like Oscar material.
