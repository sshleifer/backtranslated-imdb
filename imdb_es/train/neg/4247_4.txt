A painfully prolonged, maudlin and predictable drama, my twenty-fifth film by Sidney Lumet, Garbo Talks, is rushing into the low quality end of my search. <br /> <br /> The film documents a harried young worker named Gilbert (Ron Silver), who is the son of Estelle Rolle (Anne Bancroft), eccentric, a fighter and, above all, an obsessive fan of Greta Garbo. When Estelle is affected by a brain tumor, her son decides to undertake an obsessive search on his own: to track Greta Garbo and take her with her mother. <br /> <br /> Anne Bancroft is in full swing, Chew-the-scenery, Aunt-Mame mode here, that kind of fighting fighter who loves the movie, where she talks to people, defends her ideals and He ends up in jail all the time. She stands outside the film as an obvious artificial construction, and every scene with her is yuk-yuk lame; Every false eye-catching note. The rest of the characters are equally one-dimensional, but tremendously less interesting. Ron Silver is as flat as he can be, and his love triangle attempt is as telegraphed as anything else in the movie: he's dating Lisa Rolfe (Carrie Fisher), but falls in love with his co-worker Jane Mortimer (Catherine Hicks) , and I called each scene three scenes before they happen. <br /> <br /> That's the other problem. One-dimensional characters can survive if placed in a fascinating and captivating story, but there is simply nothing here. The rhythm of the film is glacial, resplendent with strange material that does not strengthen anything, and when the film begins to follow a linear plot, it is both laborious and uninteresting. There are many guest stars, so to speak, including Harvey Fierstein as a gay New Yorker (imagine that) in another highly inessential scene. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, try to reach the middle. Decent statement about the nature of idolatry and its role in our lives, but at that time, none of the characters exist as real people, and the film had bored me in submission, so it works as a case of very little, too late The film is my twenty-fifth film directed by Lumet, which easily makes it my most-watched director, but, aside from a couple of extravagant faults (a stranger among us, someone?), he has not listened to the depths painfully Uninteresting of Garbo Talks. <br /> <br /> {Grade: 4.5 / 10 (C / C-) / # 21 (of 24) from 1984 / # 23 of 25 films Lumet)
