Just because an event really happened does not mean it will be a good script / movie. The Cat's Meow, by Peter Bogdanovich, is based on real events that happened on a cruise organized by William Randolph Hurst. The writer paid more attention to creating a cast of strange characters than taking the time to create a story for the strange characters to inhabit. The key moments of the story seem implausible; for example, when Hurst accidentally shoots the producer, believing that he is Chaplin. Basing a key element of a story on someone who wears the wrong hat is trivial and artificial. The story tries to be a dark comedy, but The Cat's Meow loses an important part of this equation, the comedy. There is also a lack of empathy for any of the characters. It hardly matters who gets shot, who is killed, who is guilty and who is innocent. There is not a strong character to animate. As a result, conflicts are difficult to deal with and the final result is incidental.
