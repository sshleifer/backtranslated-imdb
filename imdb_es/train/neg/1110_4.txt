One hour, eight minutes and twelve seconds in this movie and I decided that it was quite scarce. That was right after Hopalong (Chris Lybbert) fell on his horse from a tree to join the gang of good guys. I was pretty baffled by the whole trick of Hopalong Cassidy / Great Bar 20 that did not translate into anything at all. Obviously, the Coppola name in the credits could not do anything to guarantee success here, even with more than one on the list. <br /> <br /> If you get to the end of the movie, you'll probably end up asking the same questions that I did. What exactly was the hook with the gloves? What about the rodeo stage? Who was The Stranger supposed to represent? Why did they make this movie? <br /> <br /> I could probably continue but my energy has run out. Look, there's a western called "The Gunfighter" since 1950 with a guy named Gregory Peck as the main character. Seeing him will make you feel as good as seeing him makes you feel bad. That I can recommend.
