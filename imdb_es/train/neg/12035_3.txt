I expected this to be much better. I love the work of Tim Burton, so I was very excited to see these short films online. Well, they were not at all what I expected. <br /> <br /> I do not know what exactly I do not like. I guess they are a bit boring. The sound bothers me, and most of the characters, although I loved Roy the Toxic Boy, and Stainboy. <br /> <br /> The episode of Match Girl probably bothered me more, although it was quite fun. <br /> <br /> I also do not like the way some of the characters die. Like how Match Girl basically set fire to the gas station, or how the Girl Who Stares died in general. Roy's death was fun, surprisingly. Death by a car air freshener. Very original ;-) That made me laugh so much ... <br /> <br /> There are some things that are not appropriate for children. Just a little language and gore. That's all I have to say! 3/10
