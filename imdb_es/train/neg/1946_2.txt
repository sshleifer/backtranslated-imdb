As a mother of 2 young children who, or should I say, have been growing up with the many reincarnations of Scooby, I feel well positioned to comment on the historical and current version of Scooby. <br /> <br /> If as a family we had not seen any episode before Shaggy and Scooby got a clue that we might have enjoyed it as a light caricature on Saturday morning, nothing special. But that is, in essence, the problem that lies in its current format, so lightweight that it will not have the longevity of the "old" Scooby and the gang. I am sure that you can succeed in a quick monetary return, but I am sure that the long-term acceptance of old and young people is in a very real danger of being lost. My 6-year-old son, on seeing the new version, was really upset and without any indication he said that he looked very ill-humored and why he did not look like the last series (Where are you). <br /> <br /> Scrappy Doo was an anomaly, but still infinitely better than this. Hopefully, we'll get it to be appropriate in reference to the producers.
