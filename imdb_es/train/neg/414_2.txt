When you enter this movie, you know that this movie has six lab technicians in a sealed lab with an invisible maniac. So you are immediately guessing who will live and who will die. The survivors end up being exactly what one would expect them to be, so there are no points for plot twists there. <br /> <br /> And if you're not sure it's a B movie or a film that just happens in a lab with an attractive story, William Devane plays a role: the state of the instant B movie. <br /> <br /> The film is promising at first. In the laboratory we are presented with the invisible gorilla that is becoming increasingly violent. Oooh, foreboding. The best scene in the whole movie is when the lab team makes the gorilla visible again. Great special effects. The same thing when they make Bacon invisible. <br /> <br /> There is a pair of naked breasts, a dirty and unconvincing joke and out of place enough to swear that this movie has an R rating that it really did not need. . <br /> <br /> For a thriller there were really no surprises, except when Shue does like MacGyver in the freezer, which is more like a 'Whaaaa?' OK, there is a surprise. That's when Caine (Bacon) returns for the last time in the elevator shaft. It was a surprise, but only because you're screaming on TV, 'Noooo! And you're dead! Finish the movie! Speaking of screaming on television, that's all I did for the last 25 minutes or so. Put on your glasses f # @% ing! Instead of putting on the infrared glasses to see it, try all the tricks of the book (fire extinguishers, sprinkler systems ...). <br /> <br /> The story really got lost in the end. But the special effects were good; That's the only reason why I give it a 2/10.
