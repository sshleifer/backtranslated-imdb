When I went and saw this movie, I had great expectations. But I was wrong. This movie was exactly like all the other horror movies. It is a virus, zombies, etc. Exactly like Resident Evil and many, many other movies. But the difference with this, and other movies, is that the story is very week. They are bad actors and boring music. The picture is fine, but the rest is total shit. Do not watch this "horror" movie, go and see the Ring 2 or any other movie that is much more of a story. I hope they stop making horror movies that have a virus and that the virus spreads and that people become zombies. We've seen enough of that already. The only good thing about the movie is when they are standing on the roof and shooting famous celebrities infected.
