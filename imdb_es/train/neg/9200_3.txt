One wonders how the script was written. <br /> <br /> Wayne and the other performers do a good job, but since it's not a comedy, a romantic thriller or anything else, it's pretty disappointing. <br /> <br /> One feels that if one of the threads had been persecuted, it could have been worth it. However, it is interesting to see a peacock from a story made just before the United States became directly involved in the war. I wonder if the surrounding politics had something to do with trying to make a movie for all tastes but ending with something that does not please anyone. <br /> <br /> However, it has a historical value.
