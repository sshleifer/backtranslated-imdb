Let's say I had to suspend my disbelief less for Spiderman than for the hooligans. I mean, I have less trouble believing that Toby McGuire can stick to the buildings that the one that Elija Wood knocks down in Manchester. I will not go into detail, since I do not want to write a spoiler, but the idea that adult and professional British men have got into the rubbish almost every weekend is, well ... funny. And this movie is not. The struggle, the idea of ​​fighting, is taken too seriously. The seriousness of pugilism, the reverence with which the subject is treated becomes irritating, since neither establishes nor resolves the conflict. It seems that the plot, with holes big enough to drive a Guinness truck, has teamed up with a "fish out of water" theme so viewers can look into Woods' watery eyes as he learns how to become a man . . Hit other soccer youths opposite the likes with blunt objects and then flee as fast as you can. The characters are caricatures, especially the Americans at Harvard. The development of the character and the line of the story are telegraphed to the viewer throughout the image. Unfortunately, the absurdity of the film does not reach its apogee until almost the end, which by then will have already spent almost two hours of his life and will never return. Choose "The Football Factory" or "Fight Club" instead of this cheesy, and disappointing. No time is lost with the empty melodrama, the old and tired "Yankee in the court of King Aurthur," or the tearful parables of the coming of age bullsh * t. They are pure, dark and intelligent fun; The way that violence is supposed to be.
