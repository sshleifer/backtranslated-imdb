Here is the perfect example of what you should not do when you have a great idea. That is the problem is not it? The concept is fresh and full of potential, but the script and its execution lack a real substance. I should catch you from the beginning and then attract a little about your emotions, interest you and invest in the characters. This movie does not have what it takes to take off and keep the flight, and here's why. First, you really do not care about the characters because they do not present themselves in a way that people can relate, I mean this is not Superman or Mission Impossible here, it's supposed to be normal people who are in a stressful situation. They are not credible in the way they act and interact. Example: Jeffrey Combs as a chew policeman is chewing gum, frowning and looking intense all the time is not the way to go here. I mean, what's that? It looks like he's in the bathroom or something. I loved him in the re-animator and the way he played with the intense / neurotic medical genius, unappreciated was right. But not for this, he tries too hard to compensate for being so intense and nervous, but in a still moderate neurotic way, it's not natural, I'm surprised he did not dislocate his jaw during the filming. The movie is basically about life support, it hardly has a pulse and it made me wait for something that would never come.
