I was very surprised to see that this movie had such a good rating, when I reviewed it in IMDb after seeing it. This is really one of the worst movies I've seen and I've seen many bad movies. It seems like a good movie at the beginning, but when he enters the surgery he could not believe how bad it got. This voice-over destroys EVERYTHING! Just imagine that you are being cut like this and then listen to what it says. I saw the movie in German, so I really do not know what it said in English, but ironic things like "Yes, of course, it does not hurt ..." ... what is this? Tell yourself "think about something else" and then forget your pain just thinking about your girlfriend is just ... stupid. And his mother ... how the hell does he realize something like that? Someone comes to tell her, her son died in surgery (what she had to wait for). She also found some letters in Jessica Albas's purse. Besides that "she knows the hospital" ... and then it takes "a second" to understand it? What the hell? ^^ And the end ... why did the police stop them? The patient died in surgery, that's all that happened. That drunken doctor does not know anything else either ... and then they break them all, even the bride? Why??? Despite all that, I think Christensen did a bad job, but that really does not count for me ... those mistakes and the stupid things I wrote about earlier are the problem. I saw this movie with some friends and we were all very disappointed ... As I said, one of the worst movies I've seen ... Just do not see it;)
