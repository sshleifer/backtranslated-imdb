Flat and soulless computer images in less than amazing backgrounds animate a horribly predictable story in this movie. Absolutely nothing takes you by surprise, you can even tell when the voices of Bryan Adams are coming, that they are always at the wrong time. <br /> <br /> The main character, Spirit the horse, is bothered. Voice when it narrates what is happening. However, the narration is not necessary, since everything that happens is really obvious. You can even say what the horses say, although all they do is whinny. Which would be good, but all horses make exactly the same sounds: one to warn, one to regret, one to laugh, etc. There is no variation between the voices of the horses. <br /> <br /> Small children could however, like this movie. It is good enough for a family to sit and watch, and there is little danger of anyone being scared. If you have nothing else to do and want to watch a movie with your children, this is not a bad choice. <br /> <br /> But otherwise, it is not recommended.
