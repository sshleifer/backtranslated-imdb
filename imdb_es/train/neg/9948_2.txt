Ice-T plays Mason, a homeless African American who is hunted by rich hunters (Rutger Hauer, Gary Busey, Charles S. Dutton, F. Murray Abraham, William McNamara and John C. McGinley) however, Mason proves to be a lot harder prey to the usual goals in this ridiculous and slow action creator that takes too long to set up the action scenes and then destroy them completely.
