A hard-to-find movie based on the still-widespread mythology of Senator Joe McCarthy as a political demon. Boyle (like Joe) gives a convincing but historically inaccurate description of the Wisconsin senator, the McCarthy caricature that many consider the real one. Meredith, like the ingenious army lawyer Joseph Welch, who was more astute than McCarthy in the army hearings in 1954, is very good, as always. <br /> <br /> In fact, McCarthy and Cohn were right to worry about the terrible security situation in the Army, and Army audiences in 1954 became entangled in the smoke screen used by the Army to divert the investigation of his security flaws, which the committee was investigating, responding that McCarthy and Cohn were trying to get favors for their staff, David Schine, while he was in the service. <br /> <br /> The film is a content-driven and content-driven polemic, based on the widespread myths that have passed through the truth with many people for decades: that the "red scare" was essentially fake and McCarthy, HUAC , etc., they always attacked the wrong targets, they were just lies, they ruined the publicity, they attacked the constitutional rights of surprised innocent liberals, accused of being security risks / commies. <br /> <br /> People who know little about the subject still feel confident in repeating the misinformation about McCarthy and the "red scare" to this day: Clooney's hagiography Murrow is an example. The misinformation is widespread, it is not surprising that people have swallowed it. A recent objection by Budd Schulberg in the UK's serious left-wing newspaper "The Guardian" led the Hollywood writer to "name names" for McCarthy, perpetuating the lie that McCarthy "investigated" Hollywood as head of HUAC; The truth is that McCarthy was never a member of HUAC and had little interest in Hollywood politics, his research was limited almost exclusively to the weapons of the US government. <br /> <br /> The mythology of "fear" red "is unfounded now is completely exploited by recently opened documents of the Soviet and American government, if McCarthy and his colleagues underestimated the magnitude of the infiltration of Soviets and fellow travelers in the US, but it will be difficult to correct decades of misinformation public about this period. <br /> <br /> One day, maybe a really brave Hollywood soul will make a movie that tells the truth about how many men and women It is Americans who clandestinely helped the mass murderer Stalin and worked to impose his vicious system of governors. In the western world, I give an accurate explanation of Joe McCarthy's career, but I can not stand my breath. Until then, we have this mythical, drunk, liar, scoundrel of the popular imagination, so familiar in the media ... "Tail Gunner Joe."
