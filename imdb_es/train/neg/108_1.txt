Pros: Nothing <br /> <br /> Cons: All <br /> <br /> Plot Summary: A reporter meets a hitchhiker who tells her stories about the deaths of people who were killed by zombies. <Br /> <br /> Review: Never in my life have I found a movie as bad as The Zombie Chronicles. Filmed with a budget of what seems to be about 20 dollars, TZC is a horror film completely horrible that is based on lame and enduring actors who could not act to save their lives and is more rude than terrifying. How is a movie like this made? In short, avoid TZC as a sexually transmitted disease. <br /> <br /> My last 2 cents: With enough humor, this movie was made by a movie company called Brain Damage Films. The brains must have been really damaged to create a spectacular movie like this one. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1 out of 10 (If it were up to me, this movie would get the negative rating bajillion)
