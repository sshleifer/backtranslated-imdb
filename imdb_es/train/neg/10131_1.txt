Well, I can put an end once and for all to the question: 'What is the worst movie ever made ... sometime?' It's Flight of Fury, starring and co-written by Steven Seagal. Sure there are many famously bad movies, but this takes the cake because it is taken so seriously. <br /> <br /> It's a Romanian-made film that talks about how far Romania has to go to catch it. up with Bollywood. He also talks about how absolutely devoid of intellect and talent Steven Seagal has become. This movie is so bad that you literally feel violated after seeing it and you need to crouch in the corner of the shower and cry, knowing that nothing will make you feel clean again. <br /> <br /> It was only released on video (I can not imagine why) and I suspect that the workers who had to make the DVD had to wear protective equipment and receive regular advice.
