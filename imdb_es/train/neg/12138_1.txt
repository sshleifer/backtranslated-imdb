Grave HOME ALONE / KARATE KID ends with enough stereotypes of bad characters for the writer to be sued and then shot. You could see the blatant use of doubles in almost every scene. Oh, and the performance stinks too. Although I must say that the line: "Sorry, friend, I have to make a big overturned in a big way" made me laugh.
