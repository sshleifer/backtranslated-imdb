I do not think this movie has been classified correctly. I took my copy, deleted the PG rating and wrote down R. I would NOT recommend this to anyone under 17 or 18, whatever the limit of R. <br /> <br /> Why? It contains a scene in the jungle with several topless Indian women. I do not know about you, but that's not something for young children to watch. It's true that it could be the traditional "dress style" of African Indians (?), But ... I think partial nudity should give the film a grade of R. <br /> <br /> I have not seen the movie recently, but I guess otherwise, it was fine.
