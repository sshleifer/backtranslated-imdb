This show had very good stories, but bad dialogue. The main character was especially annoying. It's pretty obvious why this program was canceled, although, like most UPN programs, I never knew it existed until it was on syndicated reps. <br /> <br /> Most of the plots seemed to have been copied from other programs. and movies, which leads me to think that the producers did not have an original idea in their heads. <br /> <br /> I have not commented enough. You have to have at least ten lines of text. The special effect was not bad for a 2001 show. <br /> <br /> The gnome was a good character.
