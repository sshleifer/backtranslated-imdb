I'm sorry, I had high hopes for this movie. Unfortunately, it was too long, too thin and too weak to hold my attention. When I realized that the whole movie was just about an older man who was reviving his dream, I felt cheated. Surely it could have been a device to take us to something deeper, something more significant. <br /> <br /> Therefore, do not buy a large drink or run to the bathroom. My children did not enjoy it either. Ah good.
