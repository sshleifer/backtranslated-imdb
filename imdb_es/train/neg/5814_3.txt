The film did what it was proposed: to show how a little girl faces poverty and grows to maturity. However, for most of us, this topic has been explored properly and, in most cases, with more sophistication than here. The film was fixed on the breasts, which soon became boring and I lost interest. If this were on television, it would have changed to the latest news about the Starr Report. That's how boring I found this movie.
