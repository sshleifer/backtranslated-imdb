I have not seen the first two, only this one called Primordial Species in England. I do not think I bother to look at them. <br /> <br /> This is a horrible movie. Terrible acting, bad dialogue, cheap rubber monsters. Everything is so unpleasant. The most sympathetic characters die very quickly and leave you with the annoying ones, especially one called Polchak, who is an incredible imbecile. Nobody like that would survive 5 minutes in the army. It lasted for a long time, but I was glad when they finally tore off his head: I was having nightmares that I was going to survive. The Colonel was also foolish, all with bad humor and clueless shouts. And the pillory doctor looked and acted like she was out of a porn movie. I was waiting for her to take off her glasses, shake her hair and become a vampire, but she did not. Too bad that, as it would have animated the movie until the end. <br /> <br /> Roger Corman did not used to make half decent movies once?
