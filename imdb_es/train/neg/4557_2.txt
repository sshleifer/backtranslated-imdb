Okay, it's very rare that I complain something that I received for FREE. So I guess this movie pushed me beyond that limit. I saw it for FREE at the Hollywood cemetery and I was very disappointed. The question of a member of the audience to the director about the use of Native American references simply as "signings" instead of being better woven into the movie, basically says everything this movie FAILED. <br /> <br /> NATIVE REFERENCES American --- Native American references felt really out of place and created. It is obvious that this director and writer tried to attack an arena in which they had never played before. They should have adhered to the old adage "write about something you know". If you are indeed versed in this, it certainly was not shown in the film or the beauty of this unique culture did not receive the proper justice. <br /> <br /> Clichés and ON THE NOSE --- I agreed to watch this movie on the basis that it was an indie. So I held it to higher expectations. "Little Miss Sunshine" was an indie and saw it before it became so popular. Before I went to a general release, I was already talking about how it was going to be a success. Unfortunately, I could not say the same about the "Due Date". "Sunshine" led us to the incidents of clichés, but the filmmakers were so smart in their approach that the result would take us to a different direction, avoiding the trap of being a "cliché". This film, on the other hand, had no way of not falling into the trap because it was already TREATED from the beginning. The antics of the psychopathic mother, the Hendrix couple, etc. <br /> <br /> I hate to say it, but the best and the WORST movie I've seen this year were both indies. "Little Miss Sunshine" is the best and this movie the worst. I wish I could say the opposite. <br /> <br /> But I do congratulate the filmmakers for having a good participation of their relatives in the cemetery.
