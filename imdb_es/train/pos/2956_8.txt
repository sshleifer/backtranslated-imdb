['Nowadays, there are very few artists that can captivate me throughout a movie just because of their presence. One of those few people is Judy Davis, who has developed a successful career from the creation of characters who have a stubborn attitude but are very vulnerable at heart. She takes the roles that most other artists will treat melodramatically and adds a fiery and deeply emotional intensity that draws attention away from everything else on the screen. <br /><br /> Her skills are well exposed in &quot;High Tide,&quot; a movie that compares her for the second time with director Gillian Armstrong, who gave Davis her first big hit with &quot;My Brilliant Career.&quot; In that film, Davis played a young woman who was determined to succeed in the world, despite the asphyxia she felt for her community and education. However, in &quot;High Tide&quot;, Davis&#39;s character, Lillie, is more or less the opposite: she gave up any hope for her future when she was little and, after giving birth to a child, she escapes from her responsibilities and assumes a life without direction or meaning. When he finally meets his daughter years later, the idea of caring for his son is petrifying; She knows that this is her chance to atone for her failures, but how can she be honest with her daughter and continue earning her respect? <br /><br /> Gillian Armstrong&#39;s films usually tell stories about characters who want to communicate desperately with each other, but face obstacles created by their own habits and personal addictions. &quot;Oscar and Lucinda&quot;, for example, referred to a man and a woman who desperately needed each other&#39;s love but who were always blinded by their desire for chance, represented by their addictions to the game. Here, we are immersed in the world of a family torn apart by the inability of the mother to commit herself to a stable life and her struggles to redeem herself despite being completely convinced that it is too late to change for the better. This is not simply a movie with a great performance at its center, but also an exceptional achievement: a completely convincing story of redemption.']
