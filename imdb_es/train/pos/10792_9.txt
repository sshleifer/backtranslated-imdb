Good show, very entertaining. Good performance of marshal arts. Good plot of the story. All the main team did a good job of Robert Urich, Chuck, Norris, Jennifer Tung, and especially a GREAT hand to Judson Mills. An especially good tribute to Robert Urich, in his last days. A GREAT ! Actor that will be really missed.
