This documentary makes you travel around the world. It contains strange and surprising sequels from the desert. It shows you how diversified and fragile our planet can be. The future of the polar bear stands out at the beginning and at the end. After all, its bleak future is closely related to the consequences of global warming. This documentary is, however, a simplistic approach to such a serious environmental problem. However, young children can easily see it, since it is still mainly descriptive. Scientists may well be disappointed, since it is not a new version of Al Gore's documentary "An uncomfortable truth" but frankly ... what a description! Then a question may arise: is not it worthwhile to preserve the beauty of our world? Because this documentary proves that in 2007 there is still such beauty despite the different contaminations. By living in towns and cities, we tend to forget that we are part of this nature. All the things considered in this documentary remind us that we own a common treasure called "EARTH".
