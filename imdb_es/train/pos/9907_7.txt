"Slaughter High" is, perhaps, the most underestimated slasher movie of the eighties. It is one of the few films in the genre that captivates along. That said, it also relies heavily on the standard formula of matadors: a group of young men and women are killed one by one in a horrible way until the final showdown. <br /> <br /> The reason why "Slaughter High" is above most The movies in its genre is that it goes beyond the top. Marty, the murderer, has good reasons to hold a grudge against his former classmates. They electrocuted him while he was naked in the shower of a women's clothing, hit him in the groin with a javelin and, on top of that, prepared his experiment in the science lab so that it could disfigure him. <br /> <br /> So, the victims in this movie are almost as unpleasant as you get. When they meet years later, at a high school reunion organized by Marty himself, you realize they have not matured so much. They are a group of sociopaths. <br /> <br /> It's amazing why they do not ask themselves why they were the only ones to come to the meeting, which, incidentally, takes place in a school. Since then it has fallen into disrepair. And who would think it a good idea to drink the beer and liquor found in the abandoned building in a room where your old wardrobes are displayed, as well as Marty's? There are many steps of faith that the viewer needs to enjoy this movie. The end has little or no meaning. And the writers have a strange understanding of how April Fools' Day works: the movie says jokes are no longer allowed after noon. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is one of the best examples of the slasher genre, despite all its flaws. It's hard to understand why it has not yet reached DVD, when so many other run-of-the-mill slasher movies are adorned with special editions.
