['How truly friendly, charming and cordial is this unpretentious old series; I rejoiced at seeing old Lugosi. It is disarmingly friendly and animated. It is the document of a lost ship a long time ago. (The best television series of today can hardly compete with these moderately good serial series). CHANDU is deeply, deeply optimistic and hedonistic. Refresh the mind Is not stupid; stupid are those who do not receive the terms in which such serials work. CHANDU has an irresistible sense of simple, unpretentious and friendly fun. <br /><br /> Without revealing too much, Chandu is a western sorcerer who also has this oriental name and who also loves and protects his niece against a sect of murderers. <br /><br /> Chandu exercises his supernatural gifts in a very discreet and moderate way. <br /><br /> As for the rather sexy niece, Nadji, is kidnapped by the priest of Ubasti: the sordid Vindhyan. In fact, the poor sexy girl is kidnapped several times: in a sarcophagus after being sent asleep with a flower; almost kidnapped from a ship; by a false policeman; The temple of Lemuria and its strange and creepy ceremonies resemble the images of KING KONG and are a mockery of the RCC ceremonies and rituals. <br /><br /> Would you protect a girl as bravely as Chandu does? <br /><br /> Lugosi looked like an old libidinous and rather ruthless drunkard, and this only contributed to his performances. He is the average drunk uncle prototypical, mischievous and cunning and oblique. This may sound like a pretty crooked homage to Lugosi; however, the biography of Wood de Burton left me with this impression of Lugosi and allied with a strong sympathy for the decrepit actor. I enjoy the luxurious performances of Lugosi. <br /><br /> This series is unfairly beaten.']
