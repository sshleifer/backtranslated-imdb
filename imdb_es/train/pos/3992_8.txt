Although the titles of the films contain the word "Mother", the first thing that comes to mind is the love of a mother for her children. <br /> <br /> However, The Mother tells a different story. <br /> <br /> The mother does not discuss the love between a mother and her child, or how she sacrifices herself for the benefit of her child. Here, the director of Notting Hill, Roger Michell, tells how a mother's love for a man half his age hurts the people around her. <br /> <br /> Before Daniel Craig takes on the role of James Bond, he plays here. Darren, a man who is helping to renovate the house of the mother's son, and also to sleep with his daughter. Anne Reid, who was a familiar face in the television series, takes on the challenging role of the main character, May. <br /> <br /> The story begins when May faces the sudden loss of her husband, Toots, in a family visit to her son, Bobby. While befriending Darren, an assistant who is doing some renovations at Bobby's house, she was surprised to discover that her daughter, Paula, was sleeping with Darren. At the same time, May was dealing with life after Toots' death. Fearing that Harry and Paula did not love her, May begins to lose track of her life, until she spends the afternoon with Darren. <br /> <br /> Darren was nice and friendly to May, and May soon finds some affection in Darren. Instead of treating him like a friend, she treated the man who was about half his age with the love of a couple. Later, May found sexual pleasure in Darren, where he gave her the pleasure that she could never find in anyone else. And this is the beginning of the disaster that could lead to the breakup of a family. <br /> <br /> Mother explores the inner world of a widow who wanted to try something she never had in her life, and consolation. about someone who is there for her to carry her on her shoulders. This can be said from May buying snacks at tea time for Darren to meet the sexual needs of a man younger than her, where he finally gave her more than she expected. <br /> <br /> Anne Reid has made a big breakthrough for her May role, as before she was best known for her role in the television series. Since he does not have many films in his career curriculum, The Mother has caught the attention of critics. Daniel Craig, on the other hand, had assumed a similar role in his film career, such as Sylvia (2003) and Enduring Love (2004). If his repetition of James Bond fails, film critics should not forget that he has a better performance in small productions in his years of film career, and La Madre is one of them. <br /> <br /> Mother can not be everyone's favorite, but it's definitely not your usual matinee show accompanied by tea and buns, accompanied by butter and jam.
