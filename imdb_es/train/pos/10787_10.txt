So when I was little I received this movie as a gift and my sister and I loved it. We would see it all the time. when our friends approached, we stayed to sleep and we saw the great mountain of rock sweets and the magic toys of the grandfather. Now I am 21 years old and I still love this movie, some old friends and recently we got together and saw it, we knew all the songs and we danced and we talked about how much we hated Profster when we were little. A friend really bought this movie and the grandfather's magic toys for her 2 year old daughter because she wants to convey our love for this movie. This is really a movie that you can let your children see and feel safe, without violence, without bad words, just many great songs and important lessons.
