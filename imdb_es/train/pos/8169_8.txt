This is a bloody mess and quite convincing. Corbin Bernson is very in charge of this film with his elegant interpretation of the practitioner of the same name who is crazy. Linda Hoffman plays her unfaithful wife and she is very good to the eye; unfortunately for her, the small "date" with the pool boy gives her a severe punishment in a way that the good doctor knows is better. What a shame of that beautiful smile! The last half hour of the film is dedicated to the character of Bernson losing it completely and the attention falls on a young actress named Virginya Keehne. An extremely talented artist, monopolizes the light from the moment the brakes are released. Good legs, too!
