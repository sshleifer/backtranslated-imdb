A young woman who is a successful model, and who is also engaged to marry, and who has attempted suicide twice in the past, is chosen by a secret and distant association of Catholic priests to be the next "sentinel" at the door of the hell, which apparently runs through an old and well-maintained but well-maintained Brooklyn apartment building. Their tenants climb the ladder and can reincarnate, but apparently they can not escape while there is a sentry to block the road. The former (John Carradine) is about death, so she, luckily or whatever, becomes the next, and the condemned must make him commit suicide to be free. Many interesting details are found below the surface, his relationship with his father, the stories of the condemned, his fianc√©, so one can pass this as a horror of cheap exploitation, but given the sets, the great cast and the general level of Bizarreness, This is definitely worth seeing.
