Many of the classic films of the late 1960s have not retained their ability to disturb and confront the audience. "In Cold Blood" has not lost an ounce of its power. His exceptionally well done, however, forces the viewer to think. Some have complained not only about the film, but about Truman Capote's "non-fiction novel" source, that the central message is not very subtle. That may be true, but this is definitely a case where the lack of ambiguity does not detract from the movie at all. It's refreshing, especially considering the simplistic and manipulative moral dramas of today, to see a film with a convinced political voice that is not afraid to force the audience to consider their point of view. To be honest, I'm not sure I agree with the central message of the film, but I still admire its audacity. <br /> <br /> Even if you do not agree with the message of capital punishment, there is much to admire the movie. The performance of the two protagonists is excellent. Scott Wilson (still one of the most underrated actors in history) is chilling like the nihilist leader, one who uses his charisma to hide his weaknesses. Robert Blake is also chilling as the most submissive of the two and the one who is aware. His character obviously has a voice of reason, but he is terrified of going against Wilson (there is a good amount of homoerotic subtext on the part of his character). The cinematography is fantastic, elegant but at the same time gritty and really gives the impression that the viewer is watching a documentary. Add another classic Quincey Jones score and you'll have a masterpiece. (9/10)
