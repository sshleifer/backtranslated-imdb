An imagination is a terrible thing to waste ... especially when you have talented actors. The writer / director Jones does not waste time in separating the viewer with its protagonist. <br /> <br /> Anyone who has shared an apartment with a bum will cry with laughter. Anyone who has arrived while a subway maid puts a ticket on your windshield will simply cry. We all wanted to start a terrible fight from the head of a man. These are just fragments of what's in store when we see "Cross Eyed," a sincere movie that should be a springboard for Jones and his ironic sense of humor in front of and behind the camera.
