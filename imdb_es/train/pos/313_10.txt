I am African American and I loved this soap opera. I saw it dubbed in Spanish on Telemundo, almost 5-7 years ago. The story was a TRUE story about a black slave who had a love affair with a white commander, which led to her leadership and her candid and capricious way of life. <br /> <br /> Many of us could learn a lot from XICA. She took what she had, nothing, and saw her possibilities. Many would say that she sold herself, but she was trying to secure her future and that of her future children. <br /> <br /> It was an excellent telenovela, which I thought would be released on DVD, but it's not being released. This telenovela was the best telenovela in history. We need it to be published on DVD or broadcast on TV again. He is playing in Azteca America at this time, which is only available in Mexico or the US. UU Cable paid. We need you to launch it back to Telemundo.
