Maybe it's just because I have an intense fear of hospitals and medical things, but it got into me (sorry for the pun). This piece is brave, is not afraid to go above and as satisfying as they come in terms of revenge movies. Not only did I feel a lot of hatred for the screwdriver and a lot of sympathy for the "screwee", but I also jumped and felt pangs of disgust for certain joints, which is really a rare and charming thing for a spectator of terror a bit jaded like me. same. Some parts are very reminiscent of "Hellraiser", but they come out as tribute instead of imitation. It is a heavy hand piece that does not offer much to consider the viewer, but I enjoy being assaulted by a movie from time to time. This piece brings it and does not apologize. I really liked this one. DO NOT look while eating pudding.
