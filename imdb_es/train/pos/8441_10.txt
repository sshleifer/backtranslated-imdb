For those who liked the series, this movie will be something to watch. However, it also leaves you wanting more. I loved the way each character (detective) made an appearance. At least with the end of who is the fourth chair because they leave a reason for another movie. My guess is Bayless of course. This as the series was a series of scenes very well together. This is a series that I wish I had lived. Thanks to the cast for a wonderful television.
