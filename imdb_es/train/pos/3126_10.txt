I do not give ten star ratings easily. A movie really has to impress me, and The Bourne Ultimatum has gone way beyond that. In addition, this trilogy has come together so well, that I think it is one of the best film trilogies of our time. Although the three films could not be more different from Ludlum's novels, they remain a powerful milestone in cinematographic achievement. The Bourne Ultimatum made me want to cry because the series was complete, however, I could not even stop smiling for hours. <br /> <br /> From the moment the first title appeared, I knew we were going for a moment. walk. Paul Greengrass has done it again. Everything we love about Bourne's previous films is here once again: action, dialogue and, of course, the unstable camera. However for me, the latter was never a problem. I think the suspense increases. <br /> <br /> I will return to see this movie several times before it is published on DVD, simply because it is great. It's a perfectly satisfying conclusion, and you must pass the test of time like a fantastic movie and, together, like an unforgettable trilogy.
