Moon Child, starring Japanese rockers Hyde and Gackt, was a better movie than I expected. In fact, I was very impressed and it immediately became one of my favorite movies. <br /> <br /> Located in Mallepa, the story follows a group of orphans, Sho, Sho's brother, Shinji and Toshi, who steal and murder. to make a living. In one of the robberies, Sho encounters Hyde's vampire Kei burning in the sunlight. Through the events, the true nature of Kei shows itself, however, no one rejects it. <br /> <br /> Time passes and implies that the immortal, who never changes, Kei has raised Sho, and the two have a close bond. Sho and Kei meet Son in a scandalous gun fight, and become fast friends. Both Kei and Hyde fall in love with Son's sister, Yi-Che. <br /> <br /> Time moves forward again and shows an adult Sho, this time empty of Kei. He also explains that Sho and Son have become enemies. <br /> <br /> Through tragedy after tragedy, this film is immersed in the reality of life and all its difficulties, focusing on friendship and love. It is a truly moving film that is sad but beautiful at the same time. <br /> <br /> As for the acting, I think Gackt did a magnificent job. Hyde did an amazing job for the first time. <br /> <br /> The shots were beautiful, but the movie had some weird and frightening shots. <br /> <br /> In general, I must say This movie is amazing, touching, and I highly recommend it.
