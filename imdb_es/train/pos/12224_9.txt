I could see the whole movie last night and it seemed very exciting. At least it was not like the teen movies that appear from time to time. The search for the killer and the relationship of "couple" between the hero and the so-called "bad boy" was a part that I liked about the movie. Also, I remember that I once sat on the edge of my seat during a specific scene in the movie. I mean, it's exciting. Maybe some time later, I can watch the movie again. ..
