I loved this movie because, in my opinion, it seemed to capture perfectly what I imagined life in French colonial Africa must have been in the 50s ("my" generation anyway). But I was really captivated by his calm pace and by the glorious ending. In the last 5 minutes of this movie, you should focus on what is happening. I have never been more impressed by the "closing" of a movie. I remember shouting "wow!" when I realized that it was over. On the other hand, my two daughters fell asleep on the couch!
