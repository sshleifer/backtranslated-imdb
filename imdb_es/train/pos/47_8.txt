It breaks my heart that this film is not appreciated as it should be. It is very underestimated. people forgot what movies are really about, nowadays they only think about boom bum movies, which can be quite fun watching with popcorn and friends, like transformers, movies that are oriented, with an extremely high budget like 300mln or even more, in special effects Only and that are silly movies without argument. It is the kind of film what in spite of everything. Of course, it's fun to see the CGI created to a large extent, but we do not get anything essential from that kind of movie. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I think the performance was excellent. Especially Busy Philipps, along with Erika Christensen and Victor Garber (whom I respect) made this film an Oscar. The emotional performance of Busy Philipps was amazing, it's a pity that we do not see Oscar in his hands, which she deserves.
