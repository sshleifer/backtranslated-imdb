In this installment of the series, Edmund Blackadder is stuck in the Regency period in Britain (during the latter part of the rule of George III). This time, Blackadder's prospects are much poorer, since instead of royalty, he is a servant of the very, very thick George IV (the price ruler). Unlike the historical accounts of George IV, this is as bright as a tomato and, as a result, Blackadder can take advantage of him and make plans for the content of his heart. The only big difference in style between this and the previous ones is that the series ends with a very, very, very different note: you just have to see it to believe it. Apart from that, all the usual elements of the story are there and the show is hilarious. The only reservation I have (as usual) is that this show is not appropriate for children because of its rude language and adult situations.
