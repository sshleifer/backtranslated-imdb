I think the movie was kind of weird. In the initial scene, a person is murdered for no reason. They do not mention it again. The special effects could also have been better, but I enjoyed watching an older horror movie. It's not the best example of a classic horror movie, but it was still a good movie. I give it about 5 out of 10 on the scale.
