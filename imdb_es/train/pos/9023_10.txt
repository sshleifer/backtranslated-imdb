A brave and courageous portrait of a part of the history of World War II, that most of us in the United States had no idea that has happened. I would love to have this on video. It was only shown in t.v. Once, as far as I know, in 89 or 90. I've asked about this movie and most video stores do not even know it. Great actresses everywhere, I wish I could see him again. First class series.
