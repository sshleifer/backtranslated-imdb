After reading the original work, I thought it would have been much harder to adapt to the screen than it turned out to be. Donal McCann presents a great performance once as Public Gar, the repressed antagonist that is openly manifested on the screen by his extroverted alterego (but invisible to others), Private Gar. Eamonn Kelly also plays an excellent "screwballs" whose inability to communicate his feelings is only matched by Gar. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth renting if you can find it. (Probably not available outside of Ireland and the UK)
