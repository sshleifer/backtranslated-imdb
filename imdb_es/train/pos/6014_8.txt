All the reviews here about how much ZP has no plot, the performance is made of wood, the scene of the orgy has no meaning, etc., they all lose the main point. <br /> <br /> Let's be honest. This is a movie made in the exciting times of the late sixties and early seventies in Los Angeles. It's a movie to be watched while you're out of your mind with H-I-G-H over some psychedelic substance. <br /> <br /> Find a friendly cocoon and smoke, or get a slight hit of acid. Seriously, these serious and sober criticisms of ZP lose the point. You can not get anything out of this movie in a direct mood. <br /> <br /> Until I've seen this movie on the big screen (what I'm lucky to have done three times in the 1990s when ZP was pretty weird), you have no idea what this movie is about . <br /> <br /> If you insist on seeing her not intoxicated, at least you can appreciate the end when the trash catches up to the soundtrack of Pink Floyd's wonderful repeat of "Careful With That Ax, Eugene", "Come In Number 51, Your Time Is Up ".
