Okay, it goes without saying that this movie is only going to attract a certain audience; that is, drug addicts and related people. <br /> <br /> That said, if you are one of these people mentioned, this movie is a MUST. In fact, I think it should be mandatory for major stores to sell a copy of it to anyone who buys their first bong. What the Holy Grail of Monty Python is for geeks and nerds, so is this movie for potheads. The first time I saw this movie about 10 years ago, and I keep laughing every time I see it. The jokes perfectly embody the excessive lifestyle, much better than the fakes of the last days, like the attempt of Half-Baked. <br /> <br /> There is no plot, so to speak; The film is more than a collection of several parodies; while the protagonist movies roam Los Angeles in its legendary haze. Despite this, the film has an excellent sense of rhythm and does not creep at all. Many people cite Up In Smoke as the best work of C & C, but I have to say that the next movie is superior. <br /> <br /> So if you feel like an hour and a half of laughter, turn it on. , tune in and let your mind fly away =) <br /> <br /> Oh, and FREE TOMMY CHONG!
