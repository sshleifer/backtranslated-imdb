['I used to watch this show as a child. When I think about it, I only remember it vaguely. If you ask me, it was a good show. Two things that I vaguely remember are the opening sequence and the musical theme. In addition to that, they were all ideally launched. In addition, the writing was very strong. The performances were first class, too. I hope some network brings it back to see each episode. Before finishing this, I would like to say that I will always remember this program in my memory forever, although I do not think I have seen all the episodes. Now, in conclusion, if a network brings it back, I hope it catches it a day before it leaves the air forever.']
