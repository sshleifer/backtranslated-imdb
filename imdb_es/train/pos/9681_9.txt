Add Paulie the parrot to the animal characters in the movie. This movie is a love story: Bird and Gena Rowlands, Bird and his beloved Marie, Michael and Marie. A Russian janitor helps a talking parrot and thinks to find its rightful owner many years after Marie's parents sold it to a pawnshop. Before the end of the warm-up of the heart, we learn all of Paulie's misadventures. Cheech Marin and his dancing parrots are wonderful. Beautiful photography throughout. A great little movie, word of mouth will make it the favorite of worship.
