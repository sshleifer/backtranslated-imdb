This is a very intriguing short film by David Lynch, and saying that David Lynch's name is probably enough for a lot of people. This is your typical short Lynch. A blonde and a brunette are in a dark room. The blonde has been crying, the brunette is talking in a threatening way with the blonde, and that's it. <br /> <br /> With many moments of silence, but with the disturbing music of Angelo Badalamenti, there is a Strange form of suspense. This short feels a bit like 'Mulholland Dr.', a movie that I loved, and therefore I liked it too. It's probably especially for Lynch fans, but there's a chance you might like this.
