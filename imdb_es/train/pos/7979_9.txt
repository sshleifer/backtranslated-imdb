['Tony Scott can make good and bad movies, personally I think he can be a little flashy and of poor quality and his work obviously suffers in comparison with his fairly famous brother, but possibly this is his best movie. <br /><br /> What makes this film so great is that Scott gives Denzel (in scorching form, better than Training Day) and the revelation of Dakota Fanning the moment to develop a relationship of real warmth and tenderness. The setup is not absolutely boring, although it takes time, it implies and it takes us on a little trip to the characters, including an excellent role for Radha Mitchell as a mother. All this serves to make the action much more effective, since we are so interested in the characters, for all their obvious weaknesses. This movie has you on edge in its entirety, and it does not recover at the end either. <br /><br /> The movie, of course, would be nothing without Washington. I often wonder why he seems to have so many duff roles, when it&#39;s pretty clear he&#39;s as good as almost any prominent man (I can only really think of one, Daniel Day Lewis, who has more power on the screen these days). This movie should have been huge, given its state and the strength of its performance and the quality of the film. It only serves to show you that if a studio does not support a movie to the fullest, it ends up going directly to the video. I wish I had the chance to see this on the big screen.']
