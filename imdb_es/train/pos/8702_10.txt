A woman of a child of this world and she was alone. Both were alone because a child had a gift and a curse in a package: he was able to draw the sword from his arm. There was always a wound on his wrist in the cause of this "gift": the most lethal weapon wound in his body. First, he kills his drunken stepfather who always hurts his mother. Then he grows up and decides to find his real father. As simple as all the time for a superhero, he comes to justice ... but society decides that this justice is not necessary and dangerous, which is correct, because it is not like in Hollywood movies that the character does not try . Kill anyone: Sasha (he is the main hero played by Artem Tkachenko) kills if the person who, in his opinion, deserves to die but receives the fault of the authorities and runs. In such a flight from the authorities and the mafia, he meets a girl (played by Chulpan Hamatova) and falls in love with her. Everything else is to be observed ... not counted. Keep in mind that this movie is more about feelings and emotions, but not about actions. This movie is full of pain of the main character full of him and his vision of life.
