A realistic representation of young love for the whole university, but also attracts a greater audience like me. It has ups and downs, twists and turns and made me spill a tear or two. Rarely do we see films with black urban characters that can attract older, non-black audiences, and show a more real representation of young black adults. <br /> <br /> This film takes place on a university campus and a city where two people meet and fall in love. In the background there are several known friends and situations that impact them for good or for bad. Typical plot that some may say, but this really was unexpected. <br /> <br /> I found myself encouraging the survival of the couple's relationship, seeing my own past in their history. Moments of deep reflection and revelation emerged from the performances of the actors. <br /> <br /> It is a brilliant film that I would recommend for those young at heart and in love or who have been in love at some time. Great movie. I'll be looking for a copy to add to my movie collection.
