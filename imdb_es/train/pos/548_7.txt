['This movie was as good as other westerns made by Anthony Mann and James Stewart as Winchester &#39;73 and The Naked Spur, and much better than Thunder Bay and Bend Of The River. This film begins as a race west of the mill but becomes more complex as it progresses. It begins with Jimmy Stewart and Walter Brennan arriving in Seattle and Stewart is accused of murder. He is found innocent but his cattle are stolen by a corrupt judge. Stewart then agrees to lead something, but I forget what it is, but Stewart only worries about recovering his cattle. As the film progresses, it&#39;s as if Stewart only cared for himself as did his character in Naked Spur. It gets much better at the midpoint after they arrive in Alaska. This is one of Stewart&#39;s best westerns.']
