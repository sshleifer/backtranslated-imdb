This show has a great story! It is very credible! A man's wife dies and he can not take care of his children alone, so he calls his brother-in-law, his best friend and many others who come later in the program. Like Rebeecca Donaldson, the adorable but strong dog kite, Nikki and Alex, whom you can discover for yourself (I do not want to spoil you) and coerce Kimmy Gibler! (The DJ partner) but the children are also wonderful. This is Mary Kate and Ashley took off for the first time! And you may also meet Candace Cameron Bure from programs like St. Elsewere Punky Brewster, and that's it! Jodie Sweetin plays Steph, the loving middle child who feels left out. This is really a very good show!
