Beware of spoilers. This movie was fine. Goldie Hawn and Chris Sarandon were the two best. Okay, so the foreign guy who does nonsense (SPOILER HERE) changes with the biker for his clothes was funny. The boss of this guy was good too. But the movie really belonged to Sarandon and Hawn. These two should have had much more time on screen together. Their chemistry was great. The bathroom scene-WOW! Romantic, sweet, delicious. <br /> <br /> Hawn is a ridiculous waitress who saves a foreign man and ends up in the white house in the middle of a plot due to the greed of politicians. To speak of Sarandon would be to give a lot. SPOILERS This is a rather atypical romantic / political comedy, and it satisfies both, the political side much more than the romantic one. Touch political issues and just touch the romantic areas. <br /> <br />
