Richard Willaims is a god of animation. He was hampered in the direction of this film by the producer. The final product is a very uneven film with a very complicated story, but with some amazing moments of animation (like "Greedy" by Emery Hawkins). The repetitive music of Joe Raposo does not help either. It was made in wide screen so that VHS does not show it in all its splendor, let's wait for a DVD in mailbox format some day. Still, it's worth looking for some animation animation.
