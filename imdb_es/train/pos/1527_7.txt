Saved when it came out, this movie now looks beautiful and sounds great. An intelligent and reflective performance party, by Gielgud, Kenneth Haigh, Harry Andrews and especially Anton Walbrook, and a moving central performance by the beautiful and incredibly young Jean Seberg. Preminger does not jump and show - his long, slow shots encourage him to listen and reflect, and Graham Greene's script condenses Shaw without sacrificing complexity. the worst for that Too many contemporary films about "historical" subjects can not resist the nonsense. What would Mel Gibson have done to the Maid? Probably, many shots of her drooling on the shelf, then crisp on the barbecue as the flames take over. Preminger does not do any of this. The burning is mainly shown through a fault reaction. There are some weak performances, but not enough to cause serious damage. I caught this movie on TV and did not expect to see it, but I was trapped. In our time of religious fundamentalism and sacrifice, Joan's story has an unexpected resonance.
