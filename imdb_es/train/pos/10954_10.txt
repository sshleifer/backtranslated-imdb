['Sarah Silverman is like a totally manic Zooey Deschanel and I think I&#39;m already in love. Yes, if you loved Jesus is magic, you will love this. If you did not, what the hell is wrong with you? Congratulations to the comedy channel for putting this in my face. My life finally makes sense and &quot;my car smells like farts&quot; is my kind of humor. I&#39;m a happy boy The first episode made me laugh hysterically and I&#39;m looking forward to next week. This is how Grease meets South Park. Completely outrageous. Sarah Silverman is someone who could see reading the phone book. Your delivery is precise and so funny. She never skips a beat. Now that I think about it, it&#39;s not so much your choice of material. which by the way is something really good, since that is the way he chooses to deliver it. Thank you, Sarah Silverman! Thanks, Comedy Channel!']
