['Maybe I loved this movie partly because I&#39;ve been feeling depressed and it&#39;s such a lovely fairy tale. Whatever the reason, I thought it was perfect. Great, clever story, beautiful effects, excellent acting (especially De Niro, which is amazing). This movie made me happier than I&#39;ve been for a while. <br /><br /> It is a very funny and intelligent movie. The joke that ran about the history of the kingdom of the savagery of the princes and the consequences, the way in which the magical effects are delivered to the witch and dozens of small and intelligent little touches, kept me captivated. That&#39;s a lot of what makes it so good; It is an elaborate film, loaded with special effects, with more history than most fairy tale films, however, there is an incredible attention to small things. <br /><br /> I want to go ahead and see it again.']
