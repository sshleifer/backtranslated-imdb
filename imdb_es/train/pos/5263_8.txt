Netflix should mention this brief feature in the information for silk stockings. Superior in all senses to the superproduced fluff. This had much better Cole Porter songs and a lot more energy. The silk stockings turned out to be a big disappointment. Fred was getting too old for this kind of thing, although the dances and Cyd are lovely. I will be watching the Ninotchka version of Garbo - Melvyn Douglas. Was Peter Lorre sick during the manufacture of silk stockings? It seems that it is very passive in the most active numbers and with fewer lines? Very pleased to have found Paree - Paree by sheer accident. It made the whole experience much more enjoyable. Bob Hope, as a simple "man of song and dance" is pure joy.
