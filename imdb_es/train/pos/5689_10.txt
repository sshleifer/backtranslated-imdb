['First, this is a review of the two sets of discs that came together with the DVD rental &quot;Wonderland.&quot; <br /><br /> The two films included in the rental, &quot;Wonderland&quot; and the documentary Johnny Wadd, totally eliminate the myth created by &quot;Boogie Nights&quot;. The myth is that the characters involved in the adult film trade were considerably more than a few unimportant stories that they would do anything for money, basically denying that they were anything more than detestable and self-centered bitches. This is surprisingly similar to what the book &quot;Wiseguy&quot; and the movie &quot;Goodfellas&quot; did with the fable of &quot;The Godfather&quot; and most of the rest of the gangster romanticism. <br /><br /> Now, what irritated me the most when I saw these films, and would probably annoy anyone who has seen and enjoyed &quot;Boogie Nights,&quot; is how ridiculous and gullible a supposedly educated and sophisticated person can be. &quot;Dirk Diggler&quot; in &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; is, without a doubt, John Holmes, who unlike &quot;Dirk Diggler&quot;, did not have a quality of redemption. Holmes was a criminal sociopath who abused anyone close to him, was totally consumed by his search for self-gratification, and was undoubtedly a key participant in the brutal murders on Wonderland Avenue in Los Angeles in 1981. The movie leaves the discovered the great lie that &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; was, and reinforces Linda Lovelace&#39;s description of the cruel and pathetic business that is known as the adult movie entertainment industry. This should be required to see, both functions on the DVD &quot;Wonderland&quot;, for anyone who has had positive opinions about the story in the movie &quot;Boogie Nights&quot;.']
