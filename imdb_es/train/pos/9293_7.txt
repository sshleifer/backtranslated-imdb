Clue number one: read the title as "The Crazy Dog Time", or maybe dogs. This is a very good piece of equipment (look at the cast and fix it, you know you're curious), and the first director Bishop gives them their chance, taking their time, letting the characters interact and chew the stage while they do it. Wait, not with enthusiasm, for the return of "the great boss" and any revenge that may occur. <br /> <br /> For some of us, the highlight is seeing Christopher Jones after his self-exiled film exile; He remains a dominant cinematic presence. And yes, with Christopher Jones, Larry Bishop and Richard Pryor involved, this is the "Wild in the Streets" gathering party!
