['Woohoo! I&#39;ve seen so many bad low-budget movies lately, but this is great. The very realistic depiction of police life in a city on the East German coast is a sharp contrast to other movies or crime series. I loved the main actress and the absolute rejection of any predominant clich√© about the police. This film is realistic as a documentation and entertaining as a drama at the same time. A perfect exchange!']
