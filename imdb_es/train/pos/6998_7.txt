When entering to see Seven Pounds I was not sure what to think because the previews were very open to understand what the movie was really about. So within the first 20 minutes or so you're completely lost in the plot, you have no idea what's going on and you think Tim, who claims to be Ben, is just a big jerk. All this comes to an end when the "turn", so to speak, unravels in the last minute of the movie. Basically, Tim (will smith) was worried and tormented by a major accident that caused the end of seven people's lives. With this he decides to take out seven new people who need help. To whom in turn gives his life. <br /> <br /> The performance of this film is excellent, since I think it will do it no matter what happens. part that seems to impress. Rosario Dawson, for me, this is one of her best films, apart from the eagle eye, which I think is up to the task. She has been in something bad, something good, but is delivered in this movie. Other actors, like Woody Harrelson, have very small roles and are not big enough to capture the character. Although the casting of the movie was still good. <br /> <br /> This movie was definitely not what I expected and certainly a much slower pace than I expected. The movie, however, was still pretty good. Nothing is revealed until the last 5 minutes of the movie and everything falls into place. Until then it just seems like a meaningless love story. Final thought seven pounds = seven stars.
