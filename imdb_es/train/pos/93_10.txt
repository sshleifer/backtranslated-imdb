My first child was born the year that this program came out, and from then on I played the album for the children every Christmas. When the CD came out, I bought about ten copies and I still give them to friends and family to start forming families ... it invariably becomes your favorite Christmas album. I recently found several DVDs (made on DVD-R from videotapes, probably) for sale on eBay. The one I bought was an excellent copy, and it was great to see the show again after more than 25 years. There are some songs on the show that were not on the album, and some of the songs on the album were studio versions of the same songs on the show. But both the CD and the DVD will remain in our library as the best Christmas entertainment of all time.
