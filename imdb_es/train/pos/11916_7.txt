['With all the &quot;adult&quot; hints in today&#39;s family movies, it&#39;s nice to see one where you do not have to worry about that and you can sit back and enjoy a family with your children. Yes, this movie may have some words of joy (that&#39;s the moment when Knox swears, but they do not let you hear the full words), but for the most part this movie is really as clean as it comes (and that includes movies from back in the day). Not only that, it&#39;s very nice, one of my favorites, and just a great clean and fun movie to watch with the family. <br /><br /> The only thing I have against this movie is that it is too short and I wish there could be more of the memorable parts in it, I will not mention them because I do not want any spoilers here. <br /><br /> All very well done and a great movie to watch; So go out and get the kids, make some cookies and watch this movie!']
