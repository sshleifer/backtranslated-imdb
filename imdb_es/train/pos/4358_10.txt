['Well, this movie probably deserves 7 out of 10 stars, but I voted for &quot;10&quot; to help offset the deceptive rating of the handful of bozo that gave this film zero or 1 star. Each of the segments of this anthology shows great potential and promise for talented filmmakers ... three of whom have achieved remarkable success in Hollywood&#39;s major productions. The performances range from the toughest to the most impressive, with notable twists by Bill Paxton, James Karen, Vivian Schilling and Brion James. Martin Kove can be a great melodramatic like the psychotic hypnotist with the bizarre strobe lamp, and Lance August seems intentionally clumsy as a confident laboratory victim. But in general, it has some great laughs and some really scary moments. Definitely worth seeing, so judge for yourself!']
