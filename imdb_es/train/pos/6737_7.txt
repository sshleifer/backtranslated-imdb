The director and two stars of LAURA (1944) went back to arm themselves for this solid police: Dana Andrews is the son of a criminal who becomes a policeman to cut all ties with the past, but can not control his violent forms inherited while He questioned suspects and, One night, he goes too far; Gene Tierney is the estranged wife of his victim, a decorated war hero who has become involved with the main swindler and Andrews' No. 1 enemy, Gary Merrill (who had been the protege of Andrews Snr.)! As usual at Preminger, this is a well-crafted film with a remarkable sequence of opening credits and animated by a good cast that also includes Karl Malden (as Andrews' main owner), Tom Tully (as father of Tierney's taxi driver) ) and Neville Brand (as Merrill's main bully), with notable support also from Craig Stevens (as the wife's viscous and battering victim), Bert Freed (as Andrews' sympathetic partner) and Robert F. Nolan (as the severe superior outgoing of Andrews). After being warned by the latter to amend his ways, Andrews panics and poses as Stevens a couple of hours after his murder to put the police on the wrong tracks (in this case) of Merrill; however, after Tully becomes the main suspect (by the time Andrews and Tierney get involved in a romantic way), the policeman goes alone to Merrill's lair with the total intention of being beaten and "framing" the delinquent for your own murder! Clearly, the protagonist is a complex character and Andrews faces the challenge with a first class characterization that is usually complemented by the internal style of Fox Noir.
