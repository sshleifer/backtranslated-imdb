I was lucky to see this movie while volunteering at the Maryland Film Festival. I've always been a fan of classic horror movies and especially the tricks of William Castle, so it was definitely a must for me. <br /> <br /> It's about the life and work of William Castle, who in my opinion was an underrated director. It's true that he made some low-budget horror movies, but added something to these films: real live theater tricks that you no longer see. For example, I had nurses in case someone suffered a heart attack in their movies and placed vibrators on the bottom of the chairs in THE TINGLER. <br /> <br /> This is truly a well-made documentary and it brings this director quite somber. In light, and celebrated his contributions to horror movies. He also paints Castle as a character bigger than life, who was very loved and had a smile on his face. <br /> <br /> Unlike most film documentaries that show the testaments of film historians, SPINE TINGLER! He shows interviews mainly from family members and directors who were influenced by his work, such as John Waters, John Landis and Joe Dante. A must for fans of classic horror and science fiction.
