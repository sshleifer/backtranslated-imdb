['This series is &quot;something different&quot;. Sometimes, European series are less accurate than those in EE. UU., But this time the authors have hit the right target by creating a combination that works smoothly. Edel &amp; Starck is great, it has everything: a great plot, intelligent, ingenious lines, always well delivered, an incredible theatrical synchronization shown by all the stars and beautiful photos of Berlin, one of the most interesting cities in the world. It is entertaining to see how things work in the field of justice in countries other than the USA. UU And, for once, &quot;feel&quot; the old way of dealing with life in Europe. Congratulations to the entire cast and crew for a well-made comedy that will be a must in the coming years. Seeing the series in German is excellent.']
