['Awesome documentary I saw it on the original broadcast date and on DVD several times in recent years. I was surprised that he was not even nominated for an Oscar for Best Documentary for 2002, the year it was released. No other documentary is even close. <br /><br /> It was recently on television for the fifth anniversary, but I missed the added segment &quot;where are you now?&quot; In the end, except that I detected that Tony now works for the hazardous materials unit. <br /><br /> I have seen criticisms about the making of documentary films of some on this list. I can not see how this could have been done differently. They had less than 6 months to put this together and put it in the air. The DVD contains more material and background. <br /><br /> It also surprises me that, according to IMDb.com, the brother has not had projects in the four years that followed. What have you been doing?']
