['For his first debut, this film has some fascinating and chilling moments. In the best horror movie, the pit of the stomach tightens every moment during this movie. The end is magnificent. The creators of Blaire Witch obviously saw this film that its end was not an end but a beginning of the end. A great movie and just one piece from Japan in terms of fear factor, a perfect score that makes you think and scare your mind.']
