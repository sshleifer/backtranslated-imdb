I have not seen the restored version, nor any other version of "Baby Face" with Barbara Stanwyck until I detected it in TCM. What a great movie! In short, Lily lives in a clandestine place, her own father has deceived her since she was 14 years old! Then it still explodes and died killing Lily (Stanwyck) alone for her black maid Chico, very well played by Theresa Harris. Lily goes to the big city (New York) deciding to use her sex to get to the top. He does it with great style! <br /> <br /> She seduces a chubby clerk to enter the ground floor and proceeds to go through men as disposable candy! One leaves his fiancee and kills his close father-in-law, also Lily-papi of Lily, and then commits suicide! Lily barely blinks! STanwyck is great as a girl who really does not know what love is. <br /> <br /> Then, in Paris, she falls in love with Courtland, played by George Brent, they get married, but when he is in a very difficult financial situation, she pins Almost free with Chico and half a million, she gives herself mind that he loved Court! Lily runs to find him, but will he arrive too late? <br /> <br /> This is Hollywood pre-codigo at its best. Stanwyck is tremendous and the appearance and music of the film are perfect. This reminded me of "Original Sin" with Angelina Jolie, another film unfairly ignored with an amoral woman, who did not like films of ultra-romantic inclinations, will not like Baby FAce better, those who believe in sex, love and power, love it. Highly recommended! Look at it!
