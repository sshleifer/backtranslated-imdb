It saddens me to say that I do not agree with other people in this episode of Columbo. Death gives a hand is frankly a boring columbo for me. After a few times, I got bored and changed the channel. I still love Robert Culp and Patricia Crowley and Ray Milland in their roles, but the story was weaker in this episode than in the others. First, Robert Culp plays an investigator for the character of Ray Milland. He hires him to investigate his beautiful young wife, played by Patricia Crowley, to see if he is having an affair. In return, Culp's character blackmails the cheating wife who plans to expose her plan to her husband that ruins his career. Out of anger, Culp kills her by hitting her in the face and placing the body in another place. I do not know. Maybe I just did not care about this at all. Of course, Columbo gets it in the end. It's just the question of how.
