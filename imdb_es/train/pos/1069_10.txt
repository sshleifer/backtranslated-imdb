I bought the stations 1 and 2 of Dark Angel two weeks ago, after capturing a couple of episodes of season 1 on Channel 5. Nothing prepared me for how brilliant the show is. I have not enjoyed it so much since Firefly (also an amazing show). I admit that season 2 is not so good, but there are still some amazing episodes (see Designate this, Bag 'Em, Berrisford Agenda, Harbor Lights, Freak Nation, etc.) and Alec is great. I have heard some of the plans for the possible season 3, and I must say that I can not believe that it has been canceled (I will not spoil it for you), but it would have shot! I also think that it has a lot of potential as a movie (although at this moment it seems very unlikely). As proof of my obsession, Max's bar code number is 332960073452, and in the two weeks I've had it, I'm 3 episodes of having seen the two seasons twice. It is too good.
