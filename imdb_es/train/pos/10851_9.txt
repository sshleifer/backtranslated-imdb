I discovered that 'Still Crazy' is wonderfully entertaining, and not only for those of us who lived that scandalous era of the rock of the late 60s and early 70s. My 15 year old daughter sees it with me every time I take out the DVD (Do not worry, it's only been three times) and he also loves it. <br /> <br /> He is a truly loving, moving and moving person. Hilarious nod to the era, and each actor hits their notes with perfection. It was my first introduction to Bill Nighy and I'm glad that his somewhat similar spin on 'Love Actually' has caught his attention. Bruce Robinson was amazing as Brian, and gave real life to what could have been a caricature of the stereotype of rocker damaged by drugs. It was interesting to see that Robinson made a great name as a writer. <br /> <br /> I live in Sherman Oaks, California, and after the first time I saw the movie, I ran into Billy Connolly at the local mall (he was living here at the time) and told him it was a of my five favorite movies of all time. He invited me to sit with him in the food court and we talked about the movie for a while. We even talked about the idea of ​​a new version oriented to the Americans before discarding it wisely. Why mess with the original? <br /> <br /> My only problem with 'Still Crazy' is that it was not very popular in theaters and that many people have missed a wonderful experience.
