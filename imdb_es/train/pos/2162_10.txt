I was very surprised to see this movie so underestimated ... I understand why some of you do not like this movie. Its pace is slow, characteristic of Japanese films. However, if you are absorbed in the movie like me, you will find that this is not a problem. <br /> <br /> I must say that this is the best comedy I've seen in my life. "We We Dansu?" It is often considered a masterpiece of Japanese comedies. It is very different from those of Hollywood, for example, Austin Powers or Scary Movies, in which a gag is guaranteed in every couple of minutes. Rather, it's cheerful, a movie that makes you feel good. <br /> <br /> I love the movie because it makes me feel "real". The plot is simple but nice. I loved seeing that Sugiyama (the lead role) has found the meaning of life in dance. Before watching the movie, I was a little depressed due to the heavy school work. I felt lost. However, this movie made me think about the positive side of life. I thought I was in the same boat as Sugiyama; If he could find himself in his hobby, why could not he? It reminded me to "explore my own future" and discover happiness in my daily life. <br /> <br /> It is important to keep in mind that the actors are not professional dancers. While some of you find that the dance scenes are not as perfect as expected, I like it, as it makes me feel that the characters are really "alive", learning to dance as the movie progresses. <br /> <br /> Above all, this film is encouraging and comforting. As a comedy, he does his job perfectly. It definitely deserves 10 stars. <br /> <br /> And yes, Aoki is fun :-D
