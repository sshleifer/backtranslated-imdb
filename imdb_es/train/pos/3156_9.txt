Like the characters in this program, I was also a teenager during the 70s. The producers really nailed the whole zeitgeist, from being a suburban teenager in the 70s. The fashions of the 70s, automobiles, furniture for Home, food and fashions are very authentic in this show. <br /> <br /> The show has a very talented cast, which combine very well with the camera. I really like the unique sequences of psychedelic style movies. No other show does camera tricks like this. These avant-garde film sequences really help to convey the camper style, which characterized the 70's era. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a very funny comedy. The only thing that bothers me about this program is its excessive dependence on cruel humor to generate laughter. In this way, I think this program tries to look a lot like Married with children. While Married with Children is a great comedy in itself, it is in bad taste that the creators of That 70s show, keep trying to imitate it. <br /> <br /> I recommend That 70s Show, mainly because of its nostalgia factor. However, it could be an even better show, if the writers relied more on witty dialogue, instead of obscene and tasteless jokes and jokes.
