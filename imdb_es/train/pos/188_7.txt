I'm a big fan of classic movies, but I just entered silent movies. Many silent films do not get my attention, but Show People is a notable exception. <br /> <br /> Marion Davies and William Haines are simply wonderful in this photo. Davies, in particular, shows a wide range as she transforms from a girl from a small laughing city to a star who takes herself a little too seriously. <br /> <br /> Show People is a fast-paced movie with a fantastic variety of cameos. For some of the biggest stars of the silent era. The movie caught my attention immediately and I actually forgot it was a silent movie. (I know that does not make much sense, but that's what happened). The actors are so skilled in their craft that few dialog cards are necessary. <br /> <br /> Show People is a perfect introduction to silent movies. It is an interesting and fast-paced movie with two of the best stars of the silent era. Add Hollywood satire and Show People should be on the "must see" list for all classic moviegoers.
