This film speaks a universal language; one can relate it to the self, the community, society or the world in general. It has a way not only to open several questions, but also to establish one in search of discovering and asking the right questions to reach that point of self-conviction / property. The description of the stereotypes within the film addresses the archetypes that surround us, which should be recognized as the repetitive cycle of destruction, the opposite force of innovation, creativity and growth. The factors that disturb the natural flow of things must be evident and addressed. The idea is definitely a film to be experienced and not only seen, since it touches one's own voice / inner consciousness through the gaze, it makes one feel as opposed to just looking.
