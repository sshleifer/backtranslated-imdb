Surprisingly good The performance was fun, the script was fun, the music was fun, the plot was tremendously fun. This was a fun movie to watch and to give your brain a break. The parts of the plot and the quotes seemed very creative to me. 7 out of 10. Actually, for what it was, it would deserve a 10 out of 10. You're not supposed to compare this to an artillery movie or a bloody Slasher movie.
