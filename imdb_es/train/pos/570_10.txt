Ashamed, I just saw this movie for the first time, 13 years after its release. It is a story that any father or brother can relate to ... a brother is a bit 'wild', the other brother is the typical older boy. Craig Sheffer is a bit too emotional as the older brother, but Pitt is amazing, and Skerritt is the perfect cast to be the father. The fishing scenes that were filmed in Montana are absolutely impressive ... I had no idea that fly fishing could be so attractive. The film follows the book closely, with only a few modifications to make it more appropriate for a film format. Unlike most stories in books and movies, it measures. It is a perfect movie for anyone who wants to spend a quiet night with a powerful film and something emotional.
