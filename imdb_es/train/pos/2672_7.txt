"The Journey of Hope" speaks of a poor Turkish family and their odyssey of hope, which plunges into despair as they travel to Switzerland in search of prosperity. Although this Oscar-winning film is pretty well crafted, it lacks substance and has many unlikeliness. Much of the film's 1.7 hours duration is getting on the bus, getting off the bus, getting on the boat, getting off the boat, getting into the truck, getting off the truck, etc .; Time that could have been better spent or excluded altogether. The story has a predictable conclusion, especially for those who are aware of the common crime of trafficking in illegal immigrants. A watch that is worthwhile and reasonably entertaining but overrated.
