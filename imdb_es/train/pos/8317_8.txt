['A remarkable example of cinematic alchemy in action, with a trivial piece of main script (written by Jole Schumacher, an enthusiastic and mediocre Hollywood, nothing less) that magically becomes a select piece of exquisitely bright 24-carat musical drama gold . thanks to the energetic direction, fresh and engaging performances, on-site production values, a flavorful recreation of the 1950s era in New York, a bluntly effervescent tone of roll-with-the-punches, and a rhythm and truly wonderful blues of the great Curtis Mayfield. <br /><br /> The story, loosely based on the real life exploits of the Supremes, prosaically documents the arduous climb from rich to rich of three impoverished, bright-eyed black teenagers desperately desperate to escape their ruinous and ungrateful ghetto situation and make it big. in the world of commercial music of R &amp; B. All the obvious evidences of instant wealth and success (egos are corrupted in a destructive way, drugs, corruption, the struggle to preserve their integrity, etc.) are exhibited in a predictable way, but fortunately the excellent work evident in the other departments of the film almost completely cancels the flat and uninspired plot of Schumacher. The first level performance helps a lot. Irene Cara, Lonette McKee and Dwan Smith are sensational sensual, vibrant and attractive, and are excellent singers. Comparatively, the excellent performances are also in charge of a charming and charming &quot;Vice&quot; of Miami, Philip Michael Thomas, as the patient and gentle man of the group, Dorian Harewood as the venal of McKee, the groom of an aggressively loving hunting dog , and the perennial blasting of the bad Tony Harlem, &quot;&quot; Bucktown &quot;) King as a nasty gangster, cold and dangerously seductive, of operation and stone.The tone descends and fits from funny and moving to melancholic and cheerful, without skipping the beat, Skillfully evolving into a brilliant and edifying ode to the extraordinary ability of the human spirit to effectively overcome extremely difficult and intimidating difficulties. <br /><br /> The veteran editor Sam O&#39;Stern is delivered to perfection in his directorial debut. The luminescent cinematography of Bruce Surtees and the expert edition of Gordon Scott are impeccable. O&#39;Stern&#39;s firm understanding of the atmosphere of the time, the good eye for the little ones, but small details, and the infallible sense of a busy and uninterrupted rhythm are just as impressive. Do not be fooled by the impeccable contributions of Curtis Mayfield&#39;s soundtrack. &quot;Salta&quot;, &quot;What can I do with this feeling&quot;, &quot;Renunciation&quot;, &quot;Take my hand, Precious Lord&quot;, &quot;Loving you baby&quot; and &quot;Look inside your heart&quot; are all incredibly silly, touching, almost incredibly fantastic songs, with the sweet and sensual number of love jones &quot;Something He Can Feel&quot;, which later covered both Aretha Franklin and En Vogue, who clearly recognize the highest musical honors as the best song of the entire movie. The net result of all these above-mentioned highlighted attributes persuasively illustrates that sometimes it is not so much the script as it is done with that script, which in turn determines the quality of the film in general.']
