I've seen tons of science fiction from the 70s; some terribly bad, and others thought, provocative and truly terrifying. Soylent Green fits into the latter category. Yes, sometimes it's a little cheesy, and yes, the furniture is good for a giggle or two, but part of the movie seems terribly prescient. Here we have a movie, 9 years before Blade Runner, who dares to imagine the future as something dark, frightening and nihilistic. Both Charlton Heston and Edward G. Robinson perform better than The Ten Commandments, and Robinson's assisted suicide scene is frightfully prescient of Kevorkian and his companions. Some of the attitudes are outdated (can you imagine a filmmaker who gets away with the concept of "women as furniture" in our 90s so politically correct?), But it is rare to find a Me Decade movie that really I can make you think This is one that I would love to see on the big screen, because even in a widescreen presentation, I do not think the overall scope of this film is worthy. Check it out.
