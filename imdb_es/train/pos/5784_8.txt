I have noticed that many people publish in "Kerching!" The board seems to hate this show, which actually seems very surprising to me. I think it's one of the best shows for British children out there. It is a shame that it ends because it is very funny (although a bit corny at times) and has great characters. The main character is a bit like Del Boy, although a lot smarter. With her 2 best friends, she tried to earn a million pounds for her mother by starting an online business and adopting a pseudonym of "Rudeboy". His friends are Seymour (who likes to cook) and Danny (who has a simple mentality and is a comic relief character). Throughout the show, some characters have left and new ones have arrived, but it has always been entertained and improved.
