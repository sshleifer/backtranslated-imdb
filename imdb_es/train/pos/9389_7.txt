Red Rock West (1993) <br /> <br /> Nicolas Cage becomes involved in a deadly crime without knowing it at first, and the dominoes increase the danger, adventure and misfortune in the wild American West of the years ninety. Red Rock West is often brutal and, sometimes, hilarious, and Cage brings out the mix with his usual sardonic wit and his caution. <br /> <br /> Is the plot over? Yes. Is Dennis Hopper perfect as a crazed, almost likeable killer? Yes. Does Cage have a chance? Well, you have to look and see. It never stops, and I was surprised the first time I saw it. In the second time I saw him yesterday, I was surprised at how well he held up, how well built he was and how macabre and fun he was at the same time. <br /> <br /> Director Ron Dahl (who also helped write) He is best known for his television work, but with Rounders and this film shows a skilled hand with sensational plots. He is saved by his humor by the way, and by the cartoons. The bar is of poor quality, the police questionable. And do not miss a truly inspired cameo from Dwight Yoakam as a truck driver.
