A funny little movie It is totally incredible, incredible, impossible. But it's funny how an introverted masochist can become totally dependent and hypnotized, even hypnotized by a girl he barely knows but who could get into his ghosts. Of course, it is a denunciation of the stupid deals you can get on the Internet. You must not believe ten percent of what you say there and never, never, ever accept to tie your hands in one way or another to someone or something or some organization you do not know personally. Most of your "businesses" will one way or another deceive you and attack you. But here the guy deserves to be a victim of such gangs because he is not only naive, but absurdly silly. But then the movie becomes funny because it ends when the crooked business victim has the advantage and ends up playing the same game with his victimizer and winning. A thought is safe too. Airport security in English is not exactly what it should be, but I think it is not better anywhere else in the world and even now they have reinforced all the rules and regulations, it's fun to go through their procedures and systematically thwart them. Then, they come to lose their luggage, a real plague in modern airports, and do not expect to get fair compensation. Or even confiscate a bottle opener or a can opener because it can be dangerous. I can see myself going through the side of the plane with a can opener. Funny is not it?
