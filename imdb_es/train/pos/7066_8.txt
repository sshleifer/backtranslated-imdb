This film is so old that I never realized how young Ray Milland looked in 1936, I remember him playing in a great movie, "Lost Weekend". Ray plays the role of Michael Stuart, who is a very rich banker. There are three girls in this photo who are not very happy that their father and mother separate and discover that their father is going to marry a young blonde who is a gold seeker who only looks for a rich and rich dad. They hire a man to pose as a very rich Count, his name is Count Ariszted, (Misha Auer) who is drunk all the time and does not have a penny and gives a lot of funny laughs throughout the image. Deanna Durbin, (Penny Craig) surprised everyone when she was hired at a police station and told the police chief that she was an opera star and then Penny starts singing with the most fantastic soprano voice I've ever heard, all the police department and the convicts began to applaud, which was a very entertaining and enjoyable scene from this movie. This is Deanna Durbin's first film debut, she became an instant hit overnight and became a big movie star at Universal Studios after leaving MGM.
