BSG is one of my favorite TV series of all time. I was lucky to start watching it when the series reached its final season. It was a marathon from start to finish for me and how amazing it was! <br /> <br /> As soon as I noticed the pilot on Hulu, I knew exactly what I was in, for the title, Caprica! Although, some things do not add up when comparing both series, they still run beautifully. There was no mention of the holobandas in Battlestar Galactica or the mention of virtual worlds, but perhaps you have not had enough in the series to explain why. <br /> <br /> I recommend this program to anyone who loves The universe, technology and alternative fantasies of our world. This show is very interesting and you will want to see more!
