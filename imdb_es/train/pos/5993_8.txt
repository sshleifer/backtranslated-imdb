The Cure uses voice-over to create an intense mood. Although the VO is responsible for all the lines of the film, surprisingly it does not take away the visual history. The use of multiple motion pictures adds a lot of texture to the story. The choice of combining b & w and color worked very well to improve jumps on time. The final will make you jump despite being able to anticipate the result. I especially liked the thrill of the suspense of the movie. The close-ups of the love scene are also charming and reflect an eye of good taste. The piece is quite short but achieves a lot. The adjusted edition really helps show what a short film can do. It's worth seeing more than once!
