I thought that this movie was very well made. Taking place in the mid-1950s, everything seemed right to me. It was well cast and credible. Normally I do not care much about this type of film, since they simply do not have depth, but I felt that this film delved into the characters and you could feel how they felt, you should really know and care about them. they. It took me to my youth and allowed me to remember a more innocent moment. This film can be enjoyed by men and women and by all ages. After the movie ended, I wished there was a second part. I wanted to know what happened to Dani and her family. This movie is destined to be a classic. If you have not seen it, you should try to catch it when it is on television or rent it ...
