The Three Stooges has always been one of the many actors I have loved. I love almost all the shorts that they have made. I love the six Stooges (Curly, Shemp, Moe, Larry, Joe and Curly Joe)! All the shorts are fun and also star many other great actors and actresses that many of them were in many of the shorts! In my opinion, The Three Stooges is one of the best actors in history and is the funniest comedy team of all time! <br /> <br /> One of my favorite Stooges shorts with Shemp is none other than Husbands Beware! All that appear in this short film are the beautiful Christine McIntyre, Dee Green, Doris Houck, Alyn Lockwood, Johnny Kascier, Nancy Saunders, Lu Leonard, Maxine Gates and Emil Sitka. Green and McIntyre offer great performances here! There are so many fun parts here. This is a very hilarious short. There are three other similar nuts, like this called Brideless Groom, and I recommend both!
