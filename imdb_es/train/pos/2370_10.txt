It's a great American martial arts movie. The fight scenes were quite impressive for the American movie made in the 90s. Of course, the fight scenes are not as good as in the Honk Kong movies, in fact, only some American movies have fight scenes as good as in the Honk Kong movies, even today. When you watch an American martial arts movie, you expect to see less impressive fighting scenes, but you still have some nice moves, which can be surprisingly good at times, or at least that's what I expect from these movies. I was impressed with this movie. Some fight scenes were really impressive, the acting, the direction and the plot were good enough, so it's really worth watching a movie, if you like the American martial arts movies of the 90s.
