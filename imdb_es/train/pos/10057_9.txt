I went to bed with my girlfriend last night, and while she brushed her teeth, I flipped through channels until I found this Chinese movie called The King of Masks. At first I thought it was going to be a Kung Fu movie, so I started watching it and then it captured me immediately and I had to finish it. <br /> <br /> The girl in the movie was absolutely adorable. She was a great actress for being so small. Maybe the fact that it was in Chinese, so the English was doubled, made it harder for me to say ... but she really seemed to be in character perfectly. I felt so bad for the girl while trying to please her "boss", but everything turned out to be rotten. hahaha Even when she brings him another grandson, just so he can transmit his art ... it turns out that the boy was kidnapped, so he is arrested and he has 5 days left to live. hahaha ... whatever you touch in an effort to be kind to your grandfather, it just becomes counterproductive. <br /> <br /> In the end, he sees how much love there is in her and teaches him the art of masks ... which is so comforting after all the setbacks in the movie. <br /> <br /> Definitely a gem, and totally original. <br /> <br /> Scott
