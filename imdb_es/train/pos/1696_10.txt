This is a cult thing. My friends and I meet once a year to enjoy this movie. It is very fun and very dry. I have seen this movement dozens of times and I have not yet enjoyed it. The actors are fun and improve with every visualization! If you enjoyed "space imbeciles" you will love this. A great work of War of the Worlds. I love the red-collar bustle to catch the aliens, the bug on the hood, the DOD, the populous annihilator looking for heat, the minefield, the red camouflage, breaking the speed limit at 1800 mph! "I'm going for the bucket!" Very funny. I would love for this to be on DVD! Forget about the negative reviews. Watch for yourself!
