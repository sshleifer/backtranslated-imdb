I remember seeing this on television in the late '70s, and it stayed with me! It is charming, noisy, colorful, a great movie for children. I put it for some friends at a party recently, and naturally they thought I was angry and they expected something bad to happen to the puppets "Meet the weak" But no, it's pure clean fun. <br /> <br /> jack wild is in good shape, as is mama cass, and the sorcerer poo in some attractive way. <br /> <br /> If you like banana rations and you are over 30 years old, this will recreate that surreal childhood on Saturday morning. Vibe! <br /> <br /> Even if I have now realized that Puf is a bit silly, since all he does is be captured and flee! Quality television movie: if, like me, you like death metal, you'll love it!
