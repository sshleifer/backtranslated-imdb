I was not sure what to expect from this movie considering its incredible collection of stars and directors, but in the end I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> For me, one of the highlights was the final episode with the American tourist. Speaking with a terrible French accent (which made me feel better with mine) it was actually quite moving and an excellent way to wrap the film. <br /> <br /> The story of the paramedic and the stinging victim was also very interesting. In movement and pure comedy, the brothers Coen and Steve Buscemi take the prize. Tom Tykwer's video was also impressive, although quite ambitious in its scope. <br /> <br /> However, the Bob Hoskins segment was totally shy and the vampire story was completely ridiculous. The dialogue in the section of Wes Craven also felt very forced and the history of Chinatown was completely incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> In general, this film is worth seeing for its good details and has a good ending. It's not too painful to sit through the bad sections, anyway they only last 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> Ca vaut the comb!
