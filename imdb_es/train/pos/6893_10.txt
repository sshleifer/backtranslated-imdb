Gerard Phillipe is absolutely perfect in this film, funny, tender, brave and loving. It gives a superior dimension to a film that is even a masterpiece, both by the other actors (Gina Lollobrigida: miaoooou!) As by the story or the rhythm. Never boring, always creating new emotions: for me, the best French film of all time.
