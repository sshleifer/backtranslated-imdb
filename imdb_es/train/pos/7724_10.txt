Of course Star Wars (a movie I've seen at least fifty times) outperforms all the others in special effects, but this movie has everything else! <br /> <br /> He has horror (not graphic), romance, robots, clever deals, intelligence, (surprisingly good) special effects and drama. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie a couple of years ago in a rebirth with a recently printed impression, and I was surprised at how well it held up today. I thought the old-style electronics of the 1940s would look bad, but somehow they looked futuristic and modern. <br /> <br /> Ann Francis here (mostly) short skirts and bare feet with a girl innocence that is hard to beat still gets a rise out of me. <br /> <br /> The monster Krell that appears in the ray rays still scares the Bejebees out of me. <br /> <br /> Of course we all know that the "Great Bird of the Galaxy" probably modeled much of "Star Trek" from this movie. <br /> <br /> No one has beaten Robby, the Robot, in terms of personality <br /> <br /> (sorry, R2D2 and C3PO). <br /> <br /> This movie, in general, is the standard that all other Science Fiction movies will have to measure! <br /> <br /> Honorable mention for the disturbing electronic score that kept us All in pins and needles.
