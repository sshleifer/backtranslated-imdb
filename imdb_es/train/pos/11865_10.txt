One day I heard some friends say that "Scarface sucks ... an idiot tried to make another set of Padrino in the early 80s". Now, I usually listen to the idiots / I watch CNN, so I decided that I would stay away from that. Then my partner handed me the DVD and said: "This is # 1 with the pelicangs", confused I tried. This is the best movie ever made. It's more realistic than all this crap about stolen car races that are too expensive for someone in that area to afford (* cough2Fast2Furiouspugh *) There's some humor ... that is, the Pelicangs and the 80s light music. Still, what is better than Al Pacino wielding a m203? I give this **** ****, perfect for fans of Al or GTA: Vice City.
