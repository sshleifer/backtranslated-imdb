I can tell you how bad this movie is. I was in the movie and I have not seen it yet, but I shudder to think that someone really paid to see me drunk. Especially considering what we did that year. The thing is that they have probably edited it in excess. Especially the scene in which my roommate was inhaling coke from the tits of a Mexican prostitute (probably should have followed him). We made some appearances to come and go, but other than that I can not remember anything. I was the MC in a few scenes (from what I have been told.) What I can tell you is that everyone avoided the camera crew, since they want to be remembered as the guy who vomited or the girl who showed her tits to the world (or the girl to whom the loser lost her virginity.) In general, the trip itself was crazy, but people act differently once the camera is on them.
