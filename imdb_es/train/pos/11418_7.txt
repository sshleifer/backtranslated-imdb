['The first time I saw this movie was during a course in International Film Studies. I am a &quot;non-traditional&quot; student and, perhaps for reasons of years of life or wisdom, I appreciated the slow and reflective rhythm of the narrative of the film. Despite the heat and dust of an arid climate, the story is deeply psychological, replete with multi-layered symbolism and an articulated inversion of the theme of being the &quot;Other&quot; in a land one does not understand. the understanding that does come is loaded with unresolved memories and the stranger&#39;s subjectivity. Made almost 20 years ago, it is also a forerunner in a genre of many other international films that explore colonial themes in colonized spaces, without having any idea of the nuances of the cultures in which they have entered. The works that have been made since then reflect the same themes: Indochine, nowhere in Africa are there two that, in comparison, make Chocolat look pale and boring. It has no adrenaline action or extreme violence. The struggles are mental, emotional and subtle. But, having said that, it&#39;s a good movie, it&#39;s worth seeing.']
