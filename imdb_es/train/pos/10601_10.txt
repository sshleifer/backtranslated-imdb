This very funny British comedy shows what could happen if a section of London, in this case Pimlico, declared itself independent of the rest of the United Kingdom and its laws, taxes and post-war restrictions. What would happen is the happy chaos. <br /> <br /> The explosion of a bomb in time of war leads to the discovery of ancient documents that show that Pimlico was ceded to the duchy of Burgundy centuries ago, a small historical note that was forgotten long ago. For the new Burgundians, however, this is an unexpected opportunity to live as they please, without any interference from Whitehall. <br /> <br /> Stanley Holloway is excellent as the minor city politician who suddenly finds himself as the leader of one of the smallest nations in the world. Dame Margaret Rutherford is a delight as a history teacher who is on Pimlico's side. Others in the cast are Hermione Baddeley, Paul Duplis, Naughton Wayne, Basil Radford and Sir Michael Hordern. <br /> <br /> Welcome to Burgundy!
