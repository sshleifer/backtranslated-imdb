Daniel Day Lewis is one of the best actors of our time and one of my favorites. It is amazing how much is thrown in each of the characters he plays to make them real. <br /> <br /> I remember that many years ago, we had a party in our house - the friends came, we were sitting around the table, eating, drinking wine, talking, laughing, having a good time. The TV was on: there was a movie that we did not pay much attention to. Then, suddenly, all of us stopped talking and laughing. The glasses did not tinkle, the forks did not move, the food cooled on the plates. We could not take our eyes off the screen where the young invalid whose whole body was against him and who only had control over his left foot, took a piece of chalk with his foot and for what seemed like eternity, tried to write just one word On the floor When he finished writing that single word, we all knew that we had witnessed not one but three triumphs: the triumph of human will and spirit, the triumph of cinema that was able to capture the moment like that in the film, and the The triumph of an actor who did not act, but who became his character. <br /> <br /> "My Left Foot" by Jim Sheridan is a fascinating and dramatic biological drama about Christy Brown, the man who was born with cerebral palsy in a Dublin suburb; who became an artist and writer and who found a love for his life. <br /> <br /> I like all the performances of Day Lewis (I have mixed feelings about his performance at GONY) but I think his most important role was Christy Brown on "My Left Foot"
