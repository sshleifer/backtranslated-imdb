Silly, hilarious, tragic, sad, inevitable. <br /> <br /> A group of disillusioned people joins an "experienced" criminal to get out of their poverty. Great idea ... if you ignore the error factor. <br /> <br /> It's good to see George Clooney doing something really fun for a change. The casting is perfect and the performance standards are very high. Although you could say that the theme of the motley crew is not new, I think this film handles it in an interesting and unique way. Enough to make it stand out from what has happened before. <br /> <br /> Very well done guys.
