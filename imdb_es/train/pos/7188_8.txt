Along with "King of the Rocket Men", this was repeated on BBC TV between the early and mid-eighties. If I were loading a time capsule of this period, these two series would definitely enter. <br /> <br /> Someone who sees it for the first time will think it is nonsense, but this is one of the best examples of "Serials". Don Del Oro will make you laugh (when I was little, my nickname for him was Mr. Dustbin's boss) and it was funny when they shot me and said: "Your bullets can not hurt me" and then stumbles, apparently less than happy. I also like the way he dispenses with Sebastian in the first episode. <br /> <br /> I saw him again because he had good memories from years ago, there are some good stunts and good music, he has the ingredients. you hope to include water, rocks, fugitive cars ... Apart from the first episode (with Ralph Faulkner), the game of swords was not as good as I remembered it, and yes, it presents the inevitable episode of "flashback"! He gets 8 out of 10 because he still suffers from slow rhythm, padding and other tricks. If you are interested in these series, I recommend William Witney's book, "In a Door, Into a Fight, Out a Door, Into a Chase", although there is only one small entry about this series.
