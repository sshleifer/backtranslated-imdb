The imperturbable William Powell. It is a pleasure to see him on the screen while making his way through situations without worries in the world. He always seems to be at the top of his game and shows little attention for anyone who doubts it. Murders are projects, just human beings. I have realized that this is a basic element of whodunnit. Apart from an occasional weeping widow, the victims fulfill the function of being the reason why the film exists. Nothing more. There are enough twists and turns to keep things interesting on the road and Powell is a master at this. There are a lot of political mistakes, especially when it comes to Asian artists. This is a bit difficult to take. The cast is excellent, and Curtiz's management is also a constant asset.
