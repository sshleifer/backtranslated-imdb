I rented this for my son who recently found interest on September 11th. He was a Kindergarten student at that time and had no idea what was going on. I liked the way it was told as a "documentary". If there was a movie that I would recommend watching on 9/11, this would be LA! You usually watch a movie that has actors that are well known. This movie did not have anyone known. Also, you watch a movie about September 11, you hear that a fireman or two lose their lives and save people. I did not feel that this had any of that! I just rented this movie and I would definitely consider adding it to my collection! Very well done! My heart is with the survivors and families of the victims of September 11!
