Time for a hit! <br /> <br /> Waqt Dir-Vipul Amrutlal Shah Cast- Amitabh Bachchan, Akshay Kumar, Priyanka Chopra, Shefali Shah, Rajpal Yadav and Boman Irani. Written by- Aatish Kapadia Rating- *** <br /> <br /> Eureka! We have it! Yes, ladies and gentlemen, in the "Waqt" of Vipul Shah, we have probably found this year's first good faith success. Packed with all the necessary ingredients of a commercial Bollywood fare, 'Waqt' has everything it takes for a movie to click with the Indian public. It's the kind of movie that makes a distributor feel happy and sees his next Phoren visit! In this 'saga of emotions of India', we have a happy family (is not that always?) Of three. Ishwar (Amitabh Bachchan), the postman turned into a millionaire (do not ask how! ... There's something about selling toys while giving out letters and all that, seriously, who cares!), Married to Sumi (Shefali Shah ) is a loving father to Aditya (Akshay Kumar). Ishwar has to make a serious decision about his son's careless attitude towards the responsibilities of life. His love for Aditya, however, translates into his procrastination of the serious issue. However, when faced with a situation that will test his career against time, Ishwar has no choice but to throw Aditya out of the house, hoping that the new situation will make him more aware of his own life. But this alleged solution becomes a problem in itself, as the break between the loving father-son and the fences continues to grow. <br /> <br /> It is not necessary to be a space scientist to realize that such a story offers ample opportunities to infuse comedy and drama alike. Therefore, before the interval you have the initially fun and then annoying comedy of Boman Irani and Rajpal Yadav; And after the interval are the moments of your handkerchiefs between Aby and Akki! The writer Aatish Kapadia (who also wrote the original work of Gujarati 'Aavjo Vhala Fari Malishu' on which the film is based) does a good job to maintain the flow of the narrative. Dialogs tend to be inconsistent at times. It does not help that the songs appear like acne on a teenage face and mark the procedures. Clearly, a couple of numbers could have been eliminated. On the managerial front, Vipul shows that he has a natural talent for telling stories. 'Waqt', as well as their previous 'Aankhen' debut effort, keep you interested until the last roll. On a personal note, the seesaw of emotions was a little abrupt for me. But taking into account the reactions of the audience, I was working to the fullest. <br /> <br /> Finally, 'Waqt' has to do with his performances that represent a whole point in the overall score! Amitabh Bachchan is reliable as always. His energy is visible and so is his age! Shefali throws in a performance with fine nuances and combines with the superstar at every step. Boman and Rajpal demolish the house with their histrionics. Priyanka has little to do that fulfill the essential role of a heroine. However, when everything is reduced, 'Waqt' is Akshay's vehicle. I have always maintained that Akki is as good as the role is. Put it on a 'Mujhse Shaadi Karogi' and it's fantastic, but on a 'Bewafaa' it's very bad. Here, Akki is probably at his best. Whether it's your comic moment or your emotional representations, it's almost perfect. There is also an action scene for his fans! Ironically, his previous best effort was in 'Aankhen', with the same director and Big B at his side! <br /> <br /> 'Waqt' is not a memorable movie. It is not one that will be presented in the best films of our industry. But it is one for the masses. And at a time when the industry is desperately hoping for universal success, 'Waqt' could do the trick! <br /> <br /> - Abhishek Bandekar <br /> <br /> Trivia: this is Akshay Kumar's second consecutive movie after 'Bewafaa', in which she performs on stage during the climax! <br /> <br /> Rating- *** <br /> <br /> * Poor ** Average *** Good *** * Very good ***** Excellent <br /> <br /> April 22, 2005
