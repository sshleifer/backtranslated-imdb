When I heard that "Hammerhead" was released on DVD and I finally found it in my local DVD store, I thought "well, just another movie of cheap Nu Image monsters". Those guys who surround Boaz Davidson and Avi Lerner produced cheap but very entertaining B-B images in recent months but also some very disappointing movies. So I did not expect much, especially after having seen the disappointing "Shark Zone" a few days before. But "Hammerhead" turned out to be an excellent rebirth of the monster movies of the 1950s. We have a mad scientist, a group of people in a dangerous situation, screaming women and maidens in distress, man-eating plants and, of course, , we have the creature, a huge mutant mix between a man and a hammerhead shark. Everything you need for a fun monster movie. The only thing missing are the graphic scenes of sex and the nudity that you expect in films of this type, but since the film was made for television, it is understandable why these scenes are missing. And it does not matter anyway because "Hammerhead" is the best in action and horror. However, there are two reasons why I gave seven out of ten points: first, the monster is not seen very often and the confrontation with the destruction of the creature is too fast and wrong, and secondly, William Forsythe simply He is not the right man for the part of the "hero" and to fall in love with the magnificent Hunter Tylo. Apart from that, I can recommend this movie to any fan of the monster movies out there. Have a cool drink and some popcorn, watch this movie and have fun. Jasper P. Morgan
