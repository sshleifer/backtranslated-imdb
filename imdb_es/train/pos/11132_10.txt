['Jon Voight plays a man named Joe. Joe is shaken by a disturbing childhood. He has a strong fear and hatred of religion due to his traumatic baptism. He leaves his job as a dishwasher and goes out to become a scammer for the rich. Meet a misfit named Ratso (Dustin Hoffman) and the two for a relationship. They go out and work together to help each other. They become thieves. The two grow remarkably close and soon they can not live without one another. However, there is something very important that Ratso has not told Joe, and could destroy any hope they have of surviving the city together. This is one of the best movies ever made. It is a heartbreaking and devastating portrait of too lonely men who have nothing to lose except one for the other. Its history is devastating to see, but ultimately it is important for people to see it. It&#39;s one of those movies where the characters are almost like crazy people who sometimes find themselves on the street. The difference is that this movie is from your perspective. They show us their lives and it&#39;s devastating to see the pedestrians in this movie treat them like crap, especially if we were ever one of those people. However, the movie is not about blaming you. Instead, it shows you the rough side of the hustle lifestyle. It is not a pleasant and simple lifestyle as shown by many Hollywood films, such as MILK MONEY and PRETTY WOMAN. The lifestyle of being a male con man is a dirty, gritty and ugly life, and it&#39;s sad that people have degraded as Joe&#39;s character does in this movie. What surprised me most about this movie was that it came out in 1969, and it has stood the test of time to perfection. Today&#39;s audiences will still find great meaning in this film and they will continue to love and appreciate it as critics and audiences everywhere did in 1969. The film received a rating of X, but what I noticed about this film is that Sexuality is presented in a much more honest, realistic and effective way. Anyone who has had sex before will know how funny, clumsy and scary it can be and this movie is not scared at all of that. The sex in this movie may not be as graphic as it was once thought. The films that were rated with X, such as MIDNIGHT COWBOY, A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, GREETINGS, LAST TANGO IN Paris and FRITZ THE CAT, seem incredibly tame compared to the shocking things that people can get with an R rating today. The sex scenes in MIDNIGHT COWBOY will look pretty strong but they certainly are not attractive. They are not graphics, but they are realistic, and that is what people should keep in mind when they watch this movie. The language of the course used in the film, particularly the word &quot;fag&quot; is used effectively and is not free. The violence is very shocking to see even today, but again it is necessary that the plot represents the world of a con man. I am really happy to see that MIDNIGHT COWBOY is not dated and is still as affective as it was in 1969, if not more so. I can not recommend this classic enough and I hope it continues to find an audience because it really is a very special and unforgettable experience that will not be forgotten soon. <br /><br /> PROS: <br /><br /> -Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman are frightening and amazing to watch. They have never played roles like this before or since and they are completely different from the usual. You will forget who plays them in minutes! <br /><br /> -Beautiful score <br /><br /> -Not at all dated or like many of the movies of that decade that come out today. <br /><br /> -Fantastic and fast editing work. <br /><br /> CONS: <br /><br /> -For mature audiences only <br /><br /> -The first scenes are well done, but could be a little stronger.']
