Great movie when I saw it. I have to say one of my favorite movies of all time. I saw him like 8 times in the theater and I got the DVD. As I grew up and saw it again, I realized that the movie is normal. Compared to movies that are known as good comedies, this is nothing. I mean Rock was hilarious in the movie and all the change with the racial theme breaks the barriers a bit, which is great. Also the thought of how the movie is going is a good way of thinking. It's like most of those thought of in a movie, but also a little twist, which is a very nice touch. I like the movie in general, so I give it a ... <br /> <br /> It's still a good 7/10 for me.
