Telemundo should definitely consider making a DVD collection of the Xica novel! I know many people, including myself, who would like to buy the Xica novel! It is a very entertaining novel that takes place in Brazil. The costumes worn by the actors are beautiful and the city in which the novel is developed is beautiful. Xica contains a lot of history from that period of time. I hope Telemundo will televise it again, even if it's at 2 in the morning. I would highly recommend seeing Xica if it ever shows up again on Telemundo. I have already sent an email to Telemundo a million times to show the novel again, but my pleas have fallen on deaf ears. The only warning statement about Xica is that it occasionally contains some difficult scenes, therefore, I would recommend that children under 14 not see Xica. In general Xica deserves a 10 out of 10!
