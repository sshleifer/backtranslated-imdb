This typical Mamet movie offers a calm and balanced view of what makes a man of trust (Joe Mantegna) good. Explored as a psychological study by a well-known psychologist (Lindsay Crouse), he slowly takes her into his world with the usual unpleasant consequences. The cast includes several of the players found in several of Mamet's films (Steven Goldstein, Jack Wallace, Ricky Jay, Andy Potok, Allen Soule, William H. Macy), and they do their usual good work. I loved Lindsay Crouse in this film, and I've often wondered why she did not become a more outstanding player than she has become. Maybe I'm not looking in the right places! <br /> <br /> The film proceeds at a slow pace, with a flat dialogue, but maintains a level of tension in everything that logically leads to the end of the outbreak. You would expect a real disappointment in the end, but I found it rewarding and satisfying. I love this movie!
