No movie with Dennis Hopper, Gary Busey, Erika Eleniak, Tom Berenger, Dean Stockwell, Marilu Henner deserves a rating below 5 here. This is a poor version of movies like 16 blocks or the timeless midnight race, except that the prisoner being transported here is very easy for the eye, Mrs. Eleniak. Tom Berenger plays well with another rough, rebellious military guy and William McNamara plays his rookie about to be discharged. The plot is absurd because I lost count of the times that Eleniak should have escaped and could have escaped, but this is an entertaining movie to feel good and there are good cameos from all the previous actors that make the film keep rolling. This is not really a family movie, as there are some oaths and a rare scene of nudes with eleniak, but it is much better than some of the other imitations that emerged in this era.
