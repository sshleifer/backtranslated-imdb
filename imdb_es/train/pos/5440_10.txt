A trio of friends, sergeants, all in the British army, carouse and fight through imperial India. Intensely loyal to each other, they face their greatest and deadliest challenge when they encounter the resurgence of a horrible cult and their insane and implacable guru. Now they must trust the most humble servant of the regiment, the GUNGA DIN water carrier, to save the Queen's soldiers from a certain massacre. <br /> <br /> Based more on The Three Musketeers than on Kipling's classic poem, this is a wonderful epic adventure: a fitting entry into the Golden Year of Hollywood of 1939. Full of suspense and humor, while maintaining the romantic interludes to the minimum, catch the interest of the viewer and hold it to the conclusion (sentimental). <br /> <br /> It is practically unsuccessful to discuss the nuances of performance of the three stars, Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen and Douglas Fairbanks Jr., since they really are thirds of a single organism: inseparable and, for all intents and purposes. and ends, indistinguishable. However, this does not diminish any of the great fun simply by watching them spend a glorious time. <br /> <br /> (It is interesting to note, in parentheses, that McLaglen boasted a distinguished military career from World War I. Fairbanks would have an excellent record in World War II, mainly in clandestine affairs and earning nothing less. that four honorary knights titles after the conflict, while, reportedly, Grant worked in a covert way for British Intelligence, watching the sympathizers of the Hollywood Nazis.) <br /> <br /> The true laurels that Act here should go to Sam Jaffe, heartbreaking in the title role. It infuses the humble man with radiant dignity and enormous courage, making the last line of Kipling's poem sound true. He is unforgettable. <br /> <br /> Montague's love is appropriately unconditional as the regimental major, while Eduardo Ciannelli is the Incarnate of Evil as the guru of the Thuggee. The rest of the cast, Joan Fontaine, Robert Coote, Lumsden Hare, are effective but have little to do. The movie geniuses will recognize Cecil Kellaway in the small role of Miss Fontaine's father. <br /> <br /> The movie chooses its villains well. The demonic cult Thuggee, worshiper of the frightful, blood-soaked Kali, Hindu goddess of destruction, was the bane of Indian life for 6 centuries, and ritually strangled up to 30,000 victims per year. In 1840, the British army, in cooperation with several princely states, ultimately succeeded in suppressing religion. From now on, it would still be the subject of novels and nightmares.
