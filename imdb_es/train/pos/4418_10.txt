['I saw this at the Hawaii Film Festival, where the director and his wife (who produced it) held a question and answer session afterwards. <br /><br /> It was hard for me to believe that this is the first director and all the congratulations to Harvey Keitel for once again, taking risks and taking risks for a script that he liked. <br /><br /> Undoubtedly, a reminiscence of Cinema Paradiso, tells the story of the young director about the revolution in Cuba. However, do not expect this to be a film about the revolution, your political stance is wonderfully ambiguous. Many references to the obvious love of directors for the history of cinema (a great tribute to the &quot;bicycle thief&quot;) and some whimsical scenes that work without being pretentious. <br /><br /> Enjoy!']
