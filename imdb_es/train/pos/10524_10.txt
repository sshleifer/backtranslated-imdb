Jane Austen would definitely approve this! <br /> <br /> Gwyneth Paltrow does an amazing job capturing Emma's attitude. She is fun without being overly silly, but elegant. She has a very convincing British accent (not being British, maybe I'm not the best judge, but she cheated on me ... she was also excellent at "Sliding Doors" ... Sometimes I forget she's American ~!). <br /> <br /> Jeremy Northam and Sophie Thompson and Phyllida Law (the sister and mother of Emma Thompson) are also brilliant as the Bates women. They almost stole the program ... and Mrs. Law does not even have lines! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
