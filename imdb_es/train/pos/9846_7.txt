Ok, at first it looked like "Shrek", the loner that is followed by comic relief. Then, it becomes something really convincing, as the glove is established. And the result is a nice movie, which has moments in which I agree that they are too dramatic for children to see (Manny's past, for example). Obviously, the premise has been worked for a long time, so that they can succeed in making a movie set almost without different sets (only ice caps and rocks) and three characters. It's good to know that they manage to do something emotional from that. Like I said, it can be a jolt of tears on some occasions, so, children, be careful. The real disappointment is the animation. This was not as improved as the Toy Story or Shrek movies, and it shows. Humans are not realistic, and we have seen better examples of CGI before. But do not let this stain the record: as a solo effort, "Ice Age" is praiseworthy. And it will gather many fans, I have no doubts. Oh, and yes, the moments with that little mouse are priceless and are a show stolen.
