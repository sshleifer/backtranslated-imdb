Personally, I despise the Jerry Springer show, however, I found "Ringmaster" as the funniest movie I've seen this year. The endless satire of "guests" by Jerry Springer that begins in the opening scene keeps you laughing throughout the film. Despite a brief scene in which Jerry Springer makes a feeble attempt to justify his existence, I definitely recommend this movie for its entertainment value.
