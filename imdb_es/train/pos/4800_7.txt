['I entered The Straight Story expecting a sad / happy type drama with good direction and good acting. These I have What I did not expect was an allegory of the judgments of human existence. Let Lynch take a simple story about a 300-mile journey on a lawnmower and make it a microcosm for the human condition. <br /><br /> If you did not notice it, see it again, pay attention to the ages of the people Alvin is with, the terrain he is driving, the reactions that people give him, the type of discussions he has (one of the first is about pregnancy and children, one of the last is outside a cemetery). The last road that leads is particularly disturbing in this context, as it narrows and their fear and nervousness increase. The last mechanical failure could be seen as a death, and the miraculous rebirth of its engine in relation to a life after death, in which it achieves the desired reunion. <br /><br /> I just hope that some of the people who rated this as a slow and slow melodrama take the time to see with more holistic attention.']
