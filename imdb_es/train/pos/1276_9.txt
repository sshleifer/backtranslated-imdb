I love this movie. The black imagery combined with Spillane's sensible character, Mike Hammer, works wonderfully to create an environment and feel seldom in the low-budget detective films of the early fifties. It may not be "The Maltese Falcon", but this film makes its own solid contribution to the genre. Spillane is often criticized for alleged misogyny, etc., but his "ladies" are far above their male counterparts in terms of cunning and intelligence. Poor Mike Hammer, as interpreted by Biff Elliott, is blinded by the beauty of the mysterious psychiatrist whom he finds when investigating the death of a comrade in the army. When the penny finally falls his face is an image. It is good to see that the censorship of the 1950s did not force the filmmakers to omit the famous last line. A low budget classic in good faith.
