I do not know what the previous reviewer was looking at, but I guess that's what the reviews are, the personal taste. What was lacking in this film was the depth, a very deep film, many layers of emotion, that affect. Hidden currents of love withheld due to submission to the beliefs of society, the taboos of times and classes, racial relations are not in a very good state of equality, guilt, longing, hatred, confusion, very emotionally dark, I thought, under the skin, you have To submit to the air of it, a fluid film, not as slow as was said before, let yourself be carried away by the current of the film, the emotions will be shown, the characters will reveal their defects, their unpleasant interiors , excellent and, really, very cruel!
