Summary: The morning after his bachelor party, Paul is awakened by his future mother-in-law and discovers that there is a woman sleeping next to him. Unfortunately, she is a waitress at the bar, and not her fianc√©e. And suddenly he appears everywhere ... the toll booth on the highway and his in-laws' dinner. And it's hard to keep a secret when her ex-boyfriend, jealous, had him followed and photographed. It's not just about saving your wedding ... it's about surviving. <br /> <br /> Comments: Actually, much better than expected. Not the sweet romantic comedy I expected, but something much more fun, something with a little advantage. This movie was not afraid to take the jokes a little further. And Jason Lee now does how to offer comedy, especially when his character is half scared and in trouble, because he is here. And he got the support of the beautiful ladies Julia Stiles and Selma Blair. And actually I thought that Lochlyn Munro did a good part as an ex. <br /> <br /> So, more emphasis on comedy than romance, and the end result was good. I enjoyed it a lot. <br /> <br /> 7/10
