Ossessione is in very bad condition, but is now in the process of being restored at the Digital Film Lab in Copenhagen. The material used is a "positive Master" 2nd generation, originally from the impression that Visconti managed to hide from the fascists. It has been scanned in the Spirit 4K (as 2K RGB data) and then processed with the DaVinci Revival restoration software. After this, the rest is manual labor and we do not anticipate that we will finish before the beginning of spring. Sometime next year it should be available on DVD and, hopefully, also be released on HD DVD. This film is beautiful and we hope that many generations will come to enjoy the restoration effort.
