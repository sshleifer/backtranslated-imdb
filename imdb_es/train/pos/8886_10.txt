['I was not alive in the &#39;60s, so I can not guarantee that this movie was a completely accurate representation of the period, but it is certainly a moving and satisfying experience. There are some excellent performances, especially by Josh Hamilton (of With Honors), Jerry O&#39;Connell (Sliders), who play the brothers divided by the war. Bill Smitrovich, a character actor who has been ignored by many for a long time, offers a heartfelt performance as his strict father, who is forced to question his own beliefs and values when one of his children is proud to go to Vietnam but it comes back empty. Inside, while the other is exactly the opposite. In short, this is a powerful and comforting film that I hope everyone will have the opportunity to experience.']
