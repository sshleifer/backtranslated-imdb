I loved this movie, seen tonight on a big movie screen. The audience laughed out loud at some very interesting things, and the fast pace was the most pleasant. <br /> <br /> I, as a singer and music director, questioned a section of Roby Keeler's voice in "By a Waterfall". "The key modulated, and suddenly she was singing much lower, with a very soft voice that did not look at all like the twitter voice a bit like a can that she used in all her other voices. <br /> < br /> Does anyone know if this was dubbed by another singer? It sounds like it to me, I'd love to know. <br /> <br /> Thank you very much.
