Woohoo! This is a good movie! The performance was not good at all, but if you watch some moments in the movie, rewind and see it again, it's great! The man at the beginning of the film walks with his suitcase against a three. WOW! I never expected that. Then he puts the coca in a suitcase and runs off. I bet the smoker against that three was one of his peers who sold the drugs later. And the genius quotes: '' nice tones, I need a pair '' '' yours, if you think you can take them ... '' ... simply great! And the fight is the best I've seen in a long time. Look at the second man he knocks down after hitting the head of the first one against the table. What a blow! And in the middle of the movie, a guy in a car filmed once, then 3 guys fall, he's very good at pointing. It costs a lot of money to hire these guys like him. The end was brilliant, it was so exciting that James Cahill walks 5 minutes up and down the stairs and shooting Jason Peters after his distracting movements. Jason Peters falls and rolls again while he is dead! I can not say with more words how great this movie is!
