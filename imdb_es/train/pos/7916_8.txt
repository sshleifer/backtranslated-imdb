Well, well ... Roeg touched a little nerve there, right? He was a genius as he was cataloging the descents of his various characters to psychosis for a couple of decades, but as soon as he has the bad taste to suggest that redemption (or even some good advice) could be found in the bad Catholic church. , the multitude of more modern movies that you can be extravagant. Worse, the character of Theresa Russell - confronted with experiences that nothing in their recognized rationalist vision has an explanation, is forced to face those experiences on another level: the spiritual. You know, the realm of the ignorant and superstitious, the kind of things that moviegoers in art houses are supposed to be up to. Oh, the horror ... Then, she finds her marriage, the idea that it could be a singularly important commitment, affirmed by what seems to be divine intervention. People who find this idea offensively at first sight may perhaps wonder why they jump instinctively to the mode of attack when challenged to take seriously the idea of ​​a spiritual dimension in their lives. But probably they will not. Of course, this movie has some problems, in particular the delirious work of Talia Shire as the overexcited nun, the attire in the style of the 50s and all. And the dialogue between Marie Davenport and the young priest in her last scene comes directly from the Spellbound School of Glib Interpretations (although Hitchcock's film escaped similar charges because of the source of wisdom that has impeccably secular credentials as a Freudian psychoanalyst). But, unfortunately, Nicolas Roeg seems to have faced a critical critique both for asking the question and for the possible answers that this film presents.
