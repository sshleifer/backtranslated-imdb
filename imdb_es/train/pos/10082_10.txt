['The film is truly moving, unique and uplifting. History is universal, since it is a battle between good, evil and the intermediate world. The MOST IMPORTANT thing is that its classification is erroneous, deceptive and a parody. Blockbuster has described it as if it were an X-rated movie. The truth is that it is closer to G than to PG and should be seen by children who can read clear and simple subtitles.']
