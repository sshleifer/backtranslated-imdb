No, this is not Alice's fairy tale, my friends! This fable of "Wonderland" is based on the true story of the horrendous and bloody murders of Wonderland that occurred in California in the 80s. At the center of this bloodbath was none other than Johnny Wad himself . Yes, John Holmes! Papa ding-dong used other shotguns than his infamous 13-inch milk machine. In addition to being a legendary adult film actor, Holmes was also a drug addict who befriended several Hollywood addicts. Val Kilmer was occasionally majestic as Holmes, but for once, this Holmes character did not completely swallow him up. The film features a "who's who" of supporting players: Josh Lucas and Dylan Mcdermott as Hollywood riffraffs, Kate Bosworth and Lisa Kudrow as the women in Holmes' life, and Eric Bogosian as a menacing businessman from Tinsletown. These characters play integral parts, directly or indirectly, in the 'Wonderland' murders. Out of this support group, it was Josh Lucas, the most ferocious and impressive as the fiery Ron Launius. Lucas is gradually becoming a major Hollywood player with such charismatic twists in "A Beautiful Mind" and "Sweet Home Alabama." The director James Cox at some point proved to be a bit coxsucker to show a lot of scenes too widespread, like the famous body of Holmes. Holmes was finally acquitted of the 'Wonderland' murders. He died of complications from the AIDS virus. `Wonderland 'will keep you wondering what really happened that damn night, and if Holmes really deployed his weapon. Ups! Holmes movie wrong! In agreement! That's enough before I 'penetrate' I mean penalized. Goodbye Holmies! *** Average
