he is the narcissist and manipulator par excellence; in this case, the lawyer (and murderer) Tom Capano. <br /> <br /> Kathryn Morris is sympathetic to the victim, Anne Marie Fahey, but at the beginning she is too much the victim. We regret the situation, but at the same time we were disgusted to see that he was also the victim of other women (including Rachel Ward). <br /> <br /> The sad thing is that you are actually getting help with your self-esteem. problems, and Capano had actually killed his psychologist. Pretty hard to believe, but this was based on a true story. <br /> <br /> There is a cameo with Olympia Dukakis (excellent) as the mother of Capano. In general, an interesting story because it is based on a real murder, and you will want to read Ann Rule's book to get the precise details. 8/10.
