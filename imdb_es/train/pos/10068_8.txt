This movie was excellent. A sad truth about how culture tends to clash with the sexes. This is just a great kind of warm and fuzzy film. You have the teacher who is steeped in tradition and good-hearted in his own way, Doggie, despite being a girl to win their affections, and crown him with a cute monkey with a thousand facial expressions. This amounts to a great happy movie at the end. This movie does a good job of showing how steep the tradition can be, so drenched that they are willing to die without sharing their secrets. You see the sides of a culture never before seen that helps to improve the drama that develops near the end of the image. The film photography is excellent, particularly the opening sequence of the parade with all the sparks. Limit of being in contention for the Oscar for the best foreign film.
