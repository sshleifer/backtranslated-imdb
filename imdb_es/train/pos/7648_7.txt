I admit that I have a weakness for alternative history stories, from ITS A WONDERFUL LIFE to GROUNDHOG DAY until 12:01. Among those great is this little gem. It is quite difficult to go through MR. DESTINY without giving a gesture of thanks to each and every one of the cast members, from the good heart James Belushi to the murderer Courtney Cox. This movie lacks gravity and scale to make it a great movie, but it is an excellent animation on a rainy afternoon. It is also a great rental for a cheap date.
