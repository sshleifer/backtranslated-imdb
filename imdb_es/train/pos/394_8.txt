['This is an incredible return of the brain director of the film, Tsui Hark. It is one of the few films that deserves a face-to-face encounter with Steven Chow&#39;s Shaolin Soccer. From the moment the movie started, there were amazing backgrounds on each edge that were <br /><br /> Deployed with excellent style. If you are a &quot;geek&quot; of science fiction or Chinese martial arts, you will love the excessive amounts of many 3D effects and realistic weapons generated by computer. Here comes a good performance (as always) by Ekin Cheung who plays &quot;Sky King&quot;. Allied with Louis Koo (Red), who was very impressed by his flexible &quot;wing&quot; that diverted incoming attacks. The fighting movements of these actors were competent in every way. Not only is the action excellent, but it has a somewhat complex plot. Many critics of this film complain about the lack of history / theme or simply &quot;pushed into random fragments&quot; and even describe them as &quot;The Legend of Poo&quot;. However, the viewer can not trust to see Dragon Ballz and other similar Manga Cartoons to understand this movie. Others who are familiar with the &quot;Wu Xia&quot; movies will have a better appointment. In due respect. There may be a weakness that could be foreseen. The blow that was delivered to the enemy in the last scene of the fight could have been more substantial and devastatingly done. Despite all this, you have to see it.']
