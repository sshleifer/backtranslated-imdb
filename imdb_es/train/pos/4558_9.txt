MY LEFT FOOT, in my opinion, is an excellent biography about one of the most talented authors and painters in the world. The performances were sensational, the soundtrack was great and the casting was perfect. I thought Christy (Daniel Day-Lewis) was a very talented man, although I could not understand what he said most of the time. Also, when he threw a tantrum, I got a little scared. Also, it's so sad that he suffered from cerebral palsy. In conclusion, if you're a Daniel Day-Lewis fan or you like biopics, I recommend this great biopic about one of the most talented authors and painters in the world. A real pleasure and a good time awaits you, so do not miss it.
