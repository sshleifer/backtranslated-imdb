I agree with all the compliments, I went through a box of tissues watching this movie. It had a harsh authenticity and it came true in every way. <br /> <br /> The question that I am about to raise represents a current sensitivity regarding the treatment of animals. I had a very difficult time with the beginning of the slaughter of sheep and goats, and the dying deer with its throbbing neck and its accumulated blood while its life was slipping was horrible. <br /> <br /> This is the era of "no animal They were wounded in the production of this movement". Iphigenia was made in the late 70's before the advent of computer simulation. Was it possible to feign these animal deaths? Or were these animals sacrificed by art?
