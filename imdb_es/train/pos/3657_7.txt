This film is like a 1950 version of Brutti sporchi e cattivi by Ettore Scola. Less sex and less realism, but a story with great humanism and warmth. I would not call this a neo-realistic image. It is very sentimental and more like a fairy tale, and probably should be classified as a comedy, although it is about serious issues (a bit like Chaplin or comedy of 1930). The typical Italian, however, is very emotional and difficult to resist, except for a cold person like stone. Sentimentality is a disappointment, although this image does not pretend to be a realistic drama. It is not a masterpiece like Umberto D or The Bicycle Thief. But it is an adorable and hilarious comedy, with good music. <br /> <br /> 7/10
