A common plot in the movies consists of the main characters who leave behind the hustle and bustle of the city, and are in the tranquility of nature. In the power of Kangwon province, we are shown two stories of people doing just that, trying to find themselves through a trip to the popular Korean parks in the mountains of Kangwon province. However, instead of epiphanic moments, we have two characters whose trip to nature was just another escape. <br /> <br /> The rhythm of this movie is slow, contemplative. We learn in the end what really brought everyone to the province of Kangwon and we learn how they are connected. For those who want Hollywood glam and for a movie to give them a definitive answer, this movie will not satisfy. But for those who want a movie that leaves them thinking, wondering and affecting them years later, this film will satisfy that longing.
