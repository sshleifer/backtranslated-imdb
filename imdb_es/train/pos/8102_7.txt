Things to Come is a historical movie. Together with Metropolis (1927), it stands as one of the first great science fiction shows. It is also one of the first films of the end of the world. It is remarkable how filmmakers predict the beginning of World War II within a year, and even, subtly, the year it would end in the real world. But then the film moves away from reality and shows a world devastated by war (only substitutes poisonous gas for nuclear weapons that, of course, did not exist in 1936). <br /> <br /> The last half hour of the film is an incredible sight, using innovative models and matte paintings, to later become basic elements of the science fiction genre. It is sad that, after Things to come, science fiction was identified with low-cost films, a stereotype that would not break until 2001: a space odyssey more than 30 years later. If they had stayed with the quality of the effects in this movie, things would have been very different in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Raymond Massey and some of his castmates play multiple roles in this film, for a good effect. Massey plays a big role similar to "Doctor Who" as a pilot of an advanced civilization (for 1970) that tries to win over the population of a devastated country ruled by a simple-minded warlord (a very effective performance by Ralph Richardson ). Ultimately, the argument covers 100 years. But that's a big problem with this movie: there really is not a cohesive plot. <br /> <br /> Perhaps in such an episodic film, in a way it reminds of intolerance, it is difficult to have a conventional plot, but I felt that more material could have been made, and although the images in the last third of the image are really amazing and are worth the price of admission ... the plot does not exist and the film itself ends suddenly as it is getting interesting Maybe the producers were thinking of another future science fiction innovation: a sequel? <br /> <br /> Things to Come is a movie that all science fiction fans should watch at least once. Unlike Metropolis, however, it may not support repeated presentations.
