It was only on my second visit, years later, that I realized two things about this movie: 1) I enjoyed it immensely, and 2) that its execution is decidedly sharper than the premise itself. I had laughed my way through the film before I could think of renewing my initial protests: valley voices, follies, and aerodynamic heads (even aerodynamic heads with good and good health) are simply not intrinsically funny, especially when they extend to the length of the feature film. But even though the momentum of the film begins to fade towards the end, Reeves and Winter and Sadler (and Hal Landon Jr. in an unforgettable scene) show such an extraordinary sense of comic timing that even the most clumsy jokes (for example , Ted not recognizing a certain inhabitant of hell) works as easily as the witter (for example, the challenge). And the team of Winter and Reeves click so well that the team of Bill and Ted (who spend only one scene separated in the whole movie, disaster if they are not well matched) appears without restrictions. <br /> <br /> (Side note: it seems to me that the first film is only sporadically entertaining, it seems that there are very different comic sensibilities there). <br /> <br /> I give it a 7.75. Surprisingly good fun.
