After dipping his fingers in the pool of giallo with the masterful film "The Strange Vice of Mrs. Wardh" (1971), the director Sergio Martino followed that same year with what turned out to be another thriller of twisted suspense, "The Case of the Scorpion's Cola. " As in his previous effort, this protagonist of the handsome male macho George Hilton, who would star in the satanic / giallo hybrid of Martino "All colors of darkness" the following year. "Scorpion's Tail" also features the actors Luigi Pistilli and Anita Strindberg, who would play an unhappy couple (to put it mildly) in Martino "Your vice is a closed room and only I have the key" (1972). (I love that title!) I guess Edwige Fenech was busy the month they filmed this! Anyway, this film has the elegant direction Martino fans expected, as well as a twisted plot, some well-executed murder scenes and the beautiful shooting at the Athens site. The story this time refers to an insurance investigator (Hilton) and a journalist (Strindberg, who here looks like Farrah Fawcett's prettiest and most intelligent sister) who is involved in a series of grisly murders after a plane crash and the inheritance of $ 1 million for a beautiful widow. I really thought I had discovered this image in half, but I was very wrong. Although the plot does not make much sense in this giallo, you may have to watch the movie again to fully appreciate all its subtleties. The highlight of the image, for me, was Anita's cat-and-mouse fight with the assassin at the end, a particularly intriguing assault on the house and an ingenious fight over a tiled roof; Lots of good bursts of action in this movie! You have to thank the good people of No Shame for another DVD of excellent appearance, with nice subtitles and interesting extras. It has become a great outfit, in its continuous search to recover these Italian gems lost from oblivion.
