Yesterday I saw this movie for the third time. It was recommended to me by a fried guy several weeks ago. I never saw it or noticed it before, because it falls (so typically) in the category "Swedish film" and those who rose (like me) with Hollywood productions tend to be skeptical of any foreign film. What a hell of a paradigm shift! The film touches me, because it only keeps my hope, that humanity can change in a better way. The Swedish people are just a pattern for all areas of the earth where people live together: controlled by religion, misunderstandings, lack of courage, predictions, disguised brutality, but also the ability to have fun, meet, sing ... You need a trigger from the outside to pull off the masks of everyone (who keep one) and make them feel that we are all human beings with the desire to live our own lives. I can never stop seeing stories like this, because that keeps my hope as described above. The five minutes that contain the story of Gabriella's song, including her performance, is one of the highlights of my movie! Thanks Kay Pollak just for these 5 minutes, what made me happy!
