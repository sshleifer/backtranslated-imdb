"Hotel du Nord" is the only Carné film from the 1936-1946 era that has dialogues not written by Jacques Prévert, but by Henri Jeanson. Janson was much more interested in the Jouvet / Arletty couple than in the couple of lovers, Annabella / Aumont. This last one is quite insipid, and its history strangely remembers the song "les amants d'un jour" by Edith Piaf, except that the story of the singer is tragic. The fascinating thing of today is this small popular world, the Saint-Martin canal. This movie is loved by French moviegoers for another very special reason. The pouf Jouvet tells her protege Raymonde that she wants a change of air (environment) because she does not understand the meaning of the World Atmosphere, the harlot Raymonde (wonderful Arletty) thinks it is an insult and she offers this line, which is, Without a doubt, the most famous of all the French cinema: <br /> <br /> In French: "Atmosphère? Atmosphère? Est-ce que j'ai une gueule d'atmosphère?" Attempt to translate: " Atmosphere? Atmosphere? I have an atmosphere face? This is our French "Nobody is perfect".
