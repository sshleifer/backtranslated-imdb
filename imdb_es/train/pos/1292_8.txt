Preston Waters, an 11-year-old boy, has problems with his parents and siblings, especially for money problems. He is crazy about having his own house and his own rules, since his brothers always stole their saved money and their parents neglect their wishes. A terrible day, Preston was riding his bicycle; It was the same day that the villain of the story, Quigley, tried to escape from the police and accidentally passed the car over Preston's bike. Being away from the police, Quigley hurries, a check to cover the damages of Preston's bicycle. The problem was: It was a blank check! Preston is a smart kid and decides to have a high price on that check: 1 million dollars! All that money gives Preston the things he always wanted, like a mansion with a pool, lots of toys and even a limousine! The problems begin when the FBI and Quigley want to know where the money is, making Preston a difficult situation and facing many problems. <br /> <br /> This movie was one of my favorites during my childhood. :)
