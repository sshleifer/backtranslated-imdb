Yes, it is low budget. Yes, it's one of Candy's first movies, but maybe it's the funniest! John Candy was not that far from his SCTV days in "Going Berserk" and it shows. If you do not laugh when Candy tries to help a man with his purchases while he is handcuffed to an escaped cohort in the process of having sex with his girlfriend, only with the apartment door that separates them (eh?, Watch the movie! ), or the way Euguene Levy (the creator of Kong Fu Yu) is talking to his mother on the phone, or just the countless amount of facial expressions that only Candy could give you better, check your pulse! If you like the John Candy of "Only the Lonely", it may not be a movie that I recommend you see, but if you enjoy the SCTV days of John Candy, this movie is a must!
