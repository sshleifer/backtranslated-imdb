Thriller beautifully filmed, well acted and scripted. He had me on the edge of my seat. I really liked the main actress, and I thought the villain was very well made. There is not much to comment here on a subject, but if you just sit down, you turn off your brain, watch how the camera works and enjoy the plot, you will have a great time. The plot is well worn, and the usual moviegoers will probably know more or less what to expect in about ten minutes. But that did not bother me, since I enjoyed watching it unfold. In the old days, it's possible that they had not focused so closely on just two characters, and there were some tempting moments when I expected some other people to have some lines. But these people were probably right to keep the film so focused. The plot grabbed me by the throat pretty soon, and I never let go. It is not a good idea to think too much during or after the movie. As I'm not sure, it makes a lot of sense. Just sit and enjoy.
