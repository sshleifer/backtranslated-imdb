Ten years after the first film, James Belushi, one of the most gifted and most watched comedic actors of the last twenty years, returns as Detective Dooley for this film. <br /> <br /> If you're expecting more of the same from the first movie, you'll be disappointed, but it's still a good movie. Realizing that all battle scenes of Dog vs. Man wills had probably been used in the first movie, it becomes a bit more psychological in its approach as it focuses on a criminal with a fixation with the recently deceased wife of Dooley after she rejected his book, and blames Dooley for his death. <br /> <br /> It is possible that the script is not the best, but the film allows both Belushi and Christine Tucci to show their good acting skills, while still retaining enough of the light humor of The First Film for make it work, and the chemistry between the two stars is there for all to see. <br /> <br /> An easy and light film that, although perhaps not worth buying, unless you are a true fanatic. Whether it's the first film or Belushi, it's definitely worth watching when it's on TV. <br /> <br />
