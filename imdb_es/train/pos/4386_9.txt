This is a powerful movie. The first time I saw it, the Scottish accents made it hard for me to understand a lot and that ruined the visual experience. I renounced it, but then I acquired the DVD, I used the English subtitles when I needed them, and I really got into this movie, discovering how good it is. It's excellent. <br /> <br /> The widescreen image makes it spectacular in some parts, with a wonderful steep landscape and history reminded me of Braveheart, a story of good versus evil. Here, it's Liam Neeson (good) against Tim Roth (bad). Both do their job well. <br /> <br /> Few actors are as despicable as Roth. Man, you really want to hit this guy with his arrogant and irritating kitten. (It's so nasty and vile that sick critics love their character more than anyone else here). Neeson is a man of man and a solid hero figure as Gibson was in Braveheart. Jessica Lange is strong here as the female protagonist. The movie attracts you and totally involves you, so be prepared to have an emotional experience to see this.
