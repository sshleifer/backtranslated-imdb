What begins as a generational conflict in this film, ends in understanding, solemnity and grace. The film winds its way through Europe with the father and young son crammed into a car over 3000 miles. Cramps compel lifestyles, beliefs and life skills to crash. There really is no clear winner. Everything is added to the end as experience, experience of multiple layers of life. For those interested in understanding Islam, this film offers a generous and friendly perspective, without being aggressive with the agenda. It is a story of coming of age for the young son, his disdainful and rebellious nature becomes an opening to receive more life forms.
