The first time I saw this movie was about ten years ago and I found it very funny. It was not as bad as some critics did. The fact that it was written by the generally reliable John Hughes shows that you can at least expect a fun dialogue. (By the way, I also think that Weird Science is pretty good, that it was also written at lightning speed by Hughes). <br /> <br /> The film has a very striking appearance with all the primary colors: red, yellow. etc - which makes it look quite unique. The cast is also pretty good. The prudish Bunny Packard and the Delores Salk, possessed by the devil, are outstanding. <br /> <br /> The film has certainly been a bit dated, but I personally prefer it to all the other 'Lampoon' series.
