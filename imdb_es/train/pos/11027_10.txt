Since I saw it for the first time in the theater it has been my favorite. Since then I have seen it countless times and I never tire of doing it. The scenario has a lot to do (the Colorado I know would be jealous), but the story is original and I liked the way it used the small mountain villages as the heroes. There has not been a movie that can compare this too. John Lithgow plays a clever villain, but I love how he's completely out of his element: he has to follow Tucker and that's what keeps him interesting. This is an action movie in its BEST. I do not think I see another that is so entertaining. <br /> <br /> You do not need 50,000 shots to qualify as an action movie. You just have to stay enthralled, not in shock.
