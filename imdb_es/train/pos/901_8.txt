Well ... Vivah is a pretty good movie, but typical of Sooraj Barjatya. It shows different aspects of Indian families, wedding ceremonies, etc. The movie is more than good, but not extremely good. <br /> <br /> The big point in favor of the film is the direction, music and performance of Shahid and Amrita (especially the last scene). The film begins with a common factor in the Indian film: a girl who does not like her stepmother. The story is that the movie is a bit common, but it's good, good enough to make the movie a blockbuster. <br /> <br /> The negative point is the common story of the Bollywood movie. In general, I would say that it is twice to watch the movie, if you want to see the typical values ​​of the Indian family and love, of course.
