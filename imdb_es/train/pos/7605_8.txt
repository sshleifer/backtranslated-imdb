Lost is a television series very well made about some people who get lost on an island. there are so many twists and turns that you can not really decide who is your favorite character, one minute is he, then he does something, so it's great, then she's about to do something, so it's the best, the suspense accumulates and just how are you to burst the episode ends and you like noooooooooooooooooooo !!!!!! so you have to wait a whole week to see the next episode, but it's worth waiting for. The suspense, the action, the romance, the humor have it all apart from the topless girls, but that's good because it means you can really concentrate more on the story and the story is what this is all about. So if you like a good story and you like suspense, this is a good one, however, I think it's better. (I also have a review where you can see it). I would give a good 8 out of 10, mainly because it is so unpredictable, you never know what will happen next.
