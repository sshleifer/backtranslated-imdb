Halloween is one of the best examples of independent cinema. It is very well done and has more psychological elements than you could imagine at first glance. It is a simple film very well told. The music is perfect and it is one of the most disturbing scores ... If you have not seen this movie yet, you should see it. The cast is all excellent. I wish they had never done sequel after sequel. The first was, by far, the best and should have ended as it did without having a sequel. It was fun to see Jamie Lee Curtis in the movie. It seems that she has not aged (today she is just as beautiful, without the hair and clothes of the seventies). Scenes through the mask are one of the most terrifying things!
