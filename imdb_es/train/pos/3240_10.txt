['I found this movie by mistake many years ago and I wondered then (I still do) why it did not get the acclamation I should have had. Well written, beautiful acting, an ironic touch after another, and there is PLAUSIBILITY in what the infamous characters try. I would not recommend this movie to people with a short attention span; enough intelligence is needed to understand that there may be a kernel of truth in this story.']
