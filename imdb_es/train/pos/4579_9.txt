I think this movie was very good. It's a bit strange that now the Olsen twins are 13 years old and have boyfriends and everything. I enjoyed them a lot when they were small children in Full House. Anyway, the casting was good and the movie was kind of funny. I got confused between all the places of change and their names. It's just a kind of previous version of It Takes Two.
