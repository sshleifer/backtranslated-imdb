This was a very good movie and it is absolutely unfair to judge it without taking into account the moment it was released. There are some movies that do not age, but this is clearly out of date. However, I saw this film when I was a child and for more than twenty years both the images and the story were unforgettable for me and most of my friends, until we could appreciate it again on DVD. In fact, I remember this film as the subject of several talks and meetings in which old people talked about things we have in common. Therefore, there was a small feeling of disappointment and even sadness when we finally had the DVD. First, there was a theory about how naive our generation was. Second, I think there is something more. I would say that this film has something that should be interesting for all modern filmmakers, especially those who focus on the decomposing horror genre. This is mutilation, the idea that gives coherence to the film; The fact that a human being has been mutilated produces a deeper horror than death and torture. I remember how sick the feeling was, when the monster tore off Kurt's arm. At the end; When the creature bites the doctor's neck to take a piece of his veins. Another remarkable thing is the morbid atmosphere that prevails without decaying in intensity through all the scenes, no matter if the action is in a secret laboratory, a lonely street where the man in a car is looking for a female body, a striper dressing room , and so. Maybe the reasons why it's not a good movie anymore are just technical things. For example, in the scene of the accident and the man who keeps the head of his fianc√© a more precise work, done for another and modern director of second unit, it could be interesting. The same with all action scenes, including Kurt's arm. Also, something could be done with the monster's makeup. Some remakes have been good; I think in this case an attempt would be worth it. However, black and white tones should be preserved.
