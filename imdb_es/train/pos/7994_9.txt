I really liked this movie. It's dark, it's not a bullet maneuver, chasing a car numbs your brain action movie. Many of the backgrounds and motivations of the characters are somewhat vague, which leaves the viewer to draw their own conclusions. It is nice to see a movie in which the director allows the viewer to make his own decisions. <br /> <br /> In the end, motivated by love or revenge, or the desire to repent, he does what he feels is "right". 'Will God ever forgive us for what we have done?' - It is not a question that mortal men can answer - so it does what it feels it has to do, what it is good at, what it has been trained on. <br /> <br /> Denzel Washington is a great actor, honestly I can not think of a bad movie he has made, and he has a great cast. I would recommend this movie to anyone.
