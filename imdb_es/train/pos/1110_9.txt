I think you should be from the United States to get a lot of the jokes. But if you liked the Princess Bride and Forest Gump, you would like this movie. Of course, you can not compare the quality of the filming with those of the filming, but obviously the cameraman's trip was done on purpose. Killer Tomatoes is a hundred times better than the Neopolitan dynamite. It is just my opinion. I am sure that the people of France would not appreciate the cartoons of the French. So this movie is not for a worldwide audience. And although I'm not a trained film critic, I know what I like. I could not stop laughing through the whole movie. My sides and my jaws were hurt at the end of the movie.
