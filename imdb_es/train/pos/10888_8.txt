This is one of those little Christmas movies for everyone. Our Scrooge is Ben Affleck, who decides that the money is not enough, so he rents the family that lives where he thought his family did it. OK? This is a great little high school soap, PG-13, but the small sexual references are a comedy, so if your child can not handle them, they can not live in the real world either. <br /> <br /> Now, Affleck is a gallant and, as usual, walks through this fun, my God, remember when we did ..., a piece of set as if he were in the final stages of some neuroinfectious disease. But it's okay, because even this old Oracle is still hoping that if Ben has that good proportion, well, there's still hope for us, ladies. Fortunately, the rest of the group, Catharine O'Hara, James Gandolfini, Christina Applegate, Udo Kier and Josh Zuckerman, complete and keep this Christmas of Ozzie and Harriet on the side of the shadow, alternately hilarious, comfortable and warm. br /> <br /> This movie is the kind that you can jump and get popcorn, and when you get back, everyone wants to make a backup to show you what you missed. <br /> <br /> This is a Happy Movie, after all, and it leaves you feeling good about life, love, family, Christmas and Chanel. There really is something for everyone.
