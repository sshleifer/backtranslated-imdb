The title says it all. <br /> <br /> I am not a film critic nor will I act like the rest of the snobistas who comment on this film. <br /> <br /> Obviously, this movie did not do it. It has a budget of several million dollars, but the plot was very well made, the performance was incredible and the cinematography was excellent. It seemed that everyone had a lot of fun doing this movie! I voted 9 out of 10, since the sound was strong on just one channel instead of both, but I imagine that this could have been a mistake in the DVD recording. <br /> <br /> I'll definitely check it out Other films produced by Brain Damage Films! <br /> <br /> Dylan O'Leary, cast and crew, thank you!
