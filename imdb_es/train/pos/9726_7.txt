['Well, it was a pleasant surprise after all. his trailer did not predict a good movie at all, it was even a bit misleading. Especially the part of Jeff Bridges was a positive surprise, well written, sardonic and fun. However, less real, I do not think that a guy who arrived where he arrived would show signs of such irreverence towards everything that his current company represents. One does not become one of the best suits to suddenly doubt everything. The end of the film, during the screening of Dolce Vita, was too corny, clich√© and quite disappointing. And, of course, a guy like Pegg&#39;s character would not spend his first week in a New York magazine like this. I hope that one day I will see a decent role written for Megan Fox, here she looked like a poor actress playing a bimbo. And, by the way, I do not see why she&#39;s the &quot;sex symbol&quot; of the year, I see more attractive girls on almost every magazine cover.']
