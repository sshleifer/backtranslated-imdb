The beauty of Bo Derek and the revolutionary direction of John Derek make this movie worthwhile. <br /> <br /> Bo, looking more beautiful than ever, is a recently widowed woman who is experiencing visits from her "dead" husband (Anthony Quinn). He has a plan. Bo must procure the body of a young man so that his spouse's ghost can make his transformation from the spectrum to the bodily life. Can she find a suitable candidate? How will she do it so that Tony can do his thing? <br /> <br /> With the attributes of Bo, John's unique direction, Quinn's presence in the film and, thanks to John, a very nice and exotic appearance of the whole movie, this movie is nice to watch .
