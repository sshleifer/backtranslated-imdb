The man with the gun is practically forgotten now, but it caused a small storm of media interest in 1955 when Robert Mitchum rejected both Jett Rink in Giant (which had actually been written for him and subsequently modified) and intended by Charles Laughton Version of The Naked and the Dead to make it in his place. Despite some obvious production problems and severe lighting that occasionally makes both Mitch and Jan Sterling appear in an unflattering tone, it's a fantastic dark west that compares more than with their previous Blood on the Moon when their ' city ​​tamer 'gets to work in a city that never had the chance to grow before being run over by local bad men before they get to ?? possibly ?? Be almost as bad as the men you dispatch. Certainly his way of dealing with the news of a death in the family? Burning a room to the ground and causing your manager to try to kill him?
