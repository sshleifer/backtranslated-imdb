It is not a great movie. The performance is not surprising (some sub-charterers are even misunderstood), the film is not beautiful in any way. Nothing really inventive or new. If you like big movies, this is not for you. However, it has a great - REALLY BIG more in history. Larry's story works, because we know this story of our own lives. The girl that we did not ask for a date, the proof that we failed, the friend we disappointed, are in our history. This movie works, because he plays it, it's a great story because it's small. It is the life we ​​all have, with regrets we all have, and yet the message comes: every life we ​​could have lived would have its disadvantages. The first time I saw him, he was 15 years old. He showed up at a party at my school. 16 years later, I keep reflecting on it from time to time, and every time I see it, it puts a smile on my face. Look at it. It'll be good for you. You will be happier with what you have.
