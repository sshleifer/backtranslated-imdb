I have seen all the films directed by Robert Redford and I appreciate his love for the American people and the earth. In A River Runs Through It, Redford shows the lyrical romanticism and visual splendor of Montana's high Rockies as if he were a nineteenth-century landscape painter by Thomas Moran or Albert Bierstadt. This film makes love for the visual and the word with the text of the author Norman Maclean, and the impressive camera work of Phillippe Rousselot (The kiss of the snake, Reigne Margot). <br /> <br /> The cast of Redford is perfect. Tom Skerritt is the Reverend MacLean, a man whose education methods include fly fishing and the Bible, Brenda Blythen, the mother and her children, Craig Schaffer and Brad Pitt create a family whose interactions reflect the same problems they encounter. Growing up adolescent children, and later, young complexes. Both Schaffer and Pitt are totally credible as the brothers whose love of fly fishing and each other will unite them forever. It is the relationships between men, father and children, brothers and their women with the outside world that makes A River Runs Through It a vein of narrations that are missing in many of the Hollywood films produced in recent years. <br /> <br /> What makes these relationships special, however, is Redford's attention to language as spoken in the dialogue. This is a literary script, beautiful to listen to and unforgettable when combined with the impressive rivers and mountains of Montana. The words and the configuration are the same as the interpretations of a cast that rises to its material. While the idea of ​​fly fishing may seem like a strange device to center a story, it is not so implausible in Redford's hands. Given the material, it's worth going back again and again to Redford's ode about a simpler time and life.
