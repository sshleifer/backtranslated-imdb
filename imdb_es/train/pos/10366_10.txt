An unqualified "10" The level of writing and acting in this Australian film is reminiscent of the best of "old" Hollywood. Sam Neill and Meryl Streep are very good together. Neill coincides with Streep line by line, and takes to take: it is one of the best showcases of his prodigious interpretive talent and he is at his best, despite the intensity of his role. This absorbing film is a delight for any movie fan who loves the court's passionate drama, portrayed in the most human but not sentimental terms. The film, which won several major awards in Australia, not only has a superlative cast and director, but also wonderful and authentic Australian venues. It shows that people are the same all over the world. And, after all these years, people still take delight in repeating the famous Streep line, the accent and all: "A dingo ate my baby!" Including that imp "Elaine Benis" in "Seinfeld".
