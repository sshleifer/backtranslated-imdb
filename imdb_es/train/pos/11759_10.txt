The best of times is one of the great sleepers of all time. The configuration does not tax your patience, the development is constant, the many intertwined relationships are lovingly established, the gags and bits work and are fun. There is a lot of sentimentality. Kurt Russell playing Reno Hightower presents one of his best performances, and Robin Williams playing Jack Dundee is safer than ever. The cast also includes many great supporters. Jack's wife is played by the daughter of Jack Palance, who is charming, as is Reno's wife, who is a great comedian. I can not tell you how many times I've seen this movie, how many times I've enjoyed it and how often I wish more people could see it.
