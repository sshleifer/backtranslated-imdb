This is a peculiar movie that the British do so well. Under budget, cameo roles, well executed. The story is a bit weak, a recently widowed Judi Dench decides to reunite the "blonde girls", a gang of girls (and almost all) who performed during the war in London. The mandatory son / daughter who believes he / she has gone to the bathroom. I liked the way the film allows young people to see that they do not have a monopoly on feelings, love and even lust. That the "old wrinkles" can also laugh a lot. Judi Dench was superb as always, a shame we did not do I did not see more of the other "blond bombs, the end was a bit hasty, I thought, I kept thinking as I watched David Jason have been a Patrick even better than Ian Holm, although it was quite adequate as the drummer "transvestite." In general, a cheerful movie that is worth a night with the girls :)
