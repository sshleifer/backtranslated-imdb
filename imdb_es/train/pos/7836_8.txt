Canto 1: How Kriemhild lamented for Siegfried and how King Attila crosses her through his ambassador Rüdiger von Bechlarn: Kriemhild (Margarete Schön) insists on having the murderer's head of her beloved husband, Hagen Tronje (Hans Adalbert Schlettow), but his brother, King Gunther (Theodor Loos), rejects his request. When King Attila of the Huns attracts Kriemhild through his ambassador Rüdiger von Bechlar, she makes him promise through the oath on behalf of his king that no man will ever offend her. Hagen Tronje hides the treasure of Nibelungen at the bottom of a lake. <br /> <br /> Song 2: How Kriemhild takes the leave of his native land and how it was received by King Attila: Kriemhild brings some land from where Siegfried died, and travels to the court of the Huns, where he is received by Attila himself, who also promises to defend her. <br /> <br /> Canto 3: How King Ávila besieges Rome and how Kriemhild summoned his brothers: when Kriemhild gives a baby, Attila returns to his kingdom and asks Kriemhild what he would most like to please her . She asks him to invite his brothers to come to his kingdom. <br /> <br /> Canto 4: How Kriemhild receives his brothers: Kriemhild insists on having the head of Hagen Tronje, but his brothers maintain loyalty to his friend and again do not accept his request. <br /> <br /> Song 5: How the Huns celebrated the summer solstice with the Nibelungs: Kriemhild asks Attila to kill Hagen Tronje, but he refuses because, according to the laws of the desert, Guest is considered sacred. Kriemhild offers gold to the Hums by the boss of Hagen Tronje. There is a fight, and Hagen Tronje kills Attila's son. <br /> <br /> Song 6: The anguish of the Nibelungen: The Huns lose the battle against the Nibelungen, but keep them under siege inside the castle of Attila. Kriemhild promises to forgive their lives as long as they hand over Hagen Tronje, but his brother Gunther says the Germans are loyal to their friends. <br /> <br /> Song 7: The end of Nibelungen: After the death of Rüdiger von Bechlarn, Giselher and Gernot, Hagen Tronje and Guhther are finally captured. Kriemhild kills Hagen Tronje, ending his revenge with the destruction of the Nibelungs. <br /> <br /> The conclusion of Siegfried's poetic saga through "Kriemhild's Revenge" is also told through seven dramatic chants. The nature of the first part is a magnificent story of fantasy, adventure, romance and betrayal; The second part is a dramatic story of hatred, revenge and loyalty. The solid script with a perfect development of the characters, the excellent performances of the cast and the impressive direction of Fritz Lang produced another anticipated epic. Margarete Schön is impressive with a totally different woman, obsessed and inflexible in her desire for revenge. The costumes that Kriemhild uses are also very impressive, and his performance is based on his face and appearance. I was a little disappointed at Attila's reaction after the death of his only son, since he found him too passive. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Os Nibelungos? Part II: A Vingança de Kriemshild" ("The Nibelungen Part II: Kriemhild's Revenge")
