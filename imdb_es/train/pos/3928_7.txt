Of course it was well thrown and done, very well thrown and done! But the story was so weak. And Lincoln's representation was even weaker. Not that Henry Fonda was not good, but the character he played was nothing but a madman. Do you want to tell me that Lincoln was a clever and cunning ass without respecting the law or the court? I mean who the hell was it supposed to be? Cousin vinnie? I mean, come on, "I'll call you Jackass then" ??? I understand that Ford was going for a great funny hero, but I really did not like this guy. He cheats in sports, talks like a real sweet simpleton and does not seem to know if he would sit in a courtroom. How am I supposed to take this seriously? <br /> <br /> The turn was even weaker. Well then! That was just stupid. The whole story seemed to have been created by a 5-year-old boy in his dreams. Saying that I liked it enough, it was very entertaining and made me laugh on several occasions, so I can not say it's a bad movie. In fact, I must say that I must say that it is good enough, nothing that entertains me and makes me laugh can be bad, BUT this vivid and silly story was so ridiculous that I can not understand how anyone could consider it great. <Br /> <br /> I have no idea how historically accurate this movie was, but if any of that were true, I would really have to shake my head.
