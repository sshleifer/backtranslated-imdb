A good picture is worth all the words. This movie has the most poetic scene ever dreamed of with people with Down syndrome. And I will not spoil it by telling you. You will want to see it for yourself. <br /> <br /> Pasqual Duquenne is an incredible actor. I did not need to understand a single word, he said to understand its meaning. <br /> <br /> The movie has its own magic. After seeing it, I understood better that we give too much value to achievement and not enough to the people we love. Passion and simplicity is all we need.
