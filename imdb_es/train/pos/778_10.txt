['I&#39;m not a great expert in acting or other details of the movie, but this movie just hit me deeply. I think I&#39;ll never forget it. A special scene (I think anyone who has seen the film will know what I&#39;m talking about) is printed in my brain. <br /><br /> I also saw the similar movie Lilja 4-ever (mentioned by a previous commentator). It was also very moving, but not so direct to the point and brutal. If you are sensitive at all, either of you will bring tears to your eyes, but Anjos Do Sol (Angels of the Sun) can remain with you forever. <br /><br /> This is a very depressing topic, but I do not think so, I HOPE that the film will attract more attention. <br /><br /> More people need to watch this movie !!!']
