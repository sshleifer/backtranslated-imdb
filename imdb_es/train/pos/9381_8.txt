A vagabond seeking work is mistaken for a hit man in a small town in Wyoming, which leads to all kinds of complications. Cage is perfectly presented as the unfortunate moron who hopes to make quick money and leave the city, but can not escape from the city of title. Hopper does what he does best, playing a psychopath known as "Lyle from Dallas", the real hit man. Walsh as a crooked sheriff and Boyle as a fatal woman complete the fine cast. The script of the brothers John and Rick Dahl contains delicious twists and turns, and John's direction creates an excellent "neo noir" atmosphere. Ingenious and very entertaining, he aspires to the viewer from the beginning and never stops.
