['Absolutely nice sing and dance movie starring Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly, as well as Kathryn Grayson. <br /><br /> The film won and Oscar for the score of George E. Stoll, and was nominated for Best Picture, Best Actor for Kelly and Best Picture, as well as a Best Son nomination for &quot;I Fall in Love Too Easily&quot;, sung by Sinatra. <br /><br /> It was a nice story about Kelly helping her friend Sinatra get a girl and fall in love with her. The lovely Grayson (The Toast of New Orleans) dazzled us with her singing, and we had many songs and dance routines of Kelly and Sinatra, as well as the art of the pianist and conductor Jos√© Iturbi. <br /><br /> A classic Hollywood music from a bygone era.']
