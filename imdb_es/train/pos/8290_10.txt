This is just one more example of Gene Wilder's absolute genius. He wrote and starred in this terrifying mystery. Nobody could have done better. The suspense was palpable at all times. I wish that Mr. Wilder would give us the grace with another of these. I've enjoyed everything I've seen in Mr. Wilder, but I had no idea how talented he was until I saw "Murder in a small town," and this continuation. He really has a firm understanding of what the public wants and how he offers it in his writings and, of course, in his brilliant performance. His subtle wit comes through swords. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes the mysteries and / or cinematographic work of Gene Wilder. Your star becomes increasingly bright.
