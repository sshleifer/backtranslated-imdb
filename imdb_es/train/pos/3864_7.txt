['This western series with such a poor name won an Emmy for the best syndicated program and is certainly an interesting series. It was produced by Republic, the studio that made the action better than anyone, and put their best effort into it. Each episode was built around a true historical figure of the Old West. A railway detective named Matt Clark, similar to Elliot Ness with the mobsters of the 20s and 30s, managed to get involved with almost all the notable Western outlaws between the mid-nineteenth century and the First World War. The best asset of the series was Jim Davis. Tall, robust, robust, good looking, in excellent condition, with a true Western accent, and with excellent driving skills that made him absolutely compelling in the action scenes, Davis was every inch of the Western hero. He teamed up with two charming and active co-stars, Mary Castle as &quot;Frankie&quot; during the first season, and Kristine Miller as &quot;Jonesy&quot; during the second. Everyone worked well with Davis. <br /><br /> What separated this show from its contemporaries and much of what came later was the professionalism invested in the action scenes. Ace action director William Witney directed 30 episodes. Franklin Adreon the rest. Both filmed the action with enamel. The vast archival store of the Republic and B&#39;s series was used to reach out. The level of the individual episodes rose or fell with the quality of the stars invited to the play by the outlaws. Among the very good were Marie Windsor as Belle Starr, Lee Van Cleef as Jesse James, Fess Parker as Grat Dalton, Jean Parker as Cattle Kate and Joe Sawyer and Slim Pickins as Butch Cassady and &quot;The Smilin &#39;Kid&quot;. The Cream of the West and their arrival, Pickins, Parker, Denver Pyle, James Best and Richard Jaeckel, perfected their craft. Veterans B with decades of experience, Harry Woods, Glenn Strange, Kenneth MacDonald, Earle Hodgkins, Steve Darrell and Chief Yowlachie, provided the leather feel of the western classics. <br /><br /> The weakness of the concept was that there are only so many famous Western outlaws. For the second season, the famous figures were becoming a dark mite for all by the most dedicated history buff. However, some of the later shows were compatible with any, due to the guest stars. Henry Brandon played the champion Nate, and former Republic star Don Barry stood out as the little criminal Milt Sharp. <br /><br /> Western fans or history buffs will want to see this.']
