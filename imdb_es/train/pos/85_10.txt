I saw this movie while I was at Birmingham Southern College in 1975, when it was shown in combination with the red balloon. Both films are similar in their dreamlike quality. Most of the film involves a fish swimming happily in its bowl while its new owner, a small child, is absent from school. A cat enters the room where the fish and its bowl are, and begins to cautiously stalk its "prey". The child begins his way home from school, and the viewer wonders if he will arrive in time to save his friend fish. The fish is stirred by the presence of the cat, and finally jumps out of the bowl! The cat quickly approaches the fish, picks it up gently with its legs and returns it to its bowl. The boy happily returns to his fish, none wiser. <br /> <br /> The ending is surprising, both because of its irony and its technical complexity. It's hard to imagine how the director could have accomplished the technical feat in 1959, it seems more like a trick for 2003. <br /> <br /> If you can find it, look at it, you will not be disappointed! And if you find it, let me know so I can get a copy too.
