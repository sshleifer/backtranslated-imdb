In 1979, I was a 12 year old boy. My parents had just got the box office at home, which was fairly new in our neighborhood. As a 12-year-old boy, this was the first time I saw tits on television. I will never forget the joy of those times. The racing vans, the total cleanup with the worst truck, the waterbed, the habit of smoking herbs, the chicks of the 70s, the love of my Chevy van song, everything was very new to me. A complete movie with all the memories you can expect. I own it and enjoy it approximately once a year. When I see this movie, I want to take my skates, with 4 wheels, not in a straight line, go to the park and hunt some babies with feathered hair. Great memories of young adolescence!
