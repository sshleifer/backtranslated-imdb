Fay, the sister of the famous evil poet Simon Grim, winner of the Nobel Prize, still loves Henry Fool. His son receives an ingenious orgy in a box from an unrevealed sender and there is a chase across the three continents, involving a collection of government agents, terrorists, flight attendants and bellboys, which is extremely sad. <br /> <br /> Parker Posey offers perfectly timed comedic performance, which includes some brilliant physical work. With strong contributions from Jasmin Tabatabai and Saffron Burrows, Fay Grim demonstrates in the best tradition of Billy Wilder that nothing is more fun than a beautiful woman in trouble. <br /> <br /> Another good Hartley score (and thanks in the credits to the American Academy in Berlin, where Hartley served as a fellow in the fall of 2004).
