Do you think the best screen version of Quo Vadis? It has never been done. Well, yes, the plot is not as strong and evident as in the book, sometimes meandering and losing its suspense among the aesthetic subtleties. But the film is real and beautifully "strange", it has an enigma and a style, that other versions, with R. Taylor and the new one from Poland, definitely lack. It has the air of Roman decadence, the beauty of declining paganism and childish Christianity. At least I think he has done it. Brandauer, Forrest and Syudov did an excellent job of portraying their characters. Petronius, of Forrest, seems to be the biggest success of the cast (not to mention Brandauer, who is one of the best actors in history) and accumulates the very essence of this dying world (IMHO). That's. That's how it happened, guys ...))) IMHO
