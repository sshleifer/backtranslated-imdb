In our home, we are big fans of A Christmas Carol and we see virtually every version every Christmas, including the old Reginald Owen of 1938 and the modern 1999 Patrick Stewart. Our favorite in general is the 1951 black-and-white classic, because Alastair Sim IS Ebeneezer Scrooge and its conversion really sound. However, this 1984 version has its own unique merits and makes a charming and entertaining story, generally very true to Dickens' novel. (See my comments on the other adaptations of the film, if interested) <br /> <br /> First of all, George C. Scott can certainly look rather grumpy and does not make a bad Scrooge. I love his sideburns, his long coat and his hat. He cuts the finest fashion figure in the lot, and a pretty handsome gentleman. However, sometimes it seems that Scott is enjoying his role as Scrooge just a little bit and does not take it as seriously as he should. <br /> <br /> This interpretation has the best overall Christmas mood, optimistic and optimistic. Somehow you know that this story will have a happy ending. Filmed in the city of Shrewsbury, England, it seems somehow very British. The film has a beautiful musical score, with a wonderful and lively music of carols in all the appropriate parts of the story. Sometimes I could almost smell the roasted chestnuts and the pudding singing in the copper! <br /> <br /> The anguished ghost of Marley (with his wonderful scene of amazement) and the three Spirits are quite convincing. Last Christmas is a beautiful ethereal lady, the Christmas present wonderfully giant and jovial, Christmas still to come wrapped and foreboding as always. However, I found Scrooge's nephew, Fred, a little quiet and somber, not as cheerful and cordial as he should be. I like the nephew's wife, whom they called Janet, with her beautiful cheerful vintage hairstyle. Instead of the deception of the blind, they have created a game called Similes for the nephew's Christmas dinner, which is a nice touch. Scrooge gets fully into the spirit of the thing. <br /> <br /> The Cratchits and their Christmas dinner is somewhat scarce (though much appreciated), with Bob (David Warner) suitably sympathetic and suffering in his scarf miles. Ms. Cratchit is played charmingly by Susannah York, who also starred with George C. Scott in the wonderful adaptation of Jane Eyre in 1970. Above all, this version has unquestionably the best Tiny Tim, not just an adorable and endearing small but sickly. With those dark circles under your eyes, the fragile thing does not seem to survive on time! <br /> <br /> This is a charming and comforting version of the Christmas classic. With its festive atmosphere, it will surely put you in the spirit of the season.
