There are many people in our lives that we meet only once in our life, but for one reason or another we remember those people for the rest of our lives. These once-in-a-lifetime friendships occur between people with long distances between them and there are always natural reasons why we no longer know these people. We do not always know their names, since we never introduce each other, and sometimes we even forget to ask what their names are. It's funny how ordinary humanity makes occasional friends and we like to keep it as such, because getting together could spoil good memories, or we do not know if they do. We are too afraid to prove it. <br /> <br /> The movie 'Before Sunrise' surprised me when I saw it. I never had the intention to see it, but as the discussion between the couple seemed interesting to me, I took a look at the rest of the film. I did not know what to expect from him, but the young couple did not either. They had time to argue with each other until dawn and anything could happen before they had to separate. I think this movie has had good reviews because the situation is something that everyone on this planet has lived at least once or twice. It makes us all think about all those people we have met only once in our lives.
