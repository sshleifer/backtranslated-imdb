['This movie is not your typical horror movie. It has some scenes of humor and death that can be funny. Personally I liked the movie because of his good humor. It&#39;s definitely not a super scary movie, which is good if you do not want to be scared and paranoid afterwards. I liked the performance of the guy from Hillbilly and Lester ... very believable. I think I&#39;m going to dye my hair red like that Scarecrow girl - very cool! Anyway, it&#39;s worth renting in general for the campy humor and the non-typical horror experience.']
