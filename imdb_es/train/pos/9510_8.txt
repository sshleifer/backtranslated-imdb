In the winter of 1931, supposedly 12-year-old Tyler Hoechlin (as Michael Sullivan Jr.) wonders what his gangster father Tom Hanks (Michael "Mike" Sullivan) does for a living. The young Hoechlin follows Mr. Hanks to "work" one night and attacks him by shooting some rival mafiosi. This leads, in a VERY indirect way, to the "Godfather", of the Paul Newman type (like John Rooney) who hires the independent hit man Jude Law (like Harlen Maguire) to track Hoechlin and Hanks, who are ready to cool their heels in Chicago Hanks believes they will be safe with a relative, which is disconcerting when considering the line of work of the characters. <br /> <br /> Looking amazingly like Paul Peterson ("The Donna Reed Show"), Hoechlin does an excellent job. for director Sam Mendes; and, starting to work with this cast makes him the most successful young actor of 2002. But, the most surprising thing about "Road to Perdition" is the dazzling cinematography of Conrad L. Hall, who deservedly won a career as "Prize of the Academy "for the late photographer Mr. Hall's work is truly superlative. This helps compensate for the general impression of a measured and artificial hardness in both the narrative and the visual. The ending that deviates is suddenly edifying (the unrelated dog is an example of the aforementioned stupidity). <br /> <br /> ******** Road to Perdition (12/7/02) Sam Mendes ~ Tom Hanks, Tyler Hoechlin, Paul Newman, Jude Law
