After the initial shock of realizing the guts of Mr. Branagh to film this, I was literally shaking with the excitement of having this epic just ahead of me. I was not disappointed. So faithful to Shakespeare and so accessible. I was speechless. I always like to see, or rather listen to, Branagh, and that made me wonder ... is this movie doubling in other countries? That would be like painting a mustache on the Mona Lisa.
