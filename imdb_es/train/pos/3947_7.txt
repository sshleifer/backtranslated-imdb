Based on a true story of how a man ahead of his time, the great American poet and humanist of the nineteenth century, Walt Whitman, made a significant contribution to how Western medicine treats people with psychological problems. <br /> <br /> Interested in the treatment of people with psychological problems, began to associate with psychiatric workers and patients. After seeing the psychological methods of the time (cruel inhuman and ignorant methods), Walt rejected those methods and treated patients with compassion and dignity, encouraging other people to do the same. The story of Walt's interactions with psychiatric workers, patients and citizens is full of drama, good humor and wisdom. :)
