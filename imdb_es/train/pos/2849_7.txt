I can not say that this movie is a disappointment because I read some reviews before seeing it and it did not go as well as I thought. The bar was not that high, so the fact that my expectations were met does not say much. <br /> <br /> The good: the city of New York. If you live in the city like me, you will recognize certain places and you will understand that the city is supposed to be more than a stage, rather than one of the main characters. There are genuinely tender moments, humorous conversations and plot twists to the left and to the right that keep things interesting. <br /> <br /> The bad: The first thing I thought when I left the theater was that I wanted more, but not in the positive "let them want more" fashion. Certainly, good scenes / scenes outweigh the bad ones, but there are many scenes that fall into the category "in the middle", many of them, which is what finally causes the film to end. In addition, the diversity of New York City, although it was insinuated into the many distant parts of the city and mentioned in the conversation throughout the film, was never made or analyzed to the point of doing justice to the city. For example, many of the parodies involve doing middle-aged targets well. I mean, I know that the city is home to a lot of the demographics mentioned, but come on, the plot and diversity of Paris Je'taime characters make New York City look like Lancaster, PA, or somewhere really white. It is simply disappointing to see the city reduced in its heritage in that way. <br /> <br /> Even so, even after having said this, I would recommend taking a look at New York, I Love You. Who knows, maybe you do not agree with my opinion and maybe not. You will never know until you see it for yourself. This review is not intended to discourage anyone from watching this film, since everyone's opinion about art is different. I'm just giving you vague information about what to expect.
