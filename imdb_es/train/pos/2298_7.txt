I love Hidden Horror, and the great British studios Hammer, who presented one of their best films with "The Devil Rides Out" (1968), have proven to be more than capable in this field of Horror. This tenth episode of the television series "Hammer House of Horror" (1980), "Guardian of the Abyss" by Hammer, is, in fact, a chilling entry to the series. The director Don Sharp, who had previously enriched the play Hammer with "The Kiss of the Vampire" (1963) and "Rasputin: The Mad Monk" (1966) and also directed two "Fu Machu" movies starring Christopher Lee, is without doubt one of The most well-known names among the directors of HHH, and also delivered here. Antique dealer Michael (Ray Lonnen) stumbles upon a mysterious and old mirror. The scrutiny glass becomes the object of desire of a cult of adoration of the devil, who wants to use it for his satanic rites. When he harbors a beautiful young woman named Allison (Rosalyn Landor), who will be sacrificed for the cult, Michael gets into bigger trouble with the cult and his sinister leader (John Carson) ... Although this is not one of mine. The favorite episodes of "Hammer House of Horror" (the best one clearly is the seventh brilliant episode, "The Silent Scream"), is one very spooky and atmospheric. The plot has several interesting twists, and remains puzzling and surprising throughout the film. Ray Lonnen is a good leader, the young Rosalyin Landor is convincing as innocent beauty, and John Carson is truly creepy as a leader of the Satanists. In general, "Guardian of the Abyss" is another interesting and spooky tale of HHH, and my fellow Hammer fans should not miss it.
