This double game was excellent, the best since the series returned. Of course, fragments of the story were compressed from previous movies, but what television shows do not do that these days. What we got here was a good science fiction story. A big (really terrifying) big monster imprisoned at the base of a deep pit, some superb extraterrestrials in The Ood: the best "new" aliens that the revived series has created, a set of basically sympathetic and believable human characters (complete with a couple of security people "dispensable" without a name in the true fashion Star Trek), some philosophical issues on a large scale (love, loyalty, faith, etc.) and some first-class special effects. <br /> <br /> I loved every minute of this.
