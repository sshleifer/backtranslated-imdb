I got this a few weeks ago and I love it! It is modern, light but full of real complexities of life. Questions and answers, like other Eytan Fox movies. This is my favorite, along with Jossi and Jagger. This represents much more, universally, than just the bubbles in which we can live. It is not necessary for you to be Jewish or homosexual to enjoy this, I am not, but the film goes directly to my ten main films. At first it seems pure entertainment, but it makes you think more. The relationships we have to live with are superficial, meaningful, deep, fatal, whatever. You do not know what's coming, and you definitely do not know where this story is heading when you first see it. It is worth seeing several times. The Fox films include a great extra material: here is a great music video and "the creation" (including the explanation of the title, the interview with Lior Ashknenazi, who plays himself in the film and the Arabs with doubts about the styles of Israeli life).
