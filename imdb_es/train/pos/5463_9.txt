['Very skilled, very Pre-Hays Code, and still very cheeky. I would highly recommend watching this movie, even if you are not a Stynwyck fan. She&#39;s funny, she&#39;s sexy, she&#39;s hard-working, and she loves what she gets! <br /><br /> Barbara Stynwyck is fantastic as a pompous vagabond who rises up in the world, perfectly portrayed by a banking building. John Wayne (in a suit) plays one of his first conquests. <br /><br /> The last three minutes are a disappointment, but the sets, the lines and the clothes add up to a lot of films on the vertical rise in the horizontal position.']
