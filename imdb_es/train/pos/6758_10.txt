Where the sidewalk ends (1950) <br /> <br /> Where one ends, another one begins <br /> <br /> This is a prototypical film, and as such, quite perfect, both from the point of view of the style as of the content. watch. The photography and the evening settings are first class (the director of photography Joseph LaShelle lets the drama be filtered scene after scene), and the close-ups of the faces of pure expressionism. I can see this type of film only for visual effects, even when the actors fight and the plot sucks. <br /> <br /> But the acting is first class here, and the plot presents what I consider the core of most noir movies, the alienated male protagonist (representing the many men who return home to a new United States after the war and feeling lost). In fact, Dana Andrews is not only really convincing as the lonely and troubled detective, but she has a small but important counterpart in the film, the husband (the first) of the leading woman, a former GI honored who has gone through difficult moments and alcohol. The fact that one man kills the other may be of monumental importance, in general: the normal guy who fights for his internal problems until success, while the soldier wearing the medal falls into an accidental death with a silver plaque on head. The woman makes the transition from one to the other: we assume that they get married and have children as previously suggested in the film. Even if this is driving an interpretation after the fact, we can still see the path of a man with some psychological baggage moving through a crisis to the highest kind of moral order: surrendering for a little crime right at the point he He really has got away with it. <br /> <br /> This movie belongs to Andrews. He plays a much more restricted and poignant type than Kirk Douglas plays in a similar role in the William Wyler detective story that took place just a year later, and Andrews is certainly less theatrical. You can easily see both movies side by side for a textbook comparison and contrast session. The fact that Andrews as Detective Dixon is fighting morally through all this, and Douglas as Detective McLeod is not, could explain why one man stays with his girl and the other does not. Gene Tierney achieves a type of woman enormously nice, disagreeable and, in the last analysis, conventional and "pretty"; not just a desirable card, but someone with whom you want Dixon to really marry. <br /> <br /> The criminal plot is really secondary to the main drama, but it is effective enough in its game with types and clich√©s. The parts of the drills are kept fast, the small details (like the portable craps table) are beautiful, far from the actors of the characters or the glamor of gambling in Casablanca. But then, Curtiz's great film is iconic even in the details: it makes no effort to be subtle, real and penetrating, but it is radical, memorable and inspiring. They come at opposite ends of the war and represent opposite possibilities for their main men. Bogart is beginning his active service, Dixon, and the man Dixon has killed is over. Through, thoroughly, but not washed. <br /> <br /> It's no coincidence that many, possibly most, of the films have what we might call a "happy" ending. The man surpasses his adversaries and transforms his inner being, and the spectator, then and now, understands how beautiful he must feel.
