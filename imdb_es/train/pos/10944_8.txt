The Sarah Silverman program is ... better than those other shows. There are no hints of laughter, no painful jokes, just a program. The Sarah Silverman program. If you're like me, and you love comedy, this is probably a show for you. <br /> <br /> Sarah Silverman brings to the table everything that is fun and right here is fun. A mixture of different styles, what makes it its own. <br /> <br /> This program is not something you want to start a comparison war with, since it has absolutely nothing to do with them (other programs). This show is its own entity, and I think most comedians will like it. <br /> <br /> Go see and see.
