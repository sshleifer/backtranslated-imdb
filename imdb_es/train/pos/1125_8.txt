Michael Cacoyannis has had a relatively long career, but he has surprisingly few credits to his name, including some real problems, like the satirical cold war without grace The day the fish came out. Iphigenia, however, is a highlight. Adapted by Cacoyannis from the work of Euripides, it is a superior representation of the classic tragedy and recently made its first appearance on television for many years in the United States, courtesy of the Flix Channel. The film is shot on an epic scale, but it is definitely not a "big" movie, with the emphasis on simple story: in supplication to the gods, King Agamemnon (Kostas Kazakos) is forced to sacrifice his daughter Iphigenia ( Tatiana Papamoschou), much to the dismay of Queen Clytemnastrae (Irene Papas). Kazakos and Papas are outstanding, but it is the impressive Papamoschou who brings the most interesting elements to the screen, combining the innocence of childhood with the revelation that she is the pawn in a political game. Highly recommended for lovers of international cinema.
