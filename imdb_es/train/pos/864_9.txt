['Surely one of the French films of the decade so far, a tense and atmospheric thriller that takes full advantage of the auditory impediments of the main characters to use the sound in a way that is rarely explored in the cinema. Emannuelle Devos offers a truly amazing performance, multifaceted, sometimes tortuous and manipulative, sometimes open and vulnerable. Another reason why those who appreciate quality films should keep their eyes open to France&#39;s offers.']
