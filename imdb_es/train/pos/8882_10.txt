The best film by John Singleton, before the aspiring blockbusters like the remake of Shaft, this is a thought-provoking film with a great overall performance and an excellent balance between the stories. 3 main characters, each with identifiable problems of young people. <br /> <br /> What he liked the most is that it also covers the problem of self-pity among young black people, a problem that most media and other films ignore and that mainly focus on the problems socioeconomic and racism of whites. This film shows that blacks can be equally ignorant and racist. <br /> <br /> The most important thing about this film is that it deals with many subjects without being superficial. It is not only about racism, but about how difficult it can be to adopt a new world (the university), go out on dates, discover sexuality and isolation. Omar Epps, Michael Rapaport and Kristy Swanson offer excellent performances, and the supporting cast is just as interesting with Jennifer Connelly as lez (yay) and with Ice Cube and Busta Rhymes as college slackers who cause minor disturbances. <br /> <br /> The only negative aspect is the cartoon of a Laurence Fishburne teacher ("Peppermint?"). Surely, many teachers are crazy. But they are not so flat. The skinheads are also a little cartoonish, but I think they are also that way in real life. <br /> <br /> In general, it's a great underestimated film work, if you liked American History X, you'll love it. . <br /> <br /> 8.5 out of 10
