This is the second film I've seen of Ida Lupino as director after the 53's, the hitchhiker. I think this was a better movie than that one. This has a girl who is about to get married and then is sexually assaulted and does not like everyone to look at her and talk about her, so she runs away and is welcomed by a family. I think Leonard Maltin's criticism is correct just to give it 2 and 1/2 stars.
