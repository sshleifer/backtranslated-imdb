The Woman in Black (1989) is a television adaptation of Susan Hill's classic ghost story, published only a few years before the movie. Unfortunately, this movie has not been released on DVD and, as far as I know, it has been deleted on VHS. Its availability is in direct contrast to its popularity among those who know horror movies. The story revolves around the events in a coastal community in the early twentieth century, in which a law firm sends a young lawyer to conclude the affairs of a recently deceased widow, who died on his farm isolated from the marshes. What he thought would be a routine and probably tedious task becomes a nightmare when he discovers that the old woman was persecuted until her death, and that the ghosts of her past are not content to rest. The story is told in a subtle but concise way, without ever being self-indulgent, striking or expository. The obviously adjusted budget may have contributed to the sensible approach, but it is just what the story needs and why it works so well. It is what you do not see what scares. That said, there is a particularly frightening scene that is based on the visual and works perfectly. I watched this movie during the day, and it still gave me nightmares almost a week later. If you love being terrified, do what you should to get and look at a copy of The Woman In Black.
