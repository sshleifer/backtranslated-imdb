Bela Lugosi appeared in several of these low budget chillers for Monogram Studios in the 1940s and The Corpse Vanishes is one of the best. <br /> <br /> Bela plays a mad scientist who kidnaps young girlfriends and kills them and then extracts fluid from their bodies so she can keep her elderly wife looking young. After a reporter and a doctor stay overnight at home and discover that he is responsible for the death of the brides, the next morning they report these murders to the police and the mad scientist is shot and falls shortly after. <br /> <br /> You have almost everything in this movie: the scientist's assistants consist of an old witch, a hunchback and a dwarf (your children), a thunderstorm and chilling passages in Bela's house. Bela and his wife discover that they sleep better in coffins than in beds in the movie. <br /> <br /> It is worth seeing The corpse disappears, especially for Bela Lugosi fans. Very funny. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 stars out of 5.
