WHO HAS THE GOLD? is (unfortunately) the last of the films of HANZO THE RAZOR, starring Shintaro Katsu as the main character: the samurai officer with multiple weapons and authority with the "only" technique of violating confessions of unwilling female informants until he " spill the beans "and ask for more ... <br /> <br /> This entry begins with Hanzo" discovering "a woman posing as a ghost to protect a lake that is full of bamboo trunks filled with gold stolen from the Treasury. This leads Hanzo to discover a shared loan scheme and an orgy ring led by a blind monk. The swordplay and the required rape / interrogation are completed in a decent ending to this strange movie trilogy. <br /> <br /> It's not as strong and enjoyable as THE SNARE (part 2 of the series ...), but it's still great for fans of the samurai sergeant and Japanese pink-style movies. 8/10
