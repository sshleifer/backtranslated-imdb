['Keeping in mind that it was done with a low budget, THE DAY TIME ENDED manages to make the most of your budget with some surprisingly good special effects. <br /><br /> The story involves a family that is about to move into their home with solar energy in an isolated part of the Mojave Desert in southwestern California, only to find it smashed by motorcycle vandals, they think. But her youngest daughter (Natasha Ryan) has begun to see mysterious things: a green pyramid, strange humanoid figures, etc. And only recently, the light of an explosion of a trinary star has caused extremely unusual auroras to appear in the desert skies. Thus, the family, led by Jim Davis and Dorothy Malone, comes face to face with strange alien forces that have put them in a deformation of time and space. <br /><br /> The mix in elements of 2001: a spatial odyssey and a close encounter of the third class, the day it ended, despite its obvious flaws and its uneven performance, remains interesting due to the excellent special effects work of David Allen. The desert scenery is very appropriate for the close encounters of this film; and while the film can not be compared to Kubrick&#39;s or Spielberg&#39;s, THE DAY TIME ENDED is much better than many other 2001 / CLOSE ENCOUNTERS imitations. I give credit to director John &#39;Bud&#39; Cardos, whose 1977 thriller KINGDOM OF THE SPIDERS created an interesting precursor to ARACHNOPHOBIA, at least to try, and on that basis, I give THE DAY TIME ENDED a 7 out of 10.']
