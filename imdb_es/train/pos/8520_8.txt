I thought the movie was pretty good. I enjoyed the performance and it moved well. The director seemed to really understand the story he was trying to tell. I have to see the big budget that comes out today, obviously they had a lot more money to spend but it was very visible. When you watch a movie like this for a small budget, you should keep it in mind when you're watching it. There were some things that could have been better, but most are related to the budget. The performance was pretty good the F / X and the stunts were well done. A couple of highlights were the guy who played the camera. and the child who played the child. These types of movies have kept LA at work and this is one that turned out well.
