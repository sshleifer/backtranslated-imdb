With films like "Wallace & Gromit" and "Chicken Run" to his credit, the good people on the other side of the pond, Aardman Animation, now present a bit of his twisted humor in the form of "Creature Comforts". <br /> <br /> Derived from a short film made at the beginning of their careers, "Creature Comforts" is a show of a segment of life in which fragments of conversation are removed from their context and given to an animal of some kind. <br /> <br /> Aardman Animation toured the country interviewing people with innocuous questions like "Are you a liar?" and then speed up questions about your sex life a little. <br /> <br /> The answers, although they seem to be boring and mundane, are quite funny, when you understand that the dialogues come first and then the animals are added. . <br /> <br /> How many of these animals resemble the person making the statements? One of the characters that discuss what he looks for in a woman, "I like them a little thin". It is an insect, the cane. <br /> <br /> There are two dogs that talk about scents and smells, while sniffing a poodle's butt, while talking about the different smells of a woman. <br /> <br /> There are two birds in a cage. While the "wife" tells the litany that it is her health, her husband suffered with her, without saying anything. <br /> <br /> While "Creature Comforts" takes some time to find their "legs", I should find a place on TV for those who are tired of the normal. While there are more reality shows that Carter has pills for the liver, "Creature Comforts" is unique in its genre and definitely worth seeing. <br /> <br /> Part of the humor may seem a bit crazy, it is the phrase that catches the public. Children's attention (like the old Batman series of the 60s, the jokes are subtle enough that children do not catch them) and the jokes are for adults.
