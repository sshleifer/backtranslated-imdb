The late Dudley Moore had the most famous role of his career too short in ARTHUR 1981, a very funny and alternately moving story that generates warm smiles, great laughter and an occasional tear if you're in a good mood. Moore received an Oscar nomination for Best Actor for his performance as Arthur Bach, a drunken playboy who "runs cars, plays tennis, caresses women, but has free weekends and is his own boss." Arthur is destined to inherit 750 million dollars when he marries a girl from the presumed society named Susan Johnston (Jill Eikenberry), who is the spoiled daughter of an undercover gangster. Things get sticky when Arthur meets Linda Morolla (Liza Minnelli), a waitress / actress from Queens who steals ties for her father's birthday. Moore lights the screen in one of the funniest performances of the last 50 years. The late Sir John Gielgud won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his impeccable turn as Arthur's butler and best friend, Hobson, whose contempt for Arthur's behavior encompasses more parental feelings. There are other fun contributions from Barney Martin as Linda's father. Stephen Elliott as Susan's father, and Geraldine Fitzgerald as Arthur's insane grandmother. The film was directed with a keen eye for comedy by a director named Steve Gordon, who, unfortunately, died the following year. There was also a forgettable sequel several years later, but this instant classic is not to be missed.
