So I turned on the digital subscriber channels one night a couple of years ago and I thought I would spend half an hour watching "Girlfight" while I waited for "Hart's War" to start. With a title like that, I realized that it was a kind of "B" movie about gangs of girls in the center of the city. <br /> <br /> To my great surprise, it was not about that at all. Instead, it's a well-written and well-written story about a young woman who almost accidentally gets into female boxing. She is responsible for taking her younger brother to her practice sessions and getting interested while watching her episodes. Since he really does not want to be a boxer (just following his father's wishes) she convinces his coach to take her instead. <br /> <br /> The story unfolds in an intelligent and credible way as it goes through several tests in its search. For starters, his brother's coach does not want to face a boxer. After doing it reluctantly, there is the problem of aligning the matches for her. Then, the confrontation with his father when he finds out what is happening. Yes, a love interest develops, but it serves to improve the plot, since it resembles more an interesting interhuman reaction with its own consequences related to the struggle. <br /> <br /> In short, this is a great little movie about the dream that few seem to have heard of Some time later, when I saw the much-advertised and acclaimed "Million Dollar Baby", I thought "wait a minute, This seems like something familiar to me. " Needless to say, that night I did not see "Hart's War".
