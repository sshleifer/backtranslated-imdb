I really enjoyed watching this movie. It has a great orientation, by the well-known Bigas Luna, born in Spain. And it is precisely in Spain where the film is made, in Catalonia, to be more precise. <br /> <br /> Luna explores once more the issue of an obcession, in this case the obduracy of a child by women. Milk. There are some psychological concepts in this story, such as the rejection complex felt by the eldest son with the birth of his brother. In the film, this is what leads to the acquisition of the child who suddenly sees that all of his mother's milk goes to the newborn child. So he starts trying to find a breast that can nourish him. He finds it in a woman who has just arrived and from here in the film this is all about. <br /> <br /> This film lives a lot of images, more than the story itself, the viewer captures certain moments (unforgettable moments) and certain symbols (the film deserves a thorough analysis of almost everything that happens because it usually means something ...). The environment, the landscapes, typical of the region, as well as the surrealistic behavior of the characters, also symbolic, and the excellent ambiguous soundtrack of Nicola Piovani transport us to another dimension, not parallel to the real world, but which intersects it from the weather. Sometimes ... It's worth living in that world, it's worth watching this movie, although eventually and for a moment we get tired and feel a little sick with the excessive obcession, which may take us beyond the limits. .. <br /> <br /> I also enjoyed the performance of the protagonist ... 8/10
