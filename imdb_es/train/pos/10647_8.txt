I can not understand what it is that the fans of the genre did not like about this movie. It was really fun. The special effects were wonderful. I generally agree with the revisions and with IMDB voters, but not this time. I waited until I got to the home video, which I felt was another reason why I did not like the movie. I think that special effects films should be seen on the big screen, but again this was not the case. For me, the film calls for comparison with two films that premiered at about the same time. Blair witch and the mummy. Both films that I found terrible. Blair was probably the most overrated horror movie of all time. The mummy made lots of money and it was pure dreck. People liked it because of its special effects. Movies like The Mummy and The Haunting are not rich in character development, they are more like funhouse attractions. Well, with that analogy, the mummy was a B ticket to Haunting's electronic ticket.
