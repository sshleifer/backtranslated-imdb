This show is very well done. When it came out for the first time, I thought it was just a happy family comedy with lots of good phrases. It seemed to express very well to many families also, with different concepts of father and son, however, as I said, I never thought about that more than a good watch one night. However, my opinion was shot through the other window when the tragic death of the fantastically funny John Ritter accumulated. The program remained firm and really praised the lives of the characters in a very sensitive way that also moved all the fans of John Ritter, a fantastic actor with the talent to do anything. When the show aired after Ritters passed, I really wanted to hug my dad and let him know how much it meant to me. I thought that this brilliance showed the talent of the three children, particularly the character of Bridget, who was worried about the last words he said. He reminded me that it does not matter what horrible things I say to my dad, I do not mean them and it is very important that he knows this. Big show
