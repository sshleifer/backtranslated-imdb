It is a story that could have taken place anywhere, given the right circumstances. Street artist that attracts the attention of the famous star of the opera and the resulting friendship. The older artist finds / buys a child to pass on his art. From there, we follow them through the rigors of their challenging, but free life along the river. Traveling from city to city, it performs and has a certain degree of notoriety. Despite the times and influences, the man is kind and good. <br /> <br /> In general, the performances are first class, especially Xu Zhu, who plays the street artist. The child (Renying Zhou) is beautiful, and very strong, and he bears well the manifest prejudices. The two protagonists, along with the support of the amiable opera singer, Master Liang (an interesting and androgynous Zhao Zhigang), paint a very interesting story of forgiveness, sadness and love. Some have mentioned the remote similarities of this film with BA WANG BIE JI (FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE); however, this film can not be easily sustained by itself, any resemblance is remote at best. <br /> <br /> My only complaint with the KING OF MASKS is the end. It was weak, clich√©d, and as subtle as a hammer. The audience was already involved in the story, what was unnecessary manipulation for? What a pity. To take a good moving image so far, only to surrender to emotional (and corny) pathos in that way. Frankly, he made this movie good, instead of classic, it should have been. Apart from that, the KING OF THE MASKS is still worth it. I was glad to see that the Shaw brothers are still producing good movies. Highly recommended
