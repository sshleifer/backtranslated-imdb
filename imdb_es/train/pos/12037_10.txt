The Woman In Black was a British film made for television that was aired for the first time on the BBC at Christmave Eve in '89, and again in '92. I think he made a round on American television at A & E. It was released on VHS in Britain in the early 90s, but sold out. A US company released it on DVD later, but that version also sold out. According to the author's website, the rights to the film are now owned by another person and will not be published again, and unofficial bootlegs are being sold on eBay. <br /> <br /> The first time I heard about this movie was recently on a message board and I had to see it. I found a copy on eBay for about $ 28. It is sure to be a fake from a seller in the Far East, although the DVD says "Made in Canada", ha ha. But it's a good copy, and you really can not blame the bootleg labels for releasing material that is rare, discontinued and lost in legal disputes. <br /> <br /> I love the movie. It is a period piece set in the 1920s, with all the very authentic and picturesque British configurations of that era. The Woman in Black is very atmospheric and dark. For the most part, the film is very discreet, but effective and terrifying. There is no self-indulgent gore, violence or much at all in special effects, but The Woman In Black can still create absolutely chilling moments. It's a spooky classic-style ghost movie. The film itself looks like it could have been made in the 1930s, except for the color. Without the flash of all modern horror movies, I'm afraid this movie will always be a lost gem. For me, it is placed as one of my favorites of all time.
