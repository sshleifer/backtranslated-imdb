Beyond the excellent direction, production, performance and predictable drama, is an essential message in the script: <br /> <br /> "Listening leads all the way" For the voice to flourish, listen. To harmonize with others in Voice, listen. To get close to yourself, listen. To discover the needs of any situation or other people, listen. It seems that script writers are transmitting a "secret of life". Listening leads to self-awareness. Awakens the other senses, especially vision and expands the horizon. You can also discover one's soul. The art of this film "How it is in heaven" magnificently showed the development of life, not only its joy and sadness, but also the hope of life. All this for the first instruction of the choir of the main character; <br /> <br /> "Just listen, take it all the way"
