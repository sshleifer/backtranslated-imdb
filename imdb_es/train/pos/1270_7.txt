This movie really is a mixed bag. On the one hand, the story and the concept of the film are really good, tense and have some nice plot twists in it. But, on the other hand, on the other hand, everything is said very slow, without style and without participation. However, I consider "Just Cause" as a thriller above average simply because of the excellent cast. <br /> <br /> Maybe Sean Connery was a villain in his role. I mean, he's not really as credible as the main "hero" and father of a young daughter (played by a very young Scarlett Johansson by the way) and Kate Capshaw's husband. I feel like he was just too old for the role to be really believable in him. However, Sean Connerey is, of course, a great actor and that is the only reason he is still able to take the film as well as he is. But, of course, it's aided by a very strong supporting cast that includes actors like Laurence Fishburne, Blair Underwood, Ned Beatty, Hope Lange, Lynne Thigpen and Ed Harris. All the actors are really good, but some of them are very underutilized at the same time, which is a real pity and a missed opportunity. Especially Ed Harris is totally great in his role as psychopathic serial killer. He is really creepy and is acting superbly. Normally, he does not play this kind of ruthless and chilling roles in movies, so he really surprises with his role in this. His solo performance is already more than enough reason to see this movie. However, due to the fact that the story is told without much style and too much formulated, none of the characters in the film really works well because it feels very distant. <br /> <br /> It really is the way of telling stories. That kills the whole movie its great potential. Arne Glimcher directs the film with little style and keeps the pace too low at times. Because of this, we, as spectators, never really get involved with the story or with any of its characters. <br /> <br /> It's really a shame, because "Just Cause" had more than enough potential. A fine cast and a polished story with some unexpected twists in which nothing is as it seems. The cast and the story are the only reason why this film is still an above-average thriller, which will probably please the genre fan. However, it is an eternal shame that the film lacks its narration and style, or else this film could have been a true classic in its genre. <br /> <br /> 7/10
