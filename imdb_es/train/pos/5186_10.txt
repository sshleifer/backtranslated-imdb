I was delighted to finally see the release of Amazing Stories in the first season on DVD. I had forgotten what kind of actors and directors worked on this series. For a long time, the only way you could see this remarkable series was with the collections of episodes VHS 2 or 3 or when Sci-Fi would rerun the episodes. However, when Sci-Fi would host the replays, they usually stayed with the same episodes. There were some episodes featured in the first season as The Mission that they did not repeat. Does anyone know exactly how long this series lasted? It says 1985 to 1987 at the top here in IMDb, but I thought it lasted more than two years. If you loved Twilight Zone, Night Gallery and Outer Limits, you will love this series and you will not be disappointed with your purchase.
