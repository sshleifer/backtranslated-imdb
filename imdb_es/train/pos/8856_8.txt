BEFORE THE DEVIL IS THAT HE IS DEAD he begins in a promising way, establishing a simple theft that goes wrong, counted from different perspectives (in the style of RASHOMON). Around the hour or so, Sidney Lumet transforms this movie into something that is much more than the sum of its parts; it finally becomes a multifaceted family drama, exploring the full realm of human emotions / relationships, as the story reaches its chilling climax. <br /> <br /> As is the case with Lumet, he manages to convince an exceptional performance outside his cast full of stars, without any notion of excess action or hyperbole. Philip Seymour Hoffman, in one of his best roles, is a complex, mysterious and interesting character, and often dwarfs Ethan Hawke, who plays his brother, Hank. That does not mean that Hawke is not bad; in fact, it is well above the appropriate, in a problematic role that suits your style. Marisa Tomei is excellent for her relatively short appearance (the fact that she discovers her flesh adds to this). The character of Albert Finney (Andy and Hank's father) is the most intriguing and, in my opinion, deserved a little more screen time. Amy Ryan also does her job properly. <br /> <br /> BEFORE THE DEVIL KNOWS YOU ARE NOT DEAD is not an exceptional movie, but it shows that Lumet is still at the top of his game in the (apparent) twilight of An Illustrious Career. Many of its characteristics and trademarks appear here, among which is the use of its characters. Infused with a killer script (no pun), intelligent dialogue and rhythm, and a decent score, BEFORE THE DEVIL KNOWS YOU ARE DEAD is a must. A true underestimated jewel. 8/10. 3 stars (of 4). I should enter my Top 250 in 248. Highly recommended.
