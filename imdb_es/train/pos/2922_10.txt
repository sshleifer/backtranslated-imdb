This movie is a perfect example of a movie that divides people into 2 groups. Those who understand the joke and those who do not. People usually attack what they do not understand. This movie has a comic style and a charm that has been incomparable ever since. It's a GREAT comedy ... and a GREAT romance. It's a perfect date movie. A perfect movie for someone who wants a good cheerful laugh. And if your perspective is too tense, maybe this movie is not for you, and you may need advice. It is an injustice that Paramount has kept this film on the shelf since the early 80s, since it had never seen the light of day on DVD. However, they feel that an urban version of "The Honeymooners" is a good idea. I find it strange that my two favorite romantic comedies of all time have never been released on DVD. The other one is Gene Wilder's "The Best Lover in the World", in which Fox has sat since the early 80's too ... However, "From Justin to Kelly" is found in almost every video store in the country . There is no justice in the world. Maybe those who took the time to hit this will enjoy "From Justin to Kelly", I'm sure one is watered enough that they can "get it". Sometimes, with age, people lose their sense of humor ... Or sometimes they simply run out and find a comical satisfaction in the "Full House" reruns.
