I must admit that I am a big fan of South Park and I expected basketball to be fun, but in no way as good as it turned out to be! I think this is what happens when they mix David Zucker, Matt Stone and Trey Parker. This movie has so much repetition value and never bothers to take it seriously. The slap stick style humor mixed with Stone and Parker simply works perfectly. The type of humor present in basketball was not popular at the time of its release and, if it were published today, it would be a success. Do not bother trying to be critical, just leave your brain at the door and wait for endless laughs. Recommended for anyone with a good sense of humor.
