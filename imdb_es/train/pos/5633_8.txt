Farrah Fawcett is excellent in this powerful drama of 1986, where she plays Marjorie, a woman who manages to escape from the clutches of a possible rapist. Well done to Farrah for being a nominee for the "Best Actress" of the Golden Globes. <br /> <br /> When her rapist Joe (terribly played by James Russo) enters her house, she shares it with her two mates of room (which are conveniently out!), Marjorie has to play along with Joe's terrifying demands. It makes some disturbing and shocking images! <br /> <br /> When their roommates return home, they are amazed (to say the least) by Marjorie's actions, and a great performance by Alfre Woodard who desperately tries to convince Marjorie. to do the right thing and make him a cop, makes the movie even more scathing. <br /> <br /> I find Diana Scarwid quite annoying, but when Joe finally admits that he came there to kill them all. , makes the film a very emotional piece of drama. <br /> <br /> In general, Extremities is a brilliantly thought out and well-performed film and I've seen it hundreds of times already! Well done to everyone involved.
