I think the deal with this movie is that it has about 2 minutes of really fun moments and makes a very good trailer and many people came with the expectations of the trailer and this time the film is not up to par. the trailer. It's a bit slower and it creeps a little slowly for such an exciting premise, and I think I'm seeing in the comments people who have a love / hate relationship with this movie. <br /> <br /> However, if you look at this movie for what it is and not for what I might have been considering the casting talent, I think it's still pretty good. Julia Stiles is clearly the star, she is so dazed and carefree that she is among the conformity of everyone else, she simply shines and the whole audience falls in love with her along with Lee. The rest of the cast, of course, Lee's testosterone-filled co-workers, his elegant mother-in-law, his sympathetic friend Jim and his future wife, do an excellent job of adapting to the stereotypes of compliance and boredom that make Stiles. We stand out in the first place. <br /> <br /> Lee is not up to his costs, I do not think so, but you could see that it is more difficult for them to live up to it. Maybe that is a source of disappointment. <br /> <br /> The film itself, despite a bit of slowness and some jokes that are not as funny as the writer intended, is still quite funny and I found an intelligent movie. The issues of compliance and "take the safe way" seemed to line up skillfully in several layers. For example, there was the whole reason for how he would imagine scenarios but he would never act on them until the last scene, or how he listened to a radio program on the road talking about how everyone adapts, or just how everything is blame and characters. Julia Stiles said and echoed those issues in which one person was the safe option and the other risky. <br /> <br /> The other good thing about the movie was that I was a kind of comedian. in which Jason Lee has to keep lying throughout the film and who through bad luck (for example, the pharmacist who has become a good chef) and a bit of cunning on his part gets away with the as much as possible. <br /> <br /> While it was not as much fun as I expected and there was a bit of talent wasted, but overall it's still a good movie.
