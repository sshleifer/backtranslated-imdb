Hi guys, I'm actually in this movie! I did not even know I was in this place until I looked a few years ago and I was very surprised! I played Pete, the main characters of the son. It was a great experience and I loved every minute. While filming, they needed me to be in two places at once, so they used my twin sister as a double body! The finger that presses the radio button on the car is yours, not mine. I still act and do some television, but not so much. Oh, and if you want a test, my name is the first one on the top of the roll. <br /> <br /> Review: I thought the movie was fine, but if I was not in it, it would not be one. from my favorites I thought the performance was really good, but the story was just regular.
