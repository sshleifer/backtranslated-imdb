If you "understand" it, it is magnificent. <br /> <br /> If you do not do it, it's decent. <br /> <br /> Understand that "getting it" does not necessarily mean you have gone through a school shooting. There is so much more in this film that, at times, shooting at school becomes insignificant. <br /> <br /> Above all, it is a film about the acceptance, both superficially, of a traumatic event, as well as of people who are different for whatever reason. <br /> <br /> It is also a film about excruciating pain and how people endure it. In this case, the contrast between Alicia's anger and Deanna's obsession creates an atmosphere of anxiety so palpable that in the middle of the film we wonder how the director could draw a happy ending from his hat. Fortunately, the audience is given credit for being human beings; our intelligence is not insulted by a sadistic ending, unbelievably moralistic. <br /> <br /> Beyond that, I try to keep a clear head about movies being fiction and all that. However, I must admit that I cried like a lost baby during this movie. There were certain things that hit * very * close to home and opened some old wounds that never healed completely. But that is not necessarily a bad thing.
