For anyone who thinks that this program is not for them, please try it. Networked television has degenerated into programs that are clones of clones or reality-based programs that present people who are often unreal. This program is a return to family-oriented television where the emphasis is on learning some life lessons, learning what real friends and family are about, and maybe even learning a little about our national pastime. Jeremy Sumpter is one of the most attractive young actors in the entertainment world today, and he is perfectly chosen as the new naive batboy for the fictitious New York Empire (big name!). Dean Cain, Christopher Lloyd, Mare Winningham and Kirsten Storms complete the main cast, and all are exceptional. This show deserves an opportunity to capture and be seen. Hopefully it stays for a few seasons and we can see Pete Young (the character of Sumpter) learn and grow.
