Having heard of Modesty Blaise before, but never having read a novel or a comic strip, my wife and I really liked the movie. He delivered, in a captivating way, a good introduction to the character and his background. <br /> <br /> Although it has some elements of action, it is much more an intimate work, excellently written. Unfortunately, this is also where a big drawback of the movie is revealed. An intimate work lives on the capabilities of its actors and, unfortunately, only half of the cast was delivered. While Alexandra Staden did an excellent job as Modesty Blaise, her counterpart Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, like the villain Miklos, did not do it. Smiling through the plot as if it were an extensive commercial toothpaste, it fails to create an atmosphere of anxiety that would have made the film a masterpiece. The cast of support is somewhat similar, from some stereotyped gangsters and whores to decent performances by Fred Pearson as Professor Lob and Eugenia Yuan as Irina.
