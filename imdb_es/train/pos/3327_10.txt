I love and admire the Farrelly brothers! Why could I only watch this great movie 3 years after its release? It made me laugh, it made me cry and it warmed my heart. Great time It's hard to describe in my rotten English, but I have to try it anyway: <br /> <br /> The cast is excellent everywhere, from the leader to the supporting roles, the acting is excellent, the dialogues They are excellent and the film is perfectly directed and edited. <br /> <br /> I think that the Farrelly brothers' films are often underestimated, they are not light comedies, they are deeeeeep! They talk about what life is about (I will not tell you!). <br /> <br /> In my case, this movie told me what relationships are about: <br /> <br /> If you love someone: let them go, let them be, try to share the passion and the pain and always know the one with the other. <br /> <br /> I am not a fan of sports, but I am definitely an ignorant of sports. . But in this movie, the vibrations catch you. I could smell the baseball atmosphere. Finally, this film explained to me what it can mean for you to be a sports fan and what great fan families should be out there. <br /> <br /> Thank you very much, Pete and Bob! <br /> <br /> PS: If you have not seen it, please check out KINGPIN!
