"Crush" examines female friendship, for the most part avoiding the quality of saccharin that spoils so many movies with the same theme (for example, "Steel Magnolias"). At the same time, it reveals the power of a sudden passion to overwhelm and surprise. The events described were highly unlikely, but the underlying emotional truth seemed very genuine to me. It is not a movie for the multitude of vehicles and explosions, but older women respond with laughter and tears.
