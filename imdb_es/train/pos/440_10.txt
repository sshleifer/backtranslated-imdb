My favorite movie of all time. Oscar-sized work by all involved, both in front of and behind the camera. The script is perfect and resolves the relationship between Lady Caroline and George Briggs in a completely satisfactory way, unlike the novel. The care with which the other main characters have been drawn is a tribute to screenwriter Peter Barnes, and the intense visual beauty should have won the Oscars for director Mike Newell and cinematographer Rex Maidment. It is Josie Lawrence's best work by far, and it transformed my opinion of Joan Plowright. Having seen this movie at least 50 times, I can not find fault with it. The music, by the famous composer Richard Rodney Bennet is a marvel.
