Neil Simon's Sunshine Boys, starring Walter Matthau and George Burns, is a funny comedy about the strange link to life and its shortage, but laughter always has a bitter taste. When you see Willy Clark (Matthau) and Al Lewis (Burns) two great comedy actors now reduced by the imbecility of hard and incessant old age, you can only feel anger and sadness. Willy will never give up and will continue to look for work, while Al is tired of the players and retired to the country at home to his daughter. The couple in their previous time was really fun and harmonious, but outside the scene there was a continuous dispute and fight, and for eleven years after their break they did not speak. Now, if you want to work, you must come back together again to make one of your best sketches for a television comedy show. The meeting is explosive and liberating for the old questions. The screenplay of Neil Simon gives a certain corrosive spirit to the story and the melancholy and blue that overwhelm the many gags and laughter managed to generate a good combination also thanks to a great couple Walter Matthu (Nominations Academy Award for Best Actor ) and George Burns (Prize Winner). the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor). The two actors are very credible and real and their harmony seems almost as if they worked together during all that time and that reality that they can not stand between them. The film is very touching also because of its reality, since the story is narrated and how the Love-Heat report that unites the two actors is a totally real part of the strange but at the same time generally understandable things for life. My rate is 7.
