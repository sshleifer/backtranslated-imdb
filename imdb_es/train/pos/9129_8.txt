When this movie first came out in 1984, Prince was one of the most popular acts. Everyone wanted to see this movie, which was not much more than an extended music video. The acting was pretty bad, but what can you expect from the musicians who perform on the big screen for the first time? Despite that, it was still a very entertaining movie! Morris Day and Jerome Benton provide classic comedy of all time, especially his interpretation of "The Password", which will make you think of Abbott and Costello doing their baseball routine "who is in the first". <br /> <br /> Appolina (who was by only one name at the time) provided some beautiful breasts, so she covered the brief nudity. Also, she is very attractive. And, of course, the soundtrack of the album is one of the best recordings of Prince ever recorded. Later, Prince had a dispute with Warner Bros. and changed his name, but at this particular moment in his career, he was at the top of his game. <br /> <br /> This movie is not in the whole Great category of time, but it is quite entertaining.
