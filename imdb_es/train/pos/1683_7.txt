I saw this movie, since it was the second film of a disc that contained the "Rites de sangre" of Video Nasty, previously forbidden. As the Blood Rites were completely horrible, I really did not expect much from this movie; but in reality, it seems that the garbage director Andy Milligan has been overcome this time as Seeds of Sin leads the Blood Rites with style and stands out as a more than adequate portion of the sick sexploitation of the sixties. The plot is quite similar to the blood rites, since we focus on a dysfunctional family unit, and of course; There is an inheritance at stake. The film is shot in black and white, and its appearance reminded me a lot of the garbage classic "The Curious Dr Humpp". There is hardly blood on the screen, and the director seems more interested in focusing on sex, with themes of incest and hatred that filter. The acting is typically of poor quality, but most women appear nude at some point and, despite their bad reputation, director Andy Milligan seems to have an eye for this kind of thing, since many of the sequences in this movie are pretty beautiful. The plot is thin as paper, and most of the film is filler; but the music is catchy, and the director also does a surprisingly good job with the sex scenes, since most of them are somewhat erotic. In general, this is not a great movie; but it is likely to attract the cult fanatic, and get a much higher recommendation than the better known and lesser quality 'Blood Rites'.
