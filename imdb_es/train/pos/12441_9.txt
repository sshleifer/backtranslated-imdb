This was the modesty we did not know! It was hinted at and summarized in the comic strip for unions to sell to newspapers! Lee and Janet Batchler were true Modesty Blaise fans who were given The Dream Job; They tell a prequel to the story of Modesty that fans never saw before. In their audio-commentary, they admitted that they made changes in their origin to make the story more fluid. The "purists" must also keep in mind that we really do not know if everything she told Miklos was true because she was "stuck with time". I did not rent or lend the DVD as other "critics" did, I bought it! And I do not want a refund! I saw it three times and I could not sleep! Great dialogue and well-drawn characters that I cared about (even the bad Miklos) as in the novels and comics! I can not wait for the next Modesty movie (and Willie) either, especially if this "prequel" is a sign of what's to come!
