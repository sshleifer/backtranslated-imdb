This is an amazing movie and all the actors and actresses and very well! Although some of the actors and actresses were not very popular in the entertainment world, they seemed to have performed since they were a year old! It was funny, disgusting and everything was a very good movie. In most of the parts I did not know what was going to happen next! I had the impression that this is going to happen, wait, I think it will happen. All ages will love this movie! In some places I could not stop laughing, it was very funny, but in some parts I was totally angry and could not believe what I was seeing. I will definitely see this movie again! It's one of those movies where you can not get bored. Every time you see it, it's so suspenseful. I definitely recommend watching this movie!
