Due to the invention of a "Domestication Collar", zombies that eat meat are put under control and become productive members of society; However, they perform low-level tasks. The servile dead attend those who live in small cities of the 50s delimited by the United States, while untamed zombies roam "The Wild Zone". In the town of "Willard," preteen K'Sun Ray (as Timmy Robinson) lives with parents Carrie-Anne Moss and Dylan Baker (as Helen and Bill Robinson). Unfortunately, the Robinsons are the only family on their street that does not own a zombie; Their new neighbors, the Bottoms, have six. So, to keep up, the Robinsons get the zombie Billy Connolly (as Fido). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Mr. Connolly's "Domestication Collar" is damaged by an old woman's walker, and he eats it; Then, new and hungry zombies infest the city. Meanwhile, young Ray has joined Connolly (the boy and his zombie are like "Timmy and Lassie" on television) and, the Robinson family, find it difficult to cooperate with the controlling authorities of "Zomcom." <br /> <br /> "Fido" does not go far enough in his own intriguing "Wild Zone"; but, it is a colorful, elegant and satirically funny addition to the history of zombie cinema. Ray and the cast act well, individually; with the zombie clouds Sonja Bennett (as Tammy) and owner Tim Blake Nelson (as Theopolis) the most memorable couple. Director Andrew Currie and his team, including Rob Gray (design), Jan Kiesser (photography), Don MacDonald (music) and James Willcock (design), deservedly won awards. <br /> <br /> ****** * Fido (2006) Andrew Currie ~ K'Sun Ray, Carrie-Anne Moss, Billy Connolly, Dylan Baker
