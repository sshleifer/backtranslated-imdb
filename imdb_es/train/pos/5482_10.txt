This is an amazing movie. In addition to showing real images of key events in the failed coup to expel Ch√°vez, we are given the background image that describes a society divided into classes. Apparently, many of the rich have an option with the democratic election of the people and are willing to use the army for regime change. 'Be careful what you say in front of your servants' is a revealing comment. The head of the largest oil company in the country names himself as the new president, with the support of the United States, and these young Irish filmmakers have it all on camera. A great movie to educate young people about democracy. We see a transparent documentation of how the media can be manipulated, and the force used, in the interests of large companies, against the interests of the democratic desires of the people.
