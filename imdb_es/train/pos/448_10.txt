I think this movie is absolutely beautiful. And I do not mean just the breathtaking landscapes. They are two unhappy English housewives who decide to rent an Italian castle to take a break from their not so happy family life. In the end, four women rent the place together, all with different personalities and different reasons to be there. In this magically beautiful place, everyone finds the peace they crave and, curiously, peace comes from inner reflections and resolutions, rather than from outside. I also find it wonderful because of the relationships that develop with kindness and understanding. Acting is a joy to see in itself. I especially love the characters of Lottie (Josie Lawrence) and Lady Caroline (Polly Walker).
