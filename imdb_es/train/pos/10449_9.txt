I had never heard of this movie a couple of weeks ago, but its concept interested me when I heard it: an American man meets a European woman on his last night in Europe and they spend the night together talking. It aroused my interest, but I never expected it to be so good. Before Sunrise is a masterpiece, and it is also one of the most romantic movies ever recorded. To my surprise, I completely lacked the cynicism of the nineties. It really is impossible to talk too much about that, since there is no real plot, so to speak (although there are many very interesting things that you could talk about, it's something like My Dinner With Andre, where there is a conversation, but it's not ONLY the conversation that matters), but let me just say, see it. LOOK AT IT!
