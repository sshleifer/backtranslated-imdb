This is a free adaptation of Clarence Mulford's novels; Fans of the Willaim Boyd movies will probably feel a bit at sea here (and the reviews here so far reflect it). But I first learned about Hopalong from the novels, and I never really cared about Boyd's movies once I met them. <br /> <br /> Christopher Coppola has made a wise decision: he has not made a "Western" nostalgia. ; instead, he has addressed Cassidy's story as a part of what we used to call "American"; or what older critics once called 'homespun'. As the film developed, I found myself remembering more and more the great "Hallmark Theater" version of Mark Twain's "Roughing It", with the narration of James Garner. <br /> <br /> Both films remind us that, although films about the "Old West" are probably always myths for Americans, they do not need to be "Western"; They may very well be just movies about what it meant to be American at that time, in that place. <br /> <br /> I was never pleased to see this movie; there is no effort to push the legacy of Boyd-Cassidy down our throats, or irony, or camp. Consequently, I have the feeling that these characters have walked, or ridden, through a true west of North America that I too could have walked a hundred years ago. <br /> <br /> In view of this, the clarity of the film, positively avoids everything we have come to call "style": is in its favor; and the simple performance of the interpreters fits perfectly with this; My God, it really feels like a story told around a campfire on a cattle farm - without visual clothing, just the quirks and good humor - and the sudden violence - that we expect from the good narration of a thread of adventure. I was pleasantly surprised by this film, and if the viewer leaves aside enculturated expectations, he or she will find great pleasure in it. <br /> <br /> I would have given 9 stars to this movie, but give it a ten just because most of the critics here have lost the point completely; and I urge you to put aside your memories of Boyd and give this film another shot. <br /> <br /> Note 1: A critic complained that Hopalong shoots dead people in this movie, instead of shooting them with guns. (Cassyd's wing of Boyd); First, Cassidy shoots the dead people in the novels; Second, if Cassidy were a true cowboy, he would have shot people to death. The problem with firing guns at people's hands is that they can always get another gun, which is part of the subtext of this same movie. <br /> <br /> Note 2: I admit that I am jealous of the Coppola family, that they have the "The Godfather" Director among them, who can give them all the opportunities to make films that I can not; but a good movie is a good movie; And this is a good movie. If it's by someone with the name of "Coppola", well, that's how it is. America is the land of opportunity (or was, until Bush took office), that is what the great American novels are about.
