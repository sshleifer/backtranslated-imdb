I remember when I was five years old and my parents thought it was a regular cartoon movie ... except when bras and bullets started flying. I have to agree that this film will make everyone angry because he is willing to discriminate against everyone and everyone ... but the truth is that it is funny and profound. I recommend it to anyone who likes cult classics. Also try the cat Fritz and the NEW Lives of the cat Fritz. If I'm right, Ralph Bashki also made that movie. It is a cat that goes through difficult times with family, street, work, etc. When I was old enough, I rented all these movies. Because Coonskin was an offensive title during that era, it was also labeled Street Fighter. Ralph Bashki also made Cool World starring a very young Brad Pitt. Heavy traffic was another caricature that dealt with the street life of a young man.
