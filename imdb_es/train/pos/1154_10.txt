I think this is possibly the funniest movie I've ever seen. Robert Harling's script is almost perfect, just check out the "dating" section; On second thought, simply rent the DVD, since it is the delivery that really makes the lines sing. <br /> <br /> Sally Field offers a comedy, exceptional performance like you've never seen of her anywhere else. And Kevin Kline is effortlessly hilarious. Robert Downey, Jr. is usually brilliant, and in a very small role, Kathy Najimy is an uproar like the besieged client. I was never a big fan of Elisabeth Shue, but she is great here as the only real person surrounded by a group of cartoon characters on the set of "The Sun Also Sets": the rumble you feel under you is Hemingway. in his grave. Either that or he is laughing very loudly. <br /> <br /> Five stars. Fun, fun, fun
