['This movie will not sit well with some, but it is a must. I am glad that someone has finally brought into discussion the realities of HOW African-American couples worked to make a name for themselves in communities and how many of them felt trying to stay there when &quot;other&quot; African-Americans moved. <br /><br /> (Minor spoilers) <br /><br /> This little Showtime movie is almost like a Spike Lee Joint ... you have an African-American man (Danny Glover) who made his way through traditionally white law jobs in the 70s. Like ANY American, he moved his family to be compatible with his ascending mobile status, but he forgot that there were still many problems. The only African-Americans in the neighborhood at that time were the maids. A homeowner? Wow. <br /><br /> Then the merger began in. His wife (Whoopi Goldberg) is told to &quot;get involved,&quot; so he does what all the other women in his neighborhood do. And just when the man thinks that he and his family are &quot;inside&quot;, next comes another African-American who entered because he won the &quot;lottery&quot; (Mo&#39;nique), and in his eyes he does not want to have anything to do with them. because he does not want the neighborhood to think they are the same. He, of course, is of better caliber, his new neighbor is &quot;ghetto&quot;, he should not be there! Who has a problem now? <br /><br /> What this film shows you is the great pain that the family needs to adapt and how they get lost in the process. It makes you ask where racism begins and ends ... and with whom. Show how it does not matter what color you are and how much money you have, you can still disconnect from the real world and help those around you. It also shows how these African-American children, when they &quot;mix&quot; in neighborhoods like these, fall into the trap of changing themselves to adapt to the culture (complete with blond hair and blue eyes, of course!) Around them. They laugh along with the jokes, not knowing that they ARE the joke and without knowing ... why. <br /><br /> But in general, this movie is about &#39;people&#39;. No matter what race it is, this film shows how terrible it can be towards your neighbor and towards the other ... all for the simple fact of adapting ... all because you feel that you have more money than the others, so you it gets automatically. better, and you forget about the struggles you had and the ones that followed you. <br /><br /> Again, NOT for everyone. But look and judge for yourself. <br /><br />']
