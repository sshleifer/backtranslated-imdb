I was so excited to see this movie because I had always heard that it was very scary. <br /> <br /> The interesting thing about this is that it's a Japanese movie that they decided to bring to the United States, but they actually filmed it IN Japan with the original equipment! I think this made the movie ... more Japanese (which is probably the reason why it managed to be quite successful unlike most of the failures of horror movies from Japan to America), but it also made it a bit inaccessible to the American public. The difference in what scares Japanese culture and what scares American culture was felt throughout the film. This worked well at times when they pretended to capture the nervous fear of the main character: a frightened fish in a large, busy and unfamiliar Tokyo pond. <br /> <br /> The story was also quite confusing. In typical Japanese fashion it is extremely complicated and confusing. The beginning of the film is actually the center of the story and from there we constantly move back and forth until, at the end of the film, we see the end and the beginning of the whole story. This constant change of time was very confusing for me. Also, I did not think that some things were explained so well and I had to ask my friend to explain them to me (she had already seen it, as well as the sequel that apparently reveals more of the story). <br /> <br /> In general, there are many things that love the American public, tons of strange images and macabre details that are a healthy touch of jumping scenes.
