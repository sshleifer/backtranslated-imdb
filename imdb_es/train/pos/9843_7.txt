Gather some characters that would not normally be seen together (not to mention, try to save a human baby and return it to your father). They start as enemies and end up as best friends. If this sounds like a Disney movie, it is (it was only made through 20th Century Fox). The trailer of the movie was one of the best I've seen in a long time, but the film does not fit the expectation of the whole trailer. The problem lies in the fact that the creators of the film did not decide who is the target audience of the film. Yes, there are some jokes in the movie that only adults will understand, but the film is aimed primarily at children. Parents will enjoy the fact that for 90 min. The attention of their children focuses on something more than them. The backgrounds are excellent and the voice is good, but this is just a good movie. Children will love this movie, adults will only like it.
