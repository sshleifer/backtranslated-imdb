At first glance, I expected this movie to be horrible because I thought the plot would be excessively feminist. But I was wrong. As you may have read in comments previously published, I agree that the feminist part in this film does not bother. I never had the idea that the main character was exaggerating his position as a woman. It is as if Guzm√°n presents himself as someone with a spine, this in contrast to his classmates. So I was surprised by the story, in fact, I thought it was pretty good, except for the predictable end. Maybe it would have been a better idea to give a radical twist to the plot, so that the viewer feels a little more surprised. <br /> <br /> In addition, I would like to say that Rodriguez earned her respect for the way she kept her character. I really can not explain why, but especially in love scenes I was convinced. I think it looked real. <br /> <br /> I gave it a 7 out of 10, just for the last boring half hour.
