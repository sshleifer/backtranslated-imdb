Some of the background details of this story are based, in a very general way, on real events of the era in which it was placed. The story combines some of the details of the famous case of Leopold and Loeb, along with a bit of Aimee Semple McPherson. <br /> <br /> The story begins with two mothers (Shelley Winters and Debbie Reynolds) who are harassed when they leave a courtroom. The crowd seems to be more determined to harm them physically because their children were condemned for a heinous crime. A person from the crowd apparently cuts Winters' hand as they head for a waiting car. <br /> <br /> Shortly after arriving home, they begin to receive threatening phone calls, so Reynolds suggests that they both move West Coast together and open a dance school. The dance school is a success and they cater to incredibly obnoxious parents who think their son is the next Shirley Temple. One of the parents of these spoiled children is a billionaire who is quite in love with Reynolds and they start dating. Life seems very good. But when the threats of telephone calls begin again, Winters responds with a gesture: he behaves as if he is approaching a psychotic pause and retires more and more to religion; He listens on the radio to "Sister Alma" almost constantly. Again and again, you see Winters on edge and in the end it ends up in very bad things. I will not say more, since it could spoil this interesting thriller. <br /> <br /> In many ways, this movie looks a lot like the horror films of Bette Davis and Joan Crawford of the 1960s like "Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?", "Straight-Jacket" and "The Nanny". While none of these are exactly of intellectual value, on a kitsch level they are immensely entertaining and fun. The writing is very good and there are some nice twists near the end that make it very exciting. Winters is great as a frail and insane lady, and Reynolds plays one of the sexiest girls in 39 years I've ever seen, plus she can really dance. <br /> <br /> My only concern is all this. that some might find Winters hyper-religiosity in the film a bit sticky, like a cheap attack on Christianity. At first I felt that way, but when you meet Sister Alma, she seems sincere and does not make fun, so I took Winters religious zeal as just a sign of madness, which, I suppose, is all that was intended. /> <br /> By the way, this movie is packaged along with "Whoever Slew Auntie Roo?", another 1971 Shelley Winters horror movie. Both are very funny ... and very exaggerated!
