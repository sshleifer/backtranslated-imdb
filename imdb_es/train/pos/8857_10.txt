Director Sidney Lumet has done some masterpieces, such as Network, Dog Day Afternoon or Serpico. But he did not have much luck in his most recent works. Gloria (1999) was pathetic and Find Me Guilty was an interesting but failed experiment. Now, Lumet brings his best film in decades and, according to my point of view, a true masterpiece: Before the devil knows that you have died. I think this movie is like a rebirth for Lumet. This film has an excellent story that, deeply, has many layers. Also, I think the end of the movie is perfect. The performances are brilliant. Phil Seymour Hoffman brings, as always, a magnificent performance and, without doubt, is one of the best actors of our time. Ethan Hawke He is also an excellent actor, but he is underestimated by my point of view. Your performance here is excellent. The rest of the cast is also excellent (especially, the great Albert Finney), but these two actors bring monumental performances that unfortunately were ignored by the pathetic Oscars. The film has a good level of intensity, partly look at the presentations and, in part, thanks to the brilliant script. Before the devil knows that you are dead is a true masterpiece with perfect direction, a great script and excellent interpretations. We need more movies like this.
