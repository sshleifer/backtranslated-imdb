Well, magic works in mysterious ways. This movie about 4 prisoners, trying to escape with the help of spells, written by another prisoner centuries ago, was a magnificent occult thriller with a surprising ending and a lot of suspense. Even if he had some theater (almost everything happens in the cell) he never got bored and acted very well. In the tradition of "Cube", you felt trapped with the characters and even if they were criminals, you develop a certain sympathy with some of them, only to change their minds because of the twists the story takes. Some events caught you off guard and there was always a touch of madness in the air. On the whole intense and entertaining, and since I did not expect anything (a friend rented it), it was a positive surprise!
