Twelve Monkeys is a crazy action-and-time movie starring Bruce Willis, who plays James Cole, a man who returns in time to gather information about the devastating plague that ensued in November 1996. Unfortunately, he is also sent from return. Until the year 1990, where everyone thinks he is crazy. <br /> <br /> This film is exciting and has excellent performances by Bruce Willis, Brad Pitt and Madeleine Stowe. Twelve Monkeys is one of the best time travel movies that I think anyone can enjoy. Terry Gilliam has created a true masterpiece <br /> <br /> 10/10
