This is a strong film from a historical and epic perspective. While the story is simple, it is pure and direct. Indeed, it is the standard story of a simple and honorable man whose honor comes into conflict with the more educated and wealthy men of the period. <br /> <br /> Poor vs. Rich, honorable vs. dishonorable, a classic but a well-told story without much of the glitter of Hollywood stinking the screen. <br /> <br /> Extra points only because you can almost smell people on the screen. :)
