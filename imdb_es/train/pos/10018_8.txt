This night listener is better than what people usually say. He has weaknesses and seems to be having a gender identity crisis, no doubt, but I think his spooky atmosphere and interesting performances make up for it. Everything feels like one of those stoves "this happened to a friend of a friend of mine" ghost stories. A big complaint about the film is the rhythm: but the slow and sometimes uncomfortable rhythm is deliberate. Everything that unfolds in this movie is well kept within the scope of the possible, and real life is simply a kind of effort along right? So there are no flashy endings or devastating revelations, or "confrontation" scenes. Thanks to heaven You must enter the area when you are watching this movie, forget your reservations and your expectations of what makes a film (conventionally) good. Williams is not great, but easily satisfies the needs of the story, also assumes that his character is somewhat generic ("Nobody"), since it is the common man, the avatar by which we ourselves enter the story. Toni Collette's performance must be nominated for an Oscar (even if she maybe should not win it). Give it a shot. Just for the quality and the content, The Night Listener is surely in the twenty percent of the films that are published these days.
