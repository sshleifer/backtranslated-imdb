Absolute masterpiece of a movie! Good evening, Mr.Tom has quickly become one of my favorite movies of all time. Nobody should miss the opportunity to see this movie, it's too good! John Thaw perfectly portrays Tom as the rough old man who becomes a soft father figure when he is sent to William Beech (Nick Robinson) for his evacuation, almost like "The mouse of the city and the mouse of the country". A truly heartbreaking film. The director knew exactly how to turn the book into a movie and he has done extremely well. The film was filmed so excellently that the emotions of the characters and what was happening made the audience feel a variety of emotions, from love to fear, and these emotions could turn into sixpence. Set in a moment of turmoil during World War II, this film also shows the difference between cities and the countryside, they are almost like different countries. Something to see, those who are not missing a really amazing and brilliant movie.
