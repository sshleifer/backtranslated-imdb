Goldeneye will always be one of the most legendary games in the history of VG. No doubt about that. But this game, although quite different, could be the current Bond champion of his time. <br /> <br /> This was not a bonus game based on material from another medium. This was completely new; game with a script. That he even had his own song theme! (I would not be united without him, haha!) The game was excellent, and if you're a fan of bonus games or movies, you'll enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Unlike some / most of the games, these cast members portrayed their own characters, as opposed to fictitious creations for the game. What gives that more cinematic feeling. With a very apt story for the "link", you feel like you are in the game as much as you get lost in a movie. <br /> <br /> Pleasant in all aspects, from start to finish. Even after winning the game there is still much more to be done. With the classification system and the unlockables that must be achieved, as well as their multiplayer missions, this is an outstanding game. Despite being quite old now, in years of video games. It's still a good game that you can pick up and play when you feel the need to get a little more Bond in your life. Even now just thinking about it, I have the theme song stuck in my head. A great cast and a well-written story. <br /> <br /> The story comes alive on the screen, almost as if the actors were in front of you, and is as entertaining as the game itself. Superbly done, in the true form of bonuses. Which can only be named Awesome, Completely Awesome. <br /> <br /> I have to go launch this game now. If you have not played it yet, you're missing out!
