I recorded this years ago but I could only see it today. I have been sick, so I had run out of things to see! I'm so glad I saw it, and from which I could erase my memory and see it for the first time. This movie is so wonderful! It reminded me a lot of fried green tomatoes at the Whistlestop Cafe. <br /> <br /> The story goes back in time and at the end of the film we see what the connections are. Some people have said that this is a movie for children. I do not agree. It can be done by Disney and many characters are children, but I am 23 years old and I LOVED! There were times when my spine shuddered. The story is different from any other movie these days, full of adventures. I just ordered the Amazon book, I can not wait!
