Once you raise your jaw off the floor to realize that ... somehow ... they managed to put this together so quickly that it was released the same year that the case ended, you will find that it is not so bad. . The plot is attractive and interesting, and the rhythm is fast, since it covers many situations and, therefore, usually jumps quickly to the next after having spoken one or two lines. Where this really stands out is the performance. The performances are excellent. Neill and Streep are impeccable. It's also great to hear so much Australian talk in a Hollywood movie, and even those who do not consider it naturally, at least try an accent. The cinematography and the editing are quite pleasant, but in reality they do not go beyond the standard. The story of this film is compelling and the fact that it is authentic only makes it even more chilling. While I have not read the novel nor heard of what happened outside of this image, I understand that it is quite close to the truth. There is a moderate to strong language and a disturbing content in this. It is, sometimes, a great drama in the court. I recommend it to any fan of this type. 7/10
