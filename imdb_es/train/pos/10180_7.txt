The Indian directors have it difficult, they have to compete with films like "Laggan", where 11 males pressured, the castrados defend their village and half of them are certifiable idiots. "Devdas", an unfortunate and federative foreign return that drinks to oblivion, with characters that run in endless corridors alien to the feelings or feelings of anyone, unfortunately, live in a decorated scum of red upholstery and splendor. But to make a good movie, you have to walk the tightrope to appease the frontbenchers that are the quintessential pins that are hypnotized with divided skirts and Dishum-Dishum fights, which include an imbecile actor "Bollywood" who is marginally handsome. So you can connect with a director who wants to tell the story of the boss of Leonine Village, who in her own words "defending her Village" is considered a violent or too masculine movie for a male audience. There are very few actors who can convey anger and pathos like Nana Patekar (Narasimhan). Nana Patekar leaves you in her backyard and gapes at you and makes fun of the politician when her faithful admirers burst out laughing with every word of satire thrown at her, while her daughter is bathing her grandson. This is such an authentic scene that you can find in rural areas. India. Nana Patekar is the essential actor that belongs to the old acting school, which is a race that disappears in Hindi Films. The violence represented is an intrinsic part of the storytelling with songs and dances for the spectators without which the films are not sold, a sad but true state of affairs. Faster this changes better for "Bollywood". All said and done is a good movie.
