['I swear that when I saw this movie for the first time, I cried! A STAR IS BORN is the movie that lets you know what love really is in spite of the obstacles facing John Norman (Kris Kristofferson) and Esther (Streisand). You also experience what it is to lose such a love at the end of the movie. Streisand and Kristofferson have great chemistry together and the music is fantastic! When Streisand sings With a closer look at you / Watch carefully now, it&#39;s pure magic! This movie made the song Evergreen one of my favorites, and Queen Bee is a very funny song. I also love the fashion of the 70s (except the Afro Streisand, besides that, it&#39;s a beauty). A Star is Born is my favorite movie number one. This movie is a pleasure to watch and is a heartbreaker at the end.']
