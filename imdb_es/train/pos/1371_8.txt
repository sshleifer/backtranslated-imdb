['This film is a charming and happy look on both sides of where the rave scene of the &quot;club kid&quot; mixes with the world of art, music and performance of New York (with a cameo of the omnipresent Miss Bunny). This is the &quot;Torch Song Trilogy&quot; for post-teen girls. &quot;That girl&quot; for our affected and affected millennia. <br /><br /> The dialogue is fast and fun, and Parker Posey&#39;s client deserves, if not an award from the academy, at least a prestigious &quot;wave&quot; at the stadium. <br /><br /> Of course, this film is based on the elegant platform heels of Miss Posey, and she is perfectly chosen. As a large part of his acting work, it may not be very deep, it is often self-referential and, well, posey ... but everything WORKS. She is a talented comedian, an incredible artist, and this film entertains her, she carries it on her shoulders like an imitation leopard wrap, and never lets her fall to the ground. <br /><br /> Mary is a shallow party fashionista who is not above stealing designer clothes from a friend&#39;s closet or kissing someone else&#39;s boyfriend. On a deeper level, this is a story of a girl and her friends who do not care in every sense of the word, even about other people; and the process of learning that care is necessary for life. <br /><br /> The script is beautifully crafted, witty, and the only act that disappoints is the aunt, in a role that was too one-dimensional and heavy-handed; a more nuanced performance of her, would have deepened the relationship between the two ... but ... hey ... this is comedy. A surprisingly profound role, which gives this film some substance and vision of the world, is the fail-selling boyfriend. We should all be so lucky ... Is he the right one for Mary? or the one that escapes? <br /><br /> I qualify this as an 8 because it is not a great moment in the history of cinema, it is not a classic and it is not a great art (all of which is enriched and enriched by seeing it again). Like &quot;Desperately looking for Susan,&quot; it represents something very true about your time period, but it may become irrelevant over time. Still, it has everything an entertainment movie needs, and it&#39;s worth seeing several times just for clothes.']
