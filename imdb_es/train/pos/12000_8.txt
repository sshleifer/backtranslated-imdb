['I think the film is educational. However, it does not address the issue that caused so much controversy: plural marriage. In addition, the film does not reveal what the LDS church advocates. Great opportunity was lost to tell the world what they really believe. I could not have a clear idea of what LDS views are about central themes of religion. <br /><br /> I have many LDS friends and they are good people. It would have been nice to have a clearer idea of how they see the most controversial statements of their prophet. Maybe these statements are too controversial to be treated in a film format, but it would have been great to hear the whole story of Joseph Smith&#39;s really interesting life. After all, it gives an idea of American thought about religion in the eighteenth century. I hope they make some documentaries about this fascinating subject, allowing historians to comment on Smith&#39;s life. We may have a Mormon president someday. After all, Smith ran for president.']
