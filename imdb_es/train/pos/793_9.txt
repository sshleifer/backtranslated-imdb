I really enjoyed this movie. (That's why I was surprised that I got such a low rating from so many users on this site!) I'm not saying it's a cinematic masterpiece, but it was a great way to spend a cold, snowy night on Saturdays. It's funny, moving, and a great story of the ups and downs of female friendships that last through tough times and the bad things that friends tend to do to each other! (Fess up ladies, WE'VE ALL BEEN HERE!) Bill Paterson shines when Reverand Gerald Marsden and Andie McDowell prove that she can be a good actress when the role is right and she cares. (And, really, there's the best "wedding getaway" I've seen or dreamed in this movie ... more guts than anyone I've ever met!) You'll laugh and cry, ignore marketing campaigns. and how this movie is being marketed ... it's a hidden gem that should have made tons of box office. (Now I have to look around to buy a copy!)
