['Using Buster Keaton in the twilight of his career was an interesting option. He may have been the most talented comedian of the silent era. This gives you the opportunity to show those talents in a little story of time travel. He hooks up with a boy who lives in modern times, and it becomes obvious that it is better that we stay in our times. Keaton is able to make eye gags very well. I&#39;ve heard your voice before. I think he did some of those Beach Party movies, playing some empty characters to earn a few dollars. Serling seemed to have respect for him and portrayed him that way. It is not a bad story. It shows how one reacts when we want something we do not have and we get that desire.']
