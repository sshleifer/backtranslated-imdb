This is a timid docu-drama that does not cover new paths, reworks all the clich√©s and is careless with the facts. For example, Munich is a very flat city. So, why is it mountainous in the movie? For example, the end of the Great War in 1918 was not a surrender but an armistice. However, it is announced as a surrender. For example, European news sellers did not (and do not) shout headlines while selling their newspapers. However, this strictly American custom is employed in the film. For example, the Nazis did not adopt the German eagle until after they took power, but there it is on the lectern when Hitler delivers one of his shank winders. In fact, most of this disappointing production consists of little more than Hitlerian oratory. The film also perpetuates the myth that the beer tower was built at the Munich Hoffbrauhaus. Was not. Robert Carlyle makes a good representation of his subject. But its cast is adequate at best and very often not even that. These comments are based only on the first episode. You can only expect the second to be better, but do not bet.
