This is one of the most adorable episodes of Twilight Zone, with a fun dialogue and funny characters to break the tension of some spooky moments. There is the usual "dancer" blond vampires (what about the love of Serling for that type of character, so that she continues to appear in several episodes?) And other varied characters, but it is the "old" Jack Elam who He totally steals the program. I consider that this is the funny and happy version of "Monsters are due in Maple Street" or, perhaps, a parody of "The Thing" in the Twilight Zone of 20 minutes. On another note: I thought that the young lover of the episode could be someone who eventually happened to other things, it seemed familiar, but it seems that "Ron Kipling" disappeared after only two television credits to his name.
