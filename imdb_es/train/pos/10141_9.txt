I was ready to shoot this episode, seeing that this 'Master' does not really have any horror films under his belt ... but this is easily the best episode of the season. <br /> <br /> The performance was good! I do not know how he fixed it, but we have a real talent in this episode! And although you could see the things that came from a plot a mile away, at least it was entertaining and managed to keep me engaged for the full 56 minutes, something that I have been missing so far in the series. <br /> <br /> I especially liked the bit at the end, not a turn, so to speak, but just a little funny where it becomes, as always, the hen's hubby. <br /> <br /> Really a good effort. As I have said in other reviews, these are not true teachers who do many of these episodes, but they can become teachers in the future.
