Ben Thomas (Smith) plays an IRS agent who practically gives the store to everyone's surprise. What type of IRS agent is this? <br /> <br /> Most of us have heard an IRS agent's line: "Hi, I'm from the IRS, I'm here to help." Our smile then spreads in a giggle that says: "Yes, of course". <br /> <br /> As you progress more and more in this story, you can not understand this guy. He goes easy with those who are being audited. What is your motive? Is it from another planet, an angel, a rich guy who wants to do good? It helps us so much that we want it to be our auditor if they audit us, of course. Hey, IRS, are you listening? (Just kidding, it's a joke) <br /> <br /> The pace of the movie is perfect and so much, that the clues that would have told me what was really happening were ignored. Intense, repeated intense, the focus was on Ben and stays there. The whole movie only works thanks to Ben, since we tried to find out and I did not see any clues (what clues are you talking about, Willis?). Not reading the box before watching the movie on DVD was the best way to go here. At the end of the movie, I finally put everything together. Well, it was obvious by then. And, yes, it's exaggerated, but it's still a great story, mainly because of Will Smith. <br /> <br /> Will Smith should have been nominated for a Best Actor Award. The rest of the cast was very good too. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is exaggerated and despite the great performance and when you finally get all the answers, you must realize that the message of the movie is wrong. What is the message Believe me, you will not need too many clues to solve it. I did not do it. <br /> <br /> Violence: No. Sex: Yes, but there's nothing to get excited about. Friendly. Nudity: No. Language: No.
