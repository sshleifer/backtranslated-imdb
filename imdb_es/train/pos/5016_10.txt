This movie is one of my favorites. It is difficult to explain why. Maybe it's the innocence of Corin Nemec and his discomfort combined with the audacity of Cheryl Pollak, but it definitely has something to do with the soundtrack. In addition, some of the characters have small lines or movements or moments that are fun in themselves. Finally, the story is one that always pulls on my strings, and the last scene is so bittersweet. All in all, I love this movie; It's perfect for a sticky and sentimental night of girls.
