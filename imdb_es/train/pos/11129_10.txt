I did not think at all this way, but my friend said that the first thing he thought when he heard that the title "Midnight Cowboy" was a gay porn. At that time, all he knew was the reference made to him in that episode of "Seinfeld" with Jerry trying to take Kramer to Florida on that bus and Kramer is sick and with a nosebleed. <br /> <br /> The movie was great, and surprisingly optimistic and not as pessimistic pretentious as some movies that I can not even remember because they are all crap. <br /> <br /> The plot consisted basically of a young and innocent cowboy, Joe Buck. to New York, trying to be a swindler (a male prostitute, basically), thinking that they will be easy choices, only to hit the brick wall with force when a woman ends up pushing her, accusing him of their sexual encounter. <br /> <br /> Then he meets Enrico Salvatore Rizzo, called "Ratso" by all and the cute gay guys who make fun of him all the time. You think of him as a scoundrel, but adorable (like Han Solo or Lando Calrissian) and, surprisingly, he and Joe become friends, and the movie is so sweet and comforting to see them be nicer and so on. Rizzo reveals himself as a sad and pitiful man who is very sick, depressed and shy, hates being called "Ratso" and wants to go to Florida, where he believes that life will be much better and that all his problems will be solved. and he will learn to be a chef and he will be famous there. <br /> <br /> It's comforting to see Joe doing everything he does to take them to Florida, along with many fun times (like Ratso trying to steal). food at that hippie party and being trapped by the woman who says "Gee, well, you know, it's free, you do not have to steal it". And he says: "Well, if it's free, then I will not steal." ", and that classic moment completely unscripted and not programmed where Hoffman is almost hit by that Taxi, and shouts" Hey, I'm walking here! I'm walking here! "), and the acting is so believable, you would never believe that Joe Buck would become the distinguished and respected actor Jon Voight, and Ratso Rizzo would grow up in the legendary and beloved Dustin Hoffman It is not the first time that they work together in leading roles , but the chemistry is very dense and intense. <br /> <br /> Then there's the sad part that I think it's an exaggeration to call it "depressing." Ratso Rizzo is falling apart throughout the whole movie, he can barely walk he barely eats, coughs a lot, is sick, and gets to a head start on the bus on the way to Florida.He is seriously hurt, and only miles from Miami, he finally dies on the bus.The bus driver assures everyone that nothing happens and it continues sad, but not in the way that would make you go home and cry and mourn sadly as if you had just lost your 13 year old dog. <br /> <br /> In general, a great movie And the soundtrack basically consists of "All the talking world ", which is reproduced throughout the film at the right times. A strange movement, but excellent, since the song is good and fits perfectly with the tone of the film. Go see it, it's great, go buy it.
