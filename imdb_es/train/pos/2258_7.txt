I think Sarafina is a tremendous effort from Whoopi Goldberg. In addition to her, there are no other stars in the film and her role is smaller than the title character, Sarafina. Since I work in a high school with urban children, I think this is an important film to show the South African history of apartheid. Sarafina is a film about education and the relationship of a teacher with his student, Sarafina. I bought the video for practically nothing in a videostore. I saw it and moved quickly through the musical numbers. But I strongly recommend this movie to educators and their students so that they understand it. Now, although I do not know the other actors and actresses of the film, I assume they are very popular in South Africa and I'm glad I filmed with a South African cast and crew, with the exception of Goldberg in a small role, but if people see This movie, Whoopi achieves worldwide appeal.
