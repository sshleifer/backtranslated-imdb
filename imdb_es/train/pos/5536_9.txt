In fact, I quite enjoyed this show. Even as a young man I was interested in all sports and that included horse racing. It was always going to be difficult to do a series based on the corruption of the races and at the same time get permission from the tracks to record the filming of this controversial topic. An episode that I remember particularly focused on a horse that hoped to win a great race that looked a bit out of color. A syringe was found on the floor of the barn and everyone thought he had been drugged, but nothing showed up in the blood tests. Too late, they realized that the horse had not been doped, but the cartilage had been removed from the knee. Like running a car without oil and the engine stopped, the horse broke with tragic consequences.
