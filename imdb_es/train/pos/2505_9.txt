Many people judge it as a movie of fans because many stars super protagonists of this film (Gackt, Hyde and Wang Lee Hom are a very famous singer in Japan). But do not judge it before looking, it's what I say. Gackt and the staff are very serious when they made this movie, and they worked very hard. It's a good movie with a delicate story inside. Several scenes can be so funny and others so sad. They did it so well until I can not stop seeing this again. <br /> <br /> The story has written quite well, but I admit that his performance is a bit disappointing. This is especially for Hyde because his ability to act is inferior to that of the other and it is strange to hear the mode when he speaks with another language, except his native language (Japan). But it is understandable because it is the first time that they act in the film. <br /> <br /> I think Gackt is trying to show us how a person can be so weak when he loses the most important person in his life. When Toshi was killed, when Sho asked Kei to turn Yi-Che into a vampire like him because he will not let her die, when Sho's brother died, Kei Shoot Son died and the best and most beautiful scene is when Sho passed away ~ I even told him that Hyde's ability is still strange, but I give him two hits in that scene! <br /> <br /> There is a moment in which the plot goes too fast as if they did not say the reason why the Son can join the local mafia and be the enemy of Sho because they are good friends in the past and also Son is Sho's brother-in-law. <br /> <br /> Whatever, I love this movie ~ (a lot ^^). <br /> <br /> This is an action movie with a beautiful touching story.
