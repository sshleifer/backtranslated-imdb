This was, by far, the best war documentary ever made. From the beginning of the first episode, when Sir Laurence Olivier described the horrible events in Oradour-Sur-Glane "The day the soldiers arrived". Until the last days of the war, when mushroom clouds appeared over Japan, I never missed a second of this classic series and I remember it well, although it was screened in 1974. Each and every aspect of this tragedy was covered in detail. . All this series should be obligatory for as many children as possible in the world, so that the tragedy of the Second World War does not repeat itself and so that fanaticism, hatred, greed and intolerance are not confused with patriotism or religious zeal
