Bruce Almighty, one of the best images of Carrey since ... well ... a long time. It contains one of the funniest scenes I've seen for a long time too ... Morgan Freeman plays God well and even writes some jokes that are surprisingly funny. It contains one or two romantic moments that are a little boring but above all a great movie with some funny scenes. In the best scene, it's where Jim is ruining the presenter's voice. <br /> <br /> My rating: 8/10
