['I may be getting ahead here, but although the film itself was a technical masterpiece for its time, I saw it piece by piece at TCM last night, the question arises: why did they do that? putting their lives in danger, many of them died on the trek, why would they undertake such a dangerous journey for life, only to find food for their animals (!) once they reached the &quot;land of milk and honey&quot; &quot;, why not? Do you just stay there? Would he endanger his life and that of his entire community, only to find food for a herd of cattle? As dangerous as it was, doing it just for that purpose, shows the innate simplicity of this type of people. Risk of death for a cow? Better them than me!']
