"Slaughter High" is a totally ridiculous ridiculous movie about a high school nerd, Marty, who is attacked all the time by pranksters. The joke goes wrong and ends up burning wildly. Five years later, all of his torturers attend a meeting. Only ten of them, of course, and low and watch Marty murders them one after the other. British actress Caroline Munro ("Maniac") leads the cast as the heroine (who dies anyway!). The performance is completely horrible, there is no suspense at all. A lot of grotesque death scenes to satisfy the fans: a boy's stomach explodes, another female victim literally takes a bath of acid, a couple who has sex in bed is electrocuted, a boy is crushed by a tractor, A girl is drowned, and a doctor has a hyperdermal needle in her eye. The killer wears a decent and quite spooky jester mask and the setting (a beautiful old English castle) is really nice. However, the end of the dream is absolutely pathetic. All this is true. that "Slaughter High" is a piece of trash, but I enjoyed it. Only for fans of really bad slasher movies.
