And another South Park race comes to an end. This was not an episode as strong as I expected, but Night of the Living Homeless was a stronger finalist than Stanley Cup, Tsst, Bloody Mary or Erection Day. Still can not contain a candle for Woodland Critter Christmas and Goobacks, but few episodes can. <br /> <br /> Night of the Living Homeless is a parody of the zombie genre, done in a way that only South Park would think of. Instead of zombies that eat meat, the entities are homeless people who request a change and seem to survive outside it. <br /> <br /> Randy and other residents are locked in the Community Center, though this time on the roof, where they can inspect the scene. A particularly funny time is when a member discovers that their home has gone and runs out home, which leaves Randy with no choice but to shoot him. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the four boys set out to solve the problem, with the whole story behind the takeover of homeless people trying to convey a message, but that is not very inspired. South Park is at its best many times when it's ridiculous. Matt and Trey played it safe this week, and they did not really criticize the homeless problem, they just cheated on it. <br /> <br /> The moment of shock of the episode occurs when a scientist shoots himself in an attempt to avoid the homeless. . This is the first time that a suicide in South Park goes wrong, and we observe how the poor man misses his brain and then tries to shoot himself many times while he dies painfully. Another moment inspired by South Park. <br /> <br /> In general, the episode was fun, but it was prevented from being great by retaining any real comments about the homeless and following the zombie trap. The end is something fun, but nothing new. <br /> <br /> Now we must wait until October for the next group of episodes. It's a long journey, but South Park should be applauded for its execution. The program seemed to have run out last season, but now it's back in top form.
