We came across the documentary, Gray Gardens, last Sunday and they "absorbed us" without previous notice. All those who entered the room were paralyzed on television and the disturbing images of Edith and Edie, who seemed to be living their lives in practically a room of a large dirty mansion on the beach, eating ice cream and corn on the cob (which it was cooked on the bedside table) - and the cat urinating on Edith's bed and her incredible words, "I really like [the smell]". We had not seen the beginning and we were wondering what we were seeing and how these aristocratic women managed to get to the position they were in. Lovely! you must see it!!!!
