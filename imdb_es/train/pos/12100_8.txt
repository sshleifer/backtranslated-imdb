The DVD of "Danaza Macabra" (Castillo de sangre) is very strange. This is because some parts of the film are in French with subtitles and the rest is doubled in French. Sometimes, the characters change between the two in the middle of a scene! When I tried to make the film ONLY subtitled or simply folded, there was no difference! Strange, but you can still see it. <br /> <br /> The story claims to be based on a Poe story, although I can not remember which one. In fact, the character of Poe appears at the beginning and at the end of the film, although he was not particularly like him. <br /> <br /> A rich man makes a bet with a guy who has bad luck. He can not stay all night in a homely way. It seems like an easy bet to win, even if the house is very creepy. However, it can not be so easy, since the rich guy says that all those who previously took the bet died, but this fool STILL wants to bet! While at home, he meets the lovely Barbara Steele and falls in love with her. Later, however, he learns that she died more than a decade earlier! How can this be ?! I could tell you more about the plot but I do not want to spoil any of the suspense. Find out for yourself to discover the rest of the story. <br /> <br /> This movie gets high marks for creating a spooky atmosphere. The house, black-and-white cinematography and music work together to create a frightening-looking film. As for the plot, it is interesting, especially because there are many twists and turns, so many that one wonders who is and who is not among the undead at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> The only negative thing is that I felt sorry for the poor snake that was killed unnecessarily. Crazy as it may seem, I felt sorry for it and it hardly seemed necessary. <br /> <br /> In addition, parents may want to know that towards the end there is a bit of nudity. A surprisingly beautiful woman appears topless, but it is not necessary for the plot.
