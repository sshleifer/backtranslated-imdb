This is a good adaptation of Austen's novel. Good, but not bright. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is inventive, sometimes crossing the border with tricks, but it certainly avoids the trap of making this look like a telenovela in a TV disguise, given that the whole story is driven by dialogue . <br /> <br /> The acting is competent. Ms. Paltrow is distant, as her character requires, but the required distance from the other characters is accompanied by a much less appropriate detachment from her own actions. In other words, she does not seem to care enough about the results of her pairing efforts. Part of the cast of support is guilty of excess action, largely in the style that is seen on stage but out of place in moving images. Personally, I had trouble accepting Alan Cumming as Mr. Elton, without his fault, except for having left such an impression as a gay cart in "The High Life" that it is now difficult to accept him as an important part. . The interim honors are for Toni Collette, who manages to radiate heat, and Jeremy Northam, who throws his character at the correct level.
