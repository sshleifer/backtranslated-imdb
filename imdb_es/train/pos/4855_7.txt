The question of whether or not one likes this film version of "The Ghost Train" invariably depends on one thing and on one thing: his reaction to the performance of Arthur Askey. <br /> <br /> Tends to steal almost everyone Scene you're in, and not always in a good way. Sometimes, you would like it to calm down or back off just a little, to allow the many characters in the plot to show and develop (which they do up to a certain point). But somehow, everything still points to the character of Tommy Gander of Askey. <br /> <br /> Personally, I like the movie, and I even like it to some extent Askey. It seems that I always put it in the vr in those strange hours of the dawn when I can not sleep and I really can not find the energy to look at something else. There's something about watching old black and white movies in the quiet darkness of dawn that I find attractive ...
