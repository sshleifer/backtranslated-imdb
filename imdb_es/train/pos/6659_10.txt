['It takes guts to make a film about Gandhi in India, where he does not appear as a man who can not do anything wrong. This film shows how a Mahatma could not be a decent father (at least in the eyes of his son). <br /><br /> The performances are spectacular, the cinematography fantastic, the direction fabulous, but the film creeps. If the intention was to make this film without any box office expectations, which I suppose is the case here, then it&#39;s a brilliant attempt, but if the manufacturers expected this to be a commercial success, then the fate of the film was doomed the day who chose this topic ... <br /><br /> Within 20 years, this film will be remembered for the brilliant performance of Harilal by Akshaye Khanna. He deserves an Oscar nomination for this ... And honestly, this is not the only performance that is worth applauding, Shefali Chhaya is also great. <br /><br /> Look at the scene in which Harilal finds out about her father&#39;s death. Without dialogues, without shouting, but with a wordless shot of Khanna. It is one of the best scenes ever filmed in the history of cinema. <br /><br /> Gandhi, my father is not exciting cinema at all, but yes, it is an excellent cinema and a must see. Bright attempt.']
