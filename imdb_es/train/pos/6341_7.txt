Although I really enjoyed the latest "serious" performances of Jim Carrey ("The Truman Show", "Man on the Moon"), I have always thought that his true genius lies in physical comedy. This does not mean that he is a fantastic and talented actor: to the bowls of the Academy Awards he seems not to like him very much, he has never had a (or deserved) nomination or prize. Well, any "institution" that nominates 11 Oscars per year as "Titanic" should not be taken seriously. <br /> <br /> Continue with the review. "The Grinch" is the sweetest, best-looking, best-acting, most entertaining movie of seasons since "The Nightmare before Christmas." Both films seem very similar, too, with their very stylized sets and the premise that someone stole Christmas. Both make their main actors look like villains (one in a degree higher than the other), both have a strong moral lesson, and both are truly nice. <br /> <br /> That is, until you realize that Jack Skellington is a doll, and the Grinch is a human being. But a human being who is so incredibly expressive, so fluid in his movements, so caricatured, so unreal, that he never gets in the way of the movie. He can be hilarious, he can be a sad soul, he can be angry. Live in a three-dimensional world, where three-dimensional people live. He jokes, he laughs, he cries, and in the end he saves Christmas. I loved this movie in parts, and I can not wait for it to come out on DVD. This is one of those movies that you will really enjoy in 10 or 20 years. As timeless as they come.
