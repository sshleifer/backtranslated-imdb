"Pecker" shows that Waters has no intention of changing his manners in his old age. Many things have changed since Waters started making films in the 1960s, but 40 years later he is still doing what he wants to do. Over the years, the budget of Waters films has increased considerably. This is one of his most recent productions, but I was surprised to see that Waters still has that touch of "trailer park". Edward Furlong plays Pecker, a boy who is obsessed with photography. Live a quiet life in Baltimore, MD, with your friends and family. But Pecker attracts the attention of a New York art agent (the always visible Lili Taylor), and his life changes for the worse. Once again, Waters mocks art, fame and heterosexuality. It's not among his best movies, but there are some big laughs here ("Memama" has the best lines in the movie!). He is consistently intelligent and funny, and has that "weird" sensitivity that I have come to love in Warters movies.
