Excellent pirate entertainment! It has all the good ingredients to get attention: a story of intrigue, a fiery pirate named Spitfire Stevens (Maureen O'Hara) who is attracted to the irresistible Mr. Hawke (Errol Flynn) who is on a secret mission. They make a good romantic couple on the screen: sigh! <br /> <br /> Anthony Quinn is the evil pirate who is weaving his villain to divide and conquer. I noticed that the very familiar face of Mildred Natwick played a supporting role as Mrs. MacGregor, the protector of the young Princess Patma (Alice Kelley). <br /> <br /> There is a beautifully filmed stage of coasts, boats and the bay. Much action also of clashes with swords, naval battles, bold leaps of Errol Flynn (Robin Hood aboard the ship!). From the brand-new redhead, I once heard in an interview with Maureen O'Hara that she boasted of having a great command of the aircraft and that she could also overcome Flynn in the sword fight in those days, but there would be no need to put her try here. <br /> <br /> Very nice movie.
