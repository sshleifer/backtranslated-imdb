If this movie had been made only a few years later, I would have reduced the score by one or two points because the sound quality was quite poor. Sometimes, the movie seemed to be a silent movie during the intermediate scenes (normal ambient sounds are missing). But, since it was 1931 and a French movie, this is quite forgivable. Especially because this also happens in later French films, at which time the sound difficulties should have been resolved completely (as in L'Atalante since 1934). <br /> <br /> Well, aside from some minor sound problems, this is a cute little movie about a winning lottery ticket lost and a long list of people trying to get it. And, during the search, there are a lot of funny little songs that you can not stop liking. A nice and lovely movie in general.
