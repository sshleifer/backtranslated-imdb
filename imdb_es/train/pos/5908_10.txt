['This is one of the brightest movies I&#39;ve seen in recent times. It goes way beyond even any international movie of any reputation. I&#39;m really surprised why this has not received the recognition it deserved. Sonali Kulkarni, winner of the National Award, is perhaps the only comforting fact. Renuka Daftardar simply surprises when she speaks volumes through her eyes. There are some scenes that stand out: when Gauri returns from the city at the wedding of Krishna, she and Krishna meet for the first time in many years. Krishna notices a change in Gauri, but does not say a single line of dialogue. The whole range of emotions is transmitted through subtle gestures and eyes. There is another one towards the end when Krishna begs Abhay Kulkarni to marry Gauri. If that scene does not touch you, you have no heart. <br /><br /> Watch this movie to see its cinematic brilliance and acting abilities.']
