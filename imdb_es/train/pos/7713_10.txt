Today's science fiction thrillers look more like Rambo in outer space with special effects of monsters (often ridiculous, like the sounds of explosions in the vacuum of space). Although domesticated by today's standards, the special effects of "Forbidden Planet" were quite surprising for their time. Even today, they still have plausibility. However, the best part of the movie is perhaps the reason why radio thrillers still have appeal. Much of what was happening was left to the imagination of the public. (How did the Krell creatures look?) Having much of the frame of the story never disclosed or only disclosed at the end, the tension and suspense remained throughout the film. The ending was also very stimulating and satisfying. In my opinion, this is still one of the best (if not the best) science fiction movie ever made.
