I do not know if this is a comedy or not, but I agree that this is one of the best television programs in history. It's great that this show is still broadcast. And I love Michelle. She's cute in the episodes when she was a baby and she talked, and sometimes she said something funny. Aw. <br /> <br /> This program can relate to children and adolescents and ... well, families as they go through difficult times and try to solve it as a family. I do not know who would reject the opportunity to see this show with someone. <br /> <br /> I love the episode when I think her name is DD ... the older girl accidentally stole a sweatshirt and learned a lesson about stealing. That was a great episode. An example of this television show shows the family working as a family. <br /> <br /> I recommend this program for everyone.
