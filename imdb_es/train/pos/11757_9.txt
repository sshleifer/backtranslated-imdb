Robin Williams and Kurt Russell play 30-year-old boys who put their marraigs at risk by deciding (Russell reluctantly) to play their heart-rending tie with rival Bakersfield years after the fact. Williams is fine, but Russell is as good as the legendary quarterback Taft Remo Hightower. Holly Palance makes a nice and attractive turn as Williams' wife, who could live without this rematch. It's worth watching the movie just to see the famous Remo in action. Highly recommended
