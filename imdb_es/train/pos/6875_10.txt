When I was president of our university cafeteria, one of our jobs was to review groups and films for student activities. One of the best things that happened in 1972 was Groove Tube. The original premise was that it was being shown off Broadway at theaters where television monitors were placed throughout the audience, so that everyone had a large seat. The premise was that the parodies would change regularly: Saturday night live, keeping things cool. They decided to turn it into a movie for general distribution. <br /> <br /> I think the developers said it was the first time Chevy Chase was in a movie. See him running naked even though the forest was a howl. Like many of the reviews before mine, it was Saturday Night Live before there was such a thing. I highly recommend this video. I told my 13-year-old son about the clown Koko. You can not wait to get a copy!
