In 1958, Clarksberg was a famous city of speed trap. The Sheriff's Department generated a large amount of revenue to catch speed drivers. Those who tried to run away from the sheriff? Well, that gave the Sheriff the chance to drive them out of the Clarksberg Bend with their Plymouth cruiser. For example, at the beginning of the movie, a couple of soldiers who are leaving to try to get back to base in time are taken to their deaths, if I remember correctly. Then, one day, a stranger drove to the city. Possibly the best hot rodder in the world. Michael McCord Even his name is a car name, as in McCord's meetings. Possibly in the last hot rod. A Ford '34 black flamed coupe. The colors of death, evil and hell. He is picked up for speeding by the Sheriff on purpose. He checks the disposition of the earth. He is the brother of one of the Sheriff's victims. He knows how his brother died. The Clarksberg government is in favor of the Sheriff. There is only one way to get justice done for the murder of his brother and fix things so that "this does not happen again to anyone": recreates the persecution and resolves the contest of hot-rodder style until death. Go out to the curve and practice. The Sheriff knows that McCord knows. The race begins ... This is a movie to be remembered by anyone who has tried to master the maneuvers on a certain stretch of road.
