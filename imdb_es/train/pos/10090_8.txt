I was prepared for a dreaded telenovela of telenovelas and soap operas, but I was pleased to find a quick script, an underlying moral, excellent portraits of all the actors, especially Peter Finch, incredible special effects, suspense and a beautiful cinematography. even a shot of the majestic Stone Buddhas recently destroyed by the Taliban. Not to mention Elizabeth Taylor in her most gloriously beautiful and sympathetic form, before surrendering to the gas hysteria that tarnished her later work. All support players complete it, and I wonder who trained all those elephants. <br /> <br /> Speaking of the stone-Buddha sequence, you can really discern what Vivien Leigh is in the long shots. Its shape and the way it moves is different from Taylor's. The only thing that spoils this sequence are the wrongly made process shots, in which the background moves too fast for the horses on a walk. <br /> <br /> If you want a stimulating movie that is beautiful to watch and never watch Bored, spend a few hours with Elephant Walk.
