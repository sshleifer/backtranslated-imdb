What can I add that the previous comments have not already said? This is a great movie and you have to see the Star Wars tribute to the Star Wars duel to believe it! There are moments of genius throughout this movie, if you can, SEE IT NOW! Thanks again to Rick Baker, who gave me this film many years ago.
