This is one of the best comedies in history! The writing of this soap parody is brilliant and the cast, well, just look at the names of the cast and you'll understand why it's so good. If you're a Kevin Kline fan, he (as always) does a fantastic performance, and Robert Downey Jr is perfect. If you do not laugh while watching this movie, you have no sense of humor.
