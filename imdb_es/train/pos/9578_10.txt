['As others have said, all the women that are nude in this movie are, in their majority, absolutely beautiful. The plot very cleverly shows the hypocrisy of the female libido. When there are men nearby, they want to be persecuted, but when there are no &quot;men&quot;, they become the persecutors of a 14-year-old boy. And the child becomes a really fast man (we should all be so lucky at this age!). He then puts on the courage to pursue his true love.']
