# 3 in the trilogy of blockbusters of the young John Travolta. Dance to the disc, rock and roll and country. He goes to Houston to find work and love. Gilley is the hot spot, and it's time for the mechanical bull. Not to be left behind, I rode the bull in a club in Nashville. I recently saw this film almost forgotten on television and I remembered how good it was and how good it was in the year 1980. I wore a black cowboy hat that year as did Travolta. Debra Winger was at her best. She looks awesome in her red top. There is a lot of charisma. Bud and Sissy seem like the ideal couple, even if they are tow trash. They separate only because it feels so good to be together again. Urban Cowboy has an incredible soundtrack. We can listen to Lyin 'Eyes of The Eagles and Lookin' For Love by Johnny Lee.
