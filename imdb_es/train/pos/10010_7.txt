There are many diseases born in the mind of man that have received life in modern times. Constant vigilance or information accumulated in the field of Picosis have kept psychologists, counselors and psychiatrists busy enough to last for decades. Occasionally, some of these mental phenomena are discovered by those who have no knowledge of their remedy or even their existence. That's the premise of the movie called "The Night Listner." It tells the story of a popular radio host named Gabriel Noon (Robin Williams) who spends his nights captivating his audience with vivid stories about gay lifestyles. Perhaps it is because his program is losing its authentic appearance, which makes Noon admit that he is no longer himself. Feeling abandoned by both his lover Jess (Bobby Cannavale) and his best friend (Joe Morton), he seeks refuge in his deep despair and isolation. It is here, a mysterious voice at night asks for help. Midday needs to feel useful and comes to the desperate voice that belongs to a 14-year-old boy named Peter (Rory Culkin). When reading the heartbreaking manuscript of the child that describes early life and sexual abuse at the hands of his brutal parents, the noon is enthralled and wants to help. However, things are not what they seem and midday soon gets wrapped up in a strange and elusive story that emerges from a medical nightmare. This film is pure Robin Williams and if it were not for Toni Collette, who plays Donna D. Logand, Sandra Oh as Anna and John Cullum as pop, this could be funny. Instead, this may turn out to be one of William's most serious performances. ***
