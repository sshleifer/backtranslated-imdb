Now, this show looks like most other shows of its kind since the mid-1990s, but the only thing that comes down to this is that it's different, they use a lot of comedy and action in this and maybe a bit of drama. as well. Personally I thought it was a good show, I can not understand why they would cancel it. The good thing is that the fan base of this program is still alive from 1997 to date. <br /> <br /> My hope is that the BM will see the program again or even make a movie, that I know it will be impossible to do, but it does not hurt to dream, right? <br /> <br /> Anyway, I would recommend that you have not seen it to find the DVD of the 13 episodes, because the characters are great, the story lines are good, the comedy is good and the whole show It is simply great.
