This is an Arnold movie. Now that you know it, I've saved many the time it would have taken to read this review. If you do not like Arnold, then you will not like this movie. If the case is the other, you probably like it. It's as simple as that. <br /> <br /> Now, if you're still reading this, I hope you like Arnold. Good for you! He is pretty good, right? The Running Man is a very typical feature of Arnold. It has the usual retro future that we know so well from B-Sci Fi of the 80s, it has a lot of phrases of a terrible line, a lot of violence and explosions, and an attractive heroine and a happy ending. <br /> <In this case, the evil opponent is the government of 1984 that controls everything, and uses television as an effective crowd control with gladiator-type game programs. Arnold, of course, ends up in one of these shows and turns it upside down, with a little help from his two companions and the attractive Amber. <br /> <br /> It's not a big budget movie, but it still managed to create a pretty good atmosphere in the future, with some nice matte paintings and sets to help it. It is irremediably from the 80s, but I find it charming. The performance varies, Arnold makes his usual grunt and shouts, with a series of stone-faced phrases. Heroine Amber is, to put it mildly, a little stereotyped, and the subtly named Damen Killian is a typical TV villain. <br /> <br /> Despite all its shortcomings, the film shows its message very clearly; Television is an opium of the masses, a good way to control people. It also has a futuristic digital video edition at the moment, which allows bad guys to change their faces in a video to fool their audience. This does not seem anything futuristic today, which is a bit alarming. <br /> <br /> If you've seen Arnold movies before, then you know when to watch them. Enjoy.
