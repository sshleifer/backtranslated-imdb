If there is a genre that I have never been a fan of, it is the biopic. Always deceptive, full of false information, dramatized scenes and tricks, biopics are almost never done well. Even in the hands of truly talented directors like Martin Scorsese (The Aviator) and Ron Howard (A Beautiful Mind), they often do great harm to the people they try to capture on the screen. Skepticism takes the place of the hype with most of the biopics that make their way to the big screen and the Notorious Bettie Page was no different. Some critics and spectators objected to Gretchen Mol, given the role of Bettie Page, saying that she was no longer a celebrity and that she did not have the skills for the role. I never doubted that Mol could handle the role since then, but I never expected to be as impressed by his performance as he was watching the movie a few hours ago. Mol offers an excellent performance worthy of an Oscar as the emblematic pin-up girl of the 1950s, who, after an early life of abuse (represented with subtlety and good taste, something that few directors would probably do) inadvertently becomes one of the most commented models of all time. . The image covers a lot of ground in its execution time of 90 minutes, but in spite of not less than three subplots, there is still the feeling that a small part of the story may be missing. The fantastic script of the director / co-author Marry Harron and Guinevere Turner is only marred by a brusque and not as clear as it should end. Even so, credit must be given to the two ladies for creating an almost perfect biographical film that manages to pay homage to both its theme and the decade that it masterfully emulates. When the time comes for the Oscars, Mol, Turner and Harron should receive nominations. The doubt will happen, although certainly there are not three women more deserving of them. 9/10
