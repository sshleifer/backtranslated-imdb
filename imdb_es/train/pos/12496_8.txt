For years we've been watching all the horror movies that come out, from boring Hollywood retreats like Saw 2, to the terrible independent releases that are completely incomparable ... we suffer all the bad movies in the hope of finding little gems like "Dark It remains ". <br /> <br /> We managed to see a movie in Shriekfest 2005. The audience loved it and I think it ended up winning the best film award. <br /> <br /> While it may not have the budget or star power of the studio movies, it has a big impact on the spooky atmosphere and the fear category. The acting and cinematography are first class, but it is the direction that makes this film worthwhile. The story and the characters develop at the right pace to provide fantastic ghosts. <br /> <br /> The editing and visual effects are also first class. And while many horror films fail to use music to their advantage, the score of "Dark Remains" only adds to their chill. <br /> <br /> I know that the film has been presented at several festivals, but none has been close to me, so I can not wait to listen when it finally comes out on DVD. Trust me, even if you're fed up with the current state of horror movies, give it a try ... you will not regret it!
