This is the only David Zucker movie that does not distort anything like the first of its kind. The funniest movie of 98 with Night at the Roxbury right behind. But I did not think "There's something about Mary" was funny, so that does not count, except for Frank and the beans. Do not listen to critics, especially Roger Ebert, he does not know solid entertainment, just look at his comments. Anyway, see it, you will not be disappointed.
