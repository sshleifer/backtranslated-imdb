It is not well filmed, well written or well acted, but it has to be the most addictive program I have seen since Twin Peaks. Each revelation is programmed so well that you have to watch the next episode to get any kind of closure. They have even slowed the pace of the show, in that they only reveal small amounts of information per episode, however, it seems that they just told you everything you wanted to know. However, part of the performance is simply horrible and part of the duologist is downright brutal. Some characters are very two-dimensional. The more experienced actors like Locke and Ecko really stand out from the actors who play Jack, Kate, Sayid, etc. The development of the program can also be very frustrating, since the next episode may not show what led to the previous episode. The annoying lateral plots have become part of the story that sometimes does not tell you anything. However, the second season has developed to a point where previous stories reveal more about the island than before. In general, it is a great show but not perfect.
