Yaitate !! Japan is a very funny show and I really like it! It was shown in our country recently on Hero TV and ABS-CBN every 5:30. This is Azuma Kazuma, who tries to fulfill his dream of making Japanese bread that represents his country. He is working at Toyo's southern branch in Pantasia and is also helping his friend (Tsukino Azusagawa) along with other bakers (like Kawachi Kyousuke and Kanmuri Shigeru) to beat St. Pierre and take control of Pantasia. They fight against other skilled bakers from many other countries and not only learn to make different types of bread, but they also learn to cook other foods. It's a really funny and unique anime because they also imitate other anime characters (like Naruto, Detective Conan and One Piece) and famous real-life people. It is one of the best works of Takashi Haschiguchi and is a must for people of different ages.
