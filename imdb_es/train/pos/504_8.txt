Well, the recent history of Star Trek has not been good. The next generation faded in its last seasons, DS9 remained bold where no one had stayed before, and Voyager started very badly and never fulfilled its promise. Then, when they announced a new Star Trek series, I did not have many expectations. And, the first episode, Broken Bow, had some problems. But, in general, it was a solid Trek material and a good romp. <br /> <br /> First, I will remove the nits. The opening theme is boring and I do not feel like reading it regularly, but that's what remote controls are for. What was really bad was the completely free lotion rub that almost took my wife out of the room. They need to eliminate that nonsense. <br /> <br /> But, the plot was strong and progressed well. The characters, although still new, seem to be well rounded and not always what you would expect. The Vulcans are clearly presented in a very different way from the previous ones, with a slightly ominous theme. I especially liked the linguist, who is the first Star Trek character who can not be proud of death, but has to deal with his phobias and fears. They seemed to stay true to the Trek story, something that has been a major problem in past series, although they have plenty of time to bring us things like firing through shields, the instant invention of technology that can fix anything, and the inevitable plethora of travel stories in time. Does anyone want to start a group about how long before the Borg appear? <br /> <br /> In general, the series has enormous potential. They are seeing the universe with new eyes. We have the opportunity to learn how things went as they were in the later series. How did the Klingons just insult the war? How did we meet the Romulans? How was the Federation formed and who put the Earth in charge? Why is the main directive so important? If you approach these things instead of spitting episodes of time travel, this will be an interesting series. <br /> <br /> My favorite phrase: Zephram Cochran saying "where no man has gone before" (not "nobody")
