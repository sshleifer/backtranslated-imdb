Spoilers, to the extent that I describe the characters and their relationship to the plot. <br /> <br /> This is a quality movie. The subject is both grim and exciting. The stubborn determination of Stephen Rea's character, Burakov, is simply captivating. With all the excuses due to him, his dog hanged, the expression continually placed serves the character well. He, as we would say in England from the character of the television series Inspector Taggart, is destined to be grim because he sees three murders per week. Well, that is not strictly accurate since Chikatila operated for several years ... <br /> <br /> It gives you a real idea of ​​the resistance of the USSR bureaucracy, brilliantly interpreted by Joss Ackland (who often seems be made for this type of role). <br /> <br /> A key character (and I write it when the remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers is shown on BBC1) is the character of Donald Sutherland "Mikhail Fetisov". His silent support of Burakov is firm. And it lasts through perestroika, and encourages the participation of the FBI for profiling. Sparkly. <br /> <br /> This is a must see, as far as I'm concerned.
