A friend took me to this film and I was skeptical about a Swedish movie with subtitles. However, I really enjoyed every minute of this beautiful movie. The unnecessary cruelty of which man is capable was represented with confidence without overwhelming images, although animal lovers may have to protect their eyes for a brief second or two somewhere during the first 10 minutes. A traditional story of humility against brutality and hope against tragedy was illustrated from a fresh and satisfying angle using a spectrum of characters with very natural defects and characteristics. I especially liked how the film managed to address multiple aspects of hypocritical human behavior that refer to bias, discrimination and the claim to holiness. An absolute gem of a movie that I will promote to all who listen.
