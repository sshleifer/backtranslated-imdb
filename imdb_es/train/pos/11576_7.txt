Try to be the epic adventure of the century. And with a cast like Sh√¥ Kasugi, Christopher Lee and John-Rhys Davies, it really is the perfect B adventure of all time. Actually, it's a very funny and dazzling adventure that, even with its flaws, captures your interest. It must have felt like the biggest movie of all the people who made it. Even if it is done in the 90s, it does not have a modern touch. It has more the same feeling as an old Errol Flynn movie. The great adventure films are again the most important thing in Hollywood, but I am afraid that the feeling in them will never be the same as those old movies. This, on the other hand, only has the real feeling. You just can not hate it. I think it's a good adventure movie. And I really love the soundtrack. Damn it, I want the theme song.
