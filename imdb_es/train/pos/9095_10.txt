['A lovely and fun movie that gets a solid overall rating. I saw a movie of this movie recently at work. It was very nice to see this movie in contrast to all the horror movies I see every day. So much that I thought about writing. I&#39;m not sure if this movie goes to the theaters, but I hope it does. It&#39;s a good movie to watch with friends, it&#39;s lovely and has some funny jokes. The performance was excellent (especially Howard Hessman and Larry Dorf.) The direction was quite good (it was not a film that should have been overdone.) What really makes this film stand out is the writing, it was like Neil Simon, Seinfeldish, and the jokes between the characters are intelligent and have a good rhythm.As an aspiring screenwriter, I realize those things! (I&#39;m an idiot.) Anyway, a very nice movie that I recommend.']
