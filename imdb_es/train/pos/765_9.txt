I guess when "Beat Street" made a national appearance, "Flashdance" came at the same time. The problem with "Flashdance" is that there was only one break dance scene and the rest was jazz and ballet. That was one of the reasons why "Beat Street" was better. The only movie that could compete with "Beat Street" seems to be "Footloose", because both films focused on how people used dance to express their most extreme feelings. <br /> <br /> The break dance scenes on "Beat Street" comes just before the middle and end of the movie. And I loved them all. Almost all the breaking tricks appeared in the interruption scenes: the pneumatic hammer, the flares, the turns of the head, the suicide, the crazy legs, the mortal, the forward launch, figure four, almost everything. /> <br /> Like "The Warriors", "Beat Street" has violence related to gang life in the hip hop world ... but in a much less violent way than the previous one. The only major fight scene on "Beat Street" was when the graffiti artist Ramon (who in the movie was abbreviated as "Ramo") is chased by a member of a rival gang on the subway tracks of New York City ... fighting each other in The third lane and both dying by electrocution in that lane. Well, although the scene of the persecution ended tragically, it was better that they died in that way than with the blood explosion of a gang shooting. <br /> <br /> Most of the gang things in the movie were graffiti related to hip-hop. Culture and rap music. A lot of rap music appeared in the film, because members of hip-hop used rap music as a deviation from the negative aspects of gang life. Even the musical theme of the film, which closed the curtain of the film, was not only a tribute to the hip-hop culture, but also a tribute to the death of Ramon. <br /> <br /> By the way During the dance scene called 'Tango, Tango', I suppose the drummer of the pits orchestra led by actress Rae Dawn Chong was Sheila E. making a cameo.
