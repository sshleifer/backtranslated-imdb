I've never seen such an amazing acting job in a movie like I did when I saw Daniel Day-Lewis play Christy Brown in My Left Foot. In fact, offstage, his role was not even finished. He played the role of Christy Brown or, at least, was disabled like him throughout the filming of the film and needed surgery due to the damage that his superior performance had done on his back. For me that's extraordinary and, despite all the pain he had to play that role, I think it's very true to say that he had the most Oscar-worthy performance in history. He was so masterful in this difficult part that I think nobody could have done it better or with more impact than him. Although I can not say that it is the best movie of all time, I can say that the way he played this impossible role and then continued to act until he was no longer performing is without a doubt the best foot that an actor has ever seen. do. Probably a man too for that matter.
