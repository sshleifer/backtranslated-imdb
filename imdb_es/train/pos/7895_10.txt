['In the opening scenes of this film, a man shot arrows through his hotel room into another man&#39;s bathroom and turned off all the lights. This must have been very good for 1936, but beyond having nothing to do with the movie, Robin Hood did not appear as far as I could see. However, Bette Davis (Daisey Appleby), &quot;The Whales of August&quot;, 87, was very young and attractive and made one of her best roles in a long career in Hollywood. Daisey never stopped joking or being very sexy with her nightgowns and the swimsuit on her yacht with George Brent (Johnny Jones), &quot;The Spiral Staircase&quot;, &#39;46. Daisey even proposed to Johnny on an upside down Ferris wheel and even had a black eye. Davis and Brent made a great couple, one is supposed to be very rich and the other a very poor journalist. Offstage, Davis and Brent were having a real love affair, which is a good reason why there were sparks when these two appeared in this movie. If you liked Bette Davis and George Brent, this is the movie for you!']
