I appreciated photography, textures, colors and, often, unlike a comment, lighting. What was missing for me was a coherent story. Often it seemed disjointed, badly edited and, sometimes, difficult to follow. My version was 110 minutes, IMDb shows one at 125m. Possibly the cuts and subtitles did not help. I applaud any film that escapes the mold of Hollywood, but this left me disappointed. Miss Gillain was bright and the performances were fine, I just wanted a little more dialogue. If someone would like to see another movie that has some affinity with this one, try 'Hideous Kinky' with Kate Winslet.
