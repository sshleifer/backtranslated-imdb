The name Jackie Chan is synonymous with acrobatics. This movie will never disappoint you. The best chase scene and the last scene of shooting from the pole is so risky that a wonder, if you know the meaning of fear. This film is very close to the best of Jackie, which is the PROJECT A. But the main difference is that PROJECT A contains three stars where, as in this film, Jackie takes the film completely on his shoulders. This is perhaps the main reason why this film made Jackie the greatest martial arts star followed by Bruce Lee. The movie has nice comic touches. as well. What makes this movie work is Jakie's ability to show his venerable side, which is in contract with the typical martial arts action hero. This movie was followed by a sequel that was good but was rather insipid compared to its predecessor.
