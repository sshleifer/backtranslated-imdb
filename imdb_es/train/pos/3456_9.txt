There is no such thing as perfect murder. Lieutenant Columbo knows it. Ken Franklin, who is the other half of the team of detective writers, does not know. Kill your partner Jim Ferris, who had plans to go alone. Now Columbo enters the picture and asks Mr. Franklin all kinds of questions. And come back for one more question. Columbo: Murder by the Book (1971) is directed by the young Steven Spielberg before his days of fame. Steve Bochco wrote it. Columbo is a fantastic character with his disheveled appearance. It is hard to believe that this man can solve any crime. But it could. Each and every one of them! Peter Falk is the only person in the world who could play this character. So there are no remakes, please. This part is a very good example of how Columbo worked. Jack Cassidy plays the killer and Martin Milner plays the victim. Rosemary Forsyth plays The victim's wife, Joanna Ferris. There is something endearing in the scenes between Columbo and her. How does the tortilla and everything. Barbara Colby plays Lilly La Sanka. She actually had a tragic fate when she died after a homicide, as she does here. I've been a Columbo fan since childhood and I still enjoy watching them. There was a break for many years that they were not showing the Columbo stories at all, but now it's back. Come back for one more question.
