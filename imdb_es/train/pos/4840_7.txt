I have seen the recent DVD of Region 2 of this film in the "horror" section of an Oxford Street store and it is also advertised as a "classic thriller". In fact, it is almost exclusively a vehicle for Arthur Askey, one of the most popular names in British comedy and light entertainment for more than four decades. <br /> <br /> Maybe his incessantly cheerful, exuberant and essentially kind mood comes along. as a cultural shock for many, accustomed to the bitter and cynical flavor of much of the British comedy of the last twenty-five years. However, there are still those who appreciate his animated and cheerful person and the total avoidance of pathos. Askey was an idol of the great Tommy Cooper who often borrowed the gag of "self-strangulation" with which Arthur tries to entertain the stranded passengers. <br /> <br /> There is a strange and surprising appearance on the part of the low-rated Linden. Travers, who has an impact like the mysterious Julie.
