"The man on the moon" is a pretty good movie. It is very moving at times and is very well done in all aspects. I would not say the movie was terribly original, but what is it these days? <br /> <br /> The cast members did a great job with their respective roles. I really enjoyed watching Reese Witherspoon at such a young age, and she does a good job. Jason London also does a good job. And the only other person I recognized was Sam Waterston, who did a fantastic job with his role. I really liked the character of Sam (Matthew Trant). Sometimes he seemed to be the kind of father you were afraid of, but in the end you really like his character. The rest of the cast was also very good. <br /> <br /> If you like to play movies about how to grow and how to deal with what life offers you, then you should watch this movie. I would suggest reading the synopsis of the plot and if that sounds like something I would be interested in, then do it. Anyway, I hope you enjoy the movie, thanks for reading, <br /> <br /> -Chris
