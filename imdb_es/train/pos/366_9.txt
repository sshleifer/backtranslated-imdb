This movie is so wonderful, it's hard to find words to describe it. This is the only time I can not decide which was better, the book or the movie. <br /> <br /> Whoopi Goldberg is amazing, and Oprah Winfrey, such a good actress, could be funny, happy and miserable. All at the same time. All together, the film was well directed by Steven Speilberg, and should not be missed. 9/10
