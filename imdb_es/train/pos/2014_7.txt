Mel Torme and Victor Borge, in their youth, serve to make this film interesting, and especially to see a young Sinatra, on the sunny side of 30, and definitely conveys that this was her "yes, I am a popular singer , but just an actor still "on stage." Michele Morgan is an annoying and insane presence, and Jack Haley is an actor whose appeal has always been totally lost to me.Leon Erroll is stupid, as always, but generally quite funny. 7 stars of a potential 10 is about the correct "grade", because with the combination of its positive aspects, along with the lack of a great story, and a fool, and the hassles mentioned above, it is average overall at best. Part of the fascination is the visualization of the three entertainment icons in their early years.
