This is a great movie for all ages. It is the story of three animals that have to find their way home. There is a small twist at the end and mainly throughout the entire film. You never know what will happen next. This movie makes you cry and makes you laugh. You just do not know what's going to happen next. The walk home is beautiful with all the wonderful scenes of wildlife. The producers also spent a lot of money for this movie and it shows too. The animals in this movie were well trained and they are great actors / actresses. Everything about this movie is great! 10 out of 10 all the way! Rent it or buy it today I can guarantee that the whole family will love it!
