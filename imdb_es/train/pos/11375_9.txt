This movie tells an incredible story with history and compassion. From the careful descriptions of the crime scenes to the mental health of the principal investigator, you will be fascinated. It is an absolute must for anyone interested in criminology. Interpol's relationships and how the agencies work together are also excellent. Not too done either. I also recommend it to anyone interested in Russian history. How the police work with the political party as it was ... It's really fascinating and frustrating. The settings are beautiful. It's been a while since I saw this movie the first time. It does not diminish its impact. Not too dramatic or graphic, it leaves enough for the imagination, well, you'll see.
