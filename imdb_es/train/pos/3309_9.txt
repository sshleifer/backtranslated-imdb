This is a great movie. If this is an indication, then Hong Sang-Soo really is "the best kept secret of Asian cinema". It's very similar in style to Tsai Ming-Liang and Hou Hsiao-hsien, and it covers a lot of the same thematic terrain as them, but I think I actually enjoy it more than any of its films. The manifest minimalism is a little less pronounced here than in his work, although it still completely fits that style (the camera never moves even once), and somehow I found the film less consciously "slow" than Tsai Ming- Liang or Hou Hsiao -Hsien, which I think is part of the reason why I enjoyed it more. Also, he does not keep his subjects as distant as Hou does. I felt that the film was also, somehow, more "complete" and less open (barely) than some of his works, although that does not mean that it had something similar to an advanced plot. It would be hard to believe that Sophia Coppola was not directly influenced by this film for "Lost in translation" (the scenes of a young woman wandering alone and languishing in her hotel room with punk panties can not help but seem familiar).
