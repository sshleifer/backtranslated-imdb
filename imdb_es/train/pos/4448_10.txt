I saw this movie yesterday for the first time and I enjoyed it very much. I am a student of screen writing and I loved the way in which the minor characters intervened just when something fundamental / climatic happened in a scene. <br /> <br /> I thought the dialogue was very sharp and the premise of the story is quite shocking: at one point in particular, Barbara Stanwyck is flirting openly with her daughter's boyfriend; And rekindling a bit of passion in her husband, whom she has not seen in ten years; And with the bullet signal 'two shots and then one', she gets hooked up with her old redhead Dutch (the reason she left the city in the first place!) EVERYTHING AT THE SAME MOMENT! The moral majority must have felt totally angry when they saw this movie in the 50s. <br /> <br /> I love the costumes, the cinematography and the direct dialogue from the hip: just to see Barbara Stanwyck and Co doing the 'Bunny' Hug 'is reason enough to rent this movie on DVD. <br /> <br /> One of the best movies of that period that I've seen in a long time.
