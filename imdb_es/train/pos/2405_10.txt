Wow, I can not believe I'm the first and the only one to post a comment about this great movie. <br /> <br /> Although the film itself seemed interesting enough, the real thing that attracted me to this is Matt. Lillard, although most people probably think he's too happy with caffeine or he just sucks, but we're both the same age and the same generation, and I've seen this guy so many times that he's now one of my favorites. This is one of the few movies in which he is the big shot and the main star, as in SLC Punk, another great film by Lillard. <br /> <br /> Baiscally this is the story of your usual movies, but with more twists than anything else. , who begin to ascend to madness. Also very remarkable in this film is another great actor named Vincent D'onofrio, a person very little appreciated in the film industry. The woman in the movie is a newcomer and it's not that bad, although you know she was hired mainly because of her accent and the nude scene =) <br /> <br /> It's a game of Jack vs Jill vs. Bob like everyone else I want to reap the rewards but share with anyone. Everyone tries to force themselves to kill the other and is a time bomb waiting to explode. Matt shows his true prowess as the schemer who initially started the whole scheme. Vincent and the woman play a couple of art thieves who need money due to lack of business. The character of Vince is a bit upset and the skitz throughout the film, but that only increases the intensity of the film. <br /> <br /> The surprises on the left and on the right are well received and the end is not a clich√© and makes you feel happy. Well, maybe that depends on the type of endings you like. This movie kept me very interested in addition to the fact that Matt was in it, it's a great movie and I would recommend it to anyone who likes movies. Critics probably will not like this movie, but they do not watch movies because they like movies anyway.
