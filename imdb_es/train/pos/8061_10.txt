The performance of Victor McLaglen is one of the best in the history of cinema. <br /> <br /> I think we can all feel for "Gypo" because we have all struggled with what is right and what is not and what is wrong. This was one of the first images of the art house launched by a major American film studio (RKO Radio Pictures). <br /> <br /> The cinematography of Joseph H. August is at its best here. However, the impressive part of August was largely overlooked; he did not receive the Oscar nomination he deserved. <br /> <br /> This is a psychological drama, with thought, philosophy, sadness, all transmitted with as few words as possible.
