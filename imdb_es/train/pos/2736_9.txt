A unique film ... one of the best of all time. Performance, script, Quincy Jones score, cinematography, editing, etc., simply fantastic. As most viewers know, this film is based on Truman Capote's book about the famous murder of a family of Kansas farmers (the Clutters) by a couple of young people during a robbery by mistake. I've never seen a movie that brilliantly turned a real story into a fascinating movie. <br /> <br /> The actors are solid in all areas, but the focus is on the killers, Dick and Perry, and the law enforcement team that pursues them. Scott Wilson, as Dick Hickock is incredible. Cocky, nervous and devoid of compassion, he is so charming, oily and plausible. Robert Blake as Perry Smith is also extraordinary: lonely, at once empathetic and cold-blooded. Who could fold these characteristics into a single person and make us buy it? He does it, and it's brilliant! A key point of the book is how it took the intersection of these two very different sociopathic individuals to create the critical mass to commit such a stupid and atrocious crime, and these two actors make it work perfectly. Both had moments in their later careers, but these performances are high watermarks, and that means period of performance. <br /> <br /> The cops are wonderful too. Leading the investigation is John Forsythe, but the other three detectives are also great. Unlike contemporary films in which producers believe it is necessary to provide the police with assets or superhuman weaknesses, these are simply flat feet, working the case with determination and competence. They seem so real. I have never seen cops on the screen so powerful in their authenticity; and I've seen that most of the crime classics go back. Actually one of the types in this regard. <br /> <br /> PARTIAL SPOILER COMING (this movie is unique because you already know what happened, but I'm warning so that it remains a record). <br /> <br /> Of course, the best scenes of the best crime shows and movies are the interrogations: the meetings of intellectual fencing between the police and the criminals, Mano a Mano. This movie has undoubtedly the best interrogation scenes you'll ever see in a movie. Look at Dick and Perry trying to cheat their way and slowly unravel, not realizing that the police have the goods in them. But policemen must skillfully prepare their suspects to break their alibis and, hopefully, provoke confessions. This is one of the best performances you'll ever see. Think of Glengarry Glen Ross without the showboating. <br /> <br /> To help translate the sad and horrible angles of this real story, ICB was filmed in Clutter's real house, and I heard that the film students played Clutters to give them a genuine feeling. Works. These look like decent, simple people. It makes the crime so palpable and sad. <br /> <br /> I'll stop here. It is not a movie to feel good, but it is one of the best films that have been made, and, therefore, it is unique and it is obligatory for every movie fan.
