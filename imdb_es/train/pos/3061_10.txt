This film shows the kind of joint work that is desired in each film. Barbara Bain and Donald Sutherland (who are husband and wife) are getting cold, discussing the "family business" as if it were a grocery store or a dry cleaner. Macy, Campbell, Ullman and Ritter are great too. They face each other as members of a first-class theater group, who realize that a quality product requires each actor to support others in a disinterested manner. And finally, there's Sammy (David Dorfman). What an incredible performance of a child ... and what a strange resemblance it has with Ullman, whose son he plays! <br /> <br /> We are treated to a unique story in "Panic", and that is a rarity. In these days of shit formulated tired. The dialogue is sharp and intelligent, and this relatively short film, however, has the power to elicit a wide range of emotions from the viewer. There are places to laugh, to be scandalized, to be horrified, to be sad, to get excited, to get angry and to love. It is not a movie that makes you jump for joy, but when you finish, you will be more than satisfied knowing that you have spent the last ninety minutes experiencing an excellent work. <br /> <br /> More of us Go to the theaters if you treat us with a quality rate like this. When will the powers that be in Hollywood awaken? It is a real pity that something so good is not exposed beyond festivals and homes fortunate enough to have cable.
