The sequels are almost never up to the original. This is definitely true in this case. However, if you are a big fan of the original, then definitely give this a watch. Although the camera work is missing, the character of Brian Krause is annoying and the plot is a clique, it is much more fun than the first and that is what I find entertaining. <br /> <br /> I do not see this movie waiting for the same performance as in the first movie. Frankly, it's a little different. Instead of sitting in his stateroom writing movie scripts, Stanley is in Hollywood trying to direct the project of his dream, Cabin by the Lake. This movie has a very different feel, but it's still great to see Stanley back in action. <br /> <br /> I give it a 6 out of 10.
