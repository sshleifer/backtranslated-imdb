A nice game, which offers a fun and easy game and a fair play ability. Staying true to the comic and providing a low learning curve gives this game something that is not seen in most action cartridges today. In addition, the narration and the animated scenes used (although the long animations are replaced by slide shows in the Nintendo 64 version) make the most of the capabilities of the platforms.
