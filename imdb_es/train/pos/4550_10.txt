Daniel Day-Lewis is the most versatile actor alive. English aristocratic snob in A Room With A View, passionate Irish thief in In the Name of the Father, a blatant and violent butcher in Gangs of New York (in a performance ten times stronger than Adrian Brody in the Pianist) and as the scandalous Cristy Brown with cerebral palsy in My left foot (just to name a few). Their roles influence each other, but each one is separate and absolutely unique. He changes completely, with each character he assumes. And I'm starting to believe that he can act like anything. Anything. <br /> <br /> As Cristy Brown is amazing. He does not ridicule the character, and he does not sympathize with the character. A difficult achievement And Cristy Brown comes alive. A smart man. An outrageous man. Human. <br /> <br /> This film, despite the small faults in the transition of the scene and the like, is an inspiration. Yes, it is predictable. But is it stupidly sentimental? No. I laughed. I cried. Not a single moment of cheese. Proof that this is not a Hollywood movie. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is the scene in the restaurant, when Cristy is talking about painters with Eileen, Peter and his friends. This is where Daniel Day-Lewis reaches a climax of acting. "I will kick you in the only part of your anatomy that is animated." "Roll the cripple!" And his performance never slows down, never falters and is beautiful. Simply. It has a lot of screen time here. I see him again, and I never get tired of Cristy's insightful eyes, tremors and guttural speeches. <br /> <br /> A must see. Fo sho, me!
