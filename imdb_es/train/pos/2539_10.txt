For the real people of the cinema, this film is a necessity, since it works as a perfect little allegory for the films themselves. The science of Janos Rukh / Boris Karloff has to do with capturing and projecting the light of cosmic phenomena. This light can hurt, or it can be exploited to do good. On the one hand, blind to his mother, on the other hand, is used to cure blindness ("I can see!" Screams a girl in whose eyes this light is projected). When Rukh / Karloff is poisoned by the extraordinary power of this light, we see him really emitting a ghostly glow in his hands and face like a badly developed negative, drawing attention to the fact that the man we are seeing is a projection, a entity seen in a movie (only visible, like in a movie theater, when the lights are off). <br /> <br /> There is a wonderful passage near the beginning where Karloff / Rukh explains that his investigation was informed by the fact. that everything that happens is captured in the light that travels through space for millions of years, since the Andromeda light was emitted from that galaxy at a time when the earth was still molten rock. <br /> <br /> There are passages in the film when this new science is juxtaposed with older cultural vehicles: that of the writer, in the person of Beulah Bondi / Arabella Stevens; and religion, emblem of the sculptural figures of the local cathedral Karloff, with its projector / ray gun. <br /> <br /> Here you have to ask yourself if this movie was meant to take a look at what was happening in Germany at that time, and particularly to use Riefenstall from the film the previous year to promote a regime that certainly It would continue to do a lot of damage: Triumph of the Will. <br /> <br /> In the end, happily, the Mother (Violet Kemble Cooper) intervenes, reminding Janos Rukh of the first rule of science. <br /> <br /> If only more movies make you want to stop at the movies and shout: "I can see!"
