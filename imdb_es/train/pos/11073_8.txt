I've never known a movie to wake up such a debate in my life. Believe me when I say that this movie will be remembered as an all-time classic. I expected this movie in advance, as I had previously loved both Lock, Stock ... and Snatch, but after some of the negative reviews, I thought I would be very disappointed. I loved this movie and I can not wait to see it again. This movie is totally different from the two Ritchie films mentioned above, and also much better. I have my selection of favorite directors, but none of them has achieved a movement as good as the one Guy Ritchie has just made with this movie. I think he has taken filmmaking to another level (I know that most people will laugh at this comment because of the reaction to this movie, but I think that time will prove me right). This film is very confusing and lasts for more than 2 hours or more, since I could not stop thinking about it or try to put things together. Now I have a good idea of ​​everything that happens in this movie (some answers of endless hours of reflection, some responses from the reading of other people about the film) and now I can not wait until Sunday, when I will see it again. I just hope that people go to the movies with an open mind and I hope that they will be rewarded like me and many others have been.
