The sequel to "The Kingdom" is more bloody and even more twisted. I only saw half (I was exhausted and could not sit for 5 1/2 hours) but I loved what I saw. Ghosts, blood, murders, poisonings, mutated babies, voodoo ... This has it all! If you have a strong stomach and you like rare movies, this is for you. <br /> <br /> Also, you do not have to see Part 1 to understand this ... you'll find out! <Br /> <br /> Does anyone know if Kingdom 1 and 2 are available on DVD? Sitting through these marathon movies in a theater is exhausting. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there probably will not be a "Kingdom 3": Ernst-Hugo Jaregard (Sig) died a year after it was filmed. But you never know!
