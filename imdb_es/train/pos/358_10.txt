The Color Purple is about the struggles of life and love that helps people strongly affected by the struggles of life. Each character had an element of purple color in them. The film touches love, loss, hope, hatred and triumph. If Celie lived hell and lost her sister, and Shug entered her life to show her love again, Albert was not a man who corrected his fault towards Celie, Shug rejected his father and confesses at the end, Sofia and her stubbornness, good and bad, and even Nettie, they had their emptiness and difficulties during the movie, but in the end they overcame it and that is the sign of a good movie. Good job for the entire cast and crew.
