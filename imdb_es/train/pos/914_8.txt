Vivah is by no means a classic. However, in the days of hardcore action, special effects that break the road and complex graphics (none of which Bollywood has yet dominated), it's quite refreshing to watch a simple movie like Vivah. The story, as we all know, is a journey from the first meeting of a couple to their final wedding after some shy moments and testing times. Nothing more and nothing less. The music is not exactly in the same league as MPK or HAHK but it does not shake your senses either. Two songs stood out for me: Mujhe Haq Hai and Do Anjaane. While Milan abhi aadha and Hamaari shaadi were humble. Shahid performs sincerely and shows great potential. It's good to see him play something else, but the "cool guy" he usually does. Amrita is very sweet and plays the role of a docile girl from a small town to perfection. Alok Nath, Anupam Kher and Seema Biswas are excellent props and the rest of the cast does a reasonable job. The address of Suraj is simple but effective. The main flaw of the film is the slow pace that can test the patience of many young viewers. But in general, a good, clean and decent family movie.
