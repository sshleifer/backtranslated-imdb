Pleasant story of the Pimlico community in London that, after an unexploded WW2 bomb explodes, finds a Royal Charter indicating that the area in which they live is part of Burgundy. <br /> <br /> This movie works because it appeals to the Fantasy that many of us have about inventing our own rules and not having to listen to them. A solid cast of British stalwarts, especially Stanley Holloway, makes it more credible. <br /> <br /> There are some very nice moments in the movie, like when people have run out of supplies and other Londoners on the other side. The side of the barricade begins to throw food and other things. <br /> <br /> Although you always knew that Pimlico would once again be part of the United Kingdom, the people of PImico and, as a consequence, the viewer does not care. When this happens, it leaves a pleasant feeling of happiness. <br /> <br /> It's amazing to think that these low-budget films from a small studio in London are still so popular more than fifty years later. The producers must have something good.
