I have no idea how to describe this film, and I would also love to give others the same opportunity I had, seeing it without a prior knowledge of what to expect. I enjoyed it immensely, but I can also say that I barely understood what was happening, if in fact there was something to understand in the first place. David Lynch fans (tangentially) or especially Guy Maddin's films should especially enjoy this, and any EIGHTBALL comic book fan will probably be beside himself with joy and awe (he came as close as any movie he has ever seen to the tone and Dan Clowes creates so effectively. <br /> <br /> A small note to warn anyone who is easily offended: this film, if qualified, would be NC-17 with security.Fans of male frontal nudity, however .. hmm, well ... yes, this is something weird and wild.
