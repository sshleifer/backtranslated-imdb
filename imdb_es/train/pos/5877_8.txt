Well, this movie is fine, as I said, but surely you need to see it as it is worth seeing. It's about two guys, Mac and Sam, who are great friends and work as fashion photographers, and the moment of laughter begins when Mac (Akshay Kumar) starts dating with 3 hostesses at the same time, leaving his wife suspicious. Sam achieves fortune and almost forgets his friend but not completely. But Mac thinks so and so begins to go out with hostesses. There is garam masala in every step of the movie, rock songs but some faults. The comedy is not up to the task and deserves a prize. It's nice, but not so excellent. Some people laughed until their stomachs ached, but it did not deserve so much laughter. But, of course, everyone's opinion is different. So if you want to see the movie, you can do it.
