The first time I saw this movie was when I was about 8 years old on television in the United Kingdom (where it was called "Laupta: The Flying Island"). I loved it, and I broke my heart when it was repeated a little later and I missed it. I loved the story and the characters, but especially the beautiful and captivating music. It would have been the original English dubbed version that I saw, sometimes erroneously called "Streamline Dub" (the copy was actually Ghibli and distributed only by Streamline) that unfortunately is not available, except as part of a ridiculously expensive laser disk box -set. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I feel that the release has been partially spoiled by Disney. The voice acting is fine, but the dialogue does not have the same raw energy that had the streamline dubbing or the original Japanese, and I think James Van Der Beek seems too old to be the protagonist. They made some useless modifications, like changing the name of the main character from "Pazu" to "Patzu", and added a bit of dialogue. But the worst of all is that I feel they have ruined many scenes with intrusive music: the opening scene of the aircraft, for example, was originally silent, but it has been spoiled thanks to Disney's stupid need for music every time someone does not speak. annoying in many Disney movies. <br /> <br /> This movie still blows the most recent animated films, and I can not recommend them enough. The plot is simple but captivating and the film shows a style that, unfortunately, is lacking in most modern mass markets, homogenized animation.
