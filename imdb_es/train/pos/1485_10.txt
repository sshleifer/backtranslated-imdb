This movie contains personalities that are so delightfully playing their part, I love the end, when nobody knows what they are going to do with their lives, but it is completely great when you see and you realize that the priest is right, it is for two , so what are the other people doing there? The film embraces you to a new life, to experiences, to be able to dream about the other person and reach those dreams. It also shows you life itself, as hard as it is. But it gives you the option to choose what you want and what you really need. I hope this comment works for you. The movie that he did worked well for me. By the way, I bought the movie;) Take care.
