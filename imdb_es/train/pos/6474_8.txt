I felt totally attracted to this and could not wait for each episode. The performance gave life to the emotional that a missing person in the family must be, together with the effects it would have on the closest people. The only problem we had as a family was the speed with which "explained" everything at the end. Could not we hear clearly what was said and have no idea what Gary's part was in all this? Why did Kyle call him and why did he accept it? Having invested in a series for five hours, we felt cheated that only five minutes had passed for the conclusion. I asked around and none of my friends who saw it was not wise either. Very strange but maybe we missed something crucial ????
