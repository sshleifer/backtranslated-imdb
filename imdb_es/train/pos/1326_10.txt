I saw this movie at a university film festival in the 70s. I've been waiting for FOREVER to make this film come out on video (finally, that's it). It was made in Brazil, so I assumed it was the reason why I had not yet reached the video. I have been reviewing video stores for the last 15 years waiting for this excellent movie to come out! It's one of my favorites of all times, but be careful, it's weird, as is Werner Herzog, its rarity is due to its superrealism. <br /> <br /> The movie is based on a true incident. A few centuries ago, in pre-colonial times, when Europeans first encountered tribes in the Amazon. A white man is confused by a wild tribe of cannibals as his enemy, so they try to kill him. However, before they send it, they make it part of their tribe (their custom). The whole movie is like watching a National Geographic documentary when it becomes an accepted member of your tribe. That's. Cosmic plot? No. An intense vision of the variety of human life? Definitely. <br /> <br /> Oh yes ... be careful ... this movie has a definitive nudity. This is not a Hollywood movie about the wild nobles ... this movie says it was like (re-read above: National Geographic, super-realism) <br /> <br />
