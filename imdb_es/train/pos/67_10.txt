The industry dropped the ball on this. The trailer does not do justice to the movie and when it opened, it was in a hand full of screens. If people had had the opportunity to see this, word work would have made it very successful. Each of the 2 main actresses offers excellent emotional performances that really appeal to the story and especially to the characters. I verified it based on the excellent recommendation Richard Roeper or (Ebert and Roeper) in his book. An example of a great movie that never fully premiered, except on some screens. What did not give him an opportunity to be seen. Some movies go to the video quickly because they are not so good. This is worthy of Oscar and is a tragedy on many levels that most will never hear. Maybe through word of mouth you will get a follow up on DVD or cable. If you have not seen this movie you should. Great performances of the 2 main actresses make this movie. It could have been another special movie for teenagers after school, but instead it's very good for other movies worthy of being recognized. Interrupted girl comes to mind. If you like that, you'll like this. <br /> <br /> Both girls are in one amazing emotional scene after another without appearing melodramatic. Even though Alicia is angry and Deanna is crying through most of the movie, it is done in such a real way that they do not come off as stereotyped or melodramatic characters. The movie will move you in many scenes and if you are an aspiring actor, use these real performances as your school. Erica is even better at this than at Traffic. I hope these two actors get more roles that also use their talents and allow them to shine. Watch this movie and, if you wish, recommend it to your friends so you do not get lost among all the garbage that comes out every year. This movie was buried while Spiderman 2 finishes the records. In what kind of word are we living? AGHhh. So for the world to be good again, see this and recommend it.
