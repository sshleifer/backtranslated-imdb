Lensman is a little-known anime gem of Toho and MK studios. It's based on the novel, but it reminds me more of the "Metroid" game. <br /> <br /> If you want to see this, look in Japanese with subtitles or just in Japanese. The version dubbed in English was almost cropped and edited to death. <br /> <br /> There's not much news, despite the fact that it's the first animated feature that combines CG graphics with hand-drawn animation, but it's fun to watch, though.
