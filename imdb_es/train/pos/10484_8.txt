Enchanting does not even begin to describe "Saving Grace"; It is absolutely irresistible! Anyone who ventures into this movie will leave with their spirits up (haha). <br /> <br /> Grace Trevethyn (Brenda Blethyn) has just lost her husband, but her problems are about to get much worse. Her dear deceased left her without money and with pending debts. Before the loss of everything, you have to find a way to get a lot of money ... fast! An idea occurs to him when his gardener, Matthew (Craig Ferguson), asks the famous horticulturist in the city to advise him on a plant he is cultivating in secret. Grace immediately realizes that her plant is marijuana, so they decide to use her gardening skills to grow a lot of premium grass and then sell it to pay off her outstanding debts. <br /> <br /> The most notable quality about "Saving Grace" is your sympathy. All the characters are extremely sympathetic, and, with the exception of the first 20 minutes, the movie has no end. Everyone wants a happy ending for everyone, even if that means turning a blind eye to some illegal activities. <br /> <br /> The performance is top notch. Brenda Blethyn is one of the best actresses in Britain, and here's why. It turns what could have been a caricature into an individual who lives and breathes completely. She is a good lady, but she is not stupid. Craig Ferguson is just as nice as Matthew. He's a big loser, but he's so nice that it does not matter. The rest of the ensemble cast also fits into this category, but a special mention must go to Tcheky Karyo. The French actor always has an aura of threat about him, and that suits him well, but he also has great comedy skills. <br /> <br /> Nigel Cole finds the perfect tone for "Saving Grace". It's about the charm. One of the problems I have with British humor is that all the energy seems to be exhausted from the movie. It is not like that here. The movie is totally nice and always fun. That does not mean that "Saving Grace" is just a nice movie that will leave you with a smile and a good feeling. While this movie is not a comedy, it has two or three scenes that are hysterical. <br /> <br /> If there is a problem with the movie, it is that the climax is a bit confusing. However, the questions are answered and the ending has an unexpected turn. <br /> <br /> See "Saving Grace", especially when you have a bad day.
