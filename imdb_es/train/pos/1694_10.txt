['If the creators of this film had tried to introduce reality into the plot, it would have been just another waste of time, money and creative effort. Fortunately, throwing all pretension of reality to the winds, they have created a comical marvel. Who could miss a movie in which a foreign driver passes the whole movie acting as Jack Nicholson, complete with the Lakers shirt? Do not dismiss this movie as garbage.']
