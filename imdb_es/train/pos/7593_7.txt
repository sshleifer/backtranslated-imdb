The movie is absolutely silly. <br /> <br /> But did you expect a high-level intellectual film based on a comic called Slam Dunk? Really? Jay Chou's performance is not exactly the most moving thing I've seen, but I certainly enjoyed the movie. Was it somewhere near the amazing level that someone like Jet Li or Stephen Chow can produce? No, not really. Was it completely entertaining if you only take it at a superficial value? Absolutely. It is a film about some Chinese idols and musicians that can play basketball with a level of unreal experience. There's an evil guy in the style of the Triad and an intriguing madman who involves Jay Chou in all this. A love interest. It is formulaic but in reality, suspend disbelief for a while. Come on. It's called Kung Fu Dunk. Why do you really think you registered? Do yourself a favor if you see it. I found a copy with some subtitles in Engrish that made the movie almost unintelligible for intelligent conversation, but we laughed a lot. They would seem extremely obsessed with Jerusalem and the numbers 1, 10. I laughed, I cried, I threw. I would see it again. <br /> <br /> Especially for that fight scene at the bar. Well choreographed and well thrown. I especially enjoy the pool table illuminated with Plexiglas: I would love to play in one of those. <br /> <br /> Elegant enough for me, but I like junk cinema.
