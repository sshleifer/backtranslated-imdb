Although I did not like Stanley & Iris tremendously like a movie, I did admire the performance. Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro are great in this movie. I have not always been a fan of Fonda's work, but here it is delicate and strong at the same time. De Niro has the ability to make every role he plays in the golden performance. He gives a great performance in this movie and there is a big scene in which he has to take his father to a home for the elderly because he can not take care of him anymore and that will break your heart. I would not really recommend this movie as a great cinematic entertainment, but I'll say you will not see much betting acting anywhere.
