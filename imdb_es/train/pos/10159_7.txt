['There are few movies or films that I consider favorite over the years. The way of the Gospel was one of them. I saw this as a young teenager and I would like to have the opportunity to see him again. My favorite parts were the fact that <br /><br /> 1 / Jesus was blond, <br /><br /> 2 / The last dinner was a great meal. <br /><br /> 3 / He liked to play with children, <br /><br /> 4 / His death was for all people and for all times. <br /><br /> It is possible that the film was not theologically good or that it acted of high quality, but at that moment it touched my heart. Also, I&#39;m a fan of Johnny Cash and it was a brave company. If it ever comes out on DVD, I&#39;ll buy it only for sentimental reasons.']
