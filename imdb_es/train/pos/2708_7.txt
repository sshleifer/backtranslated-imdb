['After being sent to prison for no less than 10 or more than 40 years for having been arrested with drugs and refusing to give up her achievements, Jackie (Erica Gavin from Russ Meyer&#39;s &quot;Vixen&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Valley of the Dolls &quot;, in his The last role of the film) has to get used to life in the great&quot; dollhouse &quot;, or at least try, in this first film by Jonathan Demme. Due to his extravagant nature and his observation ability, he would also classify it as one of his best films, right under &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; and &quot;Stop Making Sense&quot;, but far above any of his other films. This minor classic is simply corny, sleazy and funny enough to be an incredibly good guilty pleasure and, fortunately, it is never exceeded in all the parody of the Women In Prison genre. ALMOST almost erased the rancid bad taste of the ridiculously preached &quot;Philidelphia&quot; from my mouth. However, the film is not without flaws (the &#39;show is not a HUGE task to sit and lasts too long, Barbera Steele is lost with sadness, among other small things), but do not let those complaints stop you from seeing a otherwise pleasant movie. <br /><br /> My Degree: B- <br /><br /> Extras on DVD: 5 minutes of interview with Roger Corman; Bios cast and crew; Original trailer; and Trailers for &quot;Candy Stripe Nurses&quot; (with nudity), &quot;Big Bad Mama 2&quot;, &quot;Big Doll House&quot; (with nudity), and &quot;Crazy Mama&quot; <br /><br /> Eye Candy: Juanita Brown, Cheryl &quot;Rainbeaux&quot; Smith, Erica Gavin, Roberta Collins, Ella Reid, Lynda Gold and some others show their skin']
