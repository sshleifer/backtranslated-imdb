I really enjoy this movie. I am a single father with a 17 year old daughter who is intelligent, athletic and talented. I WANT my little girl to apply herself so well to solving crimes and helping others! So for me, maybe this is Fantasyland's PG level. I read many Nancy Drew books in my adolescence, a long, long time ago. Surely THIS character was skillfully played by Emma Roberts but she did not look like the Nancy Drew I remember from the books. That's because of the script, not the acting. <br /> <br /> Emma is an adorable teenager, who has a confident, hard-working and proud character with good manners and good taste. She is not caught up in the fashionable competitiveness around her. There are some weaknesses in the plot, besides not looking like Nancy Drew of the Books, and trying to find out in what decade we are. (Like, what is that CAR, anyway?) <br /> <br /> I read the IMDb summary before watching the movie, since I was investigating Rachael Leigh Cook from other movies. This is not one of his best roles, but I'll keep looking for more of his films. Rachael was too old to interpret this advantage, but she does a good job as the greatest orphan of the mystery. <br /> <br /> I am very disappointed with other reviews written here. Some expect a perfect connection with books, others expect more credible situations or action films for adults. I got what I expected! Good entertainment well aimed at young teenagers, and their parents who want good children with high standards of behavior and achievements. This is a PG movie for teenagers, not James Bond! Which one would you like for a role model for YOUR teenage daughter?
