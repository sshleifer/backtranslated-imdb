This is an incredible film, both because of the incredible energy evoked by the frenetic flamenco dance, and because of the unique way in which the filmmakers interweave the history of the theatrical production with the life of the characters who are preparing for it. Spell is the only word I can use to describe the experience. This is not the 'Carmen de Bizet' by any usual norm. This is not a usual movie by any standard. Each nuanced look, each footprint, each piece of music is intertwined so captivatingly that you can not look away from the screen. You do not need to love opera or flamenco (not me) to be captured, captivated, captivated by this film. Subtle and direct; noisy and still One of the best films of this type, if not the best, because there are very few like this one.
