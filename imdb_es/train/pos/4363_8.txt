It's a bit disconcerting to have a character named Gig Young in a movie ... played by Gig Young. But this movie is where Gig got his name and also a good momentum in his career after playing small parts with another name. <br /> <br /> I will oppose most of the other comments and affirm that I really enjoyed this movie, mainly due to the vibrant performance of Barbara Stanwyck as Fiona. She was amused, angry, vulnerable, caring, and feisty as the eldest of three daughters whose mother died in the Lusitania, and whose father was later killed during the Woar I War. <br /> <br /> As the "man" of At home, Fiona has stood firm for years against the establishment of her father's will, which would allow a type of Donald Trump named Charles Barclay to get the family home. But Fiona keeps a secret of why she hates Barclay so much. Geraldine Fitzgerald is the middle and flirtatious sister, who is married to an Englishman but longs for her younger sister's boyfriend (Gig Young). <br /> <br /> If you're a Stanwyck fan, you can not miss it.
