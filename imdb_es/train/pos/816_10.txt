First, I would like to say that, although I know my part about Star Wars, I am not a fan. I do not know how many chromosomes a Wamp rat has or the extended family of TK427. What I know is this: Star wars, all the movies (except for episode 2), captured something magical. It's hard to say what, what button Lucas has found and pressed boldly, but it works. Star Wars is more than a movie. It's an idea. <br /> <br /> How can you ask? I will explain Star Wars touches the most universal of stereotypes, good versus evil. It does this so obviously, so deeply, that literally anyone from any environment can understand. Episode VI does it very well, concluding the epic struggle between a son and his used and manipulated father, but also, with the addition of the prequels, reveals even more insinuated history. Suddenly, it's Darth Vader at the front, and the viewers realize that it's Anakin's story, not just Luke's. but even before 1-3, there was an amazing depth to everything. It felt real, as if the capsule fell from the sky to Lucas's lap, detailing a historical history of a galaxy far, far away. <br /> <br /> Star Wars is definitely something far above the norm, and I must admit, every time I see them, particularly this one, I feel very small. I feel as if I have been pushed into a world where good and evil are clearly defined. It gives me a tingling sensation when I see them, a feeling that something, somehow, has touched me more than anything physical could hope for.
