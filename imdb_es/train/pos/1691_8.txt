This movie is fun and suitable for any age. It is definitely a family type entertainment. The cast does a good job playing people in the Midwestern city of Big Bean, Illinois. Where we must assume that nothing ever happens, since the emotion (pre-invasion) of the decade is the new (and only) exit ramp of the interstate highway. The location is so boring and totally unlikely for the invasion of the land by the Martians. But these Martians are totally inept, despite being well equipped with an arsenal of terribly frightening and deadly weapons ... including a stab at eradicating the Martians, too! The Martians die in their lines and throw the correct accents to become spectators and locals who want to help them ... to leave the earth. J. J. Anderson playing the very young carnivorous Halloween duck has great lines. Watch this movie to laugh and entertain you; provocative is not. But it is subtle and pleasant.
