Well, I just discovered that there is a more unpleasant and shocking show than "Little Britain" and I like it! "League of Knights" is a sick British comedy about the most horrible, insane and disgusting little city in the whole UK. This place makes Dibley and Craggy Island (from "The Vicar of Dibley" and "Father Ted") seem pretty normal! The format of the show is very similar to LITTLE Britain, except that everything centers around the people of the city of this hellish town. Both programs present the same parodies again and again in each episode and some inspired by "Little Britain" (particularly the class patch that seeks work). But the program differs because although it is crude as "Little Britain" (therefore it is not a program for children), the program has a sickly and sadistic quality that sets it apart from all these programs. In particular, cruelty to animals and serial murder are recurring themes throughout the program. <br /> <br /> Now, if you have not guessed, this is NOT a program for children, normal or easily offended people, and that is probably why he liked it. However, you really need a very thick skin and a love of the horrible to enjoy this to the fullest. Fun and incredibly irreverent beyond belief: you have to see it to believe it.
