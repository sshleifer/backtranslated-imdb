Well, what can I say? Apart from these people, they are Super in every way. I quite like Sharon Mcreedy, I enjoy this pure nostalgic series. And I have the set of 9 records in box, 30 episodes, I did not realize that they had done so many, I also think it's a great shame, that they have never done it anymore. I wish they would give me these powers, imagine me, leaving me out of the cycle, somewhere and staying out of combat, and then waking up in a special hospital. Later, I discover that my body has been improved. Like Richard Barrat. These stories are 50 minutes of pure action and suspense at all times. You can not fight against these 3 people, since they will defeat you in all forms of weaponry. The music is well written, and for me, I have in my mind a wonderful image of 3 super beings. The kind of powers that the champions have are the same as our domestic dog or cat, improved vision, improved hearing and touch. and the strength of 10 men for Richard and Craig and the strength of 3 women for Sharon. Who I thought was beautiful and intelligent. As a child, I was very much in love with her! Now I can see why, in my DVD set. The box is very beautiful and comes with a free brochure about the series. I also thought that Trymane was a good boss, firm, but he did things!
