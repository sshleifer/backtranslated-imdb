This movie captured my heart from the beginning, when listening to the first notes of Quincy Jones or seeing the wonderful purple color of the flowers in the meadows. This is truly a movie to cry and die for ...! The full cast offers the best performance in a movie I've seen in years and Spielberg has really outdone himself! Whoppi Goldberg, Margaret Avery, Oprah Winfrey (oh sir!), Danny Glover and the others, give us the best and you can feel it, you almost touch it! Goldberg IS Celie, she gives him the insecurity and feeling of inferiority that is needed for the character, and we grow with it, we strengthen ourselves along with it throughout the film and we triumph with it. Margaret Avery is wonderful as Shug Avery, even when she is more arrogant, and shows us that "sinners", in effect, "also have souls". The always friendly and charming Danny Glover does a wonderful job of making people hate him and the magnificent music of (I would say sir) Quincy Jones adds even more beauty to this splendid movie! Photography, music, director and music make this beautiful and moving film an experience of life. You do not want to miss it! "Sista '... remember my name ..."
