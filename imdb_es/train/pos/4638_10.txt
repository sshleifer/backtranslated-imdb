I saw this movie when I was in Israel during the summer. my Hebrew is not fluent, so the subtitles were very useful, I did not feel lost at any time of the movie. You tend to get used to the subtitles after about 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> This movie shocked me !!! It represents two of the most prominent taboos in the Middle East today: a homosexual relationship between an Israeli and a Palestinian. It allows a person to enter both realms of conflict simultaneously. The dilemma, the emotions involved. The film culminates in tragedy when anger and rage lead one of the lovers to an extremist side! an absolute must see !!
