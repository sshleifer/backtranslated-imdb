Running Man is not a great movie, in fact it is a bit silly. But it offers what you want in an Arnie movie and that is action and entertainment. I do not see how someone could not enjoy this image, it's so silly and exaggerated, it almost makes fun of itself. By the way, this is probably one of the most quoted Arnie movies out there.
