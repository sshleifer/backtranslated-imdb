This is one of the unusual cases in which a film and the novel on which it is based are excellent. Maybe this is because Gorris takes Nabokov's initial ideas and gives them a different interpretation. The final consequence is a point of view about Luzhin that dignifies him more than Nabokov's. <br /> <br /> The only thing in the film that I do not like is Valentinov's influence on Luzhin's fate. I can not imagine Nabokov creating a person like Valentinov and giving him so much influence in the plot of the novel.
