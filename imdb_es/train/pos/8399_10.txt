['Love Trap is not a short film, obviously it is a long-running movie with a running time of 105 minutes. <br /><br /> As I write this, I could talk a little more about Love Trap. I&#39;m often asked what makes Love Trap different ... that&#39;s how I answer that question: 1) It presents characters, one in particular, that have never been seen before in the movie, period. <br /><br /> 2) In my humble opinion, it reveals more truth about love and delves more deeply into the very concept of love than any other US film. UU <br /><br /> 3) Structurally, as in the way the story is told, it is different from any love story you have seen. <br /><br /> 4) It offers extremely timely information on various cultural issues, both inside and outside the black community. <br /><br /> Over time, people will see Love Trap as a work as original as possible in this era, deliciously refreshing, authentic and honest. It is a game of rare morality full of food for thought. <br /><br /> Visit www.lovetrapmovie.com for complete and accurate information about this movie.']
