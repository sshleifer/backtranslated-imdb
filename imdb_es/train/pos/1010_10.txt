I love this program! <br /> <br /> Every time I watch an episode, I repeat that line and I remember how good this program is. I am a big fan of science fiction and this program has reason to be the most important science (fiction) program in the history of cinema / TV. There are so many theories in this program about the universe that a religion could start. It's amazing, season after season the program improves and improves. <br /> <br /> I'm a MacGyver fan since I was 5 years old (19 now) and it seems so ironic to me that my 2 favorite TV shows from All-time star Richard Dean Anderson. It is also interesting to see how each character is practically the opposite of the other. <br /> <br /> When I saw the movie Stargate for the first time, I instantly liked it and considered it one of my favorite science fiction movies, then I heard one. The TV show would come out of there. I was very excited, but I did not have time until the end of the fifth season. <br /> <br /> However, I was disappointed to learn that Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin wanted to do it. A trilogy of movies but the studio opted for the series instead. <br /> <br /> I would say however that turned out well. Maybe even better. <br /> <br /> This show is amazing, and I hope it never dies. Atlantis here we go!
