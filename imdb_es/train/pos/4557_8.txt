I thought Hugh O'Conor was amazing as the young Christy Brown, and really deserved more recognition for his role. I could not believe how well the paper played. Of course, Daniel Day-Lewis was also brilliant. My favorite scene is where the children play football and Christy uses her head to stop the goals and then kicks the penalty kick! Impressive performances of the two Christys (and others too).
