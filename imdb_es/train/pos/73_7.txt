This is essentially a variation of House Of Wax, both in the plot and in the type of role played by the star of both films, Vincent Price. In both images, he plays a talented artist who is sent to madness when his creations are usurped by other people, less talented and less scrupulous. In this film he plays a designer of illusions for stage magicians who aspires to start an acting career only to be frustrated when another illusionist, the Great Rinaldo (John Emery) insists that he fulfill his contract and give him the first option of illusions I designed The price is already ill-disposed towards Rinaldi, since his ex-wife is now a lover of Rinaldi. He deploys his talents as an illusionist and as a brilliant imitator to take revenge on Rinaldi and others who frustrate his plans for recognition as an interpreter and designer. <br /> <br /> Price is practically the whole show here and offers a well-judged star change as an abused man whose problem wins the audience's sympathy. The rest of the cast is competent if they do not have color and the weight of the whole company falls on Price, who loads the load with ease. <br /> <br /> Well Melodrama from solid B movie, this is a crime movie instead of a horror image and it's nice as long as you do not expect a masterpiece. Taken in black and white it is low in blood and is best seen as melodrama and is enjoyed by the presence of its star giving an idiosyncratic performance
