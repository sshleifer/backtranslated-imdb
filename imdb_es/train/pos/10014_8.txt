The Night Listener caught my attention, with Robin Williams shining like a radio announcer in New York City who falls in love with his friendship with a 14-year-old boy (Rory Culkin) who is very sick. Williams has never met the boy in person, since they have only been in contact talking on the phone. However, Williams' ex-boyfriend (good job Bobby Cannavale) raises questions about the boy, which prompts Williams to arrange a meeting with him in person. What follows makes a permanent impact on Williams in a way that he does not expect. I'll leave it at that. Toni Collette also stars. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this movie, with Toni Collette giving a memorable portrait of Culkin's adoptive mother. Sandra Oh also played Williams' friend. The Night Listener is inspired by real events, and has a somber, almost spooky silence at all times. Sometimes it's predictable, not thanks to some of the reviews I read before watching the movie and just for logic, but I liked it anyway. I enjoy Williams in roles like this, more than his comedic characters, so that was an added bonus for me. Recommended. 8/10
