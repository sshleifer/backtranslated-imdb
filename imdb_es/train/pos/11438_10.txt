Ralph and Mumford, misfits in their own land, are deceived and become involuntary pawns of Synanomess Botch. Twice Upon a Time is their story, the characters they know and their struggle to fix things. With a surprisingly impressive soundtrack and a wonderful voice acting for some of the best in the business, this unconventional movie comes to the mark. <br /> <br /> The animation process, while similar to the "South Park" style. , it is much softer and much more three-dimensional. If I did not know that the animation was of this style, I would swear it was the traditional pen and ink. If you can watch this movie in Dolby Surround or THX, PLEASE, DO IT! You really will not lose anything if you do not, but if you do, you will get much more out of the experience!
