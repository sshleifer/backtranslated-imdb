Actually, the answer only occupies a small part of this excellent Imax film that educates us about our delicate being. C.G. and special cameras, with the help of Imax, incredibly show the internal (and external) functioning of an average human, whether they are adult men and women, boys or girls, or babies. Almost every aspect of the human body parts are specifically detailed: digestion, reproduction (with a stroke of Marvin Gaye), the heart, etc. Some particularly revealing moments include how a baby can submerge underwater and also how the impulses of the brain are seen. It's amazing how we work. <br /> <br /> The topic jumps a lot. But at all times we still learn a lot about our bodies that we * need * to know.
