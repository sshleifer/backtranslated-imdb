For a comedy this has a decent and inventive plot and the comic timing of Trey Parker and Matt Stone is perfect. There are dozens of fun moments in this fantastic movie. I especially like the multitude of colors and the way the scenes are produced in the sports arena. The parody of Robert Stacks Unsolved Mysteries is also very funny.
