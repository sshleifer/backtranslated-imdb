['I do not understand. Not being critical, I&#39;m not evaluating the quality of the performance, which I think is credible, something good. My confusion is with the content. No one else is sensitive to the fact that these two infidel women justified their infidelity to the men who fought and bled to guarantee the continued freedom of their families and their country. Should not there have been a prologue that informed us if the men arrived home and, if so, what effect did the infidelity of the &quot;wives&quot; have on them? While these women were lying to their lovers for a feeling of loneliness, did they think that their husbands enjoyed being shot when faced with death or dismemberment on a daily basis? They did not think of their husbands at all! Only of themselves. Forgive me, except when they wanted the death of their husbands.']
