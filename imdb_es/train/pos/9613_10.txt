It is difficult to describe Bug in words, it is one of those films that really have to be seen to understand them. Follow a narrative that is more fluid and interesting than anything else I've seen lately in a Hollywood release. As your characters react to the chain of events in different ways, and as the events dictate different paths for the characters to follow, the audience is simply an observer. The almost Proustian narrative flow from thought to thought, the same spontaneity in the script, will have you stuck to the screen, waiting anxiously to see how everything works in the end. And as for the thematic elements ... there is a particular sequence in the film that goes from melancholy to bright and beautiful, and then to the tragic, all in the span of a minute. And works. <br /> <br /> This movie is pure magic. It reminds us why independent cinema is perhaps the brightest star in the current film industry. Perhaps with more films of the Bug quality, people will start to notice.
