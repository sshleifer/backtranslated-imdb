Fabulous, fantastic, probably the best musical adventure of Disney. I have loved this movie for more than 35 years because it is very imaginative, intelligent and fun. Even in spite of the silly "flying bed" scenes, the other scenes and the dialogue are magical and funny. Could they have chosen someone better than Angela Lansbury to play Eglantine? I can not think of someone more suitable for the role. Redoing this classic would be as stupid as remaking Mary Poppins. <br /> <br /> David Tomlinson, although he had few quality papers, shines in this adventure. He was a comical genius who is often forgotten today. Misty, primitive and appropriate English: nobody could do slapstick and do it as gracefully as he does. It would be tragic to remake this film because Tomlinson died a few years ago and nobody could put himself in his place and do justice to his character. <br /> <br /> Dancing nightgowns and armor have a magical aura that surrounds them. Other movies with witches simply do not capture. I particularly enjoy the parts in which the Germans invade the house of Eglantine and she must defend it in any way she can. <br /> <br /> Moving along, floating along the bottom of the beautiful brackish sea. Richard and Robert Sherman excelled in musical numbers. They are all fantastic and worth remembering, Portobello Road is one of my favorites. <br /> <br /> A great movie that still stands today!
