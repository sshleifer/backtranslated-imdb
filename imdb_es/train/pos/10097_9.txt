One of the first OVA ("original video animation") that I bought, this has yet to be one of my favorite anime titles. A cyberpunk sci-fi action comedy versus an unlikely (for a comedy, that is) history of contamination in the near future in a dystopian society. <br /> <br /> The "heroes" of Dominion are the Tank Police, formed with a philosophy of "if we can not beat the crime, we will get bigger guns" and who they are, as the name suggests, patrolling the city in tanks instead of patrol cars, and they are actually much more dangerous than any criminal they are trying to catch. Most, if not all, of these policemen are psychopaths and bordering neurotics (?), who give them a new meaning to the phrase "loose cannons". <br /> <br /> Equally colorful and amusing are their opponents, the terrorist Buaku and his hench (wo) men, Twin Cat Sisters, whose existence always seems to imply a difficult time for the tank police. <br /> <br /> The animation is not cutting-edge, but it's very nice otherwise; The palette of colors and the caricature style of the characters and wicks are perfectly adapted to the comic atmosphere of Dominion. <br /> <br /> The dubbing in English is, again, very fun. The soundtrack of the English version is also very good. I wonder if they ever made an album of the soundtrack of that ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, Dominion Tank Police is great. It's a Japanese SF cyberpunk with lots of comedy, full of completely exaggerated characters and situations, making sure you never take it seriously. Highly recommended
