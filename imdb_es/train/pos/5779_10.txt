For starters, I did not even know about this program for about a year because of the Internet. I have never seen him on television in my country before, and many people do not usually know about this program. However, it is a shame, because it is easily the most original and intelligent animation I have witnessed in years. <br /> <br /> I do not distribute 10 points a lot, but this is a show that really deserves all 10 points. Although at first glance, this may seem like a typical caricature, but keep in mind that it is not a children's show. When the whole story unfolds, you know that this is a real and profound story, with a spiritual message. This spiritual part of the story is based largely on spiritual animals, an ancient Indian belief that has been preserved for many years. This gives the program an original touch that often can not be found in animated programs. <br /> <br /> The overall design is also something very different. Sometimes it looks a bit like Spawn in terms of gritty design, and sometimes it takes a more caricatural approach. I think David Feiss, who also created and directed Cow and Chicken, animated a segment in the show (since he also drew that segment in the comic). <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a program that distracts your mind, a show that deals with different topics, such as reality, suicide, spirituality, life, is something that should not be missed. Once you start looking, you'll probably see it until the end. A minor fact may be that the show takes less material from the comic, but this is not too annoying. However, the only question remains, where is the DVD?
