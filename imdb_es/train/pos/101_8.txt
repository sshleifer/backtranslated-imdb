IMDb lists this as 1972 for some reason, but the other sources I've seen, including the excellent program notes, mark it as '68. It really does not matter, except that it's quite interesting to see this abstract collage of film and video (one of the first works of art that apparently merge the two) in the context of the Star Gate sequence in 2001, released the same year. Pure abstraction is not really my thing, but I can take it in small doses and the super saturated optically printed colors and the psychedelic feeling of this series of flowers, Rohrschach spots, birds, etc. It is quite convincing and quite beautiful. It certainly helped pave the way for many other nascent video artists in the 70s, and deserves to be better known.
