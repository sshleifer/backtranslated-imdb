['This is a poem on film, wonderfully presented and photographed with sensitive art. It perfectly captures the atmosphere of the moment and place. (The Lake District of Italy in the 1920s). It&#39;s a love story with a twist. The characters are unique and credible. The settings are deliciously exotic. Some of the scenes, the funerary ship in the fog, the photo of the chess table in the center of a tile floor with an intricate pattern, are beautiful images. And instead of the obligatory happy ending, this story has a bitter sweet. If the film is an art, this is close to a masterpiece. <br /><br />']
