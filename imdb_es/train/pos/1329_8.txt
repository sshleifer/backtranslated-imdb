I grew up in Brazil and I used to visit and marvel at the beautiful coast where the film was filmed. The area is called "Parati" and is part of the "Costa Verde" of the state of Rio de Janeiro. It is about 150 kilometers from the city of Rio de Janeiro. <br /> <br /> This film revives the world of 16th century Brazil, where Europeans were just beginning to explore the coast, which was still pristine and sparsely populated by several native tribes. The French and the Portuguese fought among themselves for the territory and for the advantage in the Brazilian timber trade, while negotiating with the natives, who also fought with each other for any reason. <br /> <br /> A French misfit ("a mercenary is left to die for his own countrymen, but manages to escape and is held prisoner by a completely naked native tribe." Although he is a "slave" of the boss, according to the customs of the tribe, he is allowed to live in relative comfort for months until the time is right for him to be killed and eaten in a ritual of revenge. <Br /> <br /> What I love about this movie is that he recreates with love the peoples of the natives and their way of life (they walked naked and they were cannibals) and they ask us to recognize and accept life in those times as it was: in a beautiful Eden garden, life was disorderly, violent, full of pathetic superstitions and strange customs, Europeans come and bring their own problems, including more violence with better weapons and greed There are no romantic "noble savages" or "heroic explorers" here, it's just about people trying to survive in a world or difficult. <br /> <br /> The film is neither sympathetic nor contemptuous of the natives. As far as I know, the description is quite precise, which adds an air of singularity to the project: how many films have you seen about the lives of the Brazilian natives and their first issues with Europeans?
