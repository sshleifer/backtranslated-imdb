This film is exceptional and wonderfully qualified. Prince's Oscar for music was deserved (many people do not know who won one). I think this is one of the best movies to watch as a couple late at night on DVD. A big surprise: Prince does a good job acting and is very good at transmitting the pain to the camera. Morris Day, Wendy and Lisa are good at their supporting roles. Very interesting milestone film.
