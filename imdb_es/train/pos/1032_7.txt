A movie message, but pretty good. Outstanding distribution, from top to bottom. Interesting in the plot of Bette Davis is essentially a back story! Extremely negative critics (the name that throws the script / dramatist, associate it in some way with extremely negative comments on 'Angles in America', etc.) are opposed to the film being too preached about Germany in World War II. Hell, for me it's a too-sophisticated understanding of morality. <br /> <br /> Theatrical and film-making styles, and acting styles vary with time and, of course, 70 years later, this particular film would not be made in this way. Yes, Casablanca is a better movie (I suppose), but although it was made in the same year and both have Nazis, Casablanca is mainly a love story. The love story in this film ranks second in the spy plot, more than a thriller. Both have a fairly large number of somewhat corny accents and wonderful character actors. The children are a bit tedious and could have been edited.
