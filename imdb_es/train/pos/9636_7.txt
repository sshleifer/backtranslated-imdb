A depressed and lonely French child Mathieu (Jeremie Elkaim) on holiday in the summer, meets and falls in love with Cedric (the beautiful Stephane Rideau). Calm and slow this is a very frustrating movie. On the one hand, I was absorbed and really felt for the two children. On the other hand, it was bothering me: the film keeps blinking constantly from the past to the present without rhyme or reason. It is very confusing and useless. <br /> <br /> ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!!! ¡¡!!! <br/> <br/> There are also lots of holes in the parcels: Mathieu, at some point, does something that ends it in the hospital. What is it? They never tell us! Then he breaks up with Cedric and tells everyone else that he is living with him. Why? We are not told. Then he inexplicably hooks up with another boy at the end. Why? Without explanation. It is clear that Cedric loves Mathieu and that Mathieu lives in the same city, so ... However, it is a tribute to the film that you really care about the characters. If only things were explained! <br /> <br /> Elkaim as Mathieu is not good. He is tall, handsome and has a good body, but he can not act. His idea of ​​acting is to sit with a blank look on his face, all the time. Rideau, on the other hand, is great. He is VERY handsome, has a very beautiful body and is an actor's hell. He also has an incredible sexual magnetism about him. There are male frontal nudes, many kisses and a pretty explicit sex scene in the movie that is great. Most movies avoid showing scenes of man-to-man love. This does not and helps to see how the characters take care of and feel each other. <br /> <br /> Then, a frustrating movie that is worth seeing, especially for the nude scenes of Rideau, that is, if you like naked and handsome young men! <br /> <br />
