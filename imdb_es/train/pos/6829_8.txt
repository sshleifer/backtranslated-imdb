Gena Rowlands plays an actress who loses control over reality when she witnesses the death of a fan of her. She becomes increasingly deceived by reality and, as a result, her emotional turmoil intrudes with her work as an actress. In the sense that she breaks all the rules of acting and improvises everything, and still manages to attract her audience, she makes the film interesting (though a little important) as a parallel of Cassavettes' struggles as a filmmaker. So many ideas are launched and, as a result, they become a bit confusing (I'm still thinking about the relationship between the dead fan and Rowlands, among many other things), but the way they present themselves in their story form makes it a Movie Consistently interesting and stimulating. It would be great on a double bill with Mulholland Drive. <br /> <br />
