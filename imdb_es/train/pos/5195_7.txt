As a lover of bad movies, I definitely hit paydirt with this one. The plot is not really that bad, but there are some cases where you really have to ask yourself "what the hell is going on here?" <br /> <br /> There are many things that make this the funniest bad movie ever. First, Rudy Ray Moore had become so fat and slow when this movie was filmed that special effects consist of speeding up scenes fight to double the time. There are also scenes in which there is an instant replay in slow motion, jumping to a wall ten feet tall (playing falling from it backwards), naked men coming out of big letters and sex that literally makes the roof fall (with the Por Of course, no Rudy Ray Moore movie would be complete without a completely free and random comedy club scene in which Rudy mocks all the customers, interfered with the people, doing some strange dance.There are many bad things about this movie , but they are bad in an entertaining way, and if you look away from the movie, you could miss another mistake. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/10 for the real value, 10/10 for the cheese factor, 10/10 to select mistakes and nonsense, averages 7/10.
