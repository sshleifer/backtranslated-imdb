This is one of the few movies I saw twice in the theater. I really love this film because of its atmosphere and its story of the life of the tragic hero Esteban Trueba. He makes so many mistakes, but he has an opportunity for redemption. Is not this a pretty comforting thought? <br /> <br /> When I first saw it, I thought that after the winning election, the film would end, I did not know the book. So boy was wrong when the dramatic climax was still to come! I was literally dragged by the absolute power of the last half hour of the movie. <br /> <br /> Many people here dislike this movie. I can not understand that one bit. Perhaps those who read the book for the first time, as is often the case with the film adaptations of novels, simply feel disappointed that so many things have remained untold, unseen, unexplained. But like a movie that tells a moving story: the story of a family, the rise and fall of a man, the deep compassion of a woman, the strength of love and the madness of hatred (and conservatism), this movie It is simply splendid! In addition, the soundtrack is incredibly good and the cast is also wonderful, especially Winona Ryder and Jeremy Irons. <br /> <br /> Definitely one of those movies for which cinema was invented!
