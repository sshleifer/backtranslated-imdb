['If only Eddie Murphy was born 10 years later. Then we would all remember it. But even I was only 4 years old when it came out. If you have not seen it yet, hire Dr. Dolittle, Showtime, I spy, Pluto Nash and all the comedy movies of Eddie&#39;s family, and then look at this. Without a doubt, you will laugh 90% of the time. The other 10% will wipe the tears from your eyes. <br /><br /> You really need to see more than once to understand all the jokes. From raw humor to a joke for children (if you&#39;ve seen it, you&#39;ll laugh here): you&#39;ll love your stuff. If you can (or you&#39;re a big fan) try to download clips of Eddie&#39;s acts. All the shows are different as you imagine and have even more fun jokes. <br /><br /> But this is like the &quot;best of&quot; Eddie Murphy &#39;X-rated&#39; so to speak. <br /><br /> And all I can say is, please, do not look at Delirious if you do not like comedy, you do not have a sense of humor or it&#39;s not fun to hang out with them. You will only leave this great Eddie Murphy classic and possibly make someone miss it. <br /><br /> If you want to know how Eddie got Beverly Hills Cop and became famous with him ... Delirious is that.']
