The first time I saw this movie was when I was flipping through the movie channels on my parents' DirecTV. I was on the Sundance channel and it was starting. I love music, especially in the late 60's and that's how the BJM sounded (the Dandys are fine). Everything about the Massacre of Brian Jonestown intrigued me from the music, the personalities of Anton and Joel, to the use of illicit drugs. It was funny because when I was watching the first scene of the party, when everyone was making lines, my parents passed and decided to look (the expression on their faces was priceless). Anyway, this is definitely one of my favorite movies because I was introduced to The Massacre of Brian Jonestown, which is now my favorite band of all time. <br /> <br /> I only see it ... seriously
