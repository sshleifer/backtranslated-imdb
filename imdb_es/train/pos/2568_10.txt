In this sequel to the 1989 action comedy classic K-9, Detective Dooley [James Belushi] and his dog Jerry Lee return to fight crime, but this time they associate with another detective [Christine Tucci] and her partner, an average Doberman named Zues who does not get along very well with Jerry Lee. Dooley does not get along with his new partner either. All that changes as the movie progresses. The movie is intense since he's a guy who really wants to kill Dooley because of the way he treated him in the past. There are some dramatic scenes related to the death of Dooley's wife that do not really seem to be related to the tone of the film because the rest of the movie is action sequences, dog poop jokes, joke jokes and jokes about dogs that They bite the bad guys. in a certain area. I know it seems like a very low mood, but it's really fun. I did not see this movie because of the jokes, I saw it for two reasons. The first reason is because I am a big fan of James Belushi and the second one is for the action sequences. James Belushi is more fun than he was in K-9 and the action sequences are also better. It would have been nice to see more K-9 characters come back, but it's still a fun movie. If you are a fan of James Belushi, you will love this movie.
