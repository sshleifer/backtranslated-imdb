['Virile, but naive, the great Joe Buck leaves his home in Big Spring, Texas, and rushes to the Big Apple in search of women and a lot of money. In New York, JB finds himself in frustration and with &quot;Ratso&quot; Rizzo, a disheveled but cordial swindler. Somehow, this mismatched pair manages to survive each other, which in turn helps both of them deal with a gritty, sometimes brutal, urban America on the way to a moving end. <br /><br /> Fun and depressing, our &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot; delves into the vortex of cyclonic cultural change, and thus confirms to the 1969 spectators that they themselves have been swept from the era of innocence of the 1950s, and dropped into Dorothy and Toto. Like, in the 1960s of Aquarius. <br /><br /> The direction of the film is masterful; the casting is perfect; the performance is first class; the script is clear and convincing; The cinematography is attractive; And music enhances all of the above. He deservedly won the Oscar for the best film of 1969, and I would rate it as one of the best films of that cyclonic decade.']
