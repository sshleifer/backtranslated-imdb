I just watched this movie and I have to say it impressed me a lot. It is very creepy and has numerous moments that will make you jump out of the seat! I had to smoke several "emergency" cigarettes on the way to calm my nerves! If I had to criticize, I would say that maybe, in any case, there were too many jumping moments. It reached the point where each new scene reached the climax with a jump and this gradually wears away the surprising effect, because something new was coming. <br /> <br /> Although it contains practically all the clich√©s of the phantom genre. , they all became so good that it kept the factor creepy and scary. I had elements of The Shining, The 6th Sense and The Changeling (in particular, the soundtrack reminded me of The Changeling). <br /> <br /> I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good old scare!
