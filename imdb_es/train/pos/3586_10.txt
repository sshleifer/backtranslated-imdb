I saw it for the first time when it was released more than ten years ago. I saw him again today and he still had a great impact on me. She Fought Alone is about a girl, Caitlin (played by Tiffani Thiessen), who is raped by Jace (played by David Lipper), a classmate who enjoys hurting girls. Caitlin is in a popular high school gang, but when she reveals that she was raped, the gang turns against her, directed by Ethan (played by Brian Austin Green). <br /> <br /> This film chronicles Caitlin's fight against an entire village, including a high school that essentially allows athletes to determine the social environment, allowing them to get away with whatever they want. <br /> <br /> Thiessen and Green are the ones that have the best performance, and there is a real chemistry between the two Throughout the film. All the actors in this film, who were inspired by the real events, did a great job. She Fought Alone really captures the essence of what it is to be in high school (at least in 1995), and to have self-esteem and reputation at stake. Recommended. 10/10
