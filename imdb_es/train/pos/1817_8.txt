All Dogs Go to Heaven plays in the canine criminal underworld. The film is a delight for children with a comical and dark but satisfying story and a happy ending with many songs and dances. Introduce Charlie, a canine criminal who was killed but returns from the dead. Meet a homeless human girl who looks at him and, through this relationship, realizes the meaning of life and personal sacrifice. This is a nice animation that I loved a lot as a child. I would recommend this movie to children. I'm not sure how adults would react. (I tried to watch it a few years ago on VHS, but those recordings do not last long, right?)
