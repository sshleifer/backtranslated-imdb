This movie by Raggedy Ann and Andy is so adorable. We love to see Ann and Andy sing and dance, along with the camel with wrinkled knees. This movie is what made the Camel with wrinkled knees so popular, singing his song "I'm nobodies I Love You". If you love Raggedy Ann and Andy, watch the movie and you'll see why it's a movie that kids love, and adults love!
