Eglimata (= Crimes) is a story about small crimes that ordinary people commit in a crazy scenario could lead to absolute disaster. One of the most intelligent Greek series in history! Actors such as Ketty Konstadinou and Maria Kavogianni showed a new dimension of themselves and talent. and gave us moments of incredible "guilty laughter". Each viewer seemed to recognize their bad side in one of the characters or, at least, on one side of their person, they would like to have it. Actors of all ages who played larger and smaller parts won an equally large space at the heart of the Greek audience. My personal favorites (apart from the first two that I mentioned) are Vassilis Haralambopoulos, Athinodoros Prousalis and Stavros Nikolaidis, but many amazing actors went through some episodes of time to time. Whoever understands the Greek world, should find a way to see this series, although it has been more than 5 years since they appeared on television. In Greece they continue repeating the series (ANT1) in every opportunity that there is like summer or the first hours of the afternoon. We will never forget Eglimata or any of the members of the casting team!
