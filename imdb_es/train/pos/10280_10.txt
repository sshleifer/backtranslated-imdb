The house of games is bewitching. It's so good to occasionally watch films that are perfect tens. There are few movies that I have seen that can catch you so quickly. From the initial scene, this movie only catches you. <br /> <br /> I am trying hard not to give much to those who have not yet seen it, but there will be a few SPOILERS that should NOT READ MORE IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO KNOW. <br /> <br /> I would say that House of Games is not just an excellent movie, but it is the best movie about scam artists I've seen, without exception. From the moment the movie ends, pray that it be played again. <br /> <br /> Lindsay Crouse as Margaret Ford is simply perfection, from her manners to the inflection of her voice, she immediately joins the role. Joe Mantegna was also wonderful. The dialogue in this film has an unforced quality almost without a script and these two people communicate as much in a glance as they do in their voices. I also loved the way the film was filmed, in that grainy and surreal way, it fit perfectly and helped make the film what it was. <br /> <br /> There were some movies I've seen and loved that reminded me to include The Grifters and The usual Suspects but really, House of Games is completely different in its form. Margaret and Mike are two of the most absorbing characters I've seen on the big screen and not only have a screen chemistry that is strong and palpable from the moment they meet, but also the accumulation that starts from the moment they put Eyes on everyone. another is electrifying. You know something is going to happen, but you have no idea what. And just when you think you've guessed what the "something" is, you realize that you have not even scratched the surface ... <br /> <br /> House of Games is one of those movies that can be grouped together certain genre of film type, but it is essentially a film about human nature. The study of the character is not only about the mind of the scammer, but also about the victim. As the film progresses and we know more and more the main characters, we learn about them not only through what they say, but also how they say it. It is a great study of characters and is impeccable in the way it rushes to its conclusion. <br /> <br /> To finish, I would classify this 10 out of 10, call it (although it is not my absolute favorite movie, quite high on the list), definitely more outstanding and I would say that it is one of the best character studios and it contains some of the best "twists" I've seen. Although I love all types and genres of movies, when it comes to films of the human psyche, there really is nothing better than this. Watch this movie
