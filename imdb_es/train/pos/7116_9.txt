['Nobody would say that this war movie of 1945 was a masterpiece. (How could a 1945 war film be a masterpiece?) And yet, this is an extremely effective narrative of a true story, that of Al Schmidt, blinded on Guadalcanal, played by John Garfield, who spent days using a bandage to capture the nuances. of the actions of a blind person. Robert Leckie, in &quot;Helmet for My Pillow,&quot; denigrates Schmidt&#39;s popularity in favor of his foxhole partner, who was killed, and wrote that &quot;the country must have needed living heroes.&quot; <br /><br /> Well, I suppose the country did it. And they had one here. There is a single combat scene in the film, linked to the studio lot, which lasts about ten minutes, and occurs less than half the movie instead of being saved for the climax, but it is the most terrifying representation and realistic of men. under fire that I remember seeing on screen, including those of &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;. Men scream with fear, shout at each other and at the enemy, they bleed and die, without the help of color, stereophonic sound, squibs or gore. <br /><br /> Simply from a technological point of view, the film is outstanding. It&#39;s not just that we learn how complicated a mechanism is for a Browning .30 caliber water-cooled machine gun, or that it should be fired in bursts of only a few shots, or that it should not be stirred like a fire. hose, as in so many other war movies. The technical precision adds to the riveting quality of the scene. The need to stick to brief bursts is horrific when dozens of squealing enemies are spilling out along a stream fifty feet away with the sole purpose of exterminating you and your two isolated companions confined in a small gun emplacement. <br /><br /> The performances are solid, if not courageous, including the ubiquitous support of the 1940s, John Ridgeley and the radiant and young Eleanor Parker. The framed love story is sparse, but it works, and ultimately it is quite moving. A surprising dream sequence is included. It is not Bunuel, but for a routine film of 1945, it stands out as original and effective. <br /><br /> Albert Maltz may have overwritten the script, or it may have been altered by someone else. I could have used the kind of pruning that might have introduced some much needed ambiguity. However, there are strange verbal scores that have a surprising impact on the viewer: &quot;Why does not God kill me?&quot; And, &quot;In the eyes, Lee, take them in the eye!&quot; Depths of anguish in a few corny words. And a surprising amount of bitterness expressed by wounded veterans in a 1945 war movie. <br /><br /> Notes that may seem false to a contemporary viewer, but perhaps should not: the dated vernacular language that is hard to believe that many of today&#39;s children might think that it was once spoken: &quot;private barge&quot;, &quot;drug&quot;, &quot;drip &quot;,&quot; Wow, &quot;&quot; idiot, stupid, &quot;&quot; lady, &quot;&quot; a great guy &quot;and&quot; feel sorry for yourself. &quot;Consider the historical context and be kind to our judgments, at that time, part of this jargon Silly was at the forefront. <br /><br /> Real weaknesses? Wounded veterans get together and discuss among themselves about the collective future they have and the argument is solved in a simple way with a conclusion like the following: &quot;Just because you have a silver plaque on your head does not mean that people think you are a Bad person &quot;. Sometimes there are voices in off and silent prayers that are both unnecessary and absolutely unimaginative. &quot;Please, God, come back to me,&quot; and that kind of thing. <br /><br /> Well, the filmmakers were operating within the limitations of their time. Maybe that&#39;s why the final fade is in a shot of Independence Hall and the inspiring varieties of &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; swell in the back. <br /><br /> None of this can undo the virtues of the film, which are considerable, particularly the impact of that horrible combat scene. It&#39;s not on television that often. If you have an opportunity, by all means catch.']
