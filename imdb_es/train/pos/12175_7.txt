What would you say about a man who was about to get married and was having his bachelor party with some of his closest friends in a bar of Hawaiian men? All smooth sailing until he takes off his "bachelor hat". What would you say about him talking to one of the suggestive dancers and then sleeping with her? What would you say if that exact girl was the cousin of your finances? A new minimum, right? Well, Paul Coleman, played comically by Jason Lee, heads this experience of a blurred image and a new low. I have to say that this is one of your good leading roles. However, I think his role in Vanilla Sky was better. <br /> <br /> Her estate called Karen is played by actress Selma Blair, while Karen's character, Becky, is played by the charming and talented Julia Stiles. Returning to where we left off, Paul now has to deal with a problem that arises from another. He contracts diseases, has to deal with certain people and has to play his games of lies with stealth or any member of each family could get the PED, including one of his relatives who has not had a "bowel movement". "for 14 days. * Vomiting * All this leads to the long-awaited wedding with a hilarious scene before it recaps all the hell that Paul and his brother had to go through. <br /> <br /> In general, A Guy Thing It's a lot of fun and it's all good, sometimes the story may seem like it's not going anywhere and you get tired of the scenes here and there, but it's a mixed movie, and if you're a Canadian and comedian of the CTV comedy Brett Butt , Corner Gas, you would recognize a small role played by Fred Ewanuick, the same man who plays the hilarious Hank in the series.This movie is fine.It's another feather in Lee's hat (a pretty empty hat so far, though). <br /> <br /> My rating: 7/10 <br /> <br /> Eliason A.
