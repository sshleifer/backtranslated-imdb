Oh, honey, we do not like it when our super hero love interest develops a brain, right? <br /> <br /> Something has happened to people, has lost the ability to enjoy, a simple feeling of well-being, love story / comedy? Kirsten Dunst is a revelation: fun, sexy and real. I laughed aloud ooh at least five times and I'm not ashamed to say that I also had a tear in my eye a couple of times. The cast, the acting and the script are great, I see many films in all areas and I have not seen any in this genre that has been so successful. Those who do not agree, please tell me where I can find something. I am sure that the book is also good, but I think you have to judge it on its own merits.
