I watched the movie at the Nashville Film Festival. It was very well done, from cinematography to acting. It is the story of a father and a son, and how they appreciate each other during a family crisis. Beautifully written with a dialogue that never sounds false, the film shows the talents of Paul Reiser and Peter Falk, among others in this outstanding cast. The film begins with the elderly father (Peter Falk) is trying to find out why his wife (Olympia Dukakis) has abandoned him. The father presents himself, without warning, at the door of his son and his daughter-in-law. The father and son leave the next day to see some properties and end up making a classic road trip. They fish, play pool, watch a baseball game, get drunk, get involved in a fight at the bar and dance with strange women. But the most important thing is that each one faces the tacit tensions that can affect any family. It is the kind of film that touches the heart and makes one appreciate those who are closest to them.
