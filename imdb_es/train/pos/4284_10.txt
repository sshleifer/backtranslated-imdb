This film is one of the funniest, sad and accurate representations of the mentality that seems to have invaded the Balkans once again, 45 years after the time described. All the usual characters and conflicts are presented with such anger, sadness and love combined that it is impossible to decide whether to cry or laugh would be the most appropriate response. However, the accuracy of the representation and the timelessness of the types make it a great movie to see if you want to understand a little of what led the former Yugoslavia to its madness. In fact, no diplomat who deals with the region should try anything until he sees this film, and his twin, * Maratonci trce pocosni krug. * Did I mention that it is one of the funniest movies I've seen?
