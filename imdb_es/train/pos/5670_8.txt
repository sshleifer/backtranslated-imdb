Esther Williams gets her first lead role at MGM and gets along well <br /> <br />. This movie is an entertaining and entertaining suspense <br /> <br /> with a mature theme that will be repeated a million times more <br /> <br /> in the future: an innocent girl stalked a woman who hated. Esther <br /> <br /> looks great and if she wanted to, she probably could have made more and better movies, but according to her autobiography, <br /> <br /> practically stopped working for the marriage. Either way, she is so nice and attractive that it's fun to see her in a totally different role. <br /> <br /> outside of the "swimming musical". Universal was great for <br /> <br /> making movies with former MGM stars after the studio started <br /> <br /> dropping their biggest names as they began to descend. The stars <br /> <br /> like Lana Turner, June Allyson and others managed to make first quality films <br /> <br /> in Universal since obviously they still had drawing power in <br /> <br / > the ticket office. I wish Esther had done more, but since she did not do it, <br /> <br /> makes it even more special.
