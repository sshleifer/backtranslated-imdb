I liked Timothy Dalton very much, although he was a little young and too handsome for Mr. R. but I thought that Zelah Clarke was too chubby and short. This version however was very faithful to the novel and very well filmed. I have seen 4 versions, Orson Welles is still my favorite, Mr. R, although George C Scott did it very well and it is a game between Joan Fontaine and Sussanah York, although both were too old for the role. I recently saw a brilliant television version of Rebecca with Charles Dance and Emilia Fox. I would love to see those two Jane Eyre. When I got to see the version of Ciarin Hinds, I think it was out of Jane Eyred, but I will never tire of listening to the first few minutes of Joan Fontaine's voice when it narrates the opening of the first version I saw. I always want to go back and read the book again.
