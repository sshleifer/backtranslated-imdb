This is an amazing action movie with great lineages of Arnie! It is done with style, with a lot of tense action to keep one satisfied. The characters were incredible, and Richard Dawson, is very threatening as the main villain. Yes, it has a lot of holes in the plot, however it is highly entertaining, with a great ending as well. He also had a great story, and Arnie and Maria Conchita Alonso had great chemistry together. The development of the character was also quite good, with some excellent performances. The address is great! Paul Michael Glaser, does a very good job here, with an impressive use of colors, keeping it elegant at all times, impressive camera angles and, in general, keeping the film at a very fast pace! good job. There is a bit of blood. We received some bloody bullet wounds, head explosion, cut throat, bleeding chainsaw slices, corpses without skin, blood and impalement. The acting is great! Arnold Schwarzenegger is AMAZING as always, he is excellent in the acting department, he has a lot of funny phrases, he kicks that ass, and as always it's a great physical presence!, And it was really fun to watch! (Arnie's rules!). Maria Conchita Alonso, she does well here, she was very pretty, and she had good chemistry with Arnie! Yaphet Kotto, he's decent here, with what he has to do, which is not much. Marvin J. McIntyre, he's good as the geek guy, it was great! Richard Dawson is amazing as the main villain, and it was very threatening, and it was fun to watch. Jesse Ventura, Jim Brown, Erland van Lidth, Gus Rethwisch and Professor Toru Tanaka do what they have to do very well as stalkers. In general, you have to see! **** 1/2 out of 5
