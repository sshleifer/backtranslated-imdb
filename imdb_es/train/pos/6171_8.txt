['For those of you who have read the highly respected Rohinton Mistry novel, this film will definitely impress you, as honorable as this adaptation is. With the exception of a minor subplot, Sturla Gunnarson&#39;s film debut is an almost unimaginable recreation of the book (down to the last line). <br /><br /> For those of you who have not read the novel, this movie can be a bit complicated. It is certainly not a great story of cinematic drama. Instead, it has a strong element of realism, but it would not have it in any other way. The best way to describe such a long trip to movie fans would be to say that it is a small-scale Hindu version of &#39;Fiddler On The Roof&#39;. Instead of a Jewish / Russian milkman, the protagonist Gustad Noble is a banker in Bombay in the 1970s during the Muslim / Hindi war with Pakistan. He is forced to deal with a series of unexpected problems in his life, such as his sick daughter, his eldest individualist son, a distant friend who involves him with dirty money and an unhealthy neighborhood. The ending is not happy, nor is it sad, but that is essentially what realism implies. <br /><br /> Such a long trip is a good movie, but if you want to see it, good luck finding it. Unlike the novel, it has received very little release.']
