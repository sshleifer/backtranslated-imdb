One of the most nihilistic and brutal films I've seen, but also one of the most tragic and moving. This is a melodrama of action as the world has never seen it before. Sometimes the plot made me cry, while in the next moment it presented shocking revelations like a heartbreaking blow in the bowels. The chilling performance of Edison Chen. The story of a HK-Cop and a Cambodian murderer who persecute each other, while little by little lose their humanity, is a strong story. With very little dialogue in favor of disturbing images and camera work, "Dog bite Dog" is pure HK bloodshed without heroism.
