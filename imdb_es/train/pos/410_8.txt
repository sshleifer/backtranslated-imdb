['I rented this movie in DVD format without knowing anything about it, as part of a winter marathon of watching a movie every night. After several gruesome films of American action adventures (Ballistic, Daredevil, Cradle of Life), Zhu Warriors seemed like a brilliant and original movie. The story is complete nonsense, but I found the sincerity, the good heart and the complete lack of irony of the film, and the film looks spectacular. Of course, special effects are not technically as perfect as those produced by Hollywood, but filmmakers are more interested in color, composition and movement than realism, and many of the shots are impressive. In one shot, two of the superhuman characters stand on steep rock spiers, a huge moon rising before them, the image perfectly balanced by the three elements. In another, a warrior-princess waves the heavens behind her bright sword like a missile seeking heat. And the colors explode from one shot to another, they are used to express emotions instead of representing reality. <br /><br /> The characters have the same simplicity and frankness of the comic characters, which do not offer great depth in themselves, but refer to the archetypes that resonate most deeply. Physically, several of the actors are amazingly beautiful. They perform their roles directly, without irony or deception, for which they are credible. <br /><br /> The strangest thing of all, despite the clumsiness of the plot and the thin characterizations, in the end I found myself very close to tears, moved by the beautiful simplicity of the actors and the vision of the director in a wild and original way. <br /><br />']
