I was a little skeptic if I should see this when it was first shown on CBS. I was one of the many people who were in New York City that day, I went to school at Hunter College. I did not want to see all the destruction and the carnage again, but as many of us were curious to see what it was all about. Tears came to my eyes upon seeing this documentary. All my memories returned and only the intense images were incredible. I bought the DVD on the first anniversary and saw it several times. How these guys were able to capture this video was amazing. If you have not seen this documentary, do yourself a favor and take a look. Obviously, it is depressing and will bring tears to the eyes, but it is an incredible document of the darkest hour of this country.
