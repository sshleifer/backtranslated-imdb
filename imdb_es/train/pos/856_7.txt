The delivery of some very humorous rude lines by Pierce Brosnan is worth the price of admission. He plays a kind of "psycho-twin brother of James Bond", separated at birth, no doubt. As an intense hit man, his character is very sexual but even better, very funny. Add to the friendly "boy next door", Greg Kinnear, to establish the contrast. The innumerable locations, the vivid colors and the witty humor provide great entertainment. We hope that Davis is well regarded as the "jewel of a wife". But the focus of the film is on the two partners, a new "Odd Couple", and that is the part that works very well. Have a great laugh (probably R-rated), and look for places where the story goes a little deeper.
