This is a very moving image of about 3 friends in their forties in a small town in England. One finds a passionate love and a new beginning with a younger piano instructor, when tragedy strikes and hearts change forever. Definitely a movie to have a box of tissues with you! A powerful piece of work. This is definitely one of my favorite movies of all time. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER !!! SPOILER ALERT !! SPOILER !! * <br /> <br /> The main character is taken by his young, handsome piano instructor and a passionate romance flourishes. His two jealous "friends" play an immature joke that quickly leads to tragedy. She loses her love and her friends all at once. In the end, an unexpected surprise brings them back together (in my opinion, their forgiveness is not justified)
