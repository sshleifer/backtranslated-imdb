I do not know whether to recommend this movie to the fans of "Tetsuo" or not. Why "Tetsuo"? Because you can easily label some things about this movie as a very obvious "Tetsuo" scam. The concept is similar, the editing is equally frantic and fast, which is good because, in addition to making the film more dynamic, it hides some defects caused by low budget and other factors. <br /> <br /> There is much more gore, less eroticism and, in the case of "Meatball machine", the transformation of the human being into a creature that is partially a machine (sounds familiar?) called "Necroborg" ( very original) is caused by small viscous aliens. <br /> <br /> These small patches of outer space use humans as boats for their gladiator games that play with each other. Infest the body, somehow manage to put an insane amount of mechanical parts inside, taking them out of nowhere and turning them into a killing machine that attacks other Necroborgs. Your goal is to defeat another alien who is in another Necroborg, get him out of the corpse and eat him. <br /> <br /> In general, the plot sounds a bit silly and I did not expect much, but at least in the end, I really enjoyed this movie. <br /> <br /> As I said before, this is a low budget movie, but it's still relatively decent. Do not expect much from the actors, they are mostly not very good, but it can be tolerated. I liked the atmosphere and the blood, certain strange situations and the way the film is directed and edited. Although the story is not too original, it has a certain charm, at least for me. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
