I said it in a good way, believe me. Faithful to life, it is not. The whole Oirish thing gets a little thick, but you do enjoy the cast here: Flynn, Smith, Bond, Watson, Frawley, etc. All good. I also liked seeing Mike Mazurki. Of course he played boxer, what else? The typical movie of the forties is full of familiar faces and fast-paced scenes, one after the other. <br /> <br /> Flynn is fine as Gentleman Jim, you never get over a one-dimensional look at him or the rest here, I suppose, but it's okay, it's a caricature and it's meant to please, that's all. The boxing scenes were pretty good, the Ward Bond vaudeville record turned into a riot, and you liked seeing all those billions of people who drive the fans into the scene a couple of times. <br /> <br /> Really very funny, Flynn was on a roll at the time and it is clear to see why audiences loved him. <br /> <br /> *** outta ****
