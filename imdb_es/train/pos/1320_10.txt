In the early and mid-1970s, Clifford Irving proposed to write the definitive biography of Howard Hughes, claiming to have spent months preparing for the book, engaged in interviews with the lonely millionaire. When all this turned out to be false, Irving was accused of perjury and spent several years behind bars (although he always admitted that his findings were accurate). Advance to 20001, several months before September 11, a book, entitled "Forbidden Love" (published in the United States as "The lost honor: love and death in the modern era of Jordan"), by an unknown author with the name of Norma Khouri. , a woman from Jordan, who reported on the death by mercy of her best friend Dalia, because Dalia, of devout Muslim origin, was dating a Christian man. It is, like the biography of Irving in Hughes, revealed as a potential deception. The Australian filmmaker, Anna Broinowski, tries to delve into the quagmire that was Khouri's attempt to cleanse himself of the lie (s). Within 104 minutes, the film you are trying to reveal is that Norma Khouri is telling the truth, or is she simply a compulsive liar, with an agenda / vendetta of her own? The images of the interview with those who know her / him (including an ex-husband, his editor and others) tell their version of the facts. This is a well-made documentary, well produced, that manages to point fingers as many potential culprits. Not classified, but contains generalized negative language and a recreation of the creepy murder scene, played a few times (but nothing so graphic and disturbing as what would be seen in the last epic film about torture, as Saw: Part 84). It is not a good option for the little ones.
