Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron is a wonderful movie in general. The combination of animation types is unique, the story is amazing and the music is wonderful. <br /> <br /> Drawn animation is a special thing in many animations. The way they expressed the characters, especially the horses, through their animation are especially spectacular. While the way in which horses communicate through body language is easy to understand, many young children and people who have not studied horses may not understand. Without words, I imagine that it would have to be a challenge to express them through the functions. Because of this, I understand the 'eyebrow' that they added to the horses (while the real horses do not have those thick lines). One of the few things I noticed about the habits of the horses that might have been described strangely is that the Spirit guided the herd of his mother. In herds of wild horses, the leading stallion usually chases young foals. <br /> <br /> Also, while some people may think that portraying white army officers as "bad guys" are stereotypes, think of all the movies in which Native Americans have been portrayed as that. Sometimes back then; They treated the mustangs very badly. For example, in real history, the Appaloosa race was almost eliminated due to Army officers. Imagine what would have happened to one of the most beloved horse breeds in the world if the Native Americans had not saved them. <br /> <br /> I think it's amazing how realism was not subtracted from making horses talk to each other. The feelings of the spirit were expressed with a little narration, but mainly through music (by Bryan Adams). The songs express the story really well, and Hans Zimmer and Bryan Adams did a great job telling the story through melodies and lyrics. <br /> <br /> The excitement I felt when I saw the movie, whether it was the first time or the twentieth part (Yes, I've seen it a lot), you would not believe it. Some of the scenes take your breath away, while others seem to force the tears in your eyes. The opening sequence, which shows Spirit's homeland, puts you in spectacular action immediately. <br /> <br /> I do not understand at all why some people are so hateful with this brilliant movie. In general, I consider it a 10/10, a must see.
