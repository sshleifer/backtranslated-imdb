I stink with the free Boob references, so I'm just going to write a simply flat review (I did not intend to do any games). I love Elvira, not in a way of "I'm going to shoot the prey just to impress Jodi-Foster," but suffice it to say that I think she rocks. The film is reproduced as a horror movie of the 50s, but much more fun, look for the reference "Caressing without problems the ankle" to know what I mean. the relay that shines through the film is the absolute charm of Elvira (or should it be Cassandras). The first time I saw this movie was at the tender age of 8 years, and I've seen it many times since ... I really should buy a copy, the videostore version looks a little worse to wear. If any other fan of the movie wants to send me an email about it, feel free. <br /> <br /> p.s another great performance by Edie McClurg (paria chastedy) an actress who never gets the attention she deserves.
