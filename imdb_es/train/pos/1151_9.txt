"Soapdish" is one of the best and least remembered comedies of the nineties. The film revolves around the various off-camera dramas that occur behind the scenes of a Daytime Soap Opera produced at low cost. The first of the several impressive strengths of the film is its fantastic cast A-List. 'Soapdish' presents some of the best actors and actresses of his time. <br /> <br /> The film is superbly directed by Sally Field, as the neurotic aging actress Celeste Talbert (She is famous for her tantrums when she puts on a costume that makes her look like "Gloria F * CKING Swanson!" ). Your support cast reads like a Who's Who of the 90's Movie Greats! Whoopi Goldberg, Robert Downey Jr., Teri Hatcher, Kevin Kline and Kathy Najimy greatly enhance the film. Goldberg is predictably excellent, while the performances of Downey Jr. and Hatcher point to the comic excellence they would later achieve. <br /> <br /> In terms of writing, the film is outstanding. The script has a really modern edge, which deviates into the wonderfully strange on several occasions. There are also several visual gags that are well ahead of their time. Somehow, the film reminds Mel Brooks at his best and often reminds him of this critic of "High Anxiety" (1977). Much of the film's humor depends on it being often scathing, but quite accurate, representations of daytime television and the pretentious and neurotic actors. For example, the extras casting session with the exploitative executive played by Carrie Fisher is fun and honest. <br /> <br /> 'Soapdish' is, for my money, one of the best comedies Hollywood produced during the 90s. His excellent script and class A cast make it a must see. It's hard not to love this movie because it keeps you laughing for 90 minutes.
