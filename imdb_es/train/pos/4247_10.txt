MISSOURI'S GIRL arrives in New York City knowing exactly what she wants: to get to something solid by marrying a millionaire, without losing her virginity. With her knockout beauty, she quickly captures the attention of a playboy magnate's son, but by staying true to her virtue, will she also discover true love? <br /> <br /> Jean Harlow sizzles in this excellent comedy. With her platinum hair and her gorgeous accessories, she is a dazzling one. But her beauty should not hide the fact that she was also a very good actress. She has legitimately earned her place at the top of the Hollywood pantheon. <br /> <br /> An excellent cast gives Harlow great support: Lionel Barrymore as the cunning old tycoon, wise to Harlow's ways; the handsome Franchot Tone as his son, in love with love; the noisy Patsy Kelly, stealing her scenes as Harlow's companion; Debonair Alan Mowbray, as a well-educated English gentleman; Clara Blandick, old woman, like the struggling secretary of Barrymore; the cordial Hale Hamilton as a rich man with an eye for the ladies; the muscular Nat Pendleton as a lifeline that catches Kelly's flirty eye; and Lewis Stone, unforgettable in a small role as a bankrupt businessman. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that this film came shortly after the Hollywood Production Code was instituted. A comparison with the RED HEAD WOMAN, made two years earlier, would be fascinating, in which the character of Harlow pursues the same ends, but uses very different means.
