A young woman (Jean Simmons) is convinced by her intriguing and dangerous aunt (Sonia Dresdel) and her uncle (Barry Jones) that she is losing her mind and in a very delicate condition that requires her supervision, which is rather a manipulation, since I try to keep it as far as possible from external human contact. The only other person she sees is the estate caretaker, a lewd character played by Maxwell Reed, who caught the attention of the middle-aged aunt. All this, the aunt and the caregiver, the uncle expert in butterflies that has a serious underside, and the susceptible niece in the middle, would have made a darker and sinister film. As it stands, a framing for a murder sends Trevor Howard (a fired government secret service agent who took a job at the butterfly catalog farm) and Simmons across the field escaping the police, grabbing the headlines of " Police Net Closing In "on his first page photo, jumping on buses and ending up in Liverpool, where they meet some wonderfully chosen characters, and finally face the greedy and murderous aunt and uncle.
