I remember seeing this at the Salem movie theater (where I used to attend "Kiddie Matin√©e" almost every Saturday) in Dayton, Ohio, when I was a kid and I've never forgotten it. It just surprised me and my friends. I wish there was some way to see it again! I've tried to find a collection of shorts or something like that, without success. I recently discovered that it was a Cousteau film and that amazed me even more. How the hell he accomplished this is beyond my comprehension. The fish is REALLY IN THE CAT'S MOUTH at one point, if I remember correctly! If someone could help me find a way to see him again, I would be extremely grateful!
