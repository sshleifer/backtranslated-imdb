This movie is more Lupine than most, especially from Funimation. Apart from the bad dub, it's not bad. <br /> <br /> The first hour is very similar to Comic (which is what all of Lupine is based on, the third thing). Lupine is trying to get a great treasure. Fujiko is using Lupine's weakness with women to try to get something out of that. The latter is not so bad, it is with other women, but, of course, Fujiko is still number one. <br /> <br /> Many of Lupine's other films are more familiar with bad words than Lupine. Any good fan of Lupine I think you will be pleasantly surprised (I know that after hearing so many bad things about this movie). It could be a little better without the little animations during the credits (they do it a little soft) but, in general, it's not a bad movie. Good enough to be one of the few that I would see again from the Lupine III movies.
