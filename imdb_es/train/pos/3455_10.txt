Steven Spielberg (at 24) had already directed two magnificent episodes of a 1971 series called "The Psychiatrist," starring Roy Thinnes. One episode was about a 12-year-old boy with emotional problems and the other about a vibrant young man (Clu Gulager at his best performance) who is dying of cancer. Both episodes were amazing, visually different from anything else on television, and emotionally complex and adult. The creators of "The Psychiatrist" were Richard Levinson and William Link, who created "Columbo" and also produced their first season. <br /> <br /> Peter Falk insisted on senior TV directors for the first season of "Columbo", such as Bernard Kowalski and Jack Smight. But Falk accepted Spielberg after seeing part of Clu Gulagher's episode of "The Psychiatrist." <br /> <br /> Spielberg says on the "Duel" DVD that he loved Steven Bochco's "Murder by the Book" script (based on a Levinson / Link story), and tried to make the production seemed like a million-dollar feature, although he thought he had much less money to work with. <br /> <br /> This episode of "Columbo" is far more visually elegant and makes better use of the soundtrack and background music than almost any other episode of "Columbo", even though the series always He used the best directors. Spielberg manages to avoid that the great Falk and Cassidy bother him too much, but both actors are still very funny. Spielberg also gets excellent support work from Martin Milner, Rosemary Forsyth and Barbara Colby. All performances have a freshness and vitality about it. The only episode of "Columbo" that was close to being so well directed is the episode of "By Dawn's Early Light" with Patrick McGoohan (directed by Harvey Hart). <br /> <br /> I think the two episodes of "The Psychiatrist" and this episode of "Columbo" suggest that Spielberg has not developed technically as much as director. It was great from the beginning. In a "Combat!" The guest DVD comment of the 1962 episode starring Albert Salmi, Robert Altman, says the episode was almost as good as the one he never had as a director. Maybe the same is true of Spielberg.
