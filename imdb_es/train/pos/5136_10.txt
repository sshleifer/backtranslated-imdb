Maybe the best movie about jazz. <br /> <br /> ES Jazz. <br /> <br /> The opening shot continues to haunt my dream. <br /> <br /> Lester, of course, is wonderful and out of this world. <br /> <br /> Jo Jones is always a delight (see also The Sound of Jazz). <br /> <br /> If you can, find the music; It is available on CD. <br /> <br /> All lovers of jazz and dark films should study this tremendous gem. <br /> <br /> What shadows and light, what music, what a hat!
