For what it is, this is a pretty good movie. I like Johns so much -Stamos ("Full House") as Stockwell ("Christine", "Top Gun"). Both give strong performances. The love interest is fine, but this is more a movie of a man than a good dating movie. I love Harleys, and I hated to see them painting over the "14 coats of hand-rubbed lacquer" with the old and old Army Olive Drab. There is a small history lesson here in which Harley-Davidson motorcycles played a key role in World War II. I do not know if the training was like this cluster! The film maintained my interest until the end without being slow anywhere, with good driving action sequences. I love looking at the demographics of the voting history: an 18-year-old man gave the film a 10 (a true lover of bicycles, I suppose). I would not give a 10, but a 8. I do not weight all the movies with the same scale. There are movies that were big budget, with great actors, which you expect to be good, so when they fail, they fail in a big way. (Star Wars - Episode I is my best example) I loved the first three SW movies, but I thought Episode was weak by comparison. So he gets a lower rating from me than this movie. I expect more from George Lucas.
