The main problem I see with this movie is its score, which screams with every note: "This is a cheap movie." There is not much more to say here. The score simply stunk. <br /> <br /> The second problem, which I consider quite serious, in addition to involving the unwinding of the plot near the end of the film (one of the shots, if you will), is the dialogue between Martha ( Adrienne Barbeau) and the sunflower man (Richard Ziman), in which Martha reveals herself as the leader of the experiment. At all times during this dialogue, the viewer is very aware that he is listening to a movie dialogue. In other words, the suspension of disbelief is broken here. The integrity of a credible dialogue between two people is sacrificed by filling in the information that the filmmakers want to convey to the audience. <br /> <br /> The third problem was the casting of Adrienne Barbeau. While I honestly believe that she is a fabulous actress in her work, I think this part may have been too difficult. The main point of his performance that did not seem to fit was the spectrum through which the character moves through the film of a loving mother from a family with problems to a woman almost like Rambo on a mission. This aspect of the script obviously would have been a stretch for any actress and, therefore, you can not blame Barbeau too much. To the extent that she acted quite competently, however, I would only call this a moderately serious problem for the film as a whole. <br /> <br /> Finally, the movie did a wonderful job in the building of the first half. A creep factor, especially during its flashes of horror. I feel that the film would have benefited from a greater commitment to these flashes as a mechanism to avoid a factor creep frenzy in the second half of the movie. <br /> <br /> So, what is my holistic rating of this? piece? It would give you a solid C + to B-, depending on how much credit you want to give manufacturers to produce this movie on a limited budget. Even with two serious problems and two moderately serious problems, the film is based on the solid plot of the Jungian side of Nazi mysticism. I do not see problems with the development of the plot or coherence; the dialogue, with the exception mentioned above, is frankly brilliant in some places, especially in the important key scene between mother and daughter at the beginning of the film; As mentioned, the creep factor was well designed, although a little effervescent in the second half; and Nicholas Brendan, who was also associated with the production, offered a wonderful performance. <br /> <br /> In short, this movie is definitely worth it, see it with a Nazi you love. :)
