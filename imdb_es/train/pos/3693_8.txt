It is not easy to make a film with 18 different stories. Although 18 different international directors accepted the challenge, not all are good, some even boring. But in its entity, "Paris, je t'aime" is impressive, which shows that, as expressed "Love Actually", "love is everywhere," especially in the city of love. Here is a summary (I'll try to make as free as possible spoiler) of the 18 different stories. <br /> <br /> MONTMARTRE: a kind of boring opening sequence, nothing really special about it. A man finds a parking spot and sees many strange couples walking around, wondering why he can not find a girl. And suddenly, a woman faints beside his car ... <br /> <br /> QUAIS DE SEINE - another boring sequence of three teens looking for 'ass', when suddenly a Muslim girl travels right in front of them, receiving help from one of the children. Really basic, but with a sweet heart. <br /> <br /> LES MARAIS: it was a big disappointment! Although a love story between two children with an artistic background could have been interesting by the great Van Sant. Eventually, everything that comes AFTER Ulliel's monologue is good, everything before it's just annoying. <br /> <br /> TUILERIES - an entertaining sequence of the Coen brothers. Buscemi, without even saying a word, is fascinating and the whole sequence is very funny. This kept me hooked until the end, and this one also really hooks you to the movie. <br /> <br /> LOIN DU 16IEME: a beautiful story too, even if the execution is bad, the heart is there. . It is the story of a Hispanic woman who leaves her son, early in the morning, to take care of another suburban baby. Beautiful. <br /> <br /> CHOISY PORTE - this segment has to be the strangest and weirdest of the whole movie. Some kind of shampoo salesman comes to a place similar to Chinatown in Paris. If I understood correctly, the story is about inner beauty, but I think I'm wrong. <br /> <br /> BASTILLE - a truly wonderful sequence. A man meets his wife in a restaurant, to break up with her, so she can escape with her lover. But the wife has devastating news. Pretty basic, but truly sad and beautiful! PLACE DES VICTOIRES - a sad sequence too. Juliette Binoche plays an afflicted mother. One night, she wakes up listening to her dead son. When he arrives at the place, a cowboy tells him that he can give his son a last goodbye. One of the best segments! TOUR EIFFEL: two mimes who fall in love could have been great but, despite having some good cinematic tricks, the story is intriguing and amusing at all. <br /> <br /> PARC MONCEAU - a truth Original and great sequence, one of the best in the film! A girl and an older man discuss their future and their fear for a certain man ... Cuaron does a great job of directing, and the actors are incredible! QUARTIER DES ENFANTS ROUGES: an American actress (Gyllenhaal) falls in love with her drug trafficker. a beautiful segment again, with a very sad end PLACE DES FETES: a woman goes to a homeless man, begins to talk to her in a romantic way ... because she is the love of his life. Beautiful, sad, shocking, romantic, ... Place des Fêtes will make everyone cry. <br /> <br /> PIGALLE - a boring sequence between Ardant and Hoskins, looking for new emotions in their relationship ... very unhappy and unromantic, Pigalle is a disappointment. <br /> <br /> QUARTIER DE LA MADELEINE: with some diversity in the film, QdlM is a relief. A young man (Wood) finds a vampire killing a victim ... The tourist and the vampire ... fall in love! Dark, terrifying and strangely romantic, Madeleine is excellent. <br /> <br /> PERE-LACHAISE - another segment of disappointment. Directed by Wes Craven and with stars like Mortimer and Sewell, it could have been great, but Père-Lachaise is simply ordinary, not original at all. <br /> <br /> FAUBOURG SAINT-DENIS - the rumors are TRUE, Twyker's The short film is beautiful, impressive and well done. A blind man picks up the phone and listens to his girlfriend (Portman, really impressive) that she breaks up with him. Reflect on your relationship. <br /> <br /> QUARTIER Latin - although this segment has been co-directed by Depardieu and has stars like Rowlands, Gazzara and Depardieu, this segment is also a disappointment. Nothing happens, lack of chemistry between the actors. <br /> <br /> 14th TRANSFER: the last sequence is hilarious and sad at the same time. An American tells in her French class about her trip to Paris. His French is really terrible, but at the end of the segment, he realizes that Paris is much more than he seems. <br /> <br /> With Feist in the background, "Paris, je t'aime" ends. in a sweet tone, without disappointing me at all, although some segments bored me very much, the entity of the film is great! A true cinematic experience for young and old. Paris, je t'aime vraiment!
