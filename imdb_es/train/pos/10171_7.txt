Once, when I was in college and we had an international fair, the Russian section had a Soviet-era poster that read "Ne boltay!", Which means "Do not tell gossip!". I "translated" it for the "generation" of viewers like "Do not be Gladys Kravitz!" (in reference to the nosy neighbor in "Bewitched"). <br /> <br /> However, when you see the result of a gossip in the Pvt. Snafu short "Rumors", you see that it is not a matter of laughter. In this case, the perpetually resourceful soldier hears something about the bombings and assumes immediately that the Axis Powers have attacked the United States. Then, he tells someone, who tells another person, who tells another person and continues. As in "The Russians are coming, the Russians are coming", the story becomes increasingly disproportionate, so that when I return to Snafu ... well, you know what I mean! Yes, it's mostly World War II propaganda, complete with a derogatory term for the Japanese, but I have to say that the Pvt. The Snafu shorts were pretty funny. Of course, since Dr. Seuss was writing and Mel Blanc provided the voices, it is not surprising that they came out quite well. Worth seeing.
