The film begins with a group of dead men who walk seated in individual cells, waiting for their inevitable encounter with death represented by the electric chair. <br /> <br /> Then our "hero", whose name is Tenshu, is taken to the chair, has been beaten, and then ... is still "alive". AHA! A spooky military gives you a choice and they look really cool: or we kill you until we make sure you're really dead OR you can enter through this door and take the destiny that awaits you. "Our hero says yes to option 2, and then the real story begins. <br /> <br /> He wakes up in a different kind of cell (very high tech and very big), where he finds another cellmate, who also managed to survive the electric ride. the speakers tell them that they are free to do whatever they want, as long as it happens inside that room It seems a bit suspicious, but the two men accept: What else can they do? What? <br /> <br /> What What these two men do not know is that they have established themselves together, so they can awaken an internal urge to kill within them Basically, the unknown scientists in the background fire them until they decide they should kill each other. In fact, but there is a p Big bearded in all this. THIS is the part that sh could not be revealed, and so it will remain undisclosed. <br /> <br /> But do not fear, it's the unknown that attracts the viewer to see more of this pseudo-action movie, so it has a completely different approach. The question: How long can you stand being with a man who is a SOB? And would he kill him for freedom? <br /> <br /> The first hour is basically trying to awaken your interest, it sneaks up without you really knowing it. Then it becomes a roller coaster with action fighting scenes similar to WILD with a touch of individuality to honor the comic on which the film is based. <br /> <br /> The film is really very special, so it is special that normal cinemas do not see it under normal circumstances. However, the story is fascinating, the music is fantastic and the actors play their part (some more than others) to make the film really unique. <br /> <br /> If you are so lucky that your movie or video store has it, look at it, and enjoy the fact that not everyone is trying to make conventional movies to win large amounts of cash. <br /> <br />
