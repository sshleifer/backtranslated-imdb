One of the best comedy series ever to come out of Britain. Mark Gatiss, Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton are great actors and artists who seem to be at home with drama as with comedy. With the proper support of his writing partner Jeremy Dyson, they have populated the series with the most memorable characters of recent years. Little Britain pales in insignificance as a poor imitation of his ideas. Consistently original and innovative, I am sure that so many people hate these series as they love them, but I am equally sure that nobody could have an opinion about LOG. I have not seen the feature yet, but I have heard good and bad things, so I reserve my judgment. The original radio series that LOG came from was as innovative as the television series. I do not know if the television series came to the US UU., But I would be fascinated to see how American audiences found the strange English identity of humor.
