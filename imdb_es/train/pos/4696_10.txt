['Even though this movie is quite old, no matter how many times I see it, it still makes me laugh. <br /><br /> A particular appointment in the film stands out. <br /><br /> when Danny (Joe Piscopo) approaches the office and parks of the day in a place with a disability, says Danny&#39;s partner <br /><br /> &quot;You can not park here, it&#39;s for the disabled.&quot; <br /><br /> Danny responds: &quot;I&#39;m disabled, I&#39;m psychotic.&quot; <br /><br /> That&#39;s one of the many lines in the movie that no matter how many times you look, it will make you laugh. <br /><br /> Johnny Dangerously is among my 5 best comedy / parody movies of all time. <br /><br /> As an added bonus, it also includes the legendary actor Peter Boyle in the cast. So watch this movie and like me and many others who have seen it, you will be hooked.']
