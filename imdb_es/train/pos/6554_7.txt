OK, here's what I say: <br /> <br /> The movie was excellent. I'm a big fan of Nancy and I've read all the original books 1-56 and I kept reading. Now I'm 96. Be careful with the villains that give this movie a lower note than it should. All the clues point to a wonderful movie! I loved the whole thing. So, what is Nancy at the present time. It is still old fashioned like in books! People who have not read more than 5 books complain about Nancy's opinion. I've read them all and I think Emma is perfect and Nancy was perfect. I found parts of the movie spooky. I loved the exciting car chases and escaping. I loved the tracks. I solved the mystery myself! It was really wonderful. I suggest you go see it, since the people who have complained do not know anything about A which is a good movie and B from Nancy Drew. Go see it. It may not be worthy of Oscar, but it's really a good movie.
