I have decided not to believe what the famous film critics say. Even though this movie did not receive the best comments, this movie was my day. I started thinking. What a fake world this is. <br /> <br /> What do you do when your loved ones deceive you? It is said that no matter how often you feed milk to a snake, it can never be loyal and it will bite when given a chance. In the same way that some people are such that they never feel grateful. This film is about how selfish people can be and how everyone, ultimately, only thinks about oneself and works for oneself. <br /> <br /> A brother dies inadvertently at the hands of a gangster. The surviving brother decides to take revenge. Through this process, we learn about the futility of this world. Nothing is real and nobody is loyal to anyone. <br /> <br /> Amitabh gave the performance of his life. The new Aryan actor gave a good performance. The actress who played Amitabh's wife stole the show. His role was small, but he played his part so diligently that he is moved by his performance. Chawla had really great facial expressions, but his role was very limited and he was not given the opportunity to express himself completely. <br /> <br /> A great movie by Raj Kumar Santoshi. His films always give a message to the audience. His films are like the novels of Nanak Singh (a Punjabi novelist whose novels always had a purpose and pointed to a social evil) because they have a real message for the public. They are entertaining, as well as giving lessons.
