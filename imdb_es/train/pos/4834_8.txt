For anyone who wants to get an idea of ​​the Soviet vision of modern Russian history, this monumental film is a treasure. The story begins at the end of the century (1900) in yellowish sepia colors of old photographs that enhance black and white during the mid-century and full color when history approaches modern times (ie, in the 1960s) ). /> <br /> The story centers on a child in a remote Siberian village, which is marked by the arrival and arrest of an anarchist during the Tsarist era. Later he joined the Bolsheviks after the revolution and brought Soviet communism to his village. His son, for the local beauty, fights against the Germans during the Second World War. When he returns to the village, the oil industry takes off and invites us to a Soviet economic idealism. <br /> <br /> This movie is long and slow, but completely logical and very well made. It can be seen in three parts.
