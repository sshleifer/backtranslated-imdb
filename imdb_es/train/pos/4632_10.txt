['Directed and co-written by Eytan Fox, the writer / director of the acclaimed 2002 mini feature &quot;Yossi &amp; Jagger&quot; (2002). This comparative epic, in 1 hour and 53 minutes, is another excellent romantic drama in which we must treat the tragedy and celebrate the beauty and joy of life. Westerners, especially urban gay men like me, should be moved out of our security zone and be informed of real life and the struggle of death elsewhere to be able to love with equity. <br /><br /> While &quot;Yossi and Jagger&quot; focused on a pair of homosexual lovers in the confines of Israeli military service, &quot;Ha Buah&quot; focuses on a group of civil, heterosexual and homosexual friends, who share a unity in the heart of Israel. The capital of Tel Aviv, tolerant to homosexuals, but not always friendly to homosexuals. <br /><br /> &quot;Ha Buah&quot; begins with a dramatic border control scene in which Noam (Ohad Knoller - Yossi from &quot;Yossi &amp; Jagger&quot;) meets for the first time the handsome young Arab Ashraf (Yousef Sweid). Romance soon flourishes, but in that political climate one should seize opportunities quickly or lose them altogether. <br /><br /> From there we follow an intricate interaction between members and lovers of housemates and the inevitable effect of Ashraf&#39;s very conservative family. If you follow closely the dialogue of this movie, you will have no reason to be disappointed with the ending. <br /><br /> The soundtrack of &quot;Ha Buah&quot; is vibrant and the visual effects are beautiful and sharp, that is, real life in the Middle East. <br /><br /> Subtitles in English are very easy to follow and you quickly relax and appreciate the best of world cinema.']
