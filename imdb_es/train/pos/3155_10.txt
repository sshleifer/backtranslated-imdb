I would like "the program of the 70s" to return to television. It was the best show of all! They should make episodes between the other episodes, but of course that would be confusing. But I would like him to come back and do more episodes. Please come back ... The show was absolutely hilarious. You could not laugh without seeing an episode. There is a very funny part in each episode and, in addition, the show was much better when Hyde and Jackie went out with each other. Those were the best episodes. "That 70's show is the best" ... It will be and always will be the best show of all time. It was really sad when the show ended. They should make new episodes.
