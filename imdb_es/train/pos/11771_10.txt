['Great entertainment from the beginning to the end. Wonderful performances by Belushi, Beach, Dalton and Railsback. Some twists and many action scenes. The movie was made for me! Funny lines in the script, good music. Dalton as the hard sheriff and Railsback as &quot;villain hick&quot;. I must recommend this movie to all the fans of action and adventure! 10/10']
