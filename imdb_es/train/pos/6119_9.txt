It's fine, but just plain silly. Not bad for a horror / comedy movie. I was reading how people changed it with Michael's version and that is a good trick in my opinion because some adults hate the horrors and when they see it they will be interested in horror movies like this or maybe (I have never seen them) The horror (possibly comedy) Uncle Sam, I'll have to see how to rent or buy that movie, but the second is much better than this one, but I bought it on Amazon's VHS and got it on November 21, a day before Thanksgiving. It's worth the four dollars, l.o.l. in this film. <br /> <br /> 9/10
