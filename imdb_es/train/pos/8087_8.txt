It seems that there are only two types of reviews of this movie on the network. Those who hate him and curse the name of Ralph Bakshis and those who love him and call him a work of genius. I am inclined to be in the middle. I am forced to agree with most of the criticisms of this film (for example, the cruel clipping of the story, the bad characters made of rotoscoping, about acting, etc.) But despite this, I still love it this movie. The rotoscope (when done correctly) adds a real and mysterious dimension to the characters and the final scene of the battle at the end of the film is fantastic. The surreal scenes when the nineriders chase Frodo are elegant and well executed, and the musical score ... magical. Unfortunately, the bad points outweigh the movie, but if you can ignore them, it's a great movie. <br /> <br /> (Without a doubt, I'm going to lynch a group of people who hate this movie after writing this review, oh well, such is life)
