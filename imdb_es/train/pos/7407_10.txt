This movie took me by complete surprise. I saw it 2 or 3 times. I really liked this movie There were many truths that this movie brought up. I also love all the characters in this movie. This film makes a lot of sense because as society "becomes more advanced" what does culture lose? Do not sound the preaching. I can really relate to this movie from my childhood hood and lose part of my life that will never come back or be the same. This movie is in my top 5 movies I've ever seen. There is a truth so crude that I feel when I see the film and it is not the kind of truth that you have to dig in front of your face. The creators of this movie did a great job and I really enjoyed this movie. This movie may not be for everyone, but if you have an open mind, I think you will love it.
