From the sight of a NASCAR maniac like me, the movie is interesting. You can see many race cars since 1983. Even in difficult situations, the racing scenes are not so realistic. But I must admit that I did not see any race before 1995, because before that time, they did not show any NASCAR race in Germany) <br /> <br /> from the point of view of a Burt Reynolds fan like Basically, the movie is what we usually see of Reynolds in the 80s: Burt at the wheel of a fast car, like in his Bandit Movies. <br /> <br /> If you like NASCAR and Burt Reynolds, this movie is one I must see. If you only love one of these 2 things, I also recommend that you look at it. If you do not like NASCAR or Burt Reynolds, you should still give it a try, but remember, this movie was a long way from winning an Oscar Oscar. <br /> <br /> It's the typical mood of the 80's. If you like movies like Cannonball Movies and Police Academy, you will like it too.
