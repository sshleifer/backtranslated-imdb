Having enlightened the world of comedies with "Father Ted", the next creation of Arthur Matthews and Graham Linehan was a forgotten gem for the BBC called "Hippies". Although created by the couple, the six scripts were written only by Arthur Matthews. <br /> <br /> Set in London in 1969, Ray Purbs, a hippy, is the editor of an anarchist magazine. His friends are his roommate, the very relaxed and cannabis smoking Alex, his 'girlfriend' is the feminist Jill and the not at all brilliant Hugo. <br /> <br /> Simon Pegg was excellent as Ray, but he's excellent at everything he is. This comedy had the feeling that it was 'Citizen Smith'. Ray looked a lot like Wolfie Smith, trying to beat society, but failing miserably. At last, this comedy will be released on DVD in March, I can not wait to buy it. As it was in 1999 and has still been repeated on terrestrial television, my memories are not very good comedy, but I remember two very clear episodes, the first was the first 'Protesting Hippies' that I think was a great start - where Ray is going to protest against the sandpaper and the other episode was 'Hippy Dippy Hippies', which I think was episode 4, once again a clear memory of the Police. Unfortunately, the comedy received a negative reaction from the viewers (I can not think why). The BBC ordered another series, but Arthur Matthews decided not to do so due to the negative reaction. Oh, well, I can not wait for the DVD. <br /> <br /> Best episode: Hippy Dippy Hippies - Series 1 episode 4.
