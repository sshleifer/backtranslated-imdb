First love is a desperately difficult subject to achieve convincingly in the cinema: the general passion involved usually ends up as a pale imitation or, worse, a bit ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Lifshitz manages to avoid all the pitfalls and offers a moving, sexy and deeply absorbing story of love, disaster and possible redemption, while tangentially touching some of the deepest themes of human existence. <br /> <br /> The central story is from Mathieu, 18, a loner. Introverted child who knows Cédric, stronger, more extroverted but just as lonely, while on vacation with his family. As the summer heats up, they fall in love and, when the holidays are over, they decide to live together. A year later, the relationship ends in a catastrophe: Cédric deceives Mathieu, who, disturbed, tries to take his own life. Survive and, to recover the perspective of his life, returns to the coastal city where they met, this time wrapped in the cold of winter. <br /> <br /> If the story is told in this way, never have the impact it has: much of it is implicit, everything happens in a non-sequential way. <br /> <br /> The intricate narrative is essential to obtain a deeper feeling of the passions experienced, through the use of counterpoint and temporal perspective. Fortunately, the three timelines used (the summer of love, the post-suicide psychiatric hospital and the winter of reconstruction) are color-coded: warm yellows and oranges for the summer, an almost terrifying blue for hospital scenes and Warming up the browns and the blues for the winter beach. <br /> <br /> However, the two main actors had excellent performances, although it is a pleasure to see Stéphane Rideau (Cédric) accustomed to his maximum capacity (I am more used to seeing him underwater). (In the rather loose dramas of Gael Morel), Jérémie Elkaim (Mathieu) must be singled out for a special mention: his loneliness can be felt, then his passion almost incredulous, and then his character falls apart behind a wall of aphasia. The beautifully crafted gestures convey much more than dialogue could do. <br /> <br /> The topics discussed are almost classic in French cinema: our difficulty in really understanding what another is feeling; our difficulty in communicating fully; The shifting sands of meaning? The title of the film "Presque rien" (Almost nothing) points to all of these and, in fact, to one of the key scenes in the film: in trying to understand why Mathieu tried to commit suicide, a psychiatrist asks Cédric if any I had cheated him once. at?? "Non ?? enfin, oui ?? une fois, mais ce n'était rien" (No, well, yes, once, but it was nothing). Cédric still loves Mathieu? took him to the hospital during the suicide attempt (none of which we see) and tries to contact him desperately once he leaves? but I can not understand that he has lost it forever, because something that did not seem at all to him (a matter without meaning) is everything for Mathieu. <br /> <br /> Although the film is darker than the unfortunate poster by Pierre et Gilles suggests, it is not hopeless: we can see Cédric's slow and painful attempts to get back in touch with life, first through a cat that adopts, then through work in a local bar and finally in contact with Pierre, which may be his next love. . But here the story ends: a teenage passion, more within the year, perhaps another beginning. So, what was it? Almost nothing? Certainly not when you are living it ??
