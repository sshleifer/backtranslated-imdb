New York, 2022: the Greenhouse effect disappeared from the oceans, unemployment and shortages of water, energy and food ... and the population of New York has exceeded 40 million. This is a little gem of an image, especially because a future with exhausted resources is a reality for the citizens of the 21st century. <br /> <br /> The low-budget opening titles of this film are great: set with music, a sequence of low-tech "slides" composed entirely of archive images from the beginning of the photo until 1973, shows a virgin American pastoral that becomes a polluted hell full of people in less than 2 minutes. Succinct and unmistakable, it is truly memorable. Budgetary constraints are also behind unimaginative cinematography and other restrictions, at odds with the brilliant premise of the story. The sequences of the police station are like an episode of a television detective program of the 70s, and the other interior sets seem, at best, basic. The budget probably all kept trying to "futurize" the Chelsea West department of the Soylent Executive with cutting-edge items, which means that the other disguises are superficial, some established takes are strangely populated and the daytime outsides seemingly leak to through a smoke filter. <br /> <br /> The memorable scene in which Sol and Thorn (Charlton Heston) share a rare and expensive food meal that perfectly sums up their society: they enjoy bourbon, lettuce, celery, tomato, apple and real meat. , and we really perceive his appreciation for the lips of another person's rich privileges. <br /> <br /> The scene of Robinson's death, in which his character is voluntarily euthanized in a place called "Home", shows him immersed in images of the once beautiful flora and fauna of the world, just as the I remember, it contrasts beautifully with Thorn's jaundice when he realizes that the future has been ruined, among other horrors. <br /> <br /> This is a smart movie, and its central message is as relevant today as it was in the early 70s. Yes, I know we are not yet consuming the dead, but with our resource-consuming longevity, the growing poverty gap, corporate global capitalism and the uncontrolled habitat destruction that leads to climate change, the long-term prediction of ' Soylent Green 'may happen.
