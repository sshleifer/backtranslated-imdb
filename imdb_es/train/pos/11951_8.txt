Something happens to Sondra Pransky when she enters a magician's box on the stage of a London theater. Little does Sondra know that the spirit of the recently deceased journalist Joe Strombel materializes to ask him to investigate the man someone has told him, on his journey to another dimension, is the infamous Tarot assassin who has been in a crime attack in London. The only problem is that the accused man is, for all appearances, a respectable man of the upper class. <br /> <br /> When Sondra tells his experience to the Great Splendini, also known as Sid Waterman, the magician is stunned, but decides to go along. The two would be, for example, an invitation to a club where Peter Lyman goes swimming. Sondra, who pretends that she is drowning, draws attention to this piece, which wants to see more of her. <br /> <br /> It goes without saying that the two will enter all sorts of fun situations to the mystery. It is revealed at the end of the movie. Little do you believe the true Tarot killer can deceive a determined Sondra who proves to be more resourceful than he gave credit. <br /> <br /> The result is a perfect summer movie with lots of laughs that is just what you need to get out of the heat at a perfect moment in a cool theater. Woody Allen has done it better and, nevertheless, this sunny comedy will vindicate him for his past failures. In "Scoop", Mr. Allen has departed from the romantic leader touching his magnificent protagonist. The gesticulation of your brand is something that this funny man will never get rid of, since it seems to be his brand. The movie has some funny phrases that will go over the heads of the audience and that might not be paying attention. <br /> <br /> Scarlett Johansson, the beautiful star of "Scoop", seems to be the perfect complement for Woody Allen She plays the role straight while Mr. Allen makes his shtick, a perfect combination. Both are excellent in their jokes throughout the film. Mrs. Johansson is a spectacular beauty in her red bathing suit, although she has been dressed in the most disheveled clothes with most of the costumes she wears on the screen. Hugh Jackman is seen as Peter Lyman, a sophisticated man from the city with the right pedigree. He makes a good appearance in the film as the man who persecutes Mrs. Johansson. Ian McShane plays the dead Fleet Street journalist on his way to eternity. <br /> <br /> "Scoop" is a light film for the hot and humid summer thanks to Woody Allen.
