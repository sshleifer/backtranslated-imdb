"Once in the life" is a very good movie. However, it is not good for everyone, due to the extensive use of vulgar language and the violence of some situations. The film manages to represent in an anecdotal and credible way the "life" in the neighborhoods of New York where drug problems are important. This representation is used in turn as a decoration for a more reflective and suspenseful drama supported by powerful dialogues (however, I found it hard to understand some of them because English is not my mother tongue). There is a bit of exaggeration at times, but I think it fits quite well with the general orientation that Fishburne gave to the film, which gives more importance to reflection than to a good style exercise, especially in time management. / action. The characters, although they are not simple, are easy to relate and the actors do a good job to impersonate them. By the way, I really liked the soundtrack (B. Marsalis). If you're not too rude, you should enjoy watching that movie once, twice, three times. I qualified the movie 9/10.
