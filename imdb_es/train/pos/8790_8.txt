Hilarious movie I saw this film at the Mardi Gras Film Festival of Sydney Gay and Lesbian in 2002, and I laughed from beginning to end. The performance was subtle but very funny. I'm not completely sure of the influence of "The Real World", we do not get it here, but the film remains without understanding that show. Heather B steals all the scenes in which it appears, especially when it acts with its red co-star rarely talkative. Highly recommended I would love to see this release on Video / DVD in the future.
