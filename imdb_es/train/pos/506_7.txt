A strong driver, this two-hour episode does an excellent job of setting up the characters and the background for "Enterprise," the "prequel" of the original "Star Trek" series. He stumbles a few times with the convention and the clich√© of "Trek": it seems that candy-colored space strippers never go out of style, and I can already foresee the mocking references to T'pol as "Siete de Vulcano", but the whole It seems strong, the characters are well drawn and you can already see signs that this particular team will have to have more resources, in different ways, than those in the previous series (later?). Scott Bakula takes the right note as a captain with the audacity and audacity of Kirk, but without his presumption and arrogance, and I look forward to the ways in which the series will feature the engineer, the weapons master and the communications officer (now not just a glorified telephone operator). !) As support players. The writers seem to have realized the big mistake that was made in "Star Trek: The Next Generation", "Deep Space 9" and "Voyager": instead of starting with a large set and giving the characters a short answer, it starts with a smaller character core to which a little more variety can be added later, which I hope will happen, because after about half a dozen episodes, more variety will be needed.
