When I saw the movie, I was very surprised to see what the sixties were about. I know I may be wrong about some things, but it seemed that the 60s really had an effect on the people of the time. Some people said that they would like to go back to the 60s. From what I saw, I would say yes for the emotion and not for the result. But that's my opinion.
