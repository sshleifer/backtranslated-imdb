['I went to see Ashura as the Fantasia Kickoff Festival 2005. Man, that was a good kick. The director was supposed to be in Montreal for the premiere in Canada, but due to health reasons, he is still in Japan ... oh sir, I hope he improves and makes many other films. <br /><br /> The plot is quite simple, but something original ... the demons roam around Edo in Japan and the Swordsmen called &quot;Demon Guardians&quot; are killing them and they fear the rebirth of Ashura, the goddess of the sleeping demon who supposedly is very disgusting. <br /><br /> He takes us to Izumo ... some kind of elite swordsman called &quot;Demon Slayer&quot; and his friend Jaku, who is the typical jealous imbecile ... <br /><br /> Does it look boring? Well now it thickens ... <br /><br /> Izumo retired from killing demons since he killed a child in the &quot;impression&quot; that he was the devil, he never knew, but he did kill her. So Izumo continued with his life and was recycled in the Kabuki theater. In a boat on a nice night, Izumo sees a girl hidden on a bridge and changes her life and returns to kill the demons ... for the good cause, the cause of love ... and damn ... the Guy knows how to handle a sword and pull an entertaining massacre. <br /><br /> Izumo takes the film as far as the game is concerned ... he is the total package ... he knows how to fight (hell, he does), he&#39;s witty, he&#39;s smart and he has that value. You never have to shout: &quot;NO IZUMO, IT&#39;S A TRAP&quot; The guy already knows, he has that common sense. He is really the perfect hero. <br /><br /> As for cinematography, aesthetics is quite interesting. It is, by far, the movie that most resembles a manga. It is full of special effects and nothing, at all costs will prevent this movie from looking realistic ... it is quite surprising. Many colors and an &quot;unreal&quot; photograph, apart from that ... it&#39;s quite simple ... but as I said, the main character is the bearer of the movie You have to see it, a tale of masterful hands']
