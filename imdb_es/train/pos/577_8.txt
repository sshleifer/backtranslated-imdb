This is one of the most beautiful movies I've seen in my life. The footage is extraordinary, fascinating at times. He also received an Oscar for the best photography, and deservedly. I have many movies in my movie collection and several more that I've seen, besides them, and not many of them are as beautiful or as beautiful as this one. <br /> <br /> It's unique and, in general, it's great. movie. The cast is excellent and does a great job of portraying their characters. We follow their destiny with devotion and we bond emotionally with them. Along the way, we also learn things about ourselves and our lives. I think a lot about this film because of what it represents and how it is presented. I recommend it
