I was hooked on this, since apparently ABC has licensed this program for Pearl TV in Hong Kong. I was surprised, as it was a break from listening to something Chinese. But I started to get carried away, since the cast and lines of the story are just reflective enough and New York. Nothing too incredible, although I think it is very stereotyped to write to Damien as a potential black man with a sheet. That has been the most disappointing aspect. The rest is excellent and it saddens me to know in IMDb that I can not wait to see season 2 when I return to the USA. UU I am as disappointed as the other commentators that this showed a lot of promise, quality and taste. But just like the shows that show that the characters are approaching, it is likely to be harder for people to see if they start seeing several episodes. What apparently is a bit late for the anxious networks.
