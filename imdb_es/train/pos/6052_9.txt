Highly recommended! <br /> <br /> A well-written and fun film that will appeal to all who have a sense of humor. Try it, it's good to see an independent British film more than defend against the big established studios! Definitely worth adding to any movie collection. There are scenes in this film that I'm sure many people can relate to. You will laugh at the pranks of laughter and enjoy the great soundtrack. I especially enjoyed the Orb version of Vietnam Cliff and the Freebird version of the Tower of London. <br /> <br /> Give it a chance ............ you will not be disappointed.
