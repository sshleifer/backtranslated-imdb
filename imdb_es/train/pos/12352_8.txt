My boyfriend and I really enjoyed this movie. The viewer is dragged from modern life to ancient Japan, while at the same time being exposed to very current issues. The characters are realistic and detailed; It has an unpredictable ending and history, which is very refreshing. The story is made up of mini-plots within the lives of several geishas who live together in a poor district of the city. I recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in a realistic romance or a life in ancient Japan. <br /> <br />
