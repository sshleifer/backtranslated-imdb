Kolchak is pure entertainment. Great stories and a great cast and nothing more to weigh. Darren McGavin offers an energetic performance that attracts the audience along with him. Simon Oakland, Jack Grinnage and Ruth McDevitt give McGavin the kind of solid support that most major actors can only dream of having. Some excellent guest stars add color and excitement to the individual episodes: Erik Estrada in Legacy of Terror, Phil Silvers in Horror in the Heights, Antonio Fargas in The Zombie. It's easy to see how a childhood that spent watching Kolchak led Chris Carter to create The X Files. Darren - RIP. Simon - RIP. Ruth - RIP.
