I see this movie all the time. I've seen it with the family from 3 to 87 years old, and everyone in between; Everyone loved it. It really shows the real scenes a dog has, and the love and loyalty you get from a pet. Simply beautiful. <br /> <br /> It's great for those who love comedy movies, tears movies, or even just pets. <br /> <br /> The music is wonderful, the animals spectacular, the scenes really thought, and the characters perfect. What I liked about the characters are the real and well mixed personalities: Shadow (the oldest, a Golden Retriever) He is the wise, full of the wisdom and mentality of any dog, Chance (the American Bulldog puppy) is basically a puppy with an ingenious side, the comic character; And Sassy (Hymilayan's cat) She is the real cat that shows what a real cat will do for its owner, the real female.
