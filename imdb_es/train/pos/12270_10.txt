I searched for this movie for years, apparently not available here in the United States, so I bought a copy of Ebay. <br /> <br /> Four young hunters and three of their girlfriends venture into the forest in search of a bear that apparently has killed several campers. What they find is a former Vietnam veteran who went crazy (kills some of his victims using a glove with long metal nails in the style of Freddy Krueger). As soon as the night falls, one of the girls goes out for a walk after a brief discussion with her boyfriend, they kill her. After one of the groups finds its body, all hide in its tents waiting for the light of day. Once the sun rises, everyone tries to leave, but they are victims one by one. <br /> <br /> Seven bodies, not much blood, but a couple of good murders, especially the girls. deaths The boys are killed in a somewhat bloodless way (exploded in a car, shot to death, with a knife in the head). <br /> <br /> In general, INFERNAL TRAP is a good slasher movie from the late 80's. Nothing new, just well acted, fast and some pretty ladies. 10 out of 10
