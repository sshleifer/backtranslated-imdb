The best martial arts movie ever made. This movie is better than anything Bruce Lee has done. A classic with a brutal climax and totally entertaining. Jackie Chan is the king of martial arts movies and the true king of kung fu. It is a great pity that, while Bruce Lee had been so overrated, it took Jackie Chan an eternity to become popular in Europe and America. Jackie governs !!!!
