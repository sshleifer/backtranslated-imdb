This film illustrates the worst part of the surviving war, the memories. For many soldiers, men and women alike, returning home can be the beginning of real problems. I remember my father and his brothers who returned from the Second World War. For one of my uncles, the war was never over. He survived the invasion of D-Day, something like the first 20 minutes of Saving Private Ryan. For him memories not only delayed but tortured him. He became an alcoholic just like several of my cousins, his children. It advances 60 years and places the soldiers in a different war, in a different country, the result is the same. When I saw this at KC FilmFest, they reminded me that there are some things about the war that never change. Young, idealistic men and women are not saved from the emotional torment of what happened in Iraq, and especially if they are against the war, they will be more compassionate to soldiers who try to do what they believe or have said is right. <br /> <br /> The slogan of the Vietnam War movie, Platoon, says it all. "The first casualty of the war is innocence."
