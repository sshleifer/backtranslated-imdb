['Thomas Ince always had the ability to give life to simple and homemade stories with fullness and elegance. &quot;The Italian&quot; is such a movie. The solid performance, in particular by George Beban, father of the silent child actor George Beban, Jr., and the wonderful scenarios convey a realistic feeling of the beginnings of immigrants in New York. These give this 1915 film an authenticity that is unusual in the characteristics of this vintage. <br /><br /> The film begins with the modern day and a man (George Beban in modern clothes) reading a story about an Italian immigrant, and then we make the transition to the story with George interpreting the immigrant. He raises enough money to bring his girlfriend from Italy to America, marries her and has a son with her. But times are difficult and the family struggles to survive. I found myself wondering why the mother did not breastfeed her son and avoided the complications with the dirty formula, but well, even the old Dream Factory was promoting the correct political behavior of women in 1915! <br /><br /> The best scene in the picture is when Beban has the opportunity to get revenge on a crime boss who, without realizing it, put him in jail, and at the last moment decides not to act as he had planned. Very neat I loved the curtain effect, it was great. Wonderful use of lighting in this movie. <br /><br /> I give &quot;El Italiano&quot; an 8 out of 10.']
