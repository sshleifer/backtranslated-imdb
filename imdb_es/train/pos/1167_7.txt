Alain Delon visits a fast and sure revenge against the merciless family of criminals who hired him as a hit man in Duccio Tessari's thriller "Big Guns" after they accidentally murdered his wife and son. Tessari and the screenwriters Roberto Gandus, Ugo Liberatore of "A Minute to Pray, A Second to Die", and Franco Verucci of "Ring of Death" take this action on a career gunman for the mafia until the end. In fact, "Big Guns" is quite predictable, but still qualifies as a solid entertainment with many wild and often sudden murders. Alain Delon of "El ahijado" is quite laconic, since he methodically distributes death to the bosses of the mafia families who refused to let him retire in order to enjoy life with his son and daughter. Richard Conte, from "The Godfather", plays a Sicilian crime boss who wants to bury the ax with the character of Delon, but the rest of his hard associates want the hit man. Like most crime thrillers in the sixties and seventies, "Big Guns" adheres to the cinematic morality that crime does not pay. Interestingly, the only man who has nothing to do with the murder of the wife and son of the hero survives, while another betrays the hero with extreme prejudice. Tessari does not lose a second in this 90-minute shooting game. Aside from the fact that the mother and the son died in a car bomb destined to the father, the worse that happens happens in a patio of rescue of cars when a partner of the hero is crushed in a discarded car. Apparently, "Big Guns" is a pretty bloodless exit, but it has a high number of bodies for a melodrama of 1973 mobsters. Only at the last moment our protagonist lowers his guard and the intact morality of an eye for an eye remains intact. Tessari organizes a couple of decent car chases and the death of a Don on a train traveling through a train tunnel is as bloody as this violent thread gets. The photography and the compositions are excellent.
