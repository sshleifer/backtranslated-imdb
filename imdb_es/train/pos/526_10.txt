If someone ever asks if the cinema is an art form, it can do something worse than pointing it out in this movie. <br /> <br /> In a few words, it is the perfect combination of history, script, actors and cinematography committed to celluloid. <br /> <br /> The story of a convicted bomber pilot whom his celestial driver misses in the English fog during World War II, and his subsequent contact with the celestial authorities (or is in his head) is played with the David Niven and Kim Hunter's touch is incredibly moving, especially in the opening scenes when the condemned pilot (Niven) describes his difficult situation for the terrestrial radio operator (Hunter). <br /> <br /> The meaning of another life in the world is enhanced by the photography of Jack Cardiff and the incredible production designs. <br /> <br /> The supreme touches extend to the shots of the sky that appear in black and white and the terrestrial scenes presented in Technicolor; This is even mentioned by the heavenly director (a fantastic Marius Goring). <br /> <br /> Not just a high point in British cinema, but a high point in the cinema, period.
