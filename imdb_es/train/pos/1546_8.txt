I saw this movie once on or near its release, 36 years ago (1969). Although now I can only remember parts of him, I want to see him again. The parts that I remember, right or wrong, include mustard gas in the trenches and Suzie Kendall as a German spy, who offers some kind of sexual favors in the back of a closed truck to get military information from him. The music was especially memorable and the excitement was stirred in the Gone With The Wind league and I would love to hear it again. There must be some commercial or copyright reason why this movie is not available. Does anyone know why? I doubt it has anything to do with lack of quality or interest.
