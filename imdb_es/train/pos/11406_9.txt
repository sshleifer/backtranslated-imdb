This very peculiar setting of Wagner's last opera definitely grew on me. When I saw it for the first time, I felt somewhat annoyed by many of the surreal images of the movies and felt that it overlapped the story too much. However, if you can tolerate a good amount of "tricks" pretty much recherch√©, I think you will find that the film manages to capture the strange atmosphere of the opera of another world, and that there are moments that are particularly important. All right. <br /> <br /> Personally, I never really understood the role of Kundry until I saw how Edith Clever played it. His performance (a synchronized mime with the lips of the singing voice of Yvonne Minton) is dazzling, from end to end, and by itself justifies the hours it takes to absorb the film. <br /> <br /> Another reason for The pleasure of this film is that it captures Robert Lloyd's spectacular performance of the crucial role of Gurnemanz, a work that Lloyd has performed in opera houses around the world. I have had the privilege of enjoying him in the role of Gurnemanz on the stage of the Metropolitan Opera several times, and the delicacy of his voice and the warmth and paternity of his interpretation of this noble character really needed to be preserved, as well as his performance in the two main monologues of the character, the scene Karfreitag and the recount of the prophecy in Act 1. <br /> <br /> The version I saw was a video tape made for America, and that's why there were subtitles that , unfortunately, It could not be eliminated. This is especially unfortunate because the translation used is very inaccurate and forces an extremely Christian interpretation in a film that is already forcing layers of interpretation in the opera. This seemed quite contrary to both the clear avoidance of Wagner's Christianity and his very deliberate attempt to "generalize" the Christian elements of history. (See the footnote with the spoiler at the end of this review). I find it almost impossible, when watching a movie with subtitles, to avoid absorbing them, and I highly recommend it, if in the DVD versions you have the ability to change the subtitles. off, you do it, and instead, if the opera is unknown to you, you read the script very carefully beforehand. <br /> <br /> The conclusion is that there is a lot in the film that I do not like, and as soon as I saw it done differently ... but it has steadily increased in my estimation over the years since I saw it for the first time, and I am attracted to enjoy it again and again. <br /> <br /> __________________________________________________________________ <br /> <br /> FOOTNOTE THAT CONTAINS A SPOILER: A good example would be the famous phrase of Kundry: "I saw him ... he ... and I laughed". This translates, in the subtitles, for reasons that escape me, like "I saw the face of the Savior". It is especially irritating for me, because throughout the booklet, Wagner refers very deliberately and carefully to this invisible character WHO NEEDS TO BE THE BIBLE Jesus as "der Heiland", that is, the German for "The Healer", a reference to the Wound of Amfortas, and for all wounds and evils and the need for healing.
