First let's clarify some things: zombies do not exist, so the filmmaker can have them WALK, RUN, hell even if he FLIES if he wants. That's what makes this original Zombie movie so good. Everything they did was so original. I hate when the filmmakers do everything like Romero or when the fans expect everything like Romero. Some idiots think that zombies should only growl like a typical Romero movie, once again zombies do not exist, so a filmmaker can make zombies whistle if he wants to. The zombies in this movie all look very good, but OBVIOUSLY they are not rotting corpses, since JUSTOS died! However, they are quite disorganized and full of faces and blood. One of the most brilliant scenes was a half-eaten cat. It seemed so damn real that my daughter cried when she saw it. This film had very good reviews in Fangoria and Rue Morgue, so I wanted to go see it. I'm glad I listened. They are always right when it comes to the likes of true horror fans. 10 out of 10! Go rent it!
