['I never heard of the book, nor do I care to read it, but the movie probably sees it many times. <br /><br /> This movie is unforgettable, perhaps with the richest images I&#39;ve seen in a movie. It was like I was looking at paintings many times, which I think was the idea. <br /><br /> Fantastic film, history, actors and cinematography. Full of deep emotions from all angles. Although I do not like romantic movies very much, I loved this and I was deeply moved by Winona Ryder&#39;s plea to her father towards the end. <br /><br /> Mr. Irons deserved a reward for his performance and Close was never better. <br /><br />']
