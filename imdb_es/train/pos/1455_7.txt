Mardi Gras: Made in China is an excellent film that shows how two cultures have much in common, but they are not even aware of the influence that each society has on the other. David Redmon opens his eyes and lets you see how Chinese workers manufacture accounts that cost little or nothing and are sold in the United States for up to $ 20. When Redmon asks Americans about where these accounts come from, they had no idea and seemed stupid. When he told them that they were made in China for nothing, with a horrible salary and unacceptable working conditions, Americans seemed sad, hurt and a little sorry, but they really did not seem to stop buying the accounts after discovering the truth. . When Redmon questioned workers in China, they did not know that Americans were wearing them around their necks and paying too much for these accounts. The workers laughed at the purpose behind the accounts and could not believe it. This movie is a great movie that gives us something to think about in other countries besides ours. <br /> <br /> M.
