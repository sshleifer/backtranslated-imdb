The absolute sum of the work of that cunning Dane Douglas Sirk (born Detlef Sierck), Written on the Wind, draws attention from all corners. From its justly famous opening sequence, with the leaves blowing in the baronial hall of a Texas mansion and the wind dragging the pages of the calendar in a flashback, the film compresses in its 99 minutes all the family intrigue that was to feed such a thing later, imitations of small screens such as Dallas, Dynasty and Falcon Crest throughout their careers for years. <br /> <br /> The combination of wealth and dysfunction is an issue that Americans, in our dollar-based society, find irresistible. Brother and Sister Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone are the spoiled and troublesome heirs of Hadly's oil fortune; the childhood actress Rock Hudson and the new girlfriend Lauren Bacall are the strange cords that try to keep the lid on the cauldron. (It has been rumored that the story was based on the marriage of Libby Holmann with Reynolds tobacco money). As always, the misfits have the whole stage to chew and the best lines to spit (Malone, in his performance as Oscar Boozing Nymphomaniac with a Jones for Hudson, gets to detonate a whole fireworks display). Hudson, although he is good, can not compete with all these exaggerated emotions; Bacall begins strong but becomes recessive, a mere convenience of the plot. No matter; With a succession of flamboyant-toned shots, Sirk offers an objective lesson on how to produce an exaggerated melodrama in the exuberant consumer paradise of the United States in the late 1950s. Nobody did better.
