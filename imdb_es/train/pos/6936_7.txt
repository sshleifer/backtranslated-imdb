Winchester 73 receives credit from many critics for recovering the western after World War II. Director Anthony Mann must get a lot of credit for his excellent management. Jimmy Stewart does an excellent job, but I think Stephen McNalley and John McIntire steal the film with their portrayal of two bad guys involved in a high-level poker game with the treasured Winchester 73 going to the winner. This is a good script with several stories at the same time. Find the first appearance of Rock Hudson as Young Bull. Thank God, in a few years, we would begin to let the Indians appear in Western movies. The film is in black and white and was filmed in Tucson, Arizona. I would not put Winchester 73 in the Diligence, High Noon or Shane category, but get a higher than average recommendation from me. <br /> <br />.
