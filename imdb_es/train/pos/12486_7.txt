Well, this movie is really difficult. To be honest with you, this movie does not contain such a fascinating story, it never makes you want to know how it will end ... but I'll tell you something now ... I never did. I was so tense and I jumped before in my life! This film sure delivers jumps and excitement! To be fair, I saw it almost at midnight, so I had a little sleep anyway, so maybe that explains why I was nervous ... or maybe because this movie is delivered in that aspect! Basically it is a couple who loses their child in a tragic event. They decided to move and rent a cabin looking for things in the mountains ... everything looks calm and peaceful until they receive their first visitors (I think it's the main character's sister, and she brings her husband with her) ... during the night, the husband hears noises ... he checks it, and that's when things start to go really bad ... they do not stay for another day and tell the couple that they should leave as soon as possible because something is not right ... to shorten a long story ... finally, they discover what has happened in that house in recent years and decide that it is necessary to take care of it. <br /> <br /> It's not a Hollywood blockbuster, nore has a big budget, but please do not let it discourage you. It is creepy, tense and very very nervous. Just give it a try :)
