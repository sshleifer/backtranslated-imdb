['I do not have much to add to my summary, this film is up to Top Gun as one of the funniest films ever made without trying to be. For my part, I do not think you should take it seriously when you look at it, as it is very nice. <br /><br /> I do not think Christopher Walken&#39;s reputation diminishes, since his reputation was in decline anyway. It cost Pulp Fiction to awaken him from the dream he had been in. As for Michael Ironside, he has been in some of the great funny things while not trying to be a serious movie. Total Recall, Top Gun. What I think is amazing is the budget that this movie had. The scenes, the actors, the explosions, etc. They are quite surprising, so obviously someone liked it a lot and was willing to risk a lot of money. Whoever it is, I like them because I love this movie. <br /><br /> If someone reads this for information about McBain (and I seriously doubt there are too many), just know it&#39;s a hilarious movie and you should see yourself with a smile on your face!']
