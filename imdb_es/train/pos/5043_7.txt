A very promising directorial debut for Bill Paxton. A very obscure thriller / who did it really recommended by Stephen King. This is a strong and well-conceived tale of terror about a devout, but insane man in Thurman, Texas, who begins a wave of assassinations after receiving orders from God to eliminate the demons that try to control humanity. A couple of twists in the plot and a mysterious ending make your money worth it. Most of the violence is not really seen, but it is enough to bend your stomach. <br /> <br /> Director Paxton plays the twisted man who is known as the Assassin of the Hand of God. Matthew McConaughey is just as impressive as the eldest son of the insane man who ends up telling this story to a Dallas FBI agent (Powers Boothe). Boothe, as always, is solid and impeccable. White starter of suspense! Highly recommended
