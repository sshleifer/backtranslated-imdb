"Moonstruck" is one of the best movies in history. I own that movie on DVD! The film is about a widow from New York (Cher) who falls in love with the angry brother of her boyfriend (Danny Aiello) (Nicholas Cage) who works at a bakery. I'm glad Cher won an Oscar for that movie. Nicholas Cage and Danny Aiello are great too. The direction of Norman Jewison (who directed "Fiddler On The Roof") is fantastic. "Moonstruck" is an excellent movie for everyone to see and laugh. A must see! <br /> <br /> 10/10 stars!
