Buddy is an entertaining family movie set in a time when "humanizing" animals, and making them adorable was an accepted way to get people interested in them. <br /> <br /> Based on a true story, Buddy shows the great love that the main characters have for animals and each other, and that they will do anything for others. <br /> <br /> Although it is not a perfect movie, the animated gorilla is quite realistic most of the time and the chaos that occurs inside the home is usually fun for children. <br /> <br /> This movie loses the opportunity to address the mistake of bringing wild animals to the home as pets, but it shows the difficulties. <br /> <Br /> A recommended film that was the first for Jim Henson Productions.
