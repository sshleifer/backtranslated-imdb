This is a pretty good movie ... yes, some parts are boring and exceptionally convenient, and the film does not really justify the cast of big stars (AB, SD, Tanuja). However, the actor that really impressed me was Kay Kay Menon (not to be confused with the singer KK). In the scene where he meets Amitabh's character for the first time, I thought that a man who can only look at AB, keep looking and not say a word and still look strong, is definitely a good actor. In fact, he proved to be worthy again in Sarkar, together with AB for the second time. This guy should get more roles, he's brilliant. <br /> <br /> If you have read any of the other reviews here on IMDb, you already know the plot, and I agree that the entry of Akshaye Khanna in Pakistan was a bit too easy and the small angle of The love he shared with "her face" was completely unnecessary. But he's a pretty good actor (as seen in DCH), Sunjay Dutt is great to watch, always. and AB ... what can I say? I do not know if I'm your biggest fan in the world, but I know I can definitely compete for the place. <br /> <br /> An interesting watch, considering it's Bollywood, although a bit inspired by Hollywood oldies. like "The Great Escape" and "Bridge on the River Kwai".
