['I caught this movie on the Sundance cable channel one afternoon. You could say that &quot;Who Loves the Sun&quot; is a perfect pastime for a story, why never. You have the chance to hang out with the trio: Lukas Haas is Will (returning after abruptly leaving everyone years ago), Molly Parker is Maggie (we learn that she is part of the Bloom family), and Adam Scott is Daniel (Is friend or friend? Enemy or boyfriend), in the picturesque Lake Falcon, Manitoba, Canada, embodied in graphic compositions juxtaposed in vivid colors of summer against the light of the sun and shadows. And supporting the trio there are two other members of the family in the revealing mix: Wendy Crewson is mom Mary Bloom and RH Thomson is dad Arthur Bloom. Screenwriter and director Matt Bissonnette has presented an ingenious display of the story line and its various tentacle links. Do not worry, Haas may have an &quot;apathetic&quot; face, but humor will come when Parker and Scott enter the circle of reunited friends, the ironic smiles Breaking and knowing the excitement shake. The dialogues can be concise or even null, but we would get the taste of what is cooking, baffled or amazed. <br /><br /> Yes, &quot;Who Loves the Sun&quot; can very well be categorized as a dormant gem. The chemistry between the five principles guarantees gels and &quot;combuses&quot;, giving an energy overall performance. After all, everything is in the family, and the film is not taken too seriously. <br /><br /> It seems that the official site is still available in &quot;wholovesthesun.com&quot; and there is information in the soundtrack of Mac McCaughan (Portastatic with guitar melodies and strings) where sheet music extracts are played, and behind the scenes production notes, interview with the writer-producer writer Bissonnette about how the film and the concept came about, the casting and more. I have always appreciated Molly Parker since her flamboyant but fascinating performance in Lynne Stopkewich&#39;s &#39;Kissed&#39; in 1996, and she is married to Bissonnette, who &quot;wrote Maggie&#39;s part for Molly&quot;.']
