The movie is hugely enjoyable with a great cast and an excellent address by James Eves. The film is entertaining with a very charismatic performance by Stephanie Beecham and all are perfectly chosen. James Eves has a keen eye for the casting and is directed like a driver who knows exactly when to increase the action, fall and then reach a climax. He does it with an element of humor, a lot of twists, emotions and blood. This is a comeback of the old vampire movie, with a lot of blood, blood and screams. The film works at a great speed and the characters take you on a fantastic adventure, but what makes it work is that the film does not take itself too seriously with much action on the cheek. Cool!
