I saw this movie at the 18th Haifa Film Festival, and it's one of the best I've seen this year. See it on a big screen (and I mean GRANDE, it's not one of those TV screens that has most of the cinemas) with an excellent sound system that always improves the cinematic experience, since the movie takes over your eyes and ears and introduces you to the story. The picture. <br /> <br /> The film presents a set of characters, which are slightly interconnected. Their stories intersect at certain points, and the multiplicity of stories reminds me a lot of the great Robert Altman and his exquisite films. But the true hero of the film is obviously the city of Madrid, which provides the backdrop for the entire film. It houses the characters, contains the sidewalks and paths in which they walk and establishes the background atmosphere for all the events, all in beautifully filmed scenes. <br /> <br /> The film returns again and again to certain themes (shoes, for example), and in essence, Salazar makes his metaphors more and more comprehensible to the viewer as the film progresses. It combines the views of the city with the shots of the characters and elegantly combines the feeling of the scene with the background. A set of talented actors helps him to portray a wide variety of characters. An excellent example is the scene in which Juaquin takes Anita across the street for the first time. It may not work on a small screen, but it gave me goosebumps easily on a large screen. <br /> <br /> The message of the film is very positive and, consequently, the film is light and funny at times. The music throughout the film is usually pop, with some instrumental pieces (I hope to put my hand on the soundtrack some day, although I seriously doubt that it does). <br /> <br /> All together, I came out of this movie with a sensational feeling, and it does not impress me easily (you'll have to trust my word). For this and more I give this movie a solid 8/10.
