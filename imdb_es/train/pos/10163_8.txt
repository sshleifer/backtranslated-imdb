This had a good story ... it had a good rhythm and all the characters developed well. <br /> <br /> I've seen a lot of movies in the last two weeks and this had to be the best I've seen in the two weeks. <br /> <br /> However, Jason Bigg's character was the best. <br /> <br /> Although it was small, it was cleverly designed from the start. <Br /> <br /> This can be a romantic comedy and I do not like it anymore, but the writing, the direction, the interpretation, the sound, the design in general in all its capacity were just thought quite good. <br /> <br /> This movie got a pretty high rating of all the movies I've seen lately, and the rest was a big budget or better publicity. <br /> <br /> Good work in writing.
