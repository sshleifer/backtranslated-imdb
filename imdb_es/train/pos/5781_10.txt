"Most of us, at least, inhabit two worlds, the real world where we are at the mercy of circumstances and the inner world, the unconscious, a safe place where we can escape ..." With those words, Mr. Gone introduces into the world of "The Maxx", a fascinating world where fantasy and reality combine. Inspired by the comics of Sam Kieth, "The Maxx" is very faithful to the material in which it was inspired, not only in the story but also in the graphic style, which looks like the pages of the comic, giving this show an Appearance Surreal and unique. But also, the story is interesting and entertaining. At one time it might become too weird, but when you enter it, it is difficult to get out of it. The story and the characters are wonderfully developed. The music goes perfectly with the style of the show and gives it the right atmosphere. Unfortunately, like many good animated shows, this was short-lived. "The Maxx" is a must see. It is one of my favorites of all time.
