['Elia Kazan, one of the best theater directors in this country, showed that she was also at home with the cinema. With &quot;Panic in the Streets&quot;, Mr. Kazan gives us a first version of what would come later, perhaps with his masterpiece, &quot;On the Waterfront&quot;, although both films only share the configuration of the water, since they are different visions about different subjects. <br /><br /> Mr. Kazan filmed in New Orleans. The adaptation by Daniel Fuchs of the stories of Edna and Edward Anhalt that are the basis of the film, is remarkable because it takes us to places that no tourist dared to see when he visited &quot;The Big Easy&quot;. One of the great assets of this film is the magnificent black and white cinematography of Joseph MacDonald that shows the best of New Orleans. Also the music of Alfred Newman and the song of Billie Holiday give a nice touch to the performances. <br /><br /> This film could have been filmed in New York or another great city in the north because it presents us with characters that speak more like &quot;broklynese&quot; than perhaps a southern accent can be heard in that part of the country. <br /><br /> One thing becomes clear in the movie, Jack Palance, who makes his screen debut, smiles on the screen every time he sees it. It was so intense! At the same time, this tough guy shows a tender side of him when he goes to see his sick partner, who is unknown to him, who suffers from a deadly illness. Blackie, comfort this man caressing his sweaty face and running his hands through the greasy hair of the dying with abandon. Also notable was the fact that Mr. Palance and Mr. Mostel seem to have been doing their own stunts, something so refreshing because both actors make it look real. <br /><br /> The film also presents a normal side with the introduction of the Reed family at the beginning of the film. We see a family man painting furniture with his young son. Later, he and his wife discuss how they can not seem to make ends meet with their salary, something that many families have to deal with on a daily basis. Richard Widmark, playing a normal person is not as effective as when this actor plays more astute and intense people. Barbara Bel Geddes, as a wife, sounds like a suburban Connecticut woman. <br /><br /> The film is nice thanks to the direction of Mr. Kazan and the excellent cast that works in the film.']
