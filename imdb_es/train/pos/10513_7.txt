If you have any clues about the production of Jane Austen, now you will see that she repeats the same thing in each of her novels: marriage, marriage and marriage. In my opinion, all the movies made from his novels are a bit boring, but I like the Austen characters, because they all have a certain personality and typical sayings that they like to repeat, as well as Emma. What makes Emma good is Gwyneth Paltrow, she is very good in her main role. In addition, the fact that each of the characters in the film does not seem to think about anything other than how to get a good partner and get married soon makes the movie fun.
