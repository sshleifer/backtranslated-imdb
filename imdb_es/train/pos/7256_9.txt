When it premiered at the cinema, I saw how the long day died, I thought that the film gave a good point of view of the soldiers, gave a realistic description of the men at war. The story moves at a good pace, showing a group of men behind the enemy lines and trying to return to their own lines with an enemy prisoner. The characters are well developed and they are credible. <br /> <br /> David Hemmings is a good actor and plays the lead role with conviction, just like Alan Dobie (as German Helmut) I was surprised he was not able to find this movie on VHS or DVD, and I feel like it It has become the forgotten movie, which is sad, as it is superior to many other war movies that I have seen.
