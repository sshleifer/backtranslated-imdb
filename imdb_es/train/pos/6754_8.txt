The director Otto Preminger meets with his stars Laura Dana Andrews and Gene Tierney in this rough and ready to rumble in the film noir: Where The Sidewalk Ends. This film is completed with a well-written crime story with interesting characters, unexpected twists, an intelligent dialogue and a pleasing appearance to the eye with excellent camera movements and dark, gritty lighting. Dana Andrews plays Detective Mark Dixon, part mafioso and part policeman, who has the reputation of being too physically strong with criminals. After a case sees Dixon looking for suspects and answers, he gets involved much more than he wanted. <br /> <br /> Dana Andrews is great in her role: strong and nervous, Andrews' Dixon is ready to hit each and every one of them if they get on their bad side. He is the perfect black movie antihero: he is not very nice all the time, but we still support him. Gene Tierney does a solid job in his role, however much he is, being a sweet shoulder for Dixon. Maybe Tierney's role is not too important, but it certainly goes beyond what others could do with the role, leaving out all the members of the audience with his kind smile, polite shape and sparkle in his eyes. The cast of support is not so bad either: Karl Malden is the most memorable, he intervenes and offers a good supporting performance as Lieutenant Thomas. Where The Sidewalk Ends is not Laura, but it's a great movie full of great characters, stories and photos.
