This was the beginning of everything! Of course, this is not the best of the Friends, but this was the pilot of the program, let's not forget it and it's not bad. We are introduced to the gang and Central Perk, where our story begins. Even from this first episode, we received a signal of the relationship between Ross and Rachel that will occur in the next ten years, when Ross says: "I just want to get married again" and Rachel enters with a wedding dress ... probably It was not intentional as at the time the writers were looking for a relationship between Monica and Joey, but now it fits very well when looking back. Something else ... in this episode, Rachel is introduced to Chandler as if the two had never met before, but in later episodes, the so-called "flashbacks" are contradictory, since the two have met on three previous occasions. However, the point is this a good start for a great show. It is possible that this episode is not the usual Friends, as we are used to them, with the cast still without experience, but in the next episodes we see why the program came to be what it was. Keep watching, the first season is wonderful!
