Eddie Izzard is nothing less than a comedic genius, and this is Eddie at his best. His material is extremely ingenious and hilarious, and his delivery is one of the best that has been seen on stage. Instead of insulting the public's intelligence, trust him to extract the humor from the preferences of his wardrobe, Hitler, the moon landing and the British. With so many memorable laughs, one can not help but repeat some of their lines. Forever more, "Do you have a flag?" It should be considered one of the funniest lines that have been presented in a standing routine. All fanatics of the comedy of first category must see "Dress to Kill". By far the best British comedian I've ever seen, Eddie Izzard has fought for success offstage live. However, his lack of commercial success in the movies should not be an indication of how extremely talented he really is. "Dress to Kill" is a treasure, which fortunately has found its way into the domestic video, and can and should be enjoyed again and again.
