I thought that this movie was much better than most film critics give it credit. Although it has confusing parts of the plot, it does not interfere much with your understanding of the film. That said, if you're not open to more liberal political ideas, then this is probably not the movie for you. I thought all the actors in the film were outstanding. Each character has its fun moments and the audience at the Tribeca Film Festival was laughing throughout the event. I thought that the satire was a bit exaggerated in a particular area, but that was done intentionally. John Cusack is right about that, although it is set in the future, it really makes you see the present.
