Cinderella is a beautiful young woman who is treated cruelly by her wicked stepmother and stepsisters. One day, a dance will be held in honor of the prince, but Cinderella has no chance to go, because her stepmother and her stepsisters do not allow it. With the help of her fairy godmother and her animal friends, she goes to the dance, with the warning to return home before midnight. At the dance he meets the handsome Prince Charming. When the clock strikes midnight, he runs home, leaving behind one of his crystal slippers. With the help of his animal friends, his true identity is revealed. She and the prince then get married and live happily ever after. <br /> <br /> Cinderella, launched 56 years ago, was a blockbuster hit and continues to delight audiences to this day. It has a well written script. The characters are memorable. The songs, which include "A dream is a wish for your heart", "So This Is Love" and the great "Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo", help tell the story. This was my favorite movie while I was growing up, and it has not lost any of its charm. A true Disney masterpiece! Recommended. 10/10 P.S. The recent DVD release is the best way to appreciate this movie, including the illustrations, the deleted scenes, the music videos, the old radio shows and a restored copy of the movie.
