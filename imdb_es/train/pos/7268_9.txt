With everything that happens in the world we sometimes need an escape. Curly Sue is just that. It is not a complicated plot or a deep meaning; However, it is not exempt from substance. There is more than furious action or throbbing dramas. There are lovely little shows that you can watch with your children and have enough content to enjoy with your date. Try it, you may like it more than you think. The girl is really smart and cute. The "dad" and the girl go through some slapstick routines. When a jealous boyfriend intervenes, problems are prepared for Curly and the life that is known can be divided in two. Fred Thompson and Kelly Lynch play good roles as the upper crust and Alison Porter and James Belushi are an interesting fable like the duo that portrays homeless homeless people. Their worlds collide and comedy emerges.
