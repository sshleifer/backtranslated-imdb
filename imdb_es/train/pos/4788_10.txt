This is one of the best movies I've seen: it shone inside throughout the whole movie. Music and cinematography kept the spell when little happened on the screen. The slow pace was established by the travel mode (a lawn mower with a large trailer) and was maintained by the background images and sounds and the slow lives of the other characters. <br /> <br /> The story actually happened Alvin Straight died in 1996 at the age of 76 years. There was no performance; Everything was completely real, as if the actors had become characters. Sissy Spacek gave a touching performance as a somewhat disabled daughter who had suffered a lot but kept going, always wanting to do the right thing. Richard Farnsworth was chosen perfectly and became a beautiful Alvin Straight, a stubborn but loving old man who travels through Iowa to visit his brother, Lyle, who had a stroke. Alvin had learned a lot of wisdom during his life and that seemed to bring out the best in the people he had encountered along the way. <br /> <br /> The film emphasizes the importance of family for this man and, hopefully, for everyone. of us. I look forward to seeing you again, and again. Directed by David Lynch, this film demonstrates his ability as a director. Farnsworth was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor; At age 79, he was the oldest candidate to receive that award.
