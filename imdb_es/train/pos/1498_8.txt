This is a very funny and, at times, quite spooky anthology, that is a little bit scarce in the script writing department, more than compensates for the deficiency in the performance, the location work and the general exuberance. The best episodes of this are the first with Denholm Elliot playing a horror writer harassed by a character from his novel in the plays (a perfect example of how acting brought this out of the mere pedestrian); the third, with Christopher Lee as a man terrified by his own daughter and the final episode with the great deceased Jon Pertwee as a pompous horror movie star who gets more than a new role in his latest project. The dialogue between Pertwee and Ingrid Pitt is sparkling and inspired, both obviously taking the opportunity to really ruin it! Usually, Cushing is good in the weaker segment, which is certainly not helped by the fact that the wax figure of the woman with whom he is obsessed in the local wax museum is not so "beautiful" "as they tell us we believe it is! You needed someone of a shocking beauty and, instead, they gave us a woman with the jaw of a turtle. Minor problems aside from this movie and its wonderful country setting is one that you can capture when you can.
