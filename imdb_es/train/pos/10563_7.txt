Wow ... what ... a whirlwind. The decade of the 30 is a decade with many films of all types that I can imagine, especially during the first phase of talkies. There were films that are painfully static and boring, like "Dracula" with Bella Lugosi, and there were others that just do not give her a break, sometimes in a good way and sometimes not. This is one of the movies that does not stop for a minute, and is both a wonder and a pity. Lloyd Bacon, who also directed "42nd Street," must have been the king of Depression-era musicals and was probably enthusiastic about the possibilities that sound brought to the movie world, as he filled this image with him. There should not be a full minute or two without music or someone talking. He is completely crazy! I was thinking that the movie deserved a 5 (or a 6, tops) because the pace was very poor, since it was incredibly fast and, sometimes, I did not know what was happening and what to think. The characters seemed to simply run from one place to another, talking about things that did not interest me and probably nobody else. I thought I was just going to be rewarded with a little headache. I noticed that Lloyd Bacon also chose the female lead in "42nd Street", Ruby Keeler and "42nd Street" was a movie whose ending was the best part. And you know what? The same thing happened with "Footlight Parade"! The ending is absolutely incredible! It has become, without doubt, the most impressive musical I've seen in my life. The final part presents some musical numbers and those are, believe me, something that makes it worthwhile to see the rest of the movie. The numbers are impeccable! There are three big bits and the most impressive is surely the second. Suddenly, the screen was filled with a magnificent and ingenious camera work, beautiful people and simple entertainment that made me forget my little headache.
