After having read many of the other reviews of this film in the IMDb, there is a consensus among purists that this film does not look anything like the books on which it is based. On this point I can not comment, I had never read any of the adventures of the protagonists before. However, what I can say with certainty is that I am surprised that many of these reviewers should have overlooked the sense of humor; Let's be honest: this movie is very funny! <br /> <br /> All right? ... then I must admit that the film apparently is not representative of the character / s, but we are going to put this in a clear perspective? ... do the same individuals who talk about this movie also lament the fact that the classic Batman series from the 60s does not stay true to the original DC comic book character? Or maybe there is STILL the restlessness in the same people that the film version of Flash Gordon of 1980 was too far from the original series? <br /> <br /> The point is, yes, this movie is incredibly camping but that is precisely its Enchanting! <br /> <br /> The former Tarzan, Ron Ely plays the hero of the same name in this (and looks more like a passing resemblance to Gary Busey!) and is backed by a great cast of support that everyone seems to be Have a ball with their respective papers. Also look for a very brief but very welcome appearance of horror movie favorite Michael Berryman. <br /> <br /> The best scene? Too many to choose from, but check out the hilarious facial expressions adopted by the bartender when Savage and his men make the last false step of ordering coke, lemonade and milk on a formal occasion! Also the scene often pointed near the end of the film in which Savage tackles his enemy, Captain Seas, using various martial arts disciplines that are labeled on the screen! ?? Priceless! <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, the movie does not take anything seriously and is even more fun. Very fun from start to finish! (And you'll be singing the adapted theme of John Phillip Sousa for the ensuing guaranteed days!)
