I did not know what to do with this movie. I guess that's what it really is about. I have never seen a movie like that before and I doubt that I will ever do it again. Glover puts together something that is unique to him. I think to appreciate it you have to read some of his poetry, maybe see one of his slideshows. I really like this guy, he is so strange that I can not help it. Note: I saw this movie before it went through its final edit, so maybe what I've seen and what others have seen is different. I'll know, I suppose, if I choose to watch the movie again. I think I'll have to be properly influenced by drugs ...
