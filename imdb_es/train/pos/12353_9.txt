A tragically wonderful movie ... takes us to a Japan that no longer exists. Despite the technical experience of Hollywood, I still have to see a movie (of Hollywood) that can match the authenticity of the atmosphere in this small town by the river near the sea ... The last samurai of Tom Cruise was seen as the Last episode of Lord of the Rings attempt to capture the Old Rural Japan. <br /> <br /> If you like serene but intense story lines, this is a movie you should see. It will be a respite from the flashy films, like the last 1000 blockbusters you saw. I think this is one of the best stories of Kurosawa. <br /> <br /> Even if it is a film about geishas and brothels and the complicated rules that govern life in such environments, it did not become a skin movie. The characters are full of depth and act with great intensity.
