I know that the snobs in the movie are snorting. But if you're looking for a surprisingly fun ride through the jungle of B movies, try "Jake Speed." <br /> <br /> Slightly thinner at times, but it is a single line and location more than that of the composition. for this. John Hurt (God loves him), seems to be having fun doing his role as the ultra evil white slave. The nemesis of Crawfords, Jake Speed. Add a dimension to the movie that only a professional like Hurt could provide. Crawford and Dennis Christopher (Jakes' partner) are a good team, although one wonders why both can stand each other. However, together, Crawford and Christopher represent a team that is so fun that, if you can overcome it. For a moment, you may find yourself acting like a child again in situations and the inherent suspense they provide. The delightful Karen Kopins does a great job as the damsel in distress who is more concerned with the motives of her savior and her tormentor. <br /> <br /> I still have to find a movie that is so funny without preaching, or bogging down the film for trying too hard. Not all films have to be the last "Citizen Kane". And believe me, Wells was an original. So let's remember that sometimes, movies are for fun. No social comments or attempts to politically influence an audience. But only for the sheer fun of being alive and living in a moment when our hero lives in a celluloid dimension.
