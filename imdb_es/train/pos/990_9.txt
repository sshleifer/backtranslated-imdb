I really liked this movie. Of course, the idea is far away ... the federal government is arranging the implantation of a tracking device in the jaw of a petty thief to attract a more dangerous thief / hacker out of hiding. But Alvin Sanders, the man the feds have "volunteered" to be implanted with the device, is a very nice person and it's really fun to get in his head for a while. Alvin, even eventually, proves to be much more than a character in good humor but passive or one-dimensional when it shows that it is not as easy to manipulate as it seems. Definitely worth a watch.
