Dark Angel is a cross between Huxley's Bravo New World and Percy Love in the Ruins, which presents the not-too-distant future as a disturbing mix of chaos and order, both in the worst sense of the word. Once one swallows the premise that all modern technology can be stopped by "the Pulse", it provides an entertaining landscape to explore the personalities and relationships between the two main characters: Max (the Dark Angel / bike messenger) and Logan (the rich rebel). It seems uneven, perhaps as a result of a variety of authors, but it is held together by the lovely, beautiful and lovely Jessica Alba, who looks strong and callous, but also vulnerable and sensitive. I think Fox has done it again.
