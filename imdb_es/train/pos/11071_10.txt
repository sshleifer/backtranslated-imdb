I give ten out of ten, it's one of the best movies in history. Absolutely crushed, stunned and dazed by the whole image, the wonderful interpretation of Jason Statham, Ray Liotta and the entire crew, incredible plot ... Just look at yourself and gather your courage to admit it. It touched your soul, because it is strange. but there are all the answers you've been looking for ... The best, sir. Ritchie! The best of all Those who were looking for a simple fight and skirmishes are still shouting that they are disappointed. But there are many shallow movies in Hollywood today, you can not remember what it was like the day after you saw them. On the contrary, Revolver is unique, I could hardly hope that it would be possible to portray such a clear and brilliant image of myself, of all those who should see it. Absolutely insurmountable, amazing, dazzling ... One can get a vision by seeing this, I have no doubt about it. Actually, no word can express my admiration ... I still wonder how it was possible to film a movie of this kind after years of Hollywood dizziness that we had been seeing. Thank you with all my heart, it is simply the best.
