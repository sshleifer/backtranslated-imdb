Dumland focuses on the lives of a family (American?) ... The father; a violent and obscene person who loves to throw and use bad words and who has no redeeming qualities. Mother; Who seems to be a paranoid psychotic, never really says much. The son; A dark and annoying repetitive companion. The animation is simple and crude, but it fits into the stories and the characters. The episodes were originally only available on the davidlynch.com website, but have now been published on DVD. There are 8 episodes on the DVD and then a brief synopsis: <br /> <br /> 1- The Neighbor: We met the neighbor next door, and we discovered three things about him ... he has a very good shed, he He only has one arm and he likes to do bad things with ducks. <br /> <br /> 2- The Treadmill: We discovered that the wife has an affinity with exercise, but the husband does not really think it is a good idea. In the end, the exercise is victorious. <br /> <br /> 3- The doctor: the father has an unfortunate accident with an exposed live wire ... the doctor's examination is quite exhaustive (if it is not unconventional) but the diagnosis is "you are perfectly normal "(but we knew it). <br /> <br /> 4- Visits from a friend: After an altercation with the new clothes elevator, a friend comes to visit him (believe it or not, he has one!) but after we meet him, we can understand why), without surprises when he tells us what his hobbies are. <br /> <br /> 5- Get the stick: We meet another neighbor, he has a stick stuck His mouth (although we never found out how he got there). Unfortunately, removing the stick from your neighbor's mouth ends up being more difficult (and more violent) than expected ... but in the end it is victorious ... ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ 6- My teeth are bleeding: this was my favorite episode. ... and it was also the most repetitive and annoying (what does that say about me?). I'm not sure why the child's teeth started to bleed, but believe me when I say that the plot of the story was minimal. Which is an oxymoron, since history had no argument. But did it have a fun ending (which included a fly)? <br /> <br /> 7- Uncle Bob: After meeting Uncle Bob and Uncle Bob's wife, we have a clear feeling that the genetic group of Dumbland is very superficial. . Uncle Bob is a sick guy (I will not explain it, so as not to spoil it). Uncle Bob's wife definitely wears the pants on his family ... and the father definitely ends up on the wrong side of his broad fist (and spends the rest of his visit hidden in a tree in the backyard). <br /> 8- Ants: after the house infiltrates with ants, and a malicious insect repellent attempt goes awry ... it ends up spraying on the face with the insect repellent and begins to hallucinate. The ants put on a fabulous song and a dance show ... they go crazy trying to kill them, they end up in a full body cast ... and let's say the ants come at the end. <br /> <br /> Although these stories are so bad, there is something that forces me to see them. They give another idea in the mind of one of my favorite directors. David Lynch Maybe they were a way out for him, to get rid of some of his violent thoughts? I really laughed out loud at many points within the episodes. Many aspects are absurdly funny!
