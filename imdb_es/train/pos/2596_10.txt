The film adaptation of James Joyce's Ulysses is excellent. The actors, the voice-over, the direction, everything captures the sensation of the novel without sacrificing its own merits. Milo O'Shea does an excellent job as Leopold Bloom, the horned man married to the shameless Molly. I love this photo
