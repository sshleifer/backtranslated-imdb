This movie is amazing, it's like a nightmare. The strange story, the dark decorations, the insects swarms everywhere, the idea jumps and the surreal dreams ... Really great! People who love cult movies or very dark thrillers will find this fantastic. David Lynch's films seem a bit like: the strange story, the strange dreams, the red curtains. Nuit Noire contains almost no plot. It is rather a succession of surreal events, nightmares and meetings. That is an inconvenience. If the film had a really fascinating plot, full of tension with a captivating outcome, I would give it a 10 out of 10. But that's missing, and that's why I gave the film an 8. Nuit Noire is a movie that is worth seeing. Search for that DVD and you will be rewarded!
