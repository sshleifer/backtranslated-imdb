['Mystery Men is one of those movies that becomes more fun with time. There is a naive innocence and &quot;kindness&quot; for the characters. It has become part of our family &quot;culture,&quot; and we quote the characters frequently. It&#39;s my favorite movie of the last two years. My children are 13 and 11 years old and all three of us love this movie. Great acting and comedy. We love the Galaxy Quest and Monty Python movies too. Okay, we&#39;re not talking about intellectuals here, just about family unity.']
