This movie was amazing. It had an original concept (that of a vampire movie and the Yakuza mafia). It is a humorous and yet extremely dramatic and tragic film about friendship, love, immortality, death and happiness, and subtle comments about society. On the part of Gackt Camui, the role of Sho was excellent, and HYDE was surprisingly good for his first film as the tortured but humorous vampire, Kei. I also laughed and cried for the happy and carefree character, Toshi, who grew up with Sho. I loved every second of this movie, especially moments like the funny cigarette scene, the fight scenes and, above all, the exciting ending.
