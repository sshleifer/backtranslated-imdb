As is well known among long-haired young people who are incredibly interested in Herr Graf's silent commentaries, during the summer, aristocrats like to travel to exclusive and distinguished places to avoid the heat and hordes of rude people they relax. Those strange trips around the world also occur in "Three Ages," a charming and elegant work of silent work directed by old men, namely, Herr Buster Keaton and Herr Eddie Cline. <br /> <br /> Obviously, this German count liked the first segment more focused on the Stone Age because of the affinity that this aristocrat feels in that ancient time. preferring that to the second segment that takes place during the glory of Rome (it should have included the cause of the fall of the Roman Empire, that is, the barbarians, or the same, the Germans). Of course, the third segment takes place during modern times, but this Teutonic aristocrat believes that even 100 years ago he should qualify as modern. <br /> <br /> The leitmotiv that moves Herr Keaton and his companions to travel and endure the strange and hilarious Events during three different ages, is the search for love, a very complicated subject to understand for aristocrats who prefer the search for money and self-interest. Every time "Three Ages" is shown at the Schloss theater, it is always a pleasure to watch a funny and witty silent film (even for a serious German count), a play full of jokes and gadgets, puns, stunts and acrobatics. Visual and amazing technical tricks, an absolutely silent delicatessen that is perfect to allow us to endure the various and gross severities of summer. <br /> <br /> And now, if you'll allow me, I should temporarily leave because this German count must flirt with a former Teutonic heiress who does not seem to be his age. <br /> <br /> Herr Graf Ferdinand Von Galitzien http://ferdinandvongalitzien.blogspot.com/
