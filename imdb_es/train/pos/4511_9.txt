I just picked up the DVD release of this movie while on vacation in Norway, where it was released with English subtitles. <br /> <br /> The film is beautifully photographed and powerful. The young man who represents Frits, the main character, has a surprisingly open face that reflects with painful precision the tragic events unfolding around him. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the movie, we see that the father Frits loves so much. He has mental health problems and this arises when the brutal director denies attacking the child and suggests that he was his own father. <br /> <br /> The climatic scene in which Frits refuses to show respect to the director; simply standing and repeating 'Liar' while being brutally assaulted in front of your classmates is a scene you probably will not forget. teacher who uses all the "friendly teacher" tricks in the book. Apart from this, I am sure that this is a movie that you will really enjoy.
