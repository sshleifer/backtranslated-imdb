['I&#39;m not sure if it was right or wrong, but I read the other comments before seeing the short. I have to say that I do not agree with most of the negative comments or problems that people have had with him. <br /><br /> As director / producer of &quot;Lone Wolf&quot; for the first time, I like to see things that I can aspire to, not necessarily from professionals, but from people who wet their feet like me. <br /><br /> If in fact this is also the first time, as I read, I applaud the effort. A wonderful job then in that sense! There were some comments about the music. I thought it was nice enough for the piece. Some say it was something drugged for a while, but I discovered that it created tension without us (we) being necessarily aware of it, and when he pulled out the gun and the guitar began to crack chords, it was as if we knew there was a train on the tracks, but we realize that right now he is moving. Yes, there is a slip / clip of 180 degrees, but shi * happens. Did anyone else see Hugh&#39;s dirty shirt that went white (near the end, in the rain) in &quot;Australia&quot;? Look how much money and people were behind that movie! Give the child a rest for the love of God! In general, I think it was very well done. Only two things I would have mentioned are hardly worth mentioning: do not go near a bright brass photo frame with the camera, and you would only have shown the splash at the beginning of the shots to a still photo, so that people do not necessarily know what it is <br /><br /> My experience so far has taught me that it is not difficult to make a film, it only takes time to learn to do it, then the time to do it, and then it is better to take a little more time to think about everything. the details you will need to have before calling &quot;post-production time&quot; IMHO, it seems that the director / writer Ryan Jafri did his homework, and if this is his first report card, I will give him an &quot;A&quot;. The rest of you report to the directors office for a meeting.']
