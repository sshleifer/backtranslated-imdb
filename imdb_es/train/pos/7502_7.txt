Although he really did not feel anything for Lance's character, and he felt that his wife could have done much better with someone else. It could have been a much stronger movie if they had devoted more time to the development of the character, perhaps with Lance, I would have liked more. <br /> <br /> However, I have to completely agree with DoyleLuver, when they said "And to quote the character of Glenn Quinn, Ben: 'I'm the star here, it's true, I'm the talented one!'" If you watch the movie, just look at it, even when it's in the background ... just your facial expressions, everything in your eyes, you KNOW with certainty what motivates Ben, exactly how he feels about the comments, even if it's a quick look behind the back of a character. Great performance in a fair movie.
