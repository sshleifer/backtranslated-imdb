I saw it when I was little and it was excellent. Kelsey White as Lisa and Meecy Mices were adorable. Susan Bonde as Doodle and Sandra Dee Heidecke as Snoodle as Hilarius. Karen Boettcher-Tate as Profster was interesting. Burl Ross as Little Bunny Foo Foo was fun. Gregory Donavon as Kaiso was brilliant. What is Hilarius that Snoodle and Doodle eat too many sweets? What is sad that Little Bunny Foo Foo, who hits the Meecy Mice on the head and then by a fairy, gives little wish to Little Bunny Foo Foo, becomes a bully. This story is about when Lisa, Snoodle, Doodle go to the Big Rock Candy Mountains. This show is excellent: children will like this show, new words, songs and watch them play.
