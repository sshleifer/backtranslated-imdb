This movie is a fantastic movie. Everything in my opinion, in my opinion, was first class from the performance to the direction. I know that Mr. Garfield was on the blacklist in the 1950s, but most of his other films are on video, if not on DVD. That being the case, why is not this? A friend recorded it from TCM for me, but having it on DVD would be great. By special characteristics, they could have said that a marine historian spoke about the battle and if Schmid's wife or son is still alive, they could also be interviewed. Anyway, this is a great movie and I highly recommend it. If it is ever published, I hope it is not colored. Coloring it in my opinion would only ruin the whole effect of the movie. The battle scene was quite realistic when it came to a 1945 movie. Mr. Garfield did an excellent job of portraying Mr. Schmid. Some actors might have been tempted to exaggerate the part of Mr. Schmid's disability, but I think he did well. I sincerely hope that you will come out with this movie on DVD someday as a tribute to the courage of Al Schmid and all the other marines who sacrificed so much for us in World War II.
