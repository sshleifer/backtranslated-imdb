This movie is fascinating in its beauty and creativity. The deep vision of an artist, his art that intuitively flows from its natural source gives us an inspiring Hosanna, who combines his creations with trees, white waters that run against rocks, fields and rain ... Andy Goldsworthy makes the viewer feel happy to be alive, aware that we are all made of the clay of this glorious land. It does not spare us from occasional frustration, but in general we see the miracle of uniting art with nature. Of course, we also thank the filmmaker, Thomas Riedelsheimer, who directed, photographed and edited the film with incredible sensitivity and perfect synchronization. <br /> <br /> If you have any sense of beauty, nature and art ... do not miss this fantastic movie!
