The tweedy professor types thought they had everything solved. The peoples of today who live in Polynesia descended from the Asian migrants, moved intrepidly from the Far East, from island to island, to the east, towards Tahiti and all the other tropical exotic islands of the South Pacific for thousands of years. But the established thinking simply did not sit well with the young Norwegian ethnographer Thor Heyerdahl. If that explanation were true, why do some people born and raised on these islands have traditions, works of art and physical characteristics that do not resemble Asia but South America? How can you see the vegetation of Ecuador, Peru and Chile as much as what you would find on the island several thousand kilometers away? Is it just a coincidence that the islanders point the sea towards South America and say that this is where their ancestors came from, led by Tiki, their equivalent of Adam? Meanwhile, how is it that the Norwegians speak of the Scandanavian precursors who were persecuted from the South American continent they had colonized and, together with some of the native peoples with whom they became friends, left for the sea, heading to the WEST? It's too much to be a coincidence for Heyerdahl. With an incredible amount of moxie, a handful of crew and local knowledge for the construction of traditional rafts, an expedition begins. It is both a journey to the human imagination and a pseudoscientific demonstration that such a trip is possible only with the basic concepts of tools and navigation. The Oscar-winning documentary may be dated in its anglo-ethnocentric tone and approach, but it shoots with a spirit of adventure that surpasses even the space program that was launched a decade later, since men are willing to risk everything to try a theory they think. It is true. Wonderful. Do yourself a favor and read the book first. It's an amazing page and the perfect setting for the newsreel movie.
