What a moving movie I have a very dear friend who is over sixty years old and for the last 15 years she has told me that people no longer see her, and she longs for company. At age 40, I begin to see what he has complained about. You are no longer young, beautiful or touching. When May says "... this body bulge ..." wow. How our bodies change and how we are told that it is no longer beautiful. I love it when it starts to change what it takes ... the colorful scarf ... it's not the scruffy wife anymore. <br /> <br /> It is a sad and wonderful image at the same time. Sad that May betrays the confidence of her daughter ... beautiful because she is in the middle of the difficulty of the matter, and decides to move on and finally have her own life. I love the audacity of the character even to start the romance. <br /> <br /> I mostly love the movie because, finally, it is an image that shows the intricate nature of relationships, whether familiar or not. We see Paula's vulnerability, however, she will have what she wants at all costs ... (when she tells her mother that she will have a baby for Darren, whether he wants one or not after his mother asks him if Darren even wants a child). The film hits the mark of how relationships can change and yet reveals what has been there all the time, inactive. May has stifled her own creativity to start a family. A family that she really did not want, but it was "something you did when you were young." I love the scene when Darren calls her an old cake, and she smiles and says "They never called me that before." It was really a movie jewel. <br /> <br /> And Daniel Craig. Well, I just love it. I was pleasantly surprised. Not only is it pleasing to the eyes, but it is a true talent. What a beautiful role He is much more than any 007, that's for sure and I hope to see him in more roles of this nature. The scene in which he is pleasing May and the look he gives her is a kind of wonder that he has so much control over this woman, and also one of the pleasure of being able to give it to him. He is actually enjoying giving her pleasure. A wonderful scene The contrast is the love scene with Bruce. Bruce is totally absorbed in his own pleasure ... two completely different men. <br /> <br /> Oh ... I wonder where my Darren is.
