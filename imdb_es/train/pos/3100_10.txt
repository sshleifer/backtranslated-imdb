At the end of the first hour my jaw was comfortably between my feet. The movie never, and I never say, leave the action. It may be gentle action but it is action. Once again, each member of the cast fits perfectly. The explosions were realistic, the chase scenes were possible and the fight was incredible. Matt Damon will always be Jason Bourne. <br /> <br /> All I have to say is that every Bourne movie improves and this is no exception. The action, the stakes, the plot. How they do it, I'll never know. I applaud the man who wrote the screen reproductions of each of these films. Because if he had not done a great job with the first movie, we would not have one to talk about. <br /> <br /> So do not go see it in theaters, live it in theaters. if he is still outside of where he lives, but if not, on December 11 Bourne returns home!
