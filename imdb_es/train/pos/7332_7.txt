I had seen fragments of this as a child but, while I bought the Blue Underground set right away because it was a Limited Edition, only now I had it in my viewing calendar, and that is mainly because Bakshi's American POP (1981) has just appeared. on Italian television at night (see my review of that movie below)! <br /> <br /> Anyway, I thought the movie was a very good animated epic of swords and witchcraft with especially impressive backgrounds (the slightly awkward broken-up characters were, by the way, less) with an excitement if they derived Score . The plot, once again, was not exactly original, but proved to be undeniably attractive at a juvenile level and the well-developed main characters, especially interesting is the evil ice lord Nekron and the enigmatic warrior Darkwolf; The hero and the heroine, however, are rather bland stereotypes, but one can barely complain when Bakshi and Frazetta represent the well-endowed girl (her bra could be ripped off at any moment) and half naked to boot (her tiny panties are for always disappearing in the ass)! Still, it's clearly an action-oriented piece and it's certainly true on this front (which involves Darkwolf being particularly wild); The final confrontation, although brief, is also well handled and sees our heroes astride pterodactyl assaulting the den of the villains inside a cave. <br /> <br /> In the long run, apart from the Frazetta funds mentioned above, the main attraction of this film for me now is its nostalgia factor, as it transported me to my childhood days of watching not only movies as CONAN THE BARBARIAN (1982) and THE BEASTMASTER (1982) but also animated television series such as BLACKSTAR (1981-82) and HE-MAN AND THE MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE (1983-85). <br /> <br /> Regarding the accompaniment OF THE MANUFACTURE OF "FIRE AND ICE" (TV) (Mark Bakshi, 1982) ** 1/2: <br /> <br /> A classic of the film animated of swords and sorcerers that is only available through the printed copy on VHS owned by Ralph Bakshi himself! He goes into some details about the rotoscope technique and also shows several cases of live action "actions" (in a study) of segments of the script, which would then be tracked, mixed with the backgrounds and filmed. However, after having seen several of those scenes behind the scenes in the art of animation (in the sets of Disney Tins and Looney Tunes, for example), it is not a very convincing piece ...
