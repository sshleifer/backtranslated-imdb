This movie was incredible. I would recommend it to anyone, much better than I had anticipated. It was definitely a spectacular heartbreaking film. It is an incredible story, with incredible actors and creators. Definitely another great movie with Denzel Washington. (It should not surprise anyone) Derek Luke also did a wonderful job.
