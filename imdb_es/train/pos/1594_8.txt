What I like about you is one of those series that you need to watch, but I'm not sure you would see it, the beginning is great and it attracts you to the series just for fun, the second part and season 2-3, which are more past. , they come and go in what you want. what happens with many series is that they do not end with something special because the second part of the series always falls in the drain, this also did, the third part is the one that ruins and ruins the whole series, generally, but it is not like that , this ending is perfect for the series, it fits perfectly, I was really quite angry for all these guys in Val's life, I really wanted to end up with Jeff in the end, but later he changed, he chose to take Vic to the series after almost 3 seasons without him, and that was the biggest surprise and also what made the series the best. <br /> <br /> Look at it many times, the series is really great. I do not think the second part is so good that it is not, but the third part does what was needed and turned the series into one that was worth it. I am happy to say that I was happy and happy for the series and now I will go to see two guys, a girl and a pizzeria, when I have seen the whole series, I will come back ...
