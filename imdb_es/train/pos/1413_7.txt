In 2006, AMPAS awarded one of the most innovative documentaries depicting wildlife in the coldest place on Earth, that movie was March of the Penguins narrated by the Academy Award-winning actor Morgan Freeman. <br /> <br /> Walt Disney Studios has had a monopoly on the animated circuit for decades. They have taken their stabbings in the making of live action movies and it has been a great success in all areas. Then, Disney created a subdivision called Disneynature and released his first feature film entitled Earth. This is absolutely one of the most moving and informative documentaries I've seen in quite some time. <br /> <br /> Narrated by the great James Earl Jones, Earth offers nothing new to anyone who has seen the Discovery Channel in the last five years or closely following the global warming crisis. The Earth touches the subject very deeply and has a very liberal approach on the subject. <br /> <br /> It allows an emotional connection with nature that I had not experienced before. It also shows not only the beauty and disconcerting parts of our magnificent planet, but also the grunting and disturbing aspects that it often entails. It is one thing to see "Mufasa" fall from a cliff to a stampede or Bambi's mother being killed by a hunter in the middle of the forest. Everything is fine because at the end of the film we know it's just a movie. This shows penguins, polar bears, elephants, all kinds of families, from all walks of life, living and dying in their natural habitats. These real things make it a true cinematic experience. <br /> <br /> Although it weighs a little on the graphic nature of the film (which many people will not agree), the Earth is a moving experience. There is an impressive film work here for a great camera crew and an incredible score from George Fenton. Compared to March of the Penguins or Grizzly Man, it does not really have any measure, but stands out on its own. At the end of the day, the appreciation of our planet and a bit of sadness will increase, since many of us will probably never visit these places that we will witness in the film. We live here and it is as if we could never explore the planet for one reason or another. The earth is beautiful. <br /> <br /> *** / ****
