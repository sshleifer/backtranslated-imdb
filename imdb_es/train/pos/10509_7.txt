['I have not read the novel, although I understand that this is something different from it; the fact that I enjoyed this, along with the fact that this really is not my gender, leads me to the decision not to continue reading the book. Having not read a single word of Austen&#39;s writings, I really can not compare this with any of her works. What I can say is that almost all the lines of dialogue in this are intelligent, ingenious and well executed, as well as the greatest source of comedy in this. This made me laugh a lot out loud, with perfect British and verbal material. Each performance is successful, and Paltrow completely fulfills the role of a type of matchmaker. The characters are well written, credible and consistent. However, I found a couple of them extremely irritating, and while I think at least some of that was fun, it tended to repeat itself excessively, and the truth is that it was not fun the first time they appeared. The editing and cinematography are wonderful, and everything seems absolutely magnificent. The plot and the rhythm are great, you never get bored. It ends in a really obvious way, but maybe that&#39;s what the audience prefers. I can not say that this did not entertain me, I did it from start to finish and I would see it again. There is a short language in this. I recommend it to any fan of romantic stories. 7/10']
