I first discovered Alexander Korda's fantasy (1940), THE THIEF OF BAGDAD, in the early 1950s, in a reissue announced as "The wonder of the century show!" Both films from Korda Technicolor, THE THIEF OF BAGDAD and JUNGLE BOOK were shown in a program that will never be forgotten. The music of Miklos Rozsa enhanced both films. The Technicolor in each one was incredibly beautiful! THE THIEF OF BAGDAD has remained on my list as the best fantasy film ever made. As the years passed, it became harder to enjoy the color of the film in the way it had originally been presented. True Technicolor gave way to an Eastman Color process in the mid-1950s. Both Kino and Samuel Goldwyn reissued the film both theatrically and on video. However, Eastman's color prints were a pastel color and silenced the vitality of the original Technicolor. The launch of the laser disc of this title also has a pastel appearance, nice, but not as it should be. NOW comes the theme M-G-M DVD (December 3, 2002). THE THIEF OF BAGDAD again has the wonderful Technicolor look on a DVD that is still impressive! It was so exciting to see it like that once again that after watching the DVD once, I saw it a second time. The only "Extras" are a dubbed version in Spanish, subtitles in both English and Spanish and an original theatrical trailer very well done. Thank you M-G-M for this EXCEPTIONAL release on DVD. Now, one can only expect that Korda's FOUR FEATHERS and a restored version of the Korda JUNGLE BOOK (to replace bad public domain impressions in circulation) will soon be released on a DVD.
