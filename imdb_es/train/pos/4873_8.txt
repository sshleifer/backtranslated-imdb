For those of you who do not know the subject that Kusturica continues to explore intermittently in his films, the Western assault on traditional Serbian values, it will be impossible for him to understand his narrations. This continuous theme, expressed through fantasy and outrageous comedy as his vehicle, is one that Kusturica has chosen to command. From his fantastic work and 'Underground' by Magnum Opus, Kusturica's films '' Black Cat White Cat '', 'Life is a Miracle', and recently with 'Promise Me This', his carnival and slapstick style underscore 'Westernization' of the Balkan culture. , his ambivalent arrival and assault on traditional language. In the case of 'Promise Me This', the paradoxical world of the city (urban space) and the village space (traditional language) is contrasted. The world of the city reflects Western attributes that have installed the spatial and temporal environment; Organized crime, sexual exploitation, a sense of broken identity and vehement contempt for traditional values, as expressed towards the young - villager. The end of the film exemplifies this notion even more when observing a funeral mass and a wedding on a dirt road in one direction. They are in a rough collision; appropriately, the wedding, which represents the vital line and the pulse of the village, that is, the traditional values, are about to collide with the mourners of the funeral, exemplifying the death of the tradition in this context. However, Kusturica brilliantly examines this theme through its own unique stylistic uniqueness. With its extravagant and extravagant style that serves as a vehicle in its representation.
