I have not yet read Kurt Vonnegut's book that was adapted, but I'm familiar with some of his other works and I was interested to see how it would translate to the screen. In general, I think this is a very successful adaptation of one of Vonnegut's novels. This is the story of an American who lives in Germany and is recruited as a spy for the United States. His job is to ingratiate himself with the high-ranking Nazi and send secret messages to Americans through his weekly radio show. But when the war ends, he is denounced as a war criminal, but escapes to New York, where several strange twists of the plot await him. <br /> <br /> If Mother Night has a problem, it tends to be too sentimental at times. But for most of the film, the schmaltz is kept to a minimum and the very weird plot is carried out with skill and aplomb. And there are some fabulous moments of black comedy that involve three right-wing Christian fundamentalists and a very tall Nazi in a prison cell. Highly recommended.
