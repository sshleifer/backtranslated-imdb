A lot of genres, but mostly based on Stephen Chow's genre mash-ups for inspiration. There's kung-fu magic, college romance, sports, gangster action and a bit of weeping melodrama for a topping. The production is excellent and the pace is fast, so it is easy to overcome the many flaws in this movie. <br /> <br /> A baby is abandoned next to a basketball court. A homeless man takes him to a Shaolin monastery that is in the middle of a city along with a special manual of kung fu that the homeless man has somehow but can not read. The old monk teaches the child but expires when he tries to master the special technique of the manual. The school is run by a fake kung fu teacher who is attended by four crazy monks. The new teacher gets angry with the boy of more than 20 years for not pretending to be hurt by the teacher's weak blows and throws him out at night. The boy finds himself throwing garbage in a basket from an incredible distance by a man who takes him to the club of a gangster to play darts. This leads to a great fight, the expulsion of the child from the monastery and the decision of the man to turn the child into a college basketball sensation. <br /> <br /> All this happens in the first 20 minutes and most of it happens in the first 10 minutes. Apart from the extreme shorthand stories, the first problem is how little we know the main character until the film. The man who uses the child is more defined when the first third ends. The plot does not follow any terrain except for the climax of the insane action of the film. I'm sure you can easily imagine what the crazy monks will look like towards the end. The effects, the photography and the acrobatic work are all first class and compensate the uninspired plot. <br /> <br /> Stephen Chow has a much better grasp of plot and comedy writing and this movie will live in its shadow, but that is not a good reason to ignore it. It is quite entertaining even with a scatter shot end. Recommended.
