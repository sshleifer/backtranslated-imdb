One day I accidentally tripped on this movie on television. It was broadcast mid-day on a channel that is not exactly famous for broadcasting good movies. This, however, was not good at that time. <br /> <br /> October Sky tells the true story of Homer Hickam, a boy inspired by the launch of Sputnick to become a space scientist. He and his friends start building rockets. His father is not happy with his son's new hobby and would rather see him become a miner like himself or go to college with a football scholarship like his brother. <br /> <br /> The story is well written. . Maybe too predictable, but it's okay because it does not focus too much on those parts of the story. It is an important part, but when this is obvious in the internal action, the action between the characters is focused. The story is good. It has some clichés, but that's fine. It is based on real events, so you can not simply abandon these clichés. The characters are really good. When the story is down, the characters come out and manage to keep the action and the quality of the film high. You know these characters and you feel sympathy for them. They are well written and they are credible. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie. The sets and style of the 50s are exhaustive and the images are well composed and well-lit. All this makes the mood of the film is very good. <br /> <br /> The acting is really good. Jake Gyllenhaal offers great performance since Homer Hickam and Chris Cooper are as good as John Hickam. As for the rest of the cast they are good too. All together they make a pretty strong cast. <br /> <br /> In general, I'm glad I captured this movie. It was the first time I saw it that I knew it was based on real events. If I had known that seeing it, it would probably be even more interesting. October Sky is a good and interesting movie. It's a movie that I think everyone can enjoy. It is a kind of movie to feel good. Not bad!
