This movie was very nice, although you will only like it if: - you hate going to the dentist but you are not afraid of a movie in which one of them goes crazy - you love horror movies <br /> <br /> I I especially liked the fact that special attention was paid to explaining the brutal actions of the main character. The fact that he is totally obsessed with cleanliness (especially in the mouth) and then catches his wives by giving some oral pleasure to the man in the mud-covered pool is a pretty credible reason to go overboard. <br /> <br /> He liked it. I give it an 8.
