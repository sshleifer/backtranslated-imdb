This review is for the extended cut of this movie. <br /> <br /> The first time I saw Dragon Lord was when I bought it on a DVD many years ago. I have always liked this movie and you can read some of the most positive reviews of it to get the general idea. <br /> <br /> That said. I've always found the plot a bit confusing. The film is, after all, a love story. And it always seemed strange to me that a love story ended with a 20-minute fight scene. <br /> <br /> Well, in the extended version, this is no longer the case. The old "original" version starts with a huge climbing / rugby sequence, which is the new final sequence in the extended version. The opening sequence is Dragon (Jackie Chan) that hangs in his house and pretends to be training and reciting every time his father is near. <br /> <br /> Other sequences have also been changed or prolonged in the extended cut and the story makes a lot more sense when you look at it. The pace is also better and, in general, works better. It feels more like a love story and does not leave you asking questions about why it ends as drastically and dramatically as the regular version does. <br /> <br /> I suggest everyone who is a Hong Kong movie, or just a Jackie Chan fan to get an extended version and see the movie the way it was originally designed. (Or at least that's how I think it was the intention, why else would they do it and reorganize some of the scenes)? I finished watching it, I felt I had seen a completely new Jackie Chan movie, although most of the sequences were the same.
