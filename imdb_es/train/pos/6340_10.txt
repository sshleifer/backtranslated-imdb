First an explanation of what makes a great movie for me. The excitement of not knowing what's coming next will make me enjoy a movie the first time I see it (case in point: Twister). There are also other things that go into a great first viewing, such as good humor (John Candy in Uncle Buck and The Great Outdoors), a good plot with good resolution (Madeline and Matilda), an imaginative narrative (all episodes of Star Wars : George Lucas is THE MAN), and good music (again all episodes of Star Wars, Wizard of Oz, Sound of Music). What makes me watch a movie at least six times in the cinema and buy a DVD or a VHS tape? Characters Having said that, I present Cindy Lou Who and The Grinch. Excellent performance by Taylor Momsen and Jim Carrey. The rest of the cast was very good, particularly Jeffery Tambor, Bill Irwin, Molly Shannon, Christine Baranski and Josh Ryan Evans. But, each individual scene with Cindy and The Grinch-together is excellent and very fun and comforting. Cindy Lou is my favorite character in this movie and the most compelling reason why the movie is better than the cartoon. The Grinch has a strong plot, good conflicts and a very good theme (I can not start because I do not want to spoil it). Jim Carrey was very funny like The Grinch, particularly when interacting with Cindy. And music! Woohoo! Excellent music by James Horner. I loved their selection of instruments and compositions. Very good job Jim Carrey, I did not know you could sing. Taylor momsen! Whoa! Your voice is reason enough to watch the movie at least once. In your solo, where are you from Christmas, your voice is as loud as it sounds? Sounds like an F #? That is an obscene range for a 7 year old boy (obscene means the best way possible). Great job. This is the best performance of a child I've heard in a movie (Taylor beat the Von Trapp Children, it's no small thing!). And now to the actors. Jim Carrey was great, funny and, surprisingly, very sensitive (this was demonstrated in his scenes with Taylor Momsen). The tacit expressions of Taylor Momsen (one of the secrets of a good performance) are very strong: it really becomes Cindy Lou Who. And when she talks it is even stronger. <br /> <br /> ************************* Danger: Spoiler Alert ******* ************** ************************** ********* ***************************** <br /> <br /> Examples: expression when you first see Once The Grinch. This is a classic quote ("You are the one" and then you fill in the Grinch line "da da THE GRINCH, after which she drops to the classifier and is then rescued by The Grinch.)" Thanks for saving my appointment and the subsequent response from The Grinch was also very good. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the movie is when Cindy invites The Grinch to be Holiday Cheermeister. This scene is two excellent actors in their best interaction and expressing each other. Little Taylor Momsen is fully supported by Jim Carrey in this place. I sincerely hope that we will see Taylor Momsen in many more films to come. In general, everything was great about this movie (except perhaps the feet and nose).
