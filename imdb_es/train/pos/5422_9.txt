The story of the untouchable who acted as a great soldier, saving the lives of hundreds, if not thousands, is told in the 1939 film "Gunga Din." Based on the poem by Rudyard Kipling, the film is brilliantly directed by George Stevens and starring Cary Grant, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Victor Mclagen. The main role is played by Sam Jaffe, known in my time as Ben Casey's boss, Dr. Zorba, a name that became synonymous with big hair and out of control. Say "Dr. Zorba hair" to anyone of my generation, and they will know what you are talking about. <br /> <br /> In India at the time of the British occupation, three soldiers, two romantic and brilliant figures. in Grant and Fairbanks, and McLagen as a big lug - they are cut-outs - actually, three kids too big. Gunga Din is the water carrier, treated somewhat cruelly (verbally, anyway) by McChesney (McLaglen), but Cutter (Grant) is fond of him. When he catches Din (pronounced Deen) practicing his soldier gait and salutes as he stacks the unit during his maneuvers, Cutter gives him some advice. <br /> <br /> The merry band of musketeers will separate when Ballantine (Fairbanks) announces that he is about to marry a charming young woman (Joan Fontaine) and is leaving the service. However, when Gunga Din and Cutter go through Thugees, a murderous cult led by a guru (Eduardo Cianelli), Gunga Din escapes to warn the unit, and Ballantine insists on re-enlisting to help save Cutter. After all, it is a movie of friends. <br /> <br /> "Gunga Din" begins cheerfully, with slapstick and a wide and wonderful comedy, particularly by Cary Grant, which is quite funny. Both he and Fairbanks are so handsome, it's hard to decide which one to look at first. Much of the movie is made up of huge action sequences that are very exciting. In the last part, the story becomes very dramatic and culminates in a tense and exciting battle. <br /> <br /> Grant has the most striking role, Fairbanks is the romantic in love, and McLaglen as McChesney, mainly due to his treatment of Gunga Din, is the most unpleasant character, although one senses his soft heart in his love for his elephant Annie. Its softness reaches the end of the film, particularly in the very moving and heartbreaking final scene. <br /> <br /> Always a friendly and nice actor, Sam Jaffe offers a beautiful presentation as Gunga Din, a simple, brave man with a big smile, powerful imagination and lofty dreams. Without much dialogue, Jaffe transmits the soul of Gunga Din magnificently. <br /> <br /> This is truly the best adventure movie, powerful, with good acting, moving scenes, a wonderful musical score and some beautiful film images. Another of that remarkable year, 1939. Highly recommended.
