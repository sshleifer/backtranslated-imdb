**** SPOILER ALERT **** Across Australia, summer turned into a deluge of rain and hail stones the size of baseballs that was wreaking havoc in coastal cities like Sydney. It is under these hectic conditions that attorney David Burton, Richard Chamberlain, became involved in a case, as a defense attorney, involving the death of a local Aboriginal who was found dead in front of a Sydney bar. <br /> <br /> By having five Aboriginal companions arrested by Billy Cormans, Athol Compton, the death is determined by the police forensic officer that Billy died of drowning not by violence even though he had bruises on his neck and shoulders However, the court decided to prosecute the five for his death, accusing them of murder instead of murder. <br /> <br /> David defending the five does not get help from them in his defense and the accused aggressors choose to remain calm and keep anything. He passed Billy to themselves and they took what came from the court. One of the defendants, Chris, David Gulpili, begins to invade in some way the dreams of David as if he wanted to tell him what was really behind the death of Billy. <br /> <br /> At first, David, who does not take his dreams of Chris, begins to feel. Make them real when they find you in court. Chris confirms David's dreams by showing him a strange-looking black rock that David saw Chris had in his dreams. After meeting Chris and what turned out to be an Aboriginal shaman, Charlie (Nandjiwarna Amagula) who came to his house that night, David is told that he, like Charlie, has spiritual powers that he inherited from his mother's grandfather . Those powers will reveal the future that has to do with the strange weather conditions that are flooding the Australian continent. Chris tells David that the earth is going through a giant cleanup cycle with the old world about to be razed and the new world ready to take its place. <br /> <br /> David is confused about what both Chris and Charlie are saying, but as the rains continue to rise and the ocean waves begin to rise, he feels that something terrible is going to happen. David wants to know if everything is Aboriginal folklore or there are some scientific facts, or logic, behind his end of world-class revelations. <br /> <br /> At this point, it is obvious that both Chris and Charlie are members of an aboriginal tribe. Right in the heart of modern Sydney. Only that can get Chris, as well as his four friends, for the murder of Billy. Since the Australian government will not prosecute the tribal aborigines, justice will not be done to the tribes themselves. Still, Chris refuses to admit that he is a member of a native tribe and he and his four friends are convicted of murder for Billy's death, and the judge handed down the sentences in a matter of days. <br /> <br /> David decided now Find out what was the reason for Chris's silence, and why Billy had to die, is taken by Chris to the scene of the crime. It is there that David discovers that Billy betrayed the members of Chris's tribe by going there with Billy not being a member of Chris's aboriginal tribe. He also revealed to David that he himself has some kind of spiritual connection with the aborigines of Austrailan, as told by both Charlie and his stepfather, the Reverend Burton, David Parslow. <br /> <br /> The stage is now ready for the great and last clean-up cycle that David has been seeing both in his night dreams and in his day visions. It comes in the form of a massive tidal wave that leaves the Pacific Ocean towards the Australian coastal city of Sydney and then submerges in the entire continent.
