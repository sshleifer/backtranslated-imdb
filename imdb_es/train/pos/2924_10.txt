Rated NR (would be rated R for strong general language and raw sexual humor). Quebec Rating: 16+ (should have 13+) Canadian Home Video Rating: 18A <br /> <br /> Eddie Murphy Delirious is Eddie's first comedy routine. He left in 1983. He then returned to the movie 48 hrs and Trading Places and he was on Saturday Night Live. Eddie made two comedians. Delirious and Raw. I preferred Raw because I thought the subject was more humorous. Anyway, Serious is also very funny when Eddie talks about his childhood and mocking celebrities like Mr.T and singers like Michael Jackson. Any fan of the stand-up comedy movies should see Eddie Murphy's Delirious.
