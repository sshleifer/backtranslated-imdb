The Thing About My Folks is a wonderful movie about relationships: first of all, an adult son and his father, but also that son with his wife, his sisters and his mother. Paul Reiser has written a semi-autobiographical film about his relationship with his father. The film is fun, moving and stimulating. It led me to reevaluate my own relationship with my deceased father and my adult son. Peter Falk is excellent as Paul's father, the role could not have been better chosen. I hope that both Mr. Falk and Mr. Reiser will be recognized at the next year's film awards for their efforts: Falk for his performance and Reiser for his screenplay.
