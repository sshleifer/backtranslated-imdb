I've seen this movie when I was young, and I remembered it as one of the first movies I really liked, it was not an action movie or a comedy. Then, in my last years, I decided to see it again and see if it was just nostalgia or if there really was something in that movie. To my surprise, the film met all my expectations. It's a great movie. Emotional in the right amount, some jokes, good songs (although not very well, and that explains why I did not remember it was a musical) and, in general, a great use for my time. I was surprised because the last films of my childhood that I visited again did not even exceed my minimum demands of a decent movie, and yet this film, which I saw for the first time in the second grade, made me cry today, just as it made me cry . . Maybe it's because my dog ​​died recently and maybe not, but the important thing is that he made me feel, and that's why the filmmakers make movies (that and money, of course). Yes, there are failures in continuity. Yes, the script has holes, but it does not matter. The movie itself is fun and smart. So do not be fooled by cynical people who always look for the bad things in life, because nothing is perfect, and this movie gets a 10, not because it's perfect. He gets 10 simply because he made me feel.
