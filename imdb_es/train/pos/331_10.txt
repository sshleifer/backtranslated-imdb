['This 370-minute film was broadcast on Italian public television in the early 1970s. It tells you the myth attributed to Homer of the trip to Odysseus&#39; house after the Trojan War. It is an epic story about the ancient Minoan and Mycenaean civilizations, told on the list 500 years after the events that took place, around 1100 BC. <br /><br /> This is a movie from 1969, so if you buy the DVD version, you will find that the sound is only mono and there is no other language than Italian, even the subtitle is in Italian. Pity. Many people would enjoy this masterpiece if it had subtitles in English on the list. But if this is not a problem for you, I strongly recommend that you watch this movie.']
