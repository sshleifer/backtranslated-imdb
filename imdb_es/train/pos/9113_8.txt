Probably the first Portuguese film I've seen in my life, and I enjoyed it. The plot is related to the way in which the young army officers took power in Portugal in 1974, to finally defeat the fascist government of Caetano and also to end the wars in the colonies, that is, Mozambique, Angola and Guinea (Bissau ) - Cape Vert. Most of the events shown in the film accurately reflect the behavior of army officers and soldiers to carry out the coup, of the oppressed, who were very happy with this new development and the freedom, the resistance of the Caetano's men and also in a subtle form of most conservative officials, including Spinola, who took office as new president. The Portuguese revolution can be remembered due to the action of several young officers, but for me, the most interesting part of the film was when the young captain expressed that Portugal should develop democratically, and this is what the country achieved some years after this blow. or the revolution. The film also shows that officers and army soldiers never wanted to kill anyone; Even the most serious enemies were respected in the end.
