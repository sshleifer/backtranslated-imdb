Pretty good romantic comedy in which I think I've never seen Meg with a cuter look. All the players did a good job to keep this lively romp. Of course, in the real world no mathematical genius would not even look at a fat monkey, but that's why I love romantic comedies ... one can totally forget reality and have a good time. Good movie Damn, Meg is a babe, huh?
