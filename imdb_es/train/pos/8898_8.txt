The 60's is a great movie (I saw it completely in one night) about the hippy movement in the late 60's. Although the title suggests otherwise, the first 5 years of the 60's are not really important in this movie. <br /> <br /> The main character of the film is Michael, a political activist who goes on tour in the United States against the Vietnam War. There he meets his girlfriend, Sarah. Brian, Michael's brother, goes to Vietnam to fight (what a surprise!). Returns from the war and becomes a "Tom Cruise Born on the fourth of July." in a Hippy. His father is a kind of person pro vietnam war (what a surprise!). Michael's sister, Kate, gets pregnant by a Rock & Roll artist, flees from home and goes to San Francisco during the summer of love. The end is very poor (the father becomes a liberal and everyone is happy), but I let this slip away from my vote (the rest of the movie is very good!). <br /> <br /> The actors' performances are quite good and the film's soundtrack is absolutely brilliant. All major events of the sixties are in the film, such as the murders of JFK and Martin Luther King, as well as the great hippie protests, the summer of love and Woodstock. Look at the "Woodstock Speaker" Gravy (what we have in mind is breakfast in bed for 400,000!) As a first aid employee at the Woodstock festival! <br /> <br /> In the end, the 60s are a beautiful movie about a beautiful decade! 10/10
