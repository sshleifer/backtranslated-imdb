I caught this on the plate last night. I liked the movie. I traveled to Russia 3 different times (adopting our 2 children). I can not pinpoint exactly why I liked this movie, apart from seeing "bad" turn "good" and "good" turn "semi-bad". I liked the look that Ben Chaplin has throughout the movie. Like "I can not believe this is happening to me" if it's good or bad, it looks the same (and it works). Grand final 7/10. Rent it or pick it up on the plate as I did.
