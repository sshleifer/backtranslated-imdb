After seeing Dick Tracy in the $ 6.99 wastebasket in Future Shop, I decided to try it without prior knowledge and being a big fan of movies about mafia and crime. I was very surprised to see an entertaining and intelligent film with solid performances. The film progresses well, it has, of course, another solid performance by Warren Beatty, but the true characteristics of the film are Al Pacino and Madonna. I was happy to discover that Pacino was nominated for his performance as a great gangster trying to bring down the city. Madonna was great as the damsel in distress, she really impressed me and added depth to her performance. If you go with the attitude of wanting to see a funny and intelligent movie with a great performance and a solid script, then try Dick Tracy. I do not think you're disappointed. And watch the cameos of Paul Sorvino, James Caan, Kathy Bates and Dustin Hoffman, among others.
