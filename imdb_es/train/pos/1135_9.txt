I saw it for the first time in the cinema when it came out, and the crowd was really interested in the movie, which made the experience even more fun. This is a great cast of characters, many of their big names, some of whom were not as recognized as they are now. I think it's a great idea if you follow one of these actors, or love them in other movies, to add them to your list of viewed users. Some of the scenes really remind me of the kind of comedy well done, like in The Birdcage or even The Clue, a kind of strange comedy of spontaneous appearance, with some really professional presentations of these beloved actors. The film did a great job of giving you an idea, perhaps even a very realistic one, of the culture of a daytime soap.
