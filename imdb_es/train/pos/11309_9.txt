A masterful treatment of "The Postman Always Rings Twice" by James Caine when the first Luchino Visconti film was shot mainly around Ferrara in a soulless, war-ravaged Italy. The original negative was thought to be destroyed, but Visconti kept a footprint and, fortunately, today we can see this early neo-realist work. Massimo Girotti and Clara Calamai (who recently revealed their breasts at La Cena delle Beffe) (1941), star in the sensual and rude lovers who try to kill their husband, an unusual ending in which, although crime does not pay, one pays a way that is not directly related to the crime, excellent direction, script, acting and cinematography.It is reportedly not as good as the French "Le Dernier tournant" (1939) but probably better than the American version (1946) with Lana Turner and John Garfield in the main roles, highly recommended.
