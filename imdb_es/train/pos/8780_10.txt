['This is one of the best sports movies ever made by Hollywood. What a wonderful story about one of the great sports figures in American history. What makes James J. Corbett&#39;s story especially interesting is that Mr. Corbett introduced the style of boxing that continues to this day. In that sense, James J. Corbett was truly innovative. But going back to the movie, all the performances were excellent. Alexis Smith was beautiful. In fact, she looked like Nicole Kidman. And although it is a piece of time, history resists the test of time; It has not gone stale. The representation of Ward Bond by John L. Sullivan has to be one of the great representations of a real sports figure in the history of the films and the boxing scenes are realistic, well organized and highly effective. That, along with a great script, makes this movie a necessity.']
