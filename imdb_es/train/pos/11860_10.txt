This movie has it all. It is a classic representation of the events that surrounded the migration of thousands of Cuban refugees. Antonio Montana (played by Al Pacino), is just one of thousands who has the opportunity to choose his destiny in the United States. This cinematic but extremely precise depiction of Miamis' Drug Empire is astounding. Brian DePalma does an incredible job of directing this image, so much so that the viewer becomes involved with both the story and all the characters in the cast. With the presence of Tony's characters as believable and strong, Brian DePalma separates the raw talent exposed by Steven Bauer (Manny, Tony's best friend), Mary Elizabeth Mastantonio (Gina, Tony's sister), Robert Loggia (Frank , Tony's Boss) and Michelle Pfeiffer (Elvira, Frank's wife). I enjoyed every minute watching this movie, and I still see it weekly. This year, on the twentieth anniversary of this classic film about crime, I, for one, am a true believer that in another 20 years people will continue to refer to this movie in amazing numbers. With other crime movies so dramatic that I find, this movie is a shock to the system.
