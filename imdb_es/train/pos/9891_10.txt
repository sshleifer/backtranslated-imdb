I rented this movie for the first time many years ago and it captivated me completely. Recently, feeling a strange need to return to see some of the few and very few films that I have enjoyed immensely in my life, I decided to give "Erendira" another look. And I'm glad I did, since I soon discovered that even the passage of time has not dimmed the brightness of this movie in the least. <br /> <br /> The story is about a teenage girl (Erendira, played remarkably by Claudia O'hana, in some ways she looks like Winona Ryder, who accidentally sets fire to her grandmother's mansion, after which the grandmother, interpreted in a hypnotic way by Irene Papas, forces the girl to a life of prostitution on the road to pay for the damages. <br /> <br /> The visualization is both fascinating and convincing, although, despite of the basic premise, which deals with prostitution, lacks the taste of gratuitous and torrid sexual content.The story revolves more about the interactions between the girl and her grandmother, and the other colorful characters they come in contact with during his stay, which, incidentally, is in the rural part of rural Mexico. <Br /> <br /> The film is very atmospheric, surprisingly enigmatic with a decidedly dreamlike quality, sometimes bordering on the strange, but not to the point of, let's say, u a movie by David Lynch. It is also worth mentioning that the film is very allegorical in nature, read the comments of the previous viewers below ... <br /> <br /> Often, in the background you hear the sounds of a solitary accordion, quiet and melancholic, simply adding the right musical accents to highlight the Mexican atmosphere. The cinematography of rural places, many of which are in the desert, is excellent. <br /> <br /> The movie proceeds at a good pace, neither too fast nor too slow, and after each scene I felt I had to rewind the tape and replay it, just because it makes you want to do that. Anyway, for me it's really convincing. <br /> <br /> We hope you will see the film in its Spanish version, with subtitles. I studied Spanish in high school, as well as in college, and was happy to be able to understand much of the dialogue. For example: "The world is not as big as I thought". ("The world is not as big as I thought", that is, it is a small world). <br /> <br /> This movie somehow reminds me of stumbling upon an old and dusty bottle of old wine, which after drinking, is immensely satisfying, however, there is some sadness to realize that there is no more bottles like this.
