Come on people, look at the title! Haha I remember seeing this movie in Saturday Late Night Creature Features years ago. It's a great movie of corny monsters with a hilariously bad performance and two wonderful nonsense that adds to the blocking factor. The 2 types of Redneck boat rentals are the movie! LOL, and you'll love the boat scene where the Englishman and his wife are talking about all the stars and it's midday and sunny. Bloody hilarious! You can say that they just did not care about the plot, they just wanted to blow the film as quickly as possible. In short, you'll love it if you like the 70s.
