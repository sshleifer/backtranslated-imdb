This is a really fun movie, especially the second, third and fourth time you see it. It's a fairly short movie, and I definitely recommend seeing it more than once, the "get" more the second time. <br /> <br /> It's like the lumbar puncture but the rap version. He has a lot of attitude, which can be a negative thing in movies influenced by rap, but it's just a total photo shoot and it's not a problem because of the irony he creates. <br /> <br /> A lot of outstanding fragments, one of those types of movies in which you'll find yourself quoting lines with your classmates, and it will provoke laughter. <br /> <br /> My personal favorite part is the "guerrilla in the middle". section. Great video, excellent!
