['Previously, I wrote that I loved &quot;Titanic&quot;, I cried for its completion (many times), and I am a boy of about 60 years. I also wondered why this great movie, which won so many awards and was applauded by so many critics, received only a rating of 7.0 from the users of imdb.com. <br /><br /> Well, I looked at the breakdown of user ratings. While 29.0% of all votes gave a rating of 10, 10.7% gave it a rating of 1. These 10.7% of these irrational IMDB users, in effect, reduced the overall rating to 7.0. <br /><br /> In my previous comments, I blamed this very unusual voting pattern (a sudden increase in 1 ratings, with a high score of 10, decreasing only gradually and then suddenly reversing the course and jumping to grade 1 level) into one thing: the hatred for Leonardo DiCaprio. Believe me, I have tuned enough chat rooms to see the jokes of young people (young men, mostly), who defamed him from left to right. They absolutely hate man, and will have no part in giving him credit in &quot;Titanic.&quot; (To respond to another user: I am NOT talking about someone who really does not like the movie and gave it a 5 or a 6, etc. Everyone has and has the right to their own taste, but nobody can convince me that the rating imdb of only 7.0 in general for &quot;Titanic&quot;, taken to that level by an excessive number of ridiculous ratings 1, is a fair reflection of the film in general.) <br /><br /> Let me prove my point by comparing the voting pattern of the imdb user of &quot;Titanic&quot; with 5 randomly selected ticket counters and critical &quot;bombs&quot; (there are many more, but these 5 will prove my point). &quot;Heaven&#39;s Gate&quot; (1980) was removed from theaters quickly after a very bad box office presentation, and the ratings of the imdb voters were: 23.2% 10 ratings and 9.2% 1 ratings (overall score of 6.1). &quot;Big Top Pee-wee&quot; (1988) obtained 4.3% 10 qualifications and 9.9% 1 qualifications (general grade of 4.5). &quot;Cat People&quot; (1982) obtained 6.1% 10 qualifications and 2.6% 1 qualifications (general grade of 5.8). &quot;Blind Date&quot; (1987) obtained 3.0% 10 ratings and 2.8% 1 ratings (overall rating of 5.3). &quot;Jumpin &#39;Jack Flash&quot; (1986) obtained 4.4% 10 ratings and 3.7% 1 ratings (overall score of 5.2). WHAT DO ALL THESE MOVIES HAVE IN COMMON WITH &quot;TITANIC&quot;? ALL THE PERCENTAGES OF THEIR 1 RATINGS ARE LOWER! THAT &quot;TITANIC&quot;, AND NONE OF THESE STINKERS WERE NEVER NAMED FOR A SINGLE PRIZE. Once again, &quot;Titanic&quot; got 10.7% 1 ratings! Compare that with the other 5 movies I just mentioned. <br /><br /> Can there be another explanation other than hatred of the Leo factor? <br /><br />']
