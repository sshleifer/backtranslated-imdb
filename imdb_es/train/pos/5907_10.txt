This is one of the best movies I've seen in my life. My parents come from rural India and, to a certain extent, I have seen the lives of the villagers. The people are really poor and have economic and social problems. <br /> <br /> The movie simply reflects exactly the same. Total credit to the director and the actor. They have done an excellent job. I wonder how movies like Lagaan and Paheli can choose Oscar and not Doghi. I do not understand the criteria on which films are selected. It is the money that makes the difference or having some important names in the film makes the difference. <br /> <br /> I hope to see more movies like this in the future.
