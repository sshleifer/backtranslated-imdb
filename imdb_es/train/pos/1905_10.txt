Simply the funniest and brightest comedy movie of all time ... it's certainly on my personal list of the top ten. This also gets a solid ten on the voting scale. The millionaire heir, Arthur Bach (Moore), is a middle-aged "child" who refuses to take the mature path in life and avoids all the necessary responsibilities. He also refuses to leave the bottle. One day, he and his personal butler, Hobson (Gielgud), go shopping at Bergdorf Goodman and meet the small larcenist, Linda (Minnelli). The chemistry of Arthur and Linda adds electricity to the rest of the movie. There are hilarious sets of pieces in abundance. In one of those scenes, Arthur (drunk throughout most of the story) touches the wrong door of the apartment and receives threats from a human "siren" ("My husband has a gun !!). performances of all involved should be duly noted: Geraldine Fitzgerald plays the loving and ruthless grandmother of Arthur, Sir John Gielgud almost steals the whole show with his acid droll-isms (he took home the Oscar for this) and Christopher Cross offers the theme song (Oscar winner) "The best you can do") It is a pity that the late Dudley Moore died last month (March 2002).
