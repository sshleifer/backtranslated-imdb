There has never been anything like it, that's for sure. This episodic trilogy, seemingly redundant, only makes sense in general, and as such is not a movie about Groovin 'Gary, Utah, feeling of transvestism. It is a film very aware of how the filmmaker REACTS Groovin 'Gary. For Harris, the whole project is clearly an extended and spectacular contortion of guilt and regret. He is trying to atone for his sins: yes, Gary tried to commit suicide after the initial document was issued, through correction, commentary and convention, and claimed such Hollywood narrative candidates as best friend and challenging happy ending (two different, with a revealing setting in the Glover version) and turning them into their own very personal uses. So, although thematically it is still a film about gender and difference, the structure guarantees that it is also a movie about MOVIES, but at a level of complexity almost without precedents. There are so many things happening; By telling and retelling this story, Harris is in the right place at the right time three times in a row, and does not miss the opportunity to do something about it. Immensely moving, and as deep as the camp never sets.
