This film is about the subtlety and difficulty of navigating the ever changing boundaries of customs, race relations and desire. Of course, it's not a movie for everyone. There are no car chases, no building exploits, no murders. The drama lies in the tension suggested by the looks, the minimal gestures, the spatial limits, the lighting and the things that are left, sometimes in a very ostensible way, without saying. It is about identity, memory, community, belonging. The different parts of the film work together to reinforce the motives of the self and the other, identity, desire, limits and loss. The attentive and sensitive viewer will be rewarded. It will not please those whose palates require an explosive, massive and spicy action. It is a beautifully filmed human story. That is all.
