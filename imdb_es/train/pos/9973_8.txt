I really liked this version of 'Vanishing Point' compared to the 1971 version. I found the 1971 version quite boring. If I can get up in the middle of a movie several times (as I did with the 1971 version) that is not so good for me. Of course, this could be due to the fact that I was only nine years old when the 1971 version was published. However, I have seen many remakes, where I liked the original and the previous one. I discovered that the plot of the 1997 version was more understandable and had basically remained true to the original without undermining the meaning of the 1971 version. In my opinion, I felt that the 1997 version had more emotion and was not so "blase" . (Boring)
