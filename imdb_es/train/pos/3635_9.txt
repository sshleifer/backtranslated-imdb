['This is a great Disney movie. It&#39;s the story of an aging high school baseball coach (Dennis Quaid), who once headed to the majors as a pitcher, but suffered an injury late in his career. But through a series of events, Jimmy Morris (Quaid) is tested with a Major League team and even makes the roster. This is a great movie for the family. It&#39;s inspiring, but it&#39;s not very fun. It is fun and entertaining. Adults will enjoy this movie. besides kids.it is based on a true story, although I&#39;m sure the filmmakers took some liberties in telling the story. Quaid is sensational as the title character, very convincing. If you are looking for a movie for the whole family You can enjoy, look no further.9 / 10']
