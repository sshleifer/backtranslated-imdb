Currently in the new METOO schedule at 4 pm on weekdays, just after "Maverick" and just before "Wild, Wild West" (followed by "Star Trek"). <br /> <br /> I do not know if I ever really saw an episode from when I was originally, but I'm really enthralled by that. Extravagant, unusual, surrealist stories set in a mythical West. Something like the "naked city" of the Westerners. <br /> <br /> The guest stars are there: Dan Duryea, Lyle Bettger, Brian Donlevy, MacDonald Carey, Rick Jason (as a treacherous Mexican), a young Dick Van Patten, Jack Lord, Noah Berry, Jr. ( as a colorful Mexican), Martha Hyer, Marguerite Chapman, even Ann Robinson ("War of the worlds"), Gloria Talbott ("I married a monster from outer space") <br /> <br /> It was executed during EIGHT SEASONS, more than 200 episodes, from January 1959 to December 1965. <br /> <br /> Eric Fleming is quite remarkable as the trail chief Gil Favor, the most solid man who ever lived, with the code of honor of a samurai, and the perfect balance between hardness and frankness. I would vote for him for president any day. (PS: I had a very interesting biography: http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0281661/) <br /> <br /> And a young Clint Eastwood is quite amazing as his impulsive right hand, "Rowdy" Yates . In addition, the veteran western actor and country music figure (the immortal "One-eyed, One-horned, Flying Purple People Eater") Sheb Wooley is there as the experienced explorer Pete Nolan. And Paul Brinegar is the most cantankerous character of a chef you could ask for as "Wishbone". <br /> <br /> And then there is that great musical theme, played by the immortal Frankie Laine. (Between that and the "Maverick" song, I have songs of western themes running through my head all day long). <br /> <br /> I wait for all the episodes; I'm collecting the whole. A good time is always guaranteed (not to mention a moo-ving experience), since one waits to see if the children will solve their difficulties before the commercial. <br /> <br /> "Rollin ', rollin', arrive '..."
