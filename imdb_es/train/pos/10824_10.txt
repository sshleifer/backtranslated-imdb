"Still Crazy" is undoubtedly the best rock comedy of all time. It has been mistakenly compared with "This Is Spinal Tap", which has no relation to. "Spinal Tap" is a satire (and, frankly, not very good, despite its "exit" from many rock cliches). Unlike "Tap," "Still Crazy" is populated by great actors, great songs and great human situations. You care about the people in "Still Crazy." That's all that matters. Oh, yes, the music is also pretty good, written by Mick Jones of Foreigner and Chris Difford of Squeeze. The American audience was already familiar with Stephen Rea (The Crying Game), but only later would he become acquainted with Bill Nighy (Underworld, Love Actually, Pirates of the Caribbean II) and Timothy Spall (the Harry Potter films).
