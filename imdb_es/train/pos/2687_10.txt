No other movie has made me feel that way before ... and I do not feel bad. For example, I do not want my money back or the time I waited to see this movie (9 months) nor do I feel bad about using two hours of a sunny summer day to see this ______. The reason why I say "_____" is because no matter how difficult my brain is, it seems that I can not find a word in ANY of the seven languages ​​in which the film was to summarize it. I have no idea what was going on all the time and half the movie needed a break. No movie has done this to me before. Never in my life have I wanted so much cauliflower, milk and baguettes. Thank you. - Ed <br /> <br /> Uh. * clears throat * No words. Without thoughts I do not know. I really do not know. - Cait
