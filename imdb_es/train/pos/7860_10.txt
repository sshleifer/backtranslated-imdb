I had never seen a silent movie until July 24, 2005. I had never seen a movie with Mary Pickford in it. I've seen thousands of movies. Very few are hypnotic to me. I discovered that Last of the Mohicans and Unforgettable (Ray Liotta) is hypnotic, so consider the source while reading this. I started watching Tess of the Storm Country at TCM just to see who this Mary Pickford was, who many have credited for the release of Hollywood. I had no idea what awaited me. Two hours later, I left abruptly and realized that I had seen one of the most beautiful women I had ever seen, playing a role perfectly suited for her. Imagine a movie fan in 1922, you've never seen someone so beautiful and so expressive before. You should see her again and again. The stage was perfect for a girl that expressive. She was a poor illegal occupant, she could not speak the king's English, but you had to admire her. What a movie ... it's time to start my Mary Pickford movie collection!
