No Strings Attached presents Carlos Mencia doing a stand-up that makes us laugh and think. Not only does he make fun of racial issues (as many hate them), but he also talks about the best way to get illegal immigrants out of the country ... what women are referring to when they say they want to be treated by the same ... why the Americans are crazier than the Arab terrorists ... why no one needs to pray for the Pope, and what do you expect him to do in heaven ... a theory of how the Easter traditions began (aka Big Ups to Jesus Day) ... See the movie Passion of Christ and his subsequent discussion with a woman about whether Jesus has affected him or not ... how society should treat the physically disabled ... and even if you have right to tell a joke. or not. <br /> <br /> In addition, it never fails to remind us that each of us has a voice. So we should use it to tell the truth, say what we think and not be afraid if others get offended. <br /> <br /> Carlos is the bomb.
