Freddy (Robert Englund) is letting go and the teenager does not have many memories when he arrives in a new city. When a hard psychologist (Lisa Zane) tries to break up with the new patient. She finds out, where she is from. She takes it to Springwood to awaken some memories, but three teenagers (Lezlie Deane, Breckin Meyer and Ricky Dean Logan), who arrived unexpectedly for the trip. Once they arrived in Springwood, the psychologist remembers that she lived in that city when she was a child. While Freddy knows the true secret of his true identity. <br /> <br /> Directed by Rachel Talalay (Ghost in the Machine, Tank Girl) made a grim sequel but something strangely different with a visual style and fun moments for this horror. / fantasy / thriller. Yaphet Kotto (Alien) has a secondary role as an expert psychologist in dreams. This has some ingenious visual effects (not everyone will love the climax, especially in 3-D) and a good style in their narration. This film rolled some of the movie series at the box office. <br /> <br /> The DVD has a strong panoramic anamorphic transfer (1.85: 1) (also in Pan & Scan) and a strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround sound. Sound. The DVD has the original trailer, the Jump to a Nightmare opinion and the Cast and Personnel information. The Box Set of the series "Elm Street", the eighth album, has interviews with the cast and crew of this sixth film. The sixth movie is also in 3-D for the climax of the movie, but it could also be seen in 2-D. This is the last of the "Elm Street" movies until Wes Craven resurrected Freddy to a different and darker style in "New Nightmare" and in the stupid but surprisingly funny horror movie "Freddy Vs Jason". Watch for Robert Shaye (Co-owner and co-CEO of "New Line Cinema"), Roseanne Barr, Tom Arnold, Johnny Depp and Alice Cooper in funny cameos. Written by Michael De Luca (John Carpenter, in the mouth of madness). From a story by the director. (*** Â½ / *****).
