This film is not only entertaining, with an excellent comic performance, but also politically interesting. It was made at the end of the Soviet Union, but mocks the Soviet mentality until the end. The story unfolds during the early days of the Soviet Union, and questions the reason behind the revolution in both cultural and practical terms. Of course, by the end of the 80s and the beginning of the 90s, the strange strangulations of Soviet society are already relaxed, but the ideology and the mentality are still alive and in good condition for a well-deserved deconstruction. Fortunately, all this deep philosophical commentary is wrapped up in a fun and entertaining package. <br /> <br /> Jur
