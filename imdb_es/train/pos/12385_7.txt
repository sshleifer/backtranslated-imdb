Man, I love the new DVD that Universal released. I have never seen THE SENTINEL look so good, as I had to endure the granulated and malodorous VHS tapes for years. Unfortunately, there are no extras beyond a trailer that looks much worse for wear. AND AVOID DVD Goodtimes at all costs. Stinks. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the worried fashion model Alison Parker (Cristina Raines) moves to the red-stone house in New York City, only that it is something more than a woman's. It is also a portal to hell and the Vatican keeps an old blind priest (John Carradine) to watch over him and make sure that demons and archangels do not escape. <br /> <br /> This has a cast of stars full of actors from yesteryear like Ava Gardner, Arthur Kennedy, Jose Ferrer, etc ... as well as star litters of the 80s. Including Christopher Walken, Jeff Goldblum (Who is the voice? It was mysteriously overdubbed) and Tom Berenger. And you will not even recognize Jerry Orbach of LAW & ORDER. I had to do a double take when I was not in the place where I had seen it before. <br /> <br /> Pretty bloody scenes of Alison cutting the eye and nose of the rotten corpse of her dead father who has been possessed by the devil And there is a clean ending where disfigured and deformed people try to chase after Alison so that He commits suicide, so he will not be the next to protect the portal. It seems that Alison's problematic past makes her the Vatican's main candidate to become the next sentinel. <br /> <br /> An excellent and chilling classic from director Michael Winner's 70 that should not be missed. I also recommended it for those who want something a little more imaginative beyond the stupid teenage jokes and the horror comedy. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10 <br /> <br /> -
