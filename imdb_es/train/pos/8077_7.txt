A film made for the contemporary public. The masses get to see what they want to see. Action, comedy, drama and, of course, sensual scenes. This is not exactly a movie that one would feel comfortable watching with the whole family. It is not for children's eyes. I had to advance a good number of scenes. <br /> <br /> If you're just looking for entertainment, this movie has it all. The songs are catchy. A luxurious production, I must add. <br /> <br /> However, the message of the film is not universal. Emphasis is placed on the idea of ​​karma. That is, if you do it well, you will get well. And if you do evil, you will get evil. The fruit of good works is good, while the fruit of evil is bad. <br /> <br /> In real life, this is not always true. It is well known that most people do not receive justice in this world. While it is true that some evil people find themselves with an evil end, there are many who escape. And then, there are many people who do good and, in return, they find a sad end. <br /> <br /> If you do not mind the message, and all you want is an escape from the mundane reality. , this movie is a good animator.
