A classic series that should at least be repeated or released on DVD. Billy Toth, after realizing that he is adopted after the death of his parents, embarks on a journey to find his true parents. After several rites of passage, his search culminates in the discovery that his father's identity was stolen and used by a trafficker of people in Europe! If I remember correctly, the series ends on the Austrian ski slopes (?) And in a chase on the top of a cliff that results in the death of the traitor of Billys' parents. filmed in different destinations in Europe and with a polished and incredibly well done appearance, with some episodes that cross the realms of the black cinema and the crime thriller. The main arch was often overshadowed by the slices of life Billy went through during his years of work. Find the secrets of his mother and his parents. An act of class but underestimated and forgotten.
