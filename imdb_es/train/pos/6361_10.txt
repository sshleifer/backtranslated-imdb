I have been anxiously awaiting the opening of this movie for several months. Being a big fan of Jim Carrey, I easily saw how he could transform into Seuss's Grinch and make the character his own. I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> This movie was pure magic. Carrey is a master at his craft and no one could have played this role perfectly as he did. There was much to enjoy for both adults and children, and this film will surely become a timeless classic for all to enjoy in the coming years. I already have visions of my little daughter sitting year after year to see this new version on video, and I will definitely see her with her and I will laugh like the first time I saw her. <br /> <br /> Clearly, this The movie has written Jim Carrey everywhere, and I do not think he would have joined without him. However, the cast was charming and entertaining in its own right, especially the adorable Taylor Momsen, which was the perfect complement to Carrey's antics. The stage design, the musical score and the costumes lent themselves to a magical and fabulous final product, and I think everyone involved can be proud. <br /> <br /> It's not an easy feat to turn a 22-minute cartoon classic into a full-length live action movie, but Howard has succeeded. For those critics who do not agree, it may be their hearts that are 2 sizes too small.
