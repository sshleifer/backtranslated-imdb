I just do not understand why this movie is being hit here. OMG. It is foolish, it is not polished and it is wasted (as I am reading) in some. The cast of this movie shows its characters in the 'T' (if you saw Permanent Midnight and you became a Ben Stiller fan, then yes, you will be disappointed). They are misunderstood, well-intentioned misfits trying to save the city / world with nothing but determination and determination. The problem is that they do not realize their limits until the great confrontation and that is the point! This is 3 times more than the movie The Spy Who Shagged Me was criticized by the same demographic, probably the same people who feel that the first AP movie pales in comparison to the sequel. I just do not understand. Jokes work on more than one level; If you did not get it, I know what level you are on.
