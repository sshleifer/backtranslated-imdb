['Some people think that the second series was where Scooby went bankrupt ... I do not totally agree. The quality of the programs did not go up or down, and I gained my opinion, since a very good chrecter.i looked at a survey on jumpedtheshark.com and 72% of people said that the second series of Scrappys was the fall of Scoobys. Well, many say yes, but 28% still can not be wrong. I like the way most episodes focused on comedy. The same mystery of solving 5 people / dogs in the same formula. Scrappy was a breath of fresh air for the show. Sure, some people got disconnected but when Scrappy was introduced he saw DUDO figures. Return to the show All the episodes and segments were very funny. I was intrigued by the yabba shorts and. But at the end of the day it is a matter of opinion if you like the scrappy or it is not a matter of opinion, certainly there is no fact involved. But in my OPINION this was an excellent series That gave a beginning to tire of showing a new formula and a longer life.']
