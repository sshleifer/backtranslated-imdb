['I love sabrina! It&#39;s one of my favorite shows! My favorite episodes are; in which he turns Libby into a geek, the first episode, the true episode of love and most of the rest of the first series. I think the episodes at the university were not as good as those at the high school, but they were better than the previous series, which was horrible. Valerie was a good character since she was more complete than Jenny, but Jenny was in some brilliant episodes. Hilda and Zelda were amazing, and there did not seem to be an explanation for where they were going! Libby was also a good character. I never liked Morgan or Roxy, they just were not as good as their other friends.']
