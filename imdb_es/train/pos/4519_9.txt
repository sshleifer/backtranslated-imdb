Julie Waters is outstanding and Adrian Pasdar a revelation in a very warm, very real and extraordinarily entertaining look at the complications that gender dysphoria and transvestism cause in the life of a young executive. At the heart of this film is the true truth that you must accept yourself before you can expect others to accept you.
