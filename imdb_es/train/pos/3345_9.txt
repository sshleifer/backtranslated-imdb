What I expected: a rather stupid and too stereotyped portrait of a crazy sportsman and an equally stupid portrait of the girl who likes but suffers while being the second fan of her overly jealous support of her favorite sports team. <br /> <br /> What I got: an impartial story in which both the boy and the girl end up admitting, to themselves and to each other, that each one has passions in their lives, but that each one can be forgiven to save the love they share. . <br /> <br /> It sounds silly, but with the uninterrupted humor and excellent performances, this story works! Barrymore is the classic Barrymore: the perfect combination of sweet, strong and adorable. We expect that from her and she gave it to us. <br /> <br /> But Fallon is the pleasant surprise in this movie. It gives the paper the perfect combination of sports nuts combined with appreciation for the normal things in life, such as worrying about children and their girlfriend. Fallon delivers his lines with subtle perfection. He can take care of himself ("You ran across the field for me!") And, at the same time, be blinded by his love for the Red Sox ("How did the grass feel? Something spongy?") At the same time. The representation of Fallon "made" the film. Hopefully, this film marks the beginning of a better film career for Fallon, something that goes beyond the sophisticated humor typical of SNL students (ie, Will Ferrell). <br /> <br /> In short, a film that could have fallen victim to stereotyped male and female characters who overcame that limitation and provided non-stop comic lines, most delivered with brilliant subtlety by Fallon. <br /> <br /> Hey, I saw this with my wife, not a baseball fan, and she loved it as much as I did. It is neither a "Guy Flick" nor a "Chick Flick". It is an excellent movie to make you laugh. Go see it!
