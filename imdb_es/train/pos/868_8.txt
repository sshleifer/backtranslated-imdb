What is very French about this movie is the time it takes to establish the two main characters. This may require some patience, especially since neither of them is "attractive" in the typical Hollywood definition of them. However, once the "robbery" kicks in, the film moves quickly, perhaps sometimes too fast. But it's a real roller coaster and if you do not look closely, everything is pretty believable. The kind of movie you know about Hollywood would have failed.
