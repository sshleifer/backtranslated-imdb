Wow, I forgot how great this movie was until I bumped into it while looking through the garage. It is a kind of strange combination of a biography of Michael Jackson, a collection of musical cartoons and a story about a super hero who fights to save some children. The vignettes are good (especially Speed ​​Demon), but the best part of this movie is the superhero segment, in which Michael Jackson becomes a car, a robot and, finally, a spaceship (and it's so weird) as it seems). Joe Pesci is hilarious, and has enough great images and good music to entertain you! <br /> <br /> However, the real gem is the incredible "Smooth Criminal" video, which makes the movie worthwhile just for that part.
