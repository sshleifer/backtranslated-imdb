He is a classic of the Britishollower who I always wanted to see Food, but monthly he had desaf√≠o. It is based on a popular play that had been filmed several times before (especially in 1931 by the same director, but, unfortunately, this version does not seem to have survived in its entirety!); for the remake under review, the plot has been updated to the current situation of the war at that time. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I was mostly familiar with the primitive British comedians through the films of Will Hay: since it has a similar plot of legendary obsessions, contraband and enemy agents, it is very much in that sense (it was actually written by Hay's regular writing team of Marriott Edgar, Val Guest and JOC Orton); The element of stranded travelers, then, was an equally proven and true formula. The star on this occasion is Arthur Askey (instigated by Richard Murdoch), none of whose films he had seen before, which is a hero as unlikely as Hay himself and whose personality turns out to be as irritating as the potential ... but one soon it warms up depends on him, and Askey, no doubt, presents a series of witty lines and fun business to justify the fact that the main character of the play (and the 1931 film version) was split in two here, with Murdoch acting as the direct partner of the star. <br /> <br /> The unique and remote environment (the events of the film take place largely during a stormy night) provides a wonderful atmosphere; The last half hour, with the sudden appearance of a mysterious couple (Raymond Huntley and Linden Travers) and, finally, the arrival of the own vehicle holder, is especially exciting and well managed. Also worth mentioning is Kathleen Harrison as the frightened stereotyped spinster, with a parrot as her constant companion and who is driven by all the excitement of taking her first drink.
