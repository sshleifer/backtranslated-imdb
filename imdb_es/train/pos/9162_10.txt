Although I did not start reading the "Classics" in literature until I was 47, it's never too late. Jane Eyre is a favorite for many reasons, mainly because there is not a part of the book that I like less, only parts that I enjoyed more. The 1983 television miniseries with Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton was everything I hoped it would be. I saw it as a long-running movie in 2006. Dalton's' Mr. Rochester 'was very good, but I loved' Jane Eyre 'of Zelah. Reflecting on another 'Classics' movie that I saw recently, I was disappointed with the production, the direction and the dialogue. He was only true to the greed and arrogance of Hollywood. The artistic license to the great works of literature is nothing more than plagiarism. Using the title after such a license is a fraud. Let the British get this right (among others). You will not be able to read the book again without reliving the film with its proper context and spirit. Well done BBC.
