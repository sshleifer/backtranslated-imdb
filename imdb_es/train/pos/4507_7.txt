I was really impressed by how impressed I am by a film that is over 60 years old. It's almost two hours long, it has no stars, there are subtitles, but it's interesting and exciting to watch. What impressed me the most was the realism of the film. You can almost feel the coldness of the ice, because you can see that the storms are real. This is a relief in a CGI world like our days. I wondered how much work must have been for Van Dyke. I read somewhere that it took 17 months to film it. Now who wants to talk about 'Titanic'? It is a great movie with a great message and I would recommend it to future directors to see how cool and realistic the films can be if they are only directed with realism instead of visual effects.
