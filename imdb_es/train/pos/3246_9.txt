The first time I saw this movie on cable was 5 years ago and I could not stop laughing. Everything about this movie seemed to click, the story, the characters, the stage. When it comes to movies, I would not call it a great movie, but for what it's supposed to be, it's fantastic. Understand its meaning. The cast is maybe as good as any in a comedy movie. Corben Berbson, Fred Gwynne, Ruben Blades and Ed O'Neil are hilarious. For those who have not seen it, I'll give you a brief synopsis: Four criminals meet in a small town in Montana after receiving a letter from their friend about a bank robbery. However, when his friend is arrested by two policemen who chased him from New Jersey, they try to find out what is happening and all hell will break loose. The film is really a great comedy of banking adventures and is a kind of poor version of Oceans Eleven, only with four criminals that can not stand, and in Montana instead of Las Vegas. In short, if I want to laugh, I strongly recommend that you watch this movie.
