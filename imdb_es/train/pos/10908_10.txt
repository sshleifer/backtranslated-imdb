I could not contain the tears when I saw this beautiful documentary. It was heartbreaking, disturbing and inspiring, all in one. I recommend this documentary to anyone looking for something that makes them think about what they are doing with their own lives. Or simply, something that will make you think. You watch John live the last two months of his life. See how he spends his days with a positive attitude. At one point, you begin to see that he is really an incredible individual. You begin to understand that he has something to teach us all. Your life and your struggles will make you cry, laugh and you will find that life is much easier to live if you take it one day at a time.
