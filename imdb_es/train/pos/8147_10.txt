The fear of a black hat is a hilarious parody of hip hop culture. It's as fun as This Is Spinal Tap, if not more fun. The actors are incredible and the documentary style is excellent. Mark Christopher Lawrence is a great talent who should star in many more movies. This movie is a true cult classic!
