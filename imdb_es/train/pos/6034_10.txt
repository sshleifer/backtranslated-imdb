Last November, I had the opportunity to see this film at the Reno Film Festival. I have to say it was very fun. Apart from some technological errors, it was a great experience. I loved writing and acting, especially the guy who played the lead role. There is a lot of heart in this movie, a lot of wit. I had the opportunity to speak with some of the filmmakers after it was done, and they seemed very nice. In general, the whole movie was just a positive experience, and I would definitely recommend it. The story was entertaining and great, as a woman, I have gone through many of the same problems as the leader, and I could really understand their problems for that. The film does a great job of giving us people we can sympathize with. The friends in the movie are very well written, they are realistic. I know people like these, I just want Imy to be a friend and it might sound as great as these people when we talk. The whole movie is really great, I wish there were more movies like that. <br /> <br /> - Jayden
