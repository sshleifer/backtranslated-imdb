Charming in every way, this movie is perfect if you feel like feeling good. If you like jazz music, you have to see it. If you like to see the adorable characters that make you smile, you can take a tear and swing as if there was no tomorrow, this movie is for you. If you are looking for an intense, deep and heavy piece of art to be dissected and analyzed, it might be better for you to keep something from Darren Aronofsky (in other words, the djjohn critic lights up, do not you know if it's a good time when you See?)!) My only complaint is that the movie was too short. I guess I'll have to see it several more times to fill me up.
