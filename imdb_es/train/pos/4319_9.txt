In the second visualization of this movie, I like it even more than the first time. It is full of nuances and the perception that life is quite common and often fearful, but what elevates this film to a height that is rarely perceived is its focus on the small incidences in our lives to which we usually only We offer the least attention. Here, the film revolves around the celebration of these incidents, the meeting of a driver of a crane and a customer, the runner who hears the cry of a baby in the bushes. The dialogue, the acting, the casting and the direction are excellent. No two to four, no big revelations. What I did observe was how true the characters were about their basic natures and how enriched their lives were when they were celebrated. Congratulations to all involved in this, we need more "Great Cannons" in our lives. 9 out of 10.
