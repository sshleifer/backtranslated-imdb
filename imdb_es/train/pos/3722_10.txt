First of all, I saw this movie without knowing anything about it, I just knew that Joel Schumacher did it and that was enough for me. A friend and I went to see him at a Danish film festival called the night film festival, which is a lot of different movies that are shown after the usual times. The festival specializes in showing films that would not otherwise be seen in Danish theaters. <Br /> <br /> Anyway, my friend and I went to see him and we were amazed at how real he seemed and that really tormented us with our feelings, we really got stuck in the plot without being able to decipher the Final is a great advantage in our book. <br /> <br /> The film is recorded in a style that reminds me of the Danish initiative "dogma 95", initiated by 4 Danish directors, including Lars Von Trier (Dancer In The Dark). <br /> <br /> In conclusion, the film is really worthwhile because it offers a different perspective on how things were for the American GI. Joe is expected to leave school to serve his country in the battle away from home. <br /> <br /> Colin Farrell is also exceptional in this movie. I had not seen it before, but I can not wait to see. More of him. <br /> <br /> Lars P. Helvard
