This game is incredible. Actually, you should get it if you do not have it. Although it is ancient now it was amazing when it came out. I think this game will always be a classic. It's as good as Super Mario World or something like that. When I was young, my friend and I would sit and play this game for hours trying to improve it, which we eventually did. It is not as advanced as Super Mario Galaxy, but if you are a Mario fan it is essential. It is entertaining and challenging fun. Everything you could want from a fantasy game, except the good graphics, (well, it came out in 1996.) ROCK ON 4EVA MARIO LUIGI AND YOSHI !!! Nintendo is the best!
