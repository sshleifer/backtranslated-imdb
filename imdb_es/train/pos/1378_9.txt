I saw this little Belgian jewel two days after watching 'American Teen'. Make no mistake about it, adolescence is a roller coaster, whether American or European. 'Naissance des Pieuvres' (or as it is called in the United States 'Water Lillies') is a story of a young woman of 15 years (played by Pauline Acquart, who sometimes looks like a young Scarlett Johansson) acts in a relaxed way Girl who wants to be on the school swimming team, just to be near another attractive girl (Adele Haenel). It is more than obvious that Marie is more than attracted to Floriane. Among all this is the unattractive and unattractive friend of Marie, Anne, who only wants a boyfriend like any other girl her age. Along the way, we are shown the usual variety of teenage hobbies (broken hearts, stores, alcohol and / or drug use, casual sex, etc.). This is a small and quiet movie that takes time to work and gets into your system (Michael Bay fans, take note: the pace here is slow, so stay away), but if you have no problem with this, Water Lillies He is a charming one. There is no qualification here, but I would throw a difficult "R", due to language, nudity, adult situations.
