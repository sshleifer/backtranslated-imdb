I'm watching it on the Star World network abroad, which buys American and Canadian series that last one or two seasons like The Jane Show. I thought about how many female mainstream comedy shows I'm actually able to see on my own, Lucy, Bewitched, Dream of Jeanie (Barbara Feldman's), and then my mind goes blank, I can not think of any other, Women they are all support roles, not leadership. So for me, The Jane Show is in good company. One thing I just thought though. I've seen several things done in Canada, and I never remember being filmed in a regular television series that shows SNOW! Everything is done at the height of summer, LOL! Of course, it is an excellent place to experience the weather in summer, but THINK you would show a bit of Canada in the winter, since that is also part of the lifestyle there. I mean SCTV, Just for Laughs comes to mind as two comedy shows that lasted a long time filmed in Canada and very little or nothing is filmed with snow present although both make many outdoor shots. I'm digressing, but I laugh that Jane and her obviously liberal forms are accused of racism to her neighbor, and I like the bald guy and his madness, I found it on par with a UK series called The IT Crowd (I Think) another office comedy with female protagonist. Not in any way the best comedy in history, but a boy says he can see it alone, that is to say something. If I was with my wife, she could really enjoy it, since she deals with sex in the office and things like that could be a good light comedy for couples to see. 7 out of 10
