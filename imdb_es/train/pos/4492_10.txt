['But I want to say that I can not agree more with Moira. <br /><br /> What a wonderful movie. <br /><br /> I thought about it this morning, I wanted to give advice to a fool who had lost money on his debit card for fraud and he wanted to say &#39;Save your money in your pocket&#39; and I realized he was talking like James Mason. <br /><br /> Even though he did not say those words, I still think he would! I&#39;ve never forgotten &#39;Are you carrying?&#39; in his reconciliation with his son, Hywel Bennet: &#39;Always have money in your pocket!&#39; Good advice. <br /><br /> There are no longer enough children who have parents with such implacable but well-intentioned attitudes. Or any father at all. <br /><br /> It would be good for us to reset &#39;t&#39;, &#39;t&#39; and &#39;yours&#39; in our language to show that we care. It is just the same as &#39;tutoyer&#39; in French or &#39;du&#39; in German. <br /><br /> Annex: I just realized that a lot of my observations were about James Mason in The Family Way! <br /><br /> I think it&#39;s because I mixed Susan George with Hayley Mills. Well, easy mistake. <br /><br /> I am in favor of the comments Tho &#39;. <br /><br /> And Spring and Port Wine is very similar to The Family Way. <br /><br /> When you took a girlfriend to the photos in those days, you really had something to say and what to talk about later, something that affected your knowledge of the world and your personal development. <br /><br /> Theatrical experiences are almost real, and they are important in helping young people grow. <br /><br /> It does not happen now, I think, that teenagers can just go to the pictures like we did.']
