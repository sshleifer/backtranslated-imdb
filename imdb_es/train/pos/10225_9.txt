I laughed a lot reading all the stupid comments in this film, <br /> <br /> as it is obvious that the people who criticized the film never saw it, or that they were stupid enough to pay for it. <br /> <br /> The best reason to see it was at Elvira's show a few years ago. Elvira delivered the movie with as much laughter as she could. <br /> <br /> It's a good monster movie, compared to the hundreds of gruesome American movies. Better!!!!
