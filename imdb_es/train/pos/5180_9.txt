There is this private camp in Plymouth, Massachusetts, which has existed since 1959. My grandparents were among its founders, my parents had a place since 1965 and my two brothers now have places there. <br /> <br /> (This has nothing to do directly with the movie, be patient with me. <br /> <br /> I spent summers at Blueberry Hill from when I was five until I was eighteen, and It's for people like me who this film talks about: those for whom a camping group in the forest was, as my fiancee says of me, "the good and happy place." If you've never experienced the lifestyle, the Indian Summer will probably get lost in you, do not bother It's not fast-paced, it does not have quick cuts, the frames are not complicated in the least, it does not have explosions, the dramatic tension that exists is slight, there are no A-list actors , there are no quick doubts to show how smart the screenwriters are (apart from, perhaps, Kimberley Williams' murderous line about how her fianc√© should not "overwhelm her toys.") It is not at all about what this film is about. , more than The Godfather is a slash movie er only because it has a large amount of gore on screen. <br /> <br /> But Indian Summer is the polar opposite. If you have experienced lifestyle, watch this movie. Do not read anymore, just do it. <br /> <br /> For me, this is a 9/10 movie.
