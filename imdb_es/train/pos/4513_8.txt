['A child with ideals who tries to change things around him. A child who is forced to become a man, due to the system. A system that hides the truth and that violates the rights of existence. A child who, inspired by Martin Luther King, stands up and tells the truth. A family that falls apart, and fights against it. A movie that you can not hide from. You see things, and you hear things, and you feel things, that until the day you die, hope has never really happened. Violence, frustration, abuse of power, parents who can not do anything, and a child with, I&#39;m sorry, balls, a child who will not accept things, who will not let anything happen to him, a child with power, and a child who acts As a professional, as if he had never done anything else, he cares about this movie until the end, and anyone who wants to see how the abuse was found in the 60s.']
