Atlantis: The Lost Empire is a better movie than I thought. I never thought that this movie would lead to my expectations. It is true that this movie started slowly, but as the film progressed it became more to my liking. The story takes place in 1914 and it's about a guy named Milo. Milo believes in the legendary Atlantis. Together with his grandfather's friends, he embarks on an incredible adventure. Along the way, you must have friendship, betrayal, trust and more. The cast of voices is great. Surely they know how to take movies only with their vocal talent. The music is nothing special, but nice anyway. The animation is not the best, but it's still good enough. In general, this is a good family movie for all ages. I rate this movie 9/10.
