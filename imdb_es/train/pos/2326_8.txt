Dani (Reese Witherspoon) has always been very close to her older sister Maureen (Emily Warfield) until they both fall in love with their neighbor Court (Jason London). But it is not after a terrible tragedy that the two sisters realize that nothing can separate them and that their mutual love will never vanish. <br /> <br /> This was really a heartbreaking story about first love. Probably the most painful story about young love I've ever seen. The whole performance is amazing and Reese Witherspoon offers a great performance in her first movie. I would give The man on the moon 8.5 / 10
