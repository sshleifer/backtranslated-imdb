This film reinvents the term "Spring Breakumentary". Hans, the fat guy of the group, shows his talents as this generation Chris Farley. Johnny Kansas, "the king of the $ 1 bet", shows that he is no longer in Kansas by constantly increasing bets. Kyle's laugh is really contagious and also offers a bit of eye candy for the ladies (as Matt does). The dwarves, while they had their moments, did not do justice to the Mexican hat dance as it deserves. And finally, we have our protagonist, Ed. He gives hope to all of us, clumsy, wobbly, pale and pale, who are still looking for that special person. And that hope, it's a little place called Cabo San Lucas. While this blockbuster has just missed the theaters, this is a mandatory rental, as we can all relate to one of these Spring Breakumentararions.
