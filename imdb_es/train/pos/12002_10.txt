['Despite having read the &quot;initial comments&quot; of someone who curiously did not like the movie (WHY IS THE ONLY NEGATIVE COMMENT VERY FIRST ON THE LIST?) It was very nice to notice that almost everyone else loved it! Obviously, the Church wanted to emphasize certain points and portray the Prophet Joseph Smith positively, that&#39;s the whole idea. And, in fact, those points were extremely effective. We already know that Joseph Smith was human ... but in spite of that, and despite all the horrendous negative attempts provoked by the adversary, he showed how he could complete an extraordinary work, given by God. I would recommend it to anyone!']
