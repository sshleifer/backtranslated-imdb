I can understand those who do not like this movie because of the lack of knowledge. <br /> <br /> First of all, those girls are not Geisha, but brothel tenants, and one who does not know the difference will not understand half. Of the film, and certainly not the end. This is a complete art work about the life and needs of women in this age. Everything is important, and certainly the way they dress, in the whole movie means more than words. For those who thought it was a boring geisha movie, I would suggest that you read a little about this society before coming to a conclusion that is so out of touch with reality. Kurosawa's work is his life, and I'm sure the director understood the silent meaning of Kurosawa's piece in the right intellectual range.
