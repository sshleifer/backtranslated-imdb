I can be partial, I'm the author of the novel The Hungry Bachelors Club, self-published in 1994. The script was written by my good friend and hungry bachelor, Fred Dresch, who was the inspiration for the character of Marlon in the film. I could not be more satisfied with the trailer, I hope to see the film in its entirety and I will make more comments. But Jorja Fox, who plays Delmar Youngblood, my character, is stellar. She carries most of the emotional vehicles in fine form. I could not have done better! This seems real people, hardly oriented to the formulas and, fortunately, drives my statement against racial prejudice, with grace and sincerity.
