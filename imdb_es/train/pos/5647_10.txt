['I do not want to bore everyone by reiterating what has already been said, but this is one of the best series in history! It was a great pity when it was canceled, and I hope that someone has the good sense to pick it up and start the series again. The good news is that it is on DVD !!!! I ran to the store, picked up a copy and I&#39;m glad to say it&#39;s as good as I remembered it. Gary Cole is a wonderfully dark and spooky character, and all the actors were very good. It is a pity that the network has not continued. Shaun Cassidy, this is a masterpiece. Anyone who enjoys the genre and who has not seen it, should do so. You will not be disappointed. My daughter who was too young to see him when she was on television (she is 20 years old) is becoming very interested and will soon be a fan. She finds him &quot;very twisted&quot; and has enjoyed the episodes he has seen. I can not wait to see the episodes that were not broadcast. <br /><br /> This show is cool']
