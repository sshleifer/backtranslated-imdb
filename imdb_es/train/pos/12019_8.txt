I've seen this movie on Sky Cinema not so long ago ... I must admit it was a very good Western that features 2 of the big names. On the one hand, there is Charlton Heston, who plays the infamous and retired lawyer Samuel Burgade. In the other ... The late James Coburn playing the villain Zach Provo ... seeking revenge on Burgade no matter the cost ...! <br /> <br /> The good thing about this movie was that there were some really good characters. Most of the actors played it really well ... Especially James Coburn, who I think he was really bad at this movie ... But that's how it was ... <br /> <br /> Christopher Mitchum, whom I've seen everywhere in other movies ... Performing Hal Brickman ... I felt that his character had stayed in the cold, but managed to rejoin by joining Burgade, to knock down those of Provo! <br /> <br /> In general, it was a great movie. Very good to see ... Excellent score of the late Jerry Goldsmith. <br /> <br /> Wonderful piece of western character ...! 8 out of 10.
