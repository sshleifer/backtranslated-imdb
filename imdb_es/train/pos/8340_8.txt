This is a very funny, happy and cheerful romantic comedy. You can not go wrong with Meg Ryan's nice laziness combined with the genius of Albert Einstein. Normally, I'm not a fan of fictional stories completely invented about real people, now deceased and unable to defend myself, but I think the late Einstein might have laughed at this. <br /> <br /> It's the 1950s ... Princeton, New Jersey in the spring. The story revolves around a beautiful, young, clueless brain math, Catherine (Meg Ryan), who is ready to marry a stuffed imbecile, a behavior researcher named James, simply because she has the brain she is looking for in the father of your future. children. However, it is love at first sight when your car breaks down and you meet an auto mechanic named Ed (Tim Robbins). As she does not believe that Ed is smart enough, her uncle, who is none other than Albert Einstein, plays Match Maker, helped in his efforts for three mischievous naughty, all theoretical physical physicists. Uncle Albert must make Ed seem smart enough, so he is presented with a farce that portrays him as a physicist ... naturally with fun results. <br /> <br /> Walter Matthau is his usual and hilarious character, and he brings out Einstein's character quite effectively. With his three classmates, Kurt, Nathan and Boris, there is a lot of laughter. The real Einstein had a genuine human side and this movie just goes one step further (scandalous). If you suspend all logic, you can almost imagine that this stupid story is happening! <br /> <br /> It may not be a rocket science (despite its main character) but it's a wonderful and refreshing movie. One of the best comedies of the romantic genre.
