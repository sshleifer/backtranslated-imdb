It is a difficult thing to play a queen. On the one hand, the actress has to be majestic and imperious, and on the other hand, she has to show vulnerability in a difficult situation, as well as the meeting of courage and resolution to overcome the odds, since almost all the films about queens have basic plot. <br /> <br /> Emily Blunt is as radiant as Victoria, but it's not as complete a performance as I'd like, I do not blame her. I can not help feeling that this is an adaptation of the novel Mills & Boon compared to a darker and dramatic film about another young queen, Elizabeth. Therefore, Blunt does not go through the full range of real emotions, at least not in its entirety, since she is, you know, the young Victoria. To see old Victoria, visit Mrs. Brown. <br /> <br /> Jean-Marc Vallee is an interesting choice of director for the film. The last time you did C.R.A.Z.Y. It was excellent and it propelled him to fame. It was a very different movie, but I remember that it looked beautiful and that is probably the main similarity between the two films. But while Vallee wrote C.R.A.Z.Y., this one was by Julian Fellowes, and although I really enjoyed his Gosford Park, the story of this movie was much less interesting. I soon got lost with all the government policy. Maybe it was less attractive because there was no possible beheading of the monarchy. Just say.
