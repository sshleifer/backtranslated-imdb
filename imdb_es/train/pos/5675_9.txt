['Blackadder 3 is probably the Blackadder series that less people have heard about: basically it has the same principles as the second and fourth and it has nothing revolutionary about it. But it&#39;s still great: an ardent Duke of Wellington and a fool and fat Dr Johnson (writer of the first dictionary in England) make this series worthy of consideration. There are still more funny phrases to offer in this series, and it highlights the humor in a lesser-known era, in historically precise and enjoyable episodes. Blackadder&#39;s third outing is not the most famous and well-known of all, but Rowan Atkinson&#39;s role as steward of a stupid prince is fun and effective, and Hugh Laurie is at his best in this series. Very well! 9/10']
