['This very strange movie does not look like anything done in the west at that time. With its tumultuous emotions and the network of visions, dreams and amazing images, its effect is beautiful and disturbing. The actors are choreographed more like dance than acting. It contains the only sequence of dreams I know that actually resembles a real nightmare (sorry, Dali fans).']
