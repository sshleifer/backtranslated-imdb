['My father was the director of the prison (he is now retired), he is shown in this documentary and I have grown in prison life, so perhaps my points of view are totally different from the others who see this movie. I will say this, the filmmakers who brought us this 93 minute miracle are fantastic artists and even better people. They were brave enough to: A) Appear and tell this story, B) Enter into the minds and hearts of these interns, and C) Do all this responsibly. Responsible for their art and, most importantly, responsible for the inmates and staff of the Luther Luckett Correctional Complex. They should be congratulated endlessly for this work. Taking 170 hours, yes, HOURS, of archival material and being able to reduce it and reduce it to 93 minutes of riveting is nothing less than extraordinary and you have my greatest respect. <br /><br /> I saw this movie in circumstances that only very, very few could see it. I was on the inmate exam. He was in the same room with these men as they watched their hearts pour out on the screen. I saw men crying on television crying in the chair in front of me and let me tell you it was a very deep experience. These men have committed horrendous crimes in some cases, but have found ways to try to redeem themselves, even if they consider themselves irredeemable. How many of us have the courage to do this? How many people could do what they have done in such a harsh environment? Seeing them react to the movie was an experience for which I am eternally grateful, and I will never forget it. I thank the men who allowed me to glimpse their lives, I thank my father for making ALL of this possible, and I thank Philomath Films for taking the time to shed their blood, sweat, soul and tears on this project. <br /><br /> This movie will change everything you think you know about life in prison and the inmates who are inside it. &#39;Oz&#39; is not real, television is not real. &#39;Shakespeare Behind Bars&#39; is.']
