At first I was not sure if I was watching a documentary, a propaganda movie or a dramatic presentation. I guess given the production time it was a mixture of the three. <br /> <br /> It is true that the dramatic plot was something predictable. But you had the feeling that there would be some interesting scenes as the movie progressed. We were able to witness what appeared to be realistic regimes and training teams. <br /> <br /> Where this movie came together for me, it was closer to the end. The scenes had a realism (at least as I perceived it) that I have not encountered often before. You could put yourself in action and imagine the thoughts of the young combatants. This mixed with the usual problems of portraying passable Japanese soldiers at a time when he might think that real Japanese actors would be somewhat scarce. <br /> <br /> The film is excellent as a source of the state of the American mentality In 1943 as the war waged with Japan. Also of interest was a push to the Japanese regarding the help that EE. UU He gave Japan in recent years.
