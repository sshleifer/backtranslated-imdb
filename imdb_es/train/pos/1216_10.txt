When I was a kid, I preferred the first Care Bear movie, because it seemed so dark. I always sat down and looked at the first one. As I got older I learned to prefer this one. What I do believe is that this movie is too dark for babies, but as you get older, you learn to treasure it because you understand it more, it does not seem as dark as it was when you were a child. <Br /> <br /> This movie, in my opinion, is better than the first, everything is much deeper. You can contradict the first movie, but you must ignore the first movie to see it. The puppies are too adorable, I rewound that scene from 'Flying My Colors'. I tend to annoy everyone by singing. <br /> <br /> The sound track is great! A great hand for Carol and Dean Parks. I love all the songs in this movie, I've downloaded them all and that's all I hear, I hear "Our beginning", also known as "Remembering" at this moment. I have always preferred this sound track to the first one, although I love the song of Carol Kings in the first movie 'Care-A-Lot'. <br /> <br /> I think the animation is great, the animation in both movies are fantastic. I was surprised when I sat down and I saw it about 10 years later and I saw that the animation for the time was excellent. It was really amazing. <br /> <br /> There are not many backup copies of other people to say that this movie is great, but it is. I do not think it's weird / weird. I think it's a wonderful movie. <br /> <br /> Basically, this film is about how the Care Bears came about and how to defeat the Demon, Dark Heart. The ending is amazing and, again, beats any 'Pok√©mon Movie' with the problems of Care Bears Moral. Leave an effect on you. Once again, this film can teach everyone in all ages about morality.
