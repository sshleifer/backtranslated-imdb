This is a complex documentary that shows many things about early gay life. To put it in perspective, it was when Gay was the word used for the homo-sexual revolution, and not just Gay as a descriptor. Or is it still used that way today? I think most of the film comes from around 1968 to 1989. It was released in 1993, so it has already existed. <br /> <br /> I was touched by the documentaries that capture the love of one man for another of more than 20 years. period of the year A love expressed in ways that only true love can be. There are many scenes of incredible empathy and pain, along with scenes of joy and pleasure. There are scenes of life as homo-sexual and life as gay. The film itself was a work of love, and I think it's a diamond. <br /> <br /> At least one will draw from this film an understanding of the devastating impact of AIDS. As I write this, I'm thinking how much earlier it seems to me that this movie was established. The advances in science, politics, social science and culture that have taken place since this film was shot (about 15 years ago) are amazing. However, obviously, in the case of the AIDS disease itself, we are not finished yet. Heck, I guess we have not finished on all fronts. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's just a pretty good documentary. I would encourage anyone who feels they do not understand gay life, gay issues or the devastation of AIDS to watch this movie.
