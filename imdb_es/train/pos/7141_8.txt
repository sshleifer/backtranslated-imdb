Since the death of Siskel and the absence of Ebert, the show has been left in the hands of Richard Roeper. Roeper is not a film critic, he only criticizes anything that he does not personally like, that is, films with country music are criticized because "I do not like country music". and movies for children get a standard "Do not see it now, wait until it comes out on DVD and get it back to your children!" Roeper may well be a wise idiot, but in some other field. The weekly guests to "sit" for Ebert perform better, but who wants to choose a margarita in the middle of a cow pat? All this said, it is the only show in the city and that alone makes it worth seeing. As for Roger Ebert, if Stephen Hawking can talk, you can too! It is your mind and thoughts that we long for. Do whatever it takes to get that usurper out of his self-declared throne.
