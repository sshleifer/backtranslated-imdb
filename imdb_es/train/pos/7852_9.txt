The curiosity of Ladislas Starewicz with insects and cinema is merged into a short film about a love triangle between Mr. Beetle, an artistic grasshopper and Mrs. Beetle. The fairly simple story of a pair of adulterating beetles that both seek encouragement outside of their marriage is similar to a Biograph or Vitagraph before time. Starewicz's turn in the story is to use embalmed beetles with wires that straighten the legs in a frame-by-frame animation. The story unfolds as, unknowingly, Mr. Beetle is captured by the camera with a dragonfly from a local nightclub by a jealous grasshopper. When Mr. Beetle arrives at his house to find his wife in the arms of his artistic friend, he pursues her angrily, but finally forgives her and takes her to see a movie. However, Mrs. Beetle soon learns about her husband's infidelities, since the movie they see is the filming of the jealous grasshopper Mr. Beetle and the dragonfly together. Mrs. Beetle beats Mr. Beetle with his umbrella, Mr. Beetle jumps through the screen, and both end up in jail after the projector they set on fire. The insects are placed in humanized environments, such as a house or a nightclub, and are given human characteristics of jealousy, anger, lust and revenge. Insect characters carry suitcases, drive cars and even wear shoes, but they also move their antennae and open and close their jaws as real insects would. The novelty of the story does not wear out, even after several visualizations, but in spite of how fluid the movements are, the film moves slowly. The action occurs with intricate details, but the speed and faster pace of filming are lost in the process. Despite its pace, the film is an excellent example of Starewicz's first puppets and is highly recommended.
