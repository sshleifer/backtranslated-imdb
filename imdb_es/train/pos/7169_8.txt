In general, "children's" films have an annoying quality that makes them too sad and unbearable for someone over 13 years of age. But, again, that's before Holes arrives on the scene. Of course, it has the same moments that often give a movie for children the quality mentioned above, but this movie does a good job of moving away from such conventions. The acting was decent, and the uncomfortable dynamics that Stanley had with some of the other campers was more realistic than most of the films seek to portray. What I liked most about this movie was the fact that this movie did not try to break your heart or make you cry. The emotional power was a little more natural than most could imagine, something like The Shawshank Redemption in many ways (which Holes also has a similar redemptive ending). The only drawback? The hokey looking for lizards. In general, however, an 8/10.
