Some guys think that the sniper is not good because the action was not good enough. Well, if you consider it as an action movie, this point of view could be quite true, since the action part of this movement is not really exciting. However, I think this is a psychological drama instead of an action one. <br /> <br /> The film told us mainly about the inside of two snipers who definitely had different personalities and experiences. Tomas Beccket, who was a veteran and had 74 confirmed deaths, seemed to have a cold heart. However, after Beccket showed his dream of Montana, we can clearly see its softness inside. It was the cruel war and the sacrifice of his companions that made Beccket a "cold heart". <br /> <br /> Millar, on the other hand, was a newcomer, a green hand, and was not even qualified as a sniper. Billy Zane did well enough to show Millar's hesitation and fear when he tried to "put a bullet in the heart" (as Beccket said). What he thought about the suicide mission was that it could be easily achieved and then he could return and receive the prize. <br /> <br /> These two guys were very different in their personalities and I think the film had successfully shown the difference and the impact they had on each other because of the difference in their personalities. These two snipers were fought, suspected and finally reached an agreement through communication and what they had done to help even save the other. <br /> <br /> Sniper is not a good action movie but a good psychological one
