************** Possible spoilers ********** There is only one reason why I saw this movie and it was because I am in love with Richard Belzer. (I do not know much about humor.) There were some parts that were fun, like Barbie and Ken Spoof and the traffickers and the president of the parody.Keep in mind that this is sometimes rude (Dare, do I say raw?) Sometimes It was fun, but it could have been better, probably if they had spent more time in humor and less time in undressing women, the movie would have been more fun, some skits just make you want to throw up, and shudder, others make you laugh and, oddly enough, they think .. Unfortunately this movie is dated.If you like Richard Belzer (it's worth it) it's worth checking it out and seeing Chevy Chase.
