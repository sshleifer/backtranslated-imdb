Every time people ask me to name the most terrifying movie I've ever seen, I invariably answer "Black Noon" and to this day nobody has ever heard of it. <br /> <br /> I saw her alone about 30 years ago at the tender age of 13 when my parents had gone out at night. As far as I know, it has only been shown once in the UK and unfortunately it is not available on DVD or VHS. <br /> <br /> If someone can trace a copy, let me know. <br /> <br /> If I saw him again now, it would probably be a great disappointment, but it has always remained in my memory as a particularly disturbing little film!
