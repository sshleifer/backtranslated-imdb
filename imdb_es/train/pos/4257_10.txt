['This film about two Italian brothers who came to Germany with their family is great! <br /><br /> It is not an idealistic film, I would say it shows life as it is or was in the 60s and 70s when the main story took place. The characters are very nice but also have some &quot;dark&quot; sides, which makes you believe that these are real people. Great movie with great actors to show that life is not fun all the time, but that you can find happiness with &quot;fire and passion&quot; as the main character that Gigi would say.']
