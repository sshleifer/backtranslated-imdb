(Spoilers?) <br /> <br /> While historical accuracy might be questionable ... (and with the massive appeal of the inaccurate LOTR ... those things can now be more easily excused) I liked the art of do what. Although it's not really an art movie. It provides a bit of emotionally charged scenes from time to time. <br /> <br /> I have two complaints. 1. It is very short. and 2. The voice you hear whispering from time to time is not explained. <br /> <br /> 8/10 <br /> <br /> Quality: 10/10 Entertainment: 7/10 Playable: 5/10
