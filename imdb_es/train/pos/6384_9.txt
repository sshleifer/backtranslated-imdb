It is written in stone that Disney animations should simply be musical. Right? Where? Show me Because I found this attempt to be much more pleasant for ~ no ~ that contained Disney's standard five-year Disney fare. <br /> <br /> While the story was not as fascinating as it could have been, it was still pretty good, enjoyable and adventurous. I expected a little more, yes, considering the subject, but this movie is not the bitter disappointment or the absolute failure that has been considered. <br /> <br /> The quality of the animation is average, but the dialogue is quite convincing, like the story line, the plot, the secondary plot and the amazing creativity that I found in this production. I will refrain from outlining the plot, as has been done and done, but this movie is worth seeing if you are a fan of fantasy. <br /> <br /> This is, in my opinion, THE BEST Disney Animated Feature Film. <br /> <br /> Rate a 9.4 / 10 of ... <br /> <br /> the Devil :.
