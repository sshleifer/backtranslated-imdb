I must say that this is one of the best animated movies I've seen. I liked it the first time, but I really appreciated it on the second visit, just a few weeks ago. I can see why the sequel is doing great business at the box office. Apparently, a lot of people liked this movie. <br /> <br /> A magnificent palette of colors (man, looks good) and a lot of adult good humor (but clean) make this a great winner. The initial scene of 3 to 4 minutes with "Scat" is excellent, since they are later interludes with him. "Sid" the sloth (voiced by John Leguizano), however, provides the main humor of the film. Usually, it has something funny to say throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> Ray Romano is the voice of the mammoth, the great character of the movie, literally, while Denis Leary is the fierce bad guy who has become the bad guy. Saber-Toothed Tiger <br /> <br /> This is not just humor and pretty colors, but a beautiful and sentimental story of how a little baby softens a couple of difficult characters. This is also not interrupted with many songs: only a brief one and there is nothing offensive, in terms of language. <br /> <br /> If more animated films were so good, I would have more.
