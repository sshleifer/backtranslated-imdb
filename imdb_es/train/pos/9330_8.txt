"Dangerous Offender" is the story of a seemingly antisocial girl, and how it came to be that way. It is based on a true story, and although I was irritated by the description of a note, that is, always with a frown, the character of the title and the hard-to-believe dedication of his lawyer, I am forced to accept that life imitates art. , and that there are people out there like that. <br /> <br /> The film is successful, for me, because although the attitude of the title character is softened slightly until almost the end, one gradually moves towards sympathy for it. , as the film shows how it got to its current state, which proves to be self-destructive, rather than antisocial. <br /> <br /> Truly a touching movie, which will open a knot in your throat when you think about it, which will be frequent. <br /> <br /> Despite its many shortcomings, (including that it is difficult to see, sometimes, due to bodily functions and suicide attempts) this is another production that I am proud to call Canadian.
