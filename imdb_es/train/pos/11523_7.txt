This is one of the funniest movies I've seen. I saw it on a DVD, and the disc does not have any special features, not even a menu, but that's not necessarily what matters to me. <br /> <br /> I tend to judge the films on a case by case basis, depending, among other things, on whether it's a large studio production or a smaller movie. This is a smaller film and I am willing to forgive minor things. That said, I think it has one of the most imaginative and original title sequences I've seen. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the performance of all the main players. I especially enjoyed Til Schweiger and Alan Arkin. Alan Arkin has most of the funniest lines. The character represented by Claire Forlani may seem unrealistic to some people, but I have personally met real people with emotional problems who see the decisions of life as their character does. That helped me capture the nuances where his pain could come out of his mood. <br /> <br /> This is not a children's movie, obviously, but it DOES NOT get involved in free sex and nudity. However, there is a bit of adult language, but sometimes it can be a lot of fun. (In particular, the character of Alan Arkin, who can not even swear correctly). <br /> <br /> Also watch the cameos of the actors of known characters.
