I and 2 sisters watched the 3 series of Tenko and I agree that this is, by far, one of the best series of the BBC. The whole cast was very convincing in the parts they portrayed, and although the 3rd series was somewhat slower, it was convincing to watch and my nights were not. I know the same without him. Without a doubt we will see it again, since it is a series that I would never tire of seeing. Excellent viewing and outstanding recognition for the BBC for such a brilliant series and casting. First level in all departments. and I would recommend this series to anyone, although some age limits due to some adult material should be taken into account. We thank the BBC for launching this series on DVD and video.
