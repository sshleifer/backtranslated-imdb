['Paris is the ideal place to enjoy beautiful art and music, and fall madly in love, as is the case in this film. The boy meets the girl, they fall in love, but something gets in the way of eternal happiness, classic history. <br /><br /> The wonderful music of George Gerschwin complements the great dance of Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron. &quot;An American in Paris&quot; is a humorous, happy and loving film that is worth seeing. <br /><br /> 8/10 <br /><br />']
