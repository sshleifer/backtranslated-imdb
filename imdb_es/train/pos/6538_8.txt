I really enjoy this movie. He managed to do something that few movies do now; It provided family values ​​while I entertained myself. Nancy Drew is a heroine for all generations and a role model for young girls. The girls I was with enjoyed the movie and they kept talking about Nancy when we left the theater. The film has relatively few problems for families and I do not think parents get bored sitting in the theater. No, he will not win an Oscar and he did not exhibit magnificent special effects or provide a horribly creepy mystery, but he entertained me and stayed true to the spirit of the books. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone with a girl (she will love it!) Or any book fan. You will not be disappointed.
