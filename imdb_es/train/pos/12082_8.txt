Having seen this movie strictly on the basis of the ratings of the critics, I was pleasantly surprised. Although clearly low budget, shows signs of ingenious ingenuity. For example, when Julia wakes up in the strange house and looks out the window, I found myself thinking that her sense of isolation would increase with an outside shot focused on her face and then backing up to include the house and its isolated location. And here and here! The next scene was exactly the last shot of the house, standing alone on the cliff at the water's edge. There are other examples of how an intelligent director can elevate his film to the level of a very pleasant thriller. Surely, experienced viewers will see them, but they must be sure that they will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> As for the performances, George Macready is his usual and creepy self, which barely maintains his composure and suggests a capacity for unadulterated violence. Nina Foch was surprisingly good as the sensible worker who is not willing to submit without fighting. But Dame May Witty, oh boy, even made me doubt my own eyes and believing that I could get away with his evil plans. <br /> <br /> This is a real diamond in the rough and you can not miss it.
