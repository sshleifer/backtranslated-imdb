One of my favorite movies, with a very nostalgic ending. The film is about the Sullivan family, obviously Michael Sullivan (the father) is one of the main members of the mafia, the murderer who says it this way, and an expert. One of the children wants to know his father's work (a terrible mistake), so he hides in his father's car and, well, he sees Tom Hanks in action to say it this way. <br /> <br /> Mafia does not do it There are no rules, in the mafia nobody wins, when they want you out, they take you out. Of course, you can see anyone working in the mafia with a giant house, the best car in the world, whatever you want, but do a wrong job or do something that your "boss" does not want, and you're fired. , and killed. <br /> <br /> You can see what I mean in the movie, Sullivan Jr. sees something he did not have to see, and well, almost his whole family is killed by that "wrong thing". your son did it The movie is really entertaining, you can see how the sullivan live after being chased by the mafia, or something like that. <br /> <br /> This movie is a sad thing, it shows us about revenge, those dirty jobs that people do, almost everything you like. Hopefully, the guy reading this commentary will not work for the mafia, and if he works in the mafia, do yourself a favor and leave the country before his boss and his workers kill him. <br /> <br /> This movie receives: 10/10
