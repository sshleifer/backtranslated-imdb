['Eric Clapton, Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker come back together to play all their songs from 35 years ago when they formed a trio called &quot;Cream&quot;. Those were the psychedelic days of England and America and these guys seemed like it: all thin, very long hair, wild clothes and music at full volume. They played a combination of rock and blues and it was, for the most part, good stuff. <br /><br /> Well, these guys are now 60 and they can still sing and play at a high level as this wonderful DVD concert disc shows us. Of course, I was always very familiar with Clapton, who has never been outside the spotlight, but I did not know what to expect from Bruce and Baker, neither of whom I had not seen in decades. I was surprised When I was young, Baker was so emaciated that he seemed a phenomenon of speed near death. Now he looks healthy, fit and playing the drum was solid. Bruce looked a little haggard but his voice is great, as good as ever and it&#39;s a pleasure to hear in these old songs. This is just an excellent material and performance of guys who know what they are doing. <br /><br /> Some people criticized this show for being discreet. I do not agree with that. I have no complaints The concert sounded very good. The second song, &quot;Spoonful&quot;, was exceptional, the highlight of the concert for me. <br /><br /> Highly recommended']
