Although I liked On the Town, I liked it a lot. I'm a newcomer when it comes to Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly. Although I had heard about them, I had never seen anything with them until recently. The first one I saw was Singin in the Rain that made me a fan of Gene's. I think that's better too. But I thought that this movie was good and like all movies, there are some parts that are better than others, but in my book it is an awesome movie and I love it. Frank and Gene make a good team. I still have to see them together in Take me to the ball game. But I stick to my guns saying that I really enjoyed it, and that I love it!
