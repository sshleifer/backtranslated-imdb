I anticipated that this film would be decent and possibly clich√©, but I was completely wrong! Charlie Cox (I had never heard of him until now) played an incredibly good man leader; It was so serious and romantic, my friend and I who watched the movie with me fell completely in love with him. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes, whom I used to love (LOVES her in Romeo and Juliet), made her enjoy it even more. Her acting was fantastic, she could not even tell that she was American. The chemistry between her and Charlie Cox was extremely good, the casting was pretty perfect. <br /> <br /> Robert DeNiro and Michelle Pfeiffer were equally well organized; DeNiro like that gay pirate ... it's priceless, it's priceless. I laughed so much about that scene in which Septimus comes on the ship ... My God, wow. Pfeiffer played a decent villain, I liked it like Hairspray's mother. But she had the right amount of melodrama and sarcastic comments throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> In general, it was fun (but not slapped at all), romantic, special effects were not totally frequent, but when they were, they were great; The cameos of Ricky Gervais and Peter O'Toole were also well placed. <br /> <br /> I totally recommend this movie to anyone who likes fantasy movies like Princess Princess or even Lord of the Rings. I kept my interest all the time and I'll buy the DVD when it comes out!
