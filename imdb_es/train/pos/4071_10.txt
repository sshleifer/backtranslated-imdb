The first time I saw this movie was when I was about seven years old and I was completely delighted, but for years I could not figure out what the movie was called. I am now twenty-one years old and stumbled upon the film by accident about two weeks ago and bought a copy. Although my memory of the film was a bit confusing, I was not disappointed in what I saw. The animation in this movie is excellent, evoking a whole world that is so believable and so well animated that you are attracted to the movie just for that. But this movie also has an argument that will delight and entertain adults and children alike. With a floating island, a crazy general, a friendly pirate grandmother and a well-constructed love story, this movie will not disappoint you. I would recommend this movie to anyone.
