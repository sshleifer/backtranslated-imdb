['I am 14 years old and I love this caricature. Burt Reynolds and Dom Deluise make a great pair. This movie is very funny and I love the songs. My favorite songs are &quot;You can not keep a good dog down&quot; and that song about sharing, I think it&#39;s called &quot;What&#39;s mine is yours&quot;. This was the last film with Judith Barsi, who played the voice of Anne-Marie. My favorite character is Charlie, but I find it very funny to hear Itchy&#39;s voice. Although some scenes seemed really terrifying, I still have a hard time watching the scene with Charlie&#39;s dream, and Carface scares me very much. Other characters like King Gator seemed very funny to me. The ending was lovely and it was really sad, it made me cry a little. I give this movie 7/10.']
