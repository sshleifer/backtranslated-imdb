It is interesting how the research train can flow. I started by looking at an article on "The Gates" of Christ in Central Park. The article claimed that the maysles had been Christ's filmmakers for years. Hmmm ... Then I started looking at his body of work. I think one of them has passed away, but the other one is still filming Christ and Jean Claude in their stages of creation. The gray gardens sounded very interesting. Video Station, in Boulder CO, is the place to look for the dark or unconventional and, of course, they had it in stock. DVD and VHS. Edith and Edie are women who live in the past, and oh, what a glorious past it was! Edith had enjoyed good fortune, was born in Bouvier, married well, had several wonderful relationships and became a singer when she was about forty years old. His daughter Edie had been a debutante, a fashion model and had had many beaus. She never married and at some point in her thirties had come home to recover. She seems to have a nervous disorder of some kind. To worry too much about things. However, it is only a shadow of the world in which they live, because Jackie O. came and arranged the place so that her aunt and her cousin were not evicted. It is a 28-room mansion that is worn and worn. But, in the movie you will notice fresh paint on the walls. If you look closely at the newspaper clippings, you will see that it was a dirty mess. The dress that Edie comes with is very intelligent and creative. The viewer has the impression that Edith likes to go nude, but not in the movie. Edith was really beautiful and you can still see the shadow of her beauty while singing "Tea for two". Edie was also a beauty in her time and quite attractive at 56. It was a good movie, but not for everyone. When the cat is urinating behind the portrait of Edith, she says: "At least someone is doing what they want"!
