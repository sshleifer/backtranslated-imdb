Without being one of my favorites, this is good to be a change of pace ... if only for a few minutes. <br /> <br /> It all starts with a big fight between Tom, Jerry and Spike (who changes the name of "Butch" here). Everyone is hitting, but suddenly Spike makes a heroic and admirable decision: stop the fight and suggest that everyone should be friends. Then, they all sign a peace treaty and they become friends ... they will not last long. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the three become affectionate, patient and kind to each other. They are even saved when one of them is in danger of life. The relationship is nothing but excellent, until a big steak appears and everyone becomes greedy. All three are guilty of returning to their usual fights and rivalries. <br /> <br /> But still ... seeing Tom, Jerry and Spike as friends is really a pleasant and grateful experience, if only for a while. <br /> <br /> By the way, as a curious fact, here are two songs of "The Wizard of Oz" in instrumental versions: "We are going to see the Wizard" and "Somewhere on the rainbow".
