I remember this series very well. It was excellent: characters so strong and attractive, elegant and sexy ... and very different from everything that was offered at that time, and now ... I'm sure it inspired the excellent Canadian drama "Traders". <br /> <br /> Both Season 1 and Season 2 are available on DVD Region 2 in the United Kingdom. It is a pleasure to see the series again. <br /> <br /> Season 1 has 13 episodes and season 2 seems to be 10 episodes. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it seems to have ended after 2 seasons. <br /> <br /> This series was very funny. <br /> <br /> Sometimes you can get it especially at Amazon.co.uk
