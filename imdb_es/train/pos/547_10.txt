I do not know if I'm weird, but I really enjoyed this movie. <br /> <br /> Returning to Cabin by the Lake is, of course, the sequel to another of my favorite films, Cabin by the Lake. In fact, I think I enjoyed this movie even more than the first one. I also thought that the cast of this movie was great, Judd Nelson is always the best! I also enjoyed the plot as a whole. I liked the fact that this second film focused on the filming of Stanley Cabin by the Lake script; it was not a completely redundant movie in which Stanley grabbed other girls and drowned them. - If you're looking for a deeper meaning, then this movie probably is not for you. However, if you are looking for a fun way to spend two hours, then go see it. I've probably killed at least ten hours watching this movie. :)
