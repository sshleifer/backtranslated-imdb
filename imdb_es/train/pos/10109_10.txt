The incursion of Govind Nihalani in the Vijay Tendulkar novel is brilliant. Om Puri plays an inspector Velankar who is forced to protect the underworld don rama shetty, brilliantly interpreted by sadahiv amrapurkar. This is the most commented film by Govind Nihlan. This is a very good and classic movie. Smita Patil plays the female protagonist in front of Om Puri. Naseeruddin Shah is bright on a cameo paper. Although Sadashiv Amrapurkar has only 4 scenes in the film, he dominates the film. This was the debut as an actor of Sadashiv Amrapurkars. Omi Puri won a national award for this film for the best actor. Winner of the Filmfare Award for the best film, history, supporting actor (Sadashiv Amrapurkar).
