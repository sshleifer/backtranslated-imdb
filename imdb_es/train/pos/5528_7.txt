This is a very beautiful and almost meditative film: there is almost no dialogue, apart from the narration; and the stage and music complement each other perfectly. At first I did not connect the red hair of the girl and the fox until a friend pointed it out to me (he also has red hair!) It is almost a kind of old-fashioned children's movies, saying that children today prefer Animations like Shrek or Toy Story, etc., but I think that young people should know more about the beauty and wonder of nature that this film undoubtedly does. It may not be the best movie of its kind, but certainly an excellent and relaxing view for all ages, not just children.
