It may be the 1987 Autumn's Tale remake after eleven years, as director Mabel Cheung said. Mabel uses rock music as the medium in this film to express her personal attitude towards life, in which love, desire and consequent frustration play important roles. Rock music may not be the best vehicle to convey the deep feeling, and yet it is not too inadequate to use it, since the life of underground rock musicians is much more intense than the current. The director focuses on the representation of subtle affection and the maximum vanity of life instead of mere rock music. The love between father and son, lovers and friends is delivered delicately and movingly through good acting. Mabel does not try to embellish the rock musicians as artists, instead, she tries to reproduce a true life on the screen, making great efforts for years working on this project and gathering information in Beijing's underground pubs. <br /> <br /> Daniel has probably given the best performance in all his movies made so far. His innate discouragement and reticence fit perfectly with the blue mood of the film.
