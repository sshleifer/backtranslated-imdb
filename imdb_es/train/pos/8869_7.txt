In this little movie we have some great characters, but a very superficial plot. Actually, it's nice to see it because Singleton does a great job of presenting esoteric conflicts and interpersonal relationships. This causes the viewer to forget the nonexistent realism for which this film is supposed to be. In fact, what we have here are all the possible clich√©s and stereotypes that are put on the celluloid at a rate higher than that of a soap. It's definitely not a deep movie (even if it wants to be), but it's better than an average college movie.
