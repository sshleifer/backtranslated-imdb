['This is the best movie of all time! I&#39;m sorry, Hollywood! I saw him in the early 70s, he barely appeared on Bulgarian television, and I loved it immediately (he was 14 years old at the time). 25 years later, I bought it on a videotape, and a few months ago it finally appeared on a DVD here in Bulgaria. I live with this movie 35 years ago and so do all my friends and my family. My son was a teenager when he saw him for the first time, and he also loved it immediately (and this is the generation that grew up watching practically only Hollywood movies and without speaking or understanding Russian at all!). What makes this masterpiece of Danelia so special? It&#39;s hard to say, since it&#39;s hard to describe what beauty is ... But the fact is that you can watch this movie dozens of times with the same pleasure as the first time. I can not remember any other movie, no matter how many millions it cost or how good the cast was ... Chapeau, Master Danelia! Bulgaria loves you!']
