I always thought that this would be a long and boring Talking-Heads movie full of static indoor shots, buddy, I was wrong. "Election" is a fascinating and captivating dramatic thriller, which offers a deep and realistic view of the origins of Triads-Rituals. The characters are constantly in motion, and although as a spectator you are always a stranger, it is still possible to feel the suspense coming from certain decisions and ambitions of the characters. In addition, Johnnie To manages to create some truly opulent images due to the meticulously composed lighting and atmospheric contrasts of shadow-light. Although there is almost no action, the ending is still shocking in its ruthless description of brutality. Great movie that deserves more attention, and I quite liked the minimalist acoustic guitar score.
