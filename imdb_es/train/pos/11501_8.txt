I barely remember this show, a little, but I remembered that it was great! My older brother reminded me about the program recently and had seen an advertisement for the D.V.D series that was being published. The network, again, was wrong to take this out of the air, so that they could put what else in their place? I should have spent at least 3 seasons. Why not, right? Sometimes I think network executives believe they are the "gods" of the entertainment world. But they guess and occasionally get a good placement in the show. To say that, they have many more failures than 'hits'. This was one of the bad decisions to cut from the lineup. Anyway, I'm getting this for my collection.
