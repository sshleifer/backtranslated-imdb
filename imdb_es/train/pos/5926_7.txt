Sleepwalkers are creatures that drain the life force completely from humans to survive ... but they can only use virgins (why not). Charles Brady (Brian Krause) is one of those who needs to feed his mother Mary (Alice Krige). It goes after the nice Tanya (Madchen Amick). Will he escape? <br /> <br /> On the one hand, this is a GREAT horror movie. Fast-paced, full of blood and blood, and a nice and twisted sense of humor. There are a lot of joking references for horror lovers (Castle Rock is mentioned once). Krause is also excellent (who would have thought he could act after "Return to the Blue Lagoon") as well as Kirge and Amick. But this movie seems annoying. <br /> <br /> It was written for the screen by Stephen King and it is maddeningly vague. Sleepwalkers are never fully explained. Where they are? Why are they called like that? Why does the son have to feed the mother? Why do cats hate them and can kill them? After all, what are his powers (at one point Krause makes a car disappear AND change color and style)? Why do they need to feed on the life force of people? Why does it have to be only virgins? Why is the son having sex with his mother? None of this is explained by leaving the story confusing. It's really very bad because, apart from those questions, this is an excellent horror movie. Excellent makeup and special effects too. <br /> <br /> Fast, bloody and very funny. If only the script was better. I also edited a pretty explicit sex scene between Krause and Krige (you can say) to get a rating of R. I can only give this a 7.
