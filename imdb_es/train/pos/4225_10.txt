['Ruth Gordon is one of the most sympathetic killers Columbo has had to deal with. And, the plot is ingenious in every way. This is one of the best episodes of Columbo ever. Mariette Hartley and GD Spradlin are excellent in their supporting roles. And Peter Falk offers something extra in his scenes with Gordon.']
