['Probably, this movie never made a signal on the radar screen, but it has enough quality. It&#39;s quite realistic, but you think &quot;it&#39;s just a movie.&quot; Duvall and Close represent ordinary people, and you would not even realize that they are now renowned actors. It seems that the imbecile of this story is too old to be chasing Eugene&#39;s girlfriend, but I suppose it&#39;s possible. It seems unlikely that the child will travel alone from Montana to Nevada, but I suppose it is possible. I might think that the family problems in this movie would never happen in your own family, but I suppose it&#39;s possible. I remember Glenn Close saying something like &quot;you think the job you do is the hardest part of your life, but it&#39;s not.&quot;']
