I love Doodlebops. My son has been watching you for more than a year. We went to the Doodlebops concert last year, as well as a concert yesterday (Connecticut). He loves them. The doodlebops do not teach the alphabet or the numbers but who cares? are you serious? Television is not supposed to teach your children about numbers or the alphabet. Parents must Overcome it. Doodlebops can really sing. Deedee has a beautiful voice and at the concert you can see that all 3 have good singing voices and do NOT sing with their lips. Imagine, they dance, they jump around and they STILL sing. They have talent, children love them, I even enjoy watching the show. This program is by far the best television program for children. And a rock band for children. How incredible is that? Why do people say that Chad (Rooney) is gay? Where did you hear that? Whether or not it is amazing! Leave him alone. It's not as if he or someone else is promoting homosexuality among our children!
