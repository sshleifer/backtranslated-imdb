What are you doing with a 14-inch porn star who was involved in drugs and murders, and then died of AIDS? You make a movie, of course. The probable reason why it was not done before is the fact that Eddie Nash would have been in the way of his production. So it's no coincidence that the movie was filmed shortly after Nash was sent to prison. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the movie is its fast pace. There is no time wasted in unnecessary garbage. And why would it be? Here there is too much good material to require boring filler scenes. The cast is good. Kilmer has been mediocre in a series of films, so finally it was a very suitable role for him. Bosworth is cute, so it is irrelevant the way he acts (is solid), and McDermott, which otherwise is quite annoying, is pretty good, largely because it has so much facial hair that I did not recognize it at first. (I wish they did that to Cruise in all the movies so he would not have to see his silly face). I could not recognize Christina Applegate, and I would not have known that she was there, if I had not seen her name in The Final Credits. Kudrow is charming as always, a little unusual to see her in a dramatic role. (By the way, "Friends" is the worst television comedy of all time.) The only casting options that were questionable were an almost brief cameo by Carrie Fischer and the totally absurd inclusion of 90-year-old jerk Janeane Garofalo. You thought I would also include Paris Hilton, right? No, I think Hilton is the ideal choice in her 10-second appearance as a dumb whore. Why is the film about decadence, among other things? And about a porn actor? she fits perfectly
