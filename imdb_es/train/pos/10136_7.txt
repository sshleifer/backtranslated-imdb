This is one of the best episodes of the second season of MOH, I think Mick Garris has a problem with women ... He killed them all, they are often the victims (Solution Screwfly, Pro-life, Valerie on the stairs , I do not remember the Argento episode in season 1, etc., obviously Imprint). I think he enjoys seeing women burned, tortured, mutilated and I do not know. Never less "Right to die" is one of the best, with good turns, graphic scenes and suspense (especially with the photos of the cell scene, wonderful). The acting is like the whole series, regular could be worse like "Pro-life" or "We scream for Ice cream". I also think that the plot could be made for a movie and not just for an episode. The ideology of the series is horrible, killing and ending with women, mutilating animals and so on ... the first season was better than the second with episodes like "Cigarrette Burns" (the best of all), "Homecoming" more fun), "Imprint" (really shocking).
