I picked up this movie in my local library. Having met the director at a film festival late last year, he was curious to "revise" his work. I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> The film analyzes family themes, love, infidelity, friendships, jealousy. It can be a bit 'talky' at times, but never so much as to completely sink the film. I enjoyed watching a love story with characters that ARRIVALLY are together and watching them make conscious decisions instead of "falling" at random into something as important as love. <br /> <br /> The contrast between this film and the low-budget average shoot-em 'up black film is quite different. Check it out. If you're lucky, your copy will come with a copy of the soundtrack like mine. Good material!
