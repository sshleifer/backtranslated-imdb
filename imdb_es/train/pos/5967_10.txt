Sammi, Curr, a rock metal god, they tried to stop him, they tried to ban it, they tried to censor his music! (as in real life Dee Snider, Twisted Sister, [Tipper Gore] or Ozzy Osborne) Killed in a fire, Sammi Cure was supposed to play Halloween at his old high school to dance .. Now Eddie Weinbauer, his # 1 fan, and the only one who knew how sammi was, and what he felt (or did he do it?) Nuke, the DJ at the local radio station (Gene Simmons) has and delivers the only copy of Sammi's latest album Eddie But when Eddie tries to play the record backwards, he finds Sammi talking to him from the dead and telling him what to do to get it. Back in the school thugs who hate him and his music ... Everything works until Sammi starts killing! A great movie to watch for heavy metal fans, with a great Fastway soundtrack, and in case you do not know how the songs sound or know Fastway and do not like them, they changed their voice a bit. and there is also style to sound like the best known Cinderella, or Ratt ... Is the movie a true horror movie? Well, that depends on what you call a horror movie. For me, a real horror movie is a bully, with many deaths, or just scary. This movie is not enough, there are not enough deaths, but it can not be called action, comedy, drama, suspense or thriller, so I guess it has to be a horror ... So if you want "Rock N 'Roll, Rockin 'at midnight, your soul !! " Than Sammi Curr and Trick or Treat is for you .. I want to say "what are you afraid of? It's just Rock 'N' Roll!?!"
