Thelma Ritter stole the photo. I just finished seeing him again. I could not help but get emotional in his final scene. She did not get the Oscar. That's why you should not put much faith in the Oscars. Richard Widmark never had a better part and was a perfect cast as a three-dimensional and flawed human being. Jean Peters was great as the street girl and lasts in her best role. And Richard Kiley must have been very good; Why else would he have hated it so much? Yes, patriotism was heavy; But, without it, you do not have much film. Look at their faces! The three main stars did not need much script. I would like to have seen them make this film without dialogue. If you've ever seen Ray Milland and Rita Gam in "The Thief", maybe you know what I mean. When I was a kid in 1956 on my first trip to New York, I had my uncle from the Bronx take us to the foot of South Street in search of the number 66. That's when I knew that Hollywood could not be trusted. But I found the river. <br /> <br /> I'm not giving away much of the story because I hate when I know what happens before I see it for myself. If you have seen it, it is not necessary to elucidate. Maybe, someone who is reading these comments has not seen "Pickup On South Street". It will like you; just do not go looking for 66 South Street in New York City.
