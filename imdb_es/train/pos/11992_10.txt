['Since I remember, I have loved airplanes and flights. Now I&#39;m in college with a private pilot&#39;s license and I&#39;m looking to become a commercial. I could never remember why I was so obsessed with the subject until I stumbled upon my old Tail Spin tapes in my basement at home and realized that this was it. My parents bought each of the tapes they had and this was the only program I would see as a child. I had the subject memorized as I grew up and I can still quote it today. It&#39;s absolutely incredible and I plan to buy the DVD&#39;s soon! It really is great for children and adults and is absolutely timeless. I can not get enough of this show.']
