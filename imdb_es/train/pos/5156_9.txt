I agree with many of the negative reviews published here, for reasons that I will discuss later. But this miniseries is powerful and compelling because the talented cast really captures the dark truth of Hitler's world. <br /> <br /> Peter Stormare is perfect as Ernst Rohm, the brutal leader of the brown shirt. Every scene you have with Hitler is explosive! Hitler is so evil that he dominates the whole world, except the nasty, primitive Rohm, and clearly exploits Rohm just for that reason. The interaction between Stormare and Carlisle illuminates the way in which Hitler enjoyed the brutality of Rohm, but later sacrificed it for political reasons. <br /> <br /> Jena Malone presents a harrowing performance as Geli Raubal, the damned niece of Hitler and the victim of her unspeakable perversions Without revealing any of the sexual filth directly, Jena Malone takes care of all the horror of the slow extinction of a girl's spirit. She uses her eyes and her voice to suggest all the horror that will be visited by millions in the coming years. And she is brilliant! Zoe Telford almost equals Jena Malone with her performance as Eva Braun. Eva is clearly ill, she is cruel and ruthless, but at the same time she almost depends on the twisted tenderness of Adolph. The aborted scene of making love between them (implying the tingling truth of Hitler's enormous self-esteem) is chilling and erotic. <br /> <br /> Liev Schrieber offers a delectably similar performance to a weasel like Putzi Hanfstaengel, the spineless man -about-town who is seduced by Hitler's promises of wealth and power. While a brute like Rohm simply loves the idea of ​​crushing skulls under his boots, Schrieber's character is one of many Germans who hate Nazi violence but can not resist the quick and easy route to money and power. His weak will flattering Hitler soon loses the respect of his wife, played with style and sensuality by the impressive and regal Julianna Margulies. They provide a true portrait of marriage and betrayal. <br /> <br /> These performances take the mini series along, easily overcoming the occasional weaknesses of the script. There is an exception. Unfortunately, Matthew Modine's acting skills are not up to the task. His noble journalist lunk-haid ruins all the scenes he has: the spectator can barely wait for Rohm's brown shirts to trample that mocking and mocking gaze of his ignorant, Hollywood golden boy face. But the story still works. <br /> <br /> Now, with regard to the fact inaccuracies of the script, Hitler's perversions and cruelty translate into a vibrant and compelling drama. But Cape Hitler's battlefield record is very distorted. As if they feared that the audience could not handle the idea of ​​evil and courage in the same person, the writers make Hitler look like a plaintive coward who "asked" for an Iron Cross. As if someone in Kaiser's army could get a medal by complaining! The film makes it appear that Hitler was a coward in the trenches, when he was an intrepid soldier. They also suggest that his comrades despised him, when in fact he was admired by officers and enlisted alike. The depressing thing is that the miniseries is as successful in depicting Hitler as a monster in an honest way, but they could not resist the cheap shot. <br /> <br /> In general, however, Hitler: RISE OF EVIL is a great success highlighted by its powerful performances.
