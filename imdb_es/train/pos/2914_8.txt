There were not many films about the appearance of Lighter-Than-Air (LTA), but this is one of them and it's very good. Just a fun movie to watch. <br /> <br /> Most of the film takes place in Navy operations at NAS Lakehurst (with NAS Tustin playing the role). Wallace Beery plays a sympathetic, but Munchausen-like, lead boss Ned Trumpet, an enlisted pilot, whose famous tales have become so frequent that no one really believes him. Half the fun is near the end of the movie when events begin to show that most of their most extravagant stories are actually true. You will end up having a father-son relationship with the crippled son of the widow, Jess. By telling him that he would never walk without crutches from doctors, Chief Trumpet pulls some ropes and a Navy flight surgeon helps restore the boy's crippled leg. Jess joins the Armada to become a flight officer, flying backwards into Lakehurst and facing a new set of challenges. <br /> <br /> A very well made movie, although not without a clever Hollywood dialogue. Beyond the technical advisors, and the apparent inability of Beery to go forward. Otherwise, this movie gets good grades for its technical accuracy, and it gives a rare look to the Navy's LTA operations. The cash register scene, an exchange between Trumpet and Jess's future love interest, Cathy, is a real problem.
