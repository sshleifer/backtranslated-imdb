After a long, hard week behind the desk, taking all those serious decisions, this movie is a great way to relax. Like Wells and the original radio broadcast, this film will take you to a land of extraterrestrial and paradisiacal sci-fi humor. Captain Zippo died to the great load of the Buick. He was a brave man. The impressions of Jack Nicholson shine through that strange face with dark glasses and leather jacket. And always remember to be careful with the 'donut of death'! Consider the number one rule of this movie: suspend disbelief, sit back and relax, and "Prepare to die scum from Earth!" You gotta see it for yourself.
