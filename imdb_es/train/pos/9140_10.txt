I love this movie!!! Purple Rain came out the year I was born and has had my heart since I can remember. Prince is so tense in this movie. Last night I attended a special presentation of Purple Rain and it was like a concert. I was glad to see some true fans because this movie is so undervalued that it is one of the best movies of all time. The music is untouchable. The film is about "The Kid", played by Prince, his family is dysfunctional, his band is the hottest act in the city and he has his eyes on Apollonia, an aspiring singer. There is no doubt why purple is my favorite color. I can thank "The Kid" for that. So if you have not seen this, then you have to look for it as soon as possible. This is a classic - 4ever!
