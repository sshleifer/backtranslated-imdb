Good times working with the Quiroz brothers, and all the cast of this project as the "Man in the bank". I was surprised at how well they managed to capture all the identifiable traits of a true horror movie "B". I hope to have the opportunity to work with the Pumpkin Patch Pictures team again in the future. I moved to Detroit shortly after the completion and I have been recognized in public several times since the launch. Once it was actually in the video store and the girl almost lost her mind. It was very funny and that was my first autograph moment when I signed his receipt. One day I asked the Blockbuster girl if the movie was often rented, and she confirmed by looking for it on the computer. At that time I was renting more than Ring2, which was also a new release at that time ... The title really captures the immediate interest in more urban markets. He also noticed that on many occasions the film had not been returned by the client who made me believe that the film is so good that people do not want to return it ... Be careful with ZoMbIeS when they are in the bell because they will receive you! Jaysun Barr (Guy on the Bench-2005)
