I do not know why I chose this movie to watch, it has a strange title and, by the description, it seemed something different. From time to time it's good to try a movie that is slightly different from the main movie of Hollywood thrillers and heroes, and this movie was certainly different. From the beginning, this film had me intrigued, but I could not find out why until the end of the movie when I realized that the movie was great because the characters were so real. I think the performance was excellent and the development of the character really makes you worry about them and I hope things go well for them in the end. I think that all those who watch the movie can relate in some way to one of the characters, which makes it a good visualization and some laughs before the normality of the actors. <br /> <br /> At the climax of the film, you definitely get a sense of well-being, and you stay with the kind of "things are going to be fine" feeling. I am sure that this will have great appeal and should have an opportunity.
