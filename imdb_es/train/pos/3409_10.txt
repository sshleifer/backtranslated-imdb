North Africa in the 1930s. To a small Arab city on the edge of the Sahara comes a beautiful woman seeking a meaning to her life and a handsome Trappist monk who flees from his crisis of faith. They will meet and the passions will shake, but not even the sand diviner knows if they will find happiness or pain, here, in THE GARDEN OF ALLA. <br /> <br /> The plot is pure hokum, but the movie is still very funny and beautiful to look at. Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boyer are an excellent screen couple. She is, to put it simply, beautiful, and Boyer gives a more effective and discreet performance, letting her sensitive face do much of her acting for him. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast is excellent: Basil Rathbone, in a role of sympathy as a count who loves the desert; Joseph Schildkraut as a friendly and talkative guide (all the "Arabs" he and the others speak in the film are incomprehensible); Lucile Watson as a gracious Mother Superior; Alan Marshal as a young and honorable French officer; Tilly Losch as a dangerous dancer; Henry Brandon as a comic goalie; John Carradine as the mysterious sand diviner; and the magnificent Sir C. Aubrey Smith as an old wise priest. <br /> <br /> Movie geniuses will recognize Helen Jerome Eddy as a nun; Marcia Mae Jones and Bonita Granville (looking over the nun's shoulder) like convent girls; the haggard Nigel De Brulier as a reader of the monastery; and Ferdinand Gottschalk as a hotel employee, uncredited. <br /> <br /> The color films of the 1930s are rare and delightful to watch, and this film is no exception: cinematography is as colorful as the desert itself. THE GARDEN OF ALLAH was the first Technicolor film shot on location. Yuma, Arizona, gave the filmmakers all the sand dunes they could want, but contaminated drinking water and 135-degree heat soon caused the company to revolt. When daily troubles showed that Boyer's face had burned a bright tomato red, producer David O. Selznick finally gave up. The rest of the movie was filmed on a Hollywood sound stage.
