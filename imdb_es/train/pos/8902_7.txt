I imagine that if Steve McQueen knew that he would become an icon and start "Wanted: Dead of Alive" the same year the movie came out, or that he would be in The Magnificent Seven two years later, he would not have done it. But he did, and we are the richest for that. <br /> <br /> It sure is a classic of the camp. The horror of the way it was meant to be the theater drive-in is fun and nostalgic. <br /> <br /> It's interesting that the last lines of the film were: <br /> <br /> Lieutenant Dave: At least we stopped it. Steve Andrews: Yes, as long as the Arctic stays cool. <br /> <br /> They would never have imagined 52 years ago that the Arctic would be melting. The Blob will soon return.
