Anyone who finds this movie boring is a hopeless fool who should stick to car chase movies and romantic comedies. This movie is fascinating and does not have a boring moment. Why? Because it is largely composed of an intelligent dialogue between real people in a time of crisis and details their efforts to survive this crisis. I repeat - intelligent dialogue! That's what characterizes almost all of Rohmer's films, and that's why many people do not like them. They prefer the action. Well, they spend the rest of their lives watching action movies, while those of us with taste and discrimination will continue to look for movies like this one. <br /> <br /> Rohmer has always been accused of being "talky". Well, it is, but for me that's a compliment, not a criticism. Shakespeare was also talented. Is there a more talkative game than "Hamlet"? Whenever the subject, or theme, of a work of art consists of ideas and conflicts about values, there must necessarily be a discussion of these ideas and values, and that is largely what this film is about. Aristocracy and noble birth vs. egalitarianism; loyalty to old friends who undergoes the final test when that friend takes what we believe is a wrong path; the value of human life and the responsibility to help save that life, even if the person who possesses that life is not so good, not even despicable. (Has anyone heard of Dostoevsky or "Crime and punishment?") This is what this movie is about. <br /> <br /> The two protagonists of this film are impeccable, as if they were born to play these roles. . Lucy Russell, who is English and speaks French as a second language, is especially brilliant. Do yourself a favor and watch this fascinating movie. It can be the last movie of this Master screen.
