"Everything depends on you, Ed?" "Now you can play the game." The day my father left my mother, he took me to see this movie with his new girlfriend, the day of the opening at the Cinerama Dome in Hollywood. He was only fourteen years old. I was not even completely sure of what I was seeing, but I will never forget it, especially the scene with Ned Beatty. <br /> <br /> When I see him today, thirty-six years later, he still gives me the creeps. <br /> <br /> My father was a huge fan of Burt Reynolds, hence the reason why I stayed in line for almost an hour to see what was supposed to be an "action movie". I had seen two films in the Dome before this: "Grand Prix" and "The Song of Norway". Well, this was not exactly Mario Andretti or The Brady Bunch. After leaving the theater, I was stunned. <br /> <br /> But even at that tender age, I appreciated the art ... and after seeing it again today, I am surprised that it was still standing after having witnessed this. Disturbing film, but extremely well elaborated. <br /> <br /> Suffice it to say that it was a traumatic experience for a fourteen year old boy who had not yet kissed his first girlfriend. I do not blame my father for taking me, but it was too much for a child to witness. <br /> <br /> As an adult, I still find it quite disturbing, but I am still very impressed with the quality of the shooting. <br /> <br /> Burt Reynolds as an absolute marvel, like all the principles ... from Billy Redden as the marvel of the innate guitar, to Ronny Cox as the terrified insurance salesman ... Everyone makes a admirable work. The sound quality is second to none, from the birds chirping to the clocks. Photography, cinematography ... all the technical aspects of this extraordinary film are first class. <br /> <br /> The moral issues raised, from murdering sex offenders to the consequences of dealing with killing a human being, are still the following. Deep today as they did when this groundbreaking film premiered. And the classic sequences of trying to survive in the desert after dealing with such unforeseen brutality are changing lives. These four men, men of the city, who suddenly face a situation they never imagined, raise the bar of action to horror. <br /> <br /> It's a classic, without a doubt. And the phrase "you have a pretty mouth" has been cited endlessly, from Saturday Night Live to great comments about the water cooler at work, this movie is without a doubt a big part of our social pop culture ... as much as " Make my day "or" I'll come back "once was. <br /> <br /> So, what would you do if you found your friends being sexually assaulted at gunpoint by mountain men away from your life? In the city, cozy bed, wife and children? And if I took the steps that Burt Reynolds took (and I would have done the same), would he bury the body under the lake that is to come, or will he be judged and risked? The conclusion is: Deliverance delivery. You can take that to the bank. If this movie does not get under your skin, then you're not human. <br /> <br /> Even if you've seen this before, fix it again and ask yourself the previous question. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the movie is still the same: Ed can not kill the deer ... then he changes. Life and its unpredictable circumstances can change a man. And I guess that's what this film about Jon Voight is all about, in particular, since Ed offers the best performance here. And he's still one of the most talented actors in Hollywood history, from Midnight Cowboy to his underestimated performance as Franklin D. Roosevelt at Pearl Harbor, his performance elevates the film to another level. Rock climbing at sunset, terrified and determined to do things well. Must be seen to be believed. I guarantee that your heart rate will rise to a new level. <br /> <br /> Fast-paced, tense, tense and with a strong plot like a banjo string, this is a work of morality that asks questions that remain in the present. Times change, but our choices as human beings do not. <br /> <br /> Ten out of ten stars.
