This is an interesting little movie made in 1967, with cool and eye-catching soundtrack music and an argument that will make you laugh ... Well, it's not really stupid, but it's fun. I saw many similarities between this and 'Creature with the Blue Hand' (also known as The Bloody Dead) and they have the same director! The best thing about Scotland Yard is to investigate the murders of young women in a university. It seems that criminals are being let out of a local prison to make an offer to an evil person and then return when their work is finished. There is an ingenious device hidden inside a bible that expels prussic acid, and there is another device that is neither ingenious nor clandestine, it looks like a large jet gun and the victim must be almost soaked before it expires. Joachim Fuchsberger plays an inspector and, in general, chews gum and looks into the distance. There is a "monk", and how someone identifies this as a "monk" beats me, carries a whip and dresses in a red suit with a red hood, plus a Klan member of a different color than a monk. There are all kinds of ingenious devices, like a fireplace hearth that goes up and down to admit the monk, and that passes over the fire without turning on his robe, a clever trick there. This is a strange combination of criminal drama with silly nuances, and although it is quite silly sometimes it is fun to watch it. 7 out of 10, it's not bad ....
