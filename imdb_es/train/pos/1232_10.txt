Very funny movie The classic funny Eddie Murphy movie of the 80s. I saw when I was a kid and I have a good memory. The classic irony of Murphy does not fail, the film is fun, well done. Murphy in the 80s made many action movies that represented for him a way to joke about everything that is dangerous. The result can only be appreciated by some, but the 1986 films have changed so far. The atmosphere for a movie of that time is good and the special effects are good for a movie of the time. A beautiful movie to see and enjoy, appreciating the taste of the ironic Murphy, an actor who has recently disappeared. The final part is anthologies, the charming actor who plays the role of the Tibetan monk. That's.
