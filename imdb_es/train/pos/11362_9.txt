I think this is the most powerful movie that HBO Pictures has done to date. This film should have been released in cinemas for the public to see on the big screen. It's available on video, so be sure to look it up and take a look. Chris Gerolmo did a great job with the direction and the script. The performances of Stephen Rea, Donald Sutherland and Jeffery DeMunn are impeccable. A masterpiece of the genre.
