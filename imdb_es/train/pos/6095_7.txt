I'm a bit conflicted about this. On the one hand, the program is horrible, the acting is terrible (even when in an episode we received the names of actors like Brad Pitt and Bill Moseley), the dialogue is absurd and the premise / moral of each episode feels like something out of a scene. 50 educational short. There's no way you can be frightened by any of these episodes for a moment, and Robert Englund's cameos are short, pointless and cheesy in a kind of Bob Saget in the United States, the funniest home videos. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this is one of the funniest things on television. The fashions of the 80s, the soft focus makes the actors look like on the set of The View at all times, the premises lend more material for self-parody than to scare, so we are left with an episode where a high school boy is fearing that if his SAT fails, his girlfriend leaves him and his parents deny him, another is afraid of being locked up in jail because he is a mother below the standard (her husband is played by Brad Pit), another fears that all the parents in the world are allied against him when he runs away from home, another fears that she will be confused with her socially retarded twin, another fears that if she does not get rid of her mother and her stepfather she will get murdered for having a party in her home. The list goes on and on. <br /> <br /> Being these are dreams, I suppose you could look beyond the absurd points and devices of the plot, but they are so out of the left field that there are no opportunities for the writers to actually scare the audience. You have characters disguised as a nightmare with the theme of the 80s that wanders to give a bad dialogue in a very hammy way and make illogical decisions that have no other purpose than to move the story to the next point of the strange plot (usually, see how it makes a peripheral character something uncharacteristic of a sensible person, while our main character looks horrified and too surprised to do anything about it). <br /> <br /> If you're looking for something that scares you, stay away. If you are looking, on the other hand, one of the funniest things of the 80s. Look at it. <br /> <br /> He has been watching lately on Chiller TV (almost every day) and I have been watching him, before for morbid curiosity, and now only to be able to laugh every day. . With Arrested Development and Extras off the air, this is officially the most fun of television right now.
