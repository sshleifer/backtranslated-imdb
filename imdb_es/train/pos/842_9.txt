['The Matador is an ingenious melodrama, dark humor and suspense that rises well above mediocrity thanks to two very attractive and serious performances of Pierce Brosnan, who has never been better than here, and the always reliable Greg Kinnear, who has his best role since playing Jack Nicholson&#39;s gay neighbor in Tan Good As It Gets. A great advantage goes to writing too. The intelligent and sometimes very unpleasant dialogue is delivered with gusto by Brosnan and the slow construction of friendship between these two different individuals is completely convincing. The story takes some unexpected twists and keeps the viewer constantly guessing where it will go next. <br /><br /> The beautiful artistic touches of the director, such as the good use of music, intelligent editing and unorthodox cinematography, sometimes give a good tone to the film and for a long period of time do not know how to label the film. But that&#39;s also thanks to a well-written script that keeps the viewer (me anyway) on the edge of his seat.']
