['Sometimes you have to look back to keep going. The 60s did just that. We need to remember the past. The past is part of the future. <br /><br /> Great mix by Gary J. Coppola. I see a great future. You deserve to be nominated and win, the best mixer of the 60s. <br /><br /> The best mini series of all time. <br /><br /> Thanks Ursula <br /><br />']
