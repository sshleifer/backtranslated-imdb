I'm glad someone has made a movie about how difficult it is to risk your heart for the second time. Or third. This movie is exactly what it promises to be: charming, fun and gives you this good feeling around your heart when it ends. The plot may not be very inventive, but there are millions of ways to tell the story and they have not yet been used. The cast is perfectly selected, although Scott Wolf does not seem to be the father of an eight-year-old boy, even when wearing a suit. Therefore, the sparks are in all the right places, the support cast is a nice support and, although you can probably predict the whole movie, you will not want to change the channel. It's the right type of entertainment for a Sunday night.
