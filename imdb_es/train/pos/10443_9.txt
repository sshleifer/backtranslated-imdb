Richard Linklater's beautifully directed mixture of youth romance and the Paris travel diary is one of the romantic movies of the person with the best thinking of the 90s. Julie Delpy becomes one of the most attractive performances of the decade as the girl Parisian who spends a day with a stranger on a train, Ethan Hawke. The dialogue (and there are lots of it) is sometimes meandering and too precious, but this portrait of two young lovers of aspirants who make a romantic, intellectual and spiritual connection with each other is full of wonderfully funny, moving and insightful moments.
