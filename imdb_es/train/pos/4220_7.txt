This is the one in which the diminutive Ruth Gordon plays a murder mystery author of Agatha-Christie who locks her nephew by marriage in a safe. Gordon believes that he murdered his niece and the young man dies of suffocation, while Gordon travels back and forth to New York. However, he manages to leave behind some clues, scratches on a pair of black safety boxes and a makeshift and well hidden note. Columbo enters the case, suspects at once and solves the mystery simply by using his supernatural and intuitive mystical powers. Oh, and Mariette Hartley is present as Gordon's secretary and possible blackmailer. Hartley is, I think, the granddaughter of psychologist B. F. Skinner. I'm not sure his ancestry had anything to do with his attractive belly button, which is shown during a belly dance sequence, but I've always admired Skinner. <br /> <br /> The murder is well managed. It's a good plot, and none of the artists or crew has anything to do with it. But the prominent figure here is Ruth Gordon, just a skosh over five feet tall. He was over 80 years old and looked at him. There are times when he almost staggers, but constantly exudes charm. His performance is idiosyncratic. You can never be sure when he is serious or when he is encouraging Columbo and the audience. She has given some good lines too. What humor there is of Gordon. Columbo does not have any of his frequent comedic moments. <br /> <br /> In short, a good job for all those interested.
