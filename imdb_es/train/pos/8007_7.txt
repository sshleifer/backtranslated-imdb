This game is very addictive, I kept playing for hours until late at night, but also the fact that you can not save a game when you are in space contributed to this, sometimes I HAVE to play not to play. lose the game data. <br /> <br /> Then, "Freelancer" is addictive but also quite defective. Also, for example, something that bothered me a lot was that you could not skip any of the cut scenes, so sometimes you had to watch the same scene of minute cuts again and again. A great opportunity to multitask to check my email or chat with my friends and more like that, while I had to wait for the scene to end. <br /> <br /> The story begins with promises, but the farther you go, the more ridiculous it becomes. Also the game also ends quite abruptly, at least it did for me. It's pretty obvious they're hinting at a sequel next. I do not know if a sequel is being prepared at this time, but I am sure that it will most likely be removed once it is published. <br /> <br /> The game is very easy! Even for those who are not familiar with flight games. To say it bravely, all fools can play this game. Yes, some levels are quite difficult and require a lot of effort. It took me 1 to 2 weeks to finish this game, which could be a bit short. But thank God for the multiplayer option! It allows you to continue playing short quests, just like the single player game once you have completed it, by the way. <br /> <br /> Even though many of the missions are the same, it's just still great to be in the middle of the sometimes massive dogfights. <br /> <br /> The graphics are good, but they are nothing revolutionary or anything. <br /> <br /> Addictive game but be careful with your flaws. <br /> <br /> 7/10
