['I really enjoyed the performances of the main cast. Emma Lung is brave and interesting. The director has developed performances where the characters are not one-dimensional. A complex history with the change between epochs. He also appreciated the underlying story of the loss of power of unions and the effect of closing a large employer in a small city. I do not agree with the comment that the older man has to be attractive. There have been many relationships with older men and younger women, without the man being handsome. The depth of character can be attractive for the not so superficial. The movie looks good and the cinematography is good too.']
