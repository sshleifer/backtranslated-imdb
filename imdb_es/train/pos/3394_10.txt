I saw this movie by chance, after having bought it as side B on The Omega Man's DVD. The Omega Man was a little disappointing, except for the beginning, which was clearly the inspiration for 28 Days Later, the rest is just the material of TV movies. But Soylent Green is in another league. I bet this is one of Tarantino's favorites. There are at least 3 scenes in the movie that I have never seen before. Heston casually gets into bed with the "furniture" while talking about something else that has no relation! A crowd of people being trapped by a fleet of mechanical diggers! A priest who takes the confession and is shot by the confessor. Ok, maybe it's been done since then, but there are not many movies that are as original as this one. And what the hell is going on between Heston and Edward G. Robinson? Is this the most unlikely gay couple in history, or what? Luckily, I saw this movie without knowing the end, which apparently is weird. Then I saw it again and enjoyed all the little clues that make it worth the long initial scenes. A very nice script, and also some great sets. Just when you thought you had seen it all. . .
