As a lover of the surreal (in art and film) I had the pleasure of discovering this film about IFC. It is definitely a guardian. Most other reviews say the general plot (not all correct), so I will not bother to bore anyone with that. The main thing is the concept of alternate worlds that is produced by the imminent illness of Ana, and the way in which she manages to bond with another person after being so "alone", and finally with her family, which I think is still a little problematic . . It can only be called a horror movie because it has terrifying scenes but it is a fantasy (with a little "coming of age" only because Ana is a preteen who "hates children"). I recommend it to all those who appreciate the reach of their imagination.
