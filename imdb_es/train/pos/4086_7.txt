['Wow. Uhm ... well ... wow! I guess I&#39;m going to start with the plot. A promised woman (Lucy) who arrives at her family home would be her husband (Mathurin) in France, where they await the arrival of the Bishop or the Cardinal or someone in the Catholic Church to marry them (to fulfill a testament). waiting, the young Lucy finds out about a legend of a Beast that wandered the grounds centuries before. That night, in bed, she begins to fantasize about the Beast and her date with the ex-lady of the house. That&#39;s where it gets interesting! The plot is really very thin (and seems to go on for quite some time in the middle of the movie), but the filmmaker rewards (?) Those who take it with a shocking and hilarious ending. <br /><br /> This movie is not for everyone. If you are looking for a great cinema, look elsewhere. If you&#39;re looking for a far-off film about bestiality (which almost casts a sympathetic look on the subject), this movie is for you! (If you have a weak stomach, do not be afraid of it.) At the beginning of a horse-on-horse action, the &#39;facts&#39; are pretty caricatural, IMO)']
