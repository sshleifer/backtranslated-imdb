This is a true eye candy. A world made of floating islands and ancient flying cities. Huge monsters whose preferred method of attack is to throw cathedrals to their opponents ... Who can resist that? An ancient prophecy, a group of lost heroes and a beautiful princess in search of her hero ... does it sound familiar ...? Yes, we've heard that song before. But you will forget it while watching the spectacular scenery. <br /> <br /> This movie is fun to watch while it lasts. But after leaving the cinema, you'll be wanting a bit more history. <br /> <br /> What is behind the circle of 30 years? What made the gentleman mad? Who built all these fabulous monuments, castles and cities ... and why are they collapsing? And apart from that group of farmers, where are the people? Actually, this image seems very intriguing, but it is not a Lord of the Rings.
