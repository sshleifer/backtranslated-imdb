It's really a shame that films like this never get hooked in the Best Movie nominations, because this is simply a winner. This is by far the most hilarious and coherent comedy I've seen in my life. His script and design are impeccable, not to mention the incredible cast. I can quote this movie for hours and hours. Look at it.
