['A surprisingly interesting meditation on the nature of repentance in terms of how it relates to paranoia. There is a lot in this to have a run time of only 74 minutes, but it works. The fear is very subtle, not the fear that seems to populate the most recent horror films of Asia. The way in which &quot;fears&quot; are configured is similar to the disturbing moments in &quot;The Uninvited&quot; (also known as 4 Inyong shiktak, directed by Su-Leon Lee), but this is not nearly the same level. The film does a good job of balancing a classic ghost story with something more unusual and psychological. It is not perfect, but it does what it is supposed to do. I would recommend taking a look if you have the opportunity.']
