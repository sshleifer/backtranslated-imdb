Higher learning is a slap in the face for those of us who have been in the closet for a long time regardless of ethnicity. it is a topic that most of us would like to ignore, but we can not afford to do so if it is a real and progressive change in the way we HAVE the capacity to embrace and understand diversity. Some have criticized this film as odious or stupid, but the fact of the matter is that ignorance reigns supreme in the world and several continue to help it to dominate our society. Everyone involved in this movie has done a good job of showing what steps must be taken to avoid having to make more films like the higher level ones. learning.sure sounds like an impossible dream, but we have to start somewhere and this helps.
