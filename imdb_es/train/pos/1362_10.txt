Me and my friends of 20 and so groovadelic do not get tired of this amazing Parker Posey CLASSIC! I tried to rent this on DVD, but I can not seem to find it, very bad, since I'm sure the features would be "very special"! :) We all highly recommend this super cool flickerino comedy for a date, or even just a cozy night at home alone! This would also be the kind of purr-fect style movie to watch with your cat, or even to organize a party based on, like a "Party Girl" party, like that of the movie that Parker Posey adores, the adorable, diligent and overwhelming. In the end. Oh, and watch for a surprising ending and surprise HILARO ... move aside, The Sixth Sense, has just been surpassed by a radder movie! I'm sorry, do not be offended, just call him how he is! Take it from an old movie lover, comedy can not be better than "Party Girl" with Parker P! Feel it!
