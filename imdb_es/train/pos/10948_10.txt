Following the plot of a comedy of situations is so easy that the fact that his character operates simultaneously inside and outside the context in which the rest of the cast lives is the kind of experimentalism that comedies could really use. The secondary characters support the program in a situation comedy reality that provides a contextual counterpoint to Sarah's erratic person who, beyond general insensitivity, has no specific recurring features on which to base behavior expectations, so that is less a character than a canvas to paint. Each episode if not scene. Sarah's ability to see everything from an external perspective allows her to parody aspects of social behavior that are subtle enough to pass unnoticed. Every time he speaks, it's like a self-contained 5-second sketch. She exceeded a lot, demonstrating the innumerable things that a smile or a change in vocal tone can mean, but she never gets an idea long enough for you to feel comfortable and form expectations that will be met. This can be the most creative, original and experimental television program of all time.
