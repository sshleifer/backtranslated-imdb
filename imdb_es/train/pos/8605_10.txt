Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy star in this "modern" musical that shows MacDonald's comic abilities. The surreal musical of the 40s seems to mock the fashions of the 40s even when they were in fashion. Costumes and striking sets (yes, B & W) add to the surreal and dreamlike quality of the entire film. Several good songs animate the film, with the number of "Twinkle in Your Eye" a total highlight, which includes a fun jitterbug number between MacDonald and Binnie Barnes. Also in the HUGE cast are Edward Everett Horton, Reginal Owen, Mona Maris, Douglas Dumbrille and Anne Jeffreys. There have also been parts of extended bits like Esther Dale, Almira Sessions, Grace Hayle, Gertrude Hoffman, Rafaela Ottiano, Odette Myrtile, Cecil Cunningham and many others. <br /> <br /> Very funny and nice to see the wonderful MacDonald in his jitterbug / vamp routines. She could do everything.
