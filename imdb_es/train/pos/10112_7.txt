Originally I discovered it in 1996 in his one week film career. I was very impressed and my feelings have not changed much. <br /> <br /> Documentary about the infamous Edward D. Wood Jr. that covers his life and his films. There are interviews with people who worked with him or knew him. They include: Vampira, Dolores Fuller, Bela Lugosi Jr., Loretta King, Gregory Walcott and Paul Marco. The interviews are mixed with the clips from the movies or with some strange recreations. It's interesting (something), but was it really necessary? I've seen all of Wood's films and they're just terrible. The wood had ambitions but not a little talent to carry them out. I would not say he was the worst director of all, but he's down there. Do we really need a docu in a very mediocre filmmaker? I like the fact that they did not try to make Wood a kind of saint. More than a few of the interviewees (especially Lugosi Jr.) hated the man a lot and listened loud and clear. They also totally ignore their films in the adult film industry in the sixties and seventies. Still, it's of interest if you're a fan of Wood. The best interviews are with Vampira (who separates Wood) and Dolores Fuller (a longtime girlfriend).
