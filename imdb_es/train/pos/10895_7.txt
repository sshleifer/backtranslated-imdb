Surviving Christmas is a surprisingly funny movie, especially considering the bad publicity when it was first released. Ben Affleck is funny as an unpleasant millionaire who pays the family that occupies his childhood home to be his family at Christmas. Then it drives the family crazy with excesses for Christmas cheer. I have not been a fan of Ben Affleck in the past (although I liked Daredevil and Paycheck), but here he is well in this role. I also like Christina Applegate as the daughter of the family who can not stand Affleck's character at first. Of course you can see where this movie is going, but you do not care. Ignore what critics say and rent this movie because it's more fun than many Christmas movies.
