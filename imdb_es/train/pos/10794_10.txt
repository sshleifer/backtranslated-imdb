I've always liked to see Chuck Norris in the movie. Although the performance may not be excellent, the fight scenes are fantastic. I also liked to see Judson Mills play along with him. In my opinion, the Norris Brothers have proven to be good artists and this was another good production. I hope you take the time to watch this movie!
