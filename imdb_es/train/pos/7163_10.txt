Seriously, I loved this movie ... I started reading the book and I loved it ... the way everything was set up and everything had a purpose ... I think this movie did so well because Louis Sachar wrote the script. And, of course, Andrew Davis directed it ... Shia Lebouf offers a great performance for her first film ... the story is very interesting and funny ... there's humor, heart and intensity ... it's very similar to the book ... it seems to me that this film is not boring at all ... I loved it ... and I encourage anyone to read the book ... this whole film is very well united and carefully elaborated ... two thumbs up me in every way
