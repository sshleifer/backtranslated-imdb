A Christmas Together came before my time, but I was raised in John Denver and the songs of this special were always my family's Christmas music. For years we had a crackling cassette made from a record that meant it was Christmas. A few years ago, I was finally able to track a video on Ebay, so after listening to all the music for about 21 years, I could see John and the Muppets in action by myself. If you ever have the opportunity, it's a lot of fun: excellent music, touching and cheesy. It is also interesting to see the versions of the Muppets of the 70s and compare them with their newer versions of today. I think Denver really took some heat by doing a show like this. I suppose normally artists do not compromise their images making long songs with the Muppets, but I'm glad that they did. Even if you can not track the video, the soundtrack is also worth it. It has some traditional Muppified favorites, but also some original Denver tunes as well.
