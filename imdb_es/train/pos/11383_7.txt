This is a good musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice Parisian atmosphere that gives the movie a lot of charm, but in terms of history ... well, it's not really there. Or at least, not very well resolved. The performance is not so smooth for Caron either. But I liked some of the dialogues, I liked the scene on the Seine, I liked the character played by Levant, the colors; and the dance, of course, which is quite magnificent. <br /> <br /> A 7.5 - 8 seems to me in point.
