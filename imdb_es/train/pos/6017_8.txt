There is no way to confront 'Zabriskie Point' from a rational point of view or try to describe it using words and conventions that you would use for other films. This is because it is not a movie. It is an idea and a feeling that the filmmakers have that somehow became such a mundane object as a movie. What we see are not the developments of a plot, but rather a sequence of events that we do not see in the movies every day, but only imagine that it happens as the background that we ourselves will provide when we learn of a tragic event in the news or friends. What we see is our imagination of people who are abstractions for us, nobody we know, but we have certainly heard about them in a book or on television or somewhere else. So what do we see? Events We see people arguing, driving and, inevitably, escaping. Only the escape is something intangible, it is the collective situation and the cruelty that the mass of a civilization has allowed to exist through laziness or human nature. Set in the late 1960s in Los Angeles, our players act against and in response to the self-inflicted miseries of modern existence. These creatures are effectively blank whiteboards that can show whatever trait we can imagine if we desire it. Although the actions taken can be considered criminal or irresponsible, the characters are not criminals. They are human beings who seek to return to a family existence, not manufactured, which is beyond the normality they experience every day. It is not that they are ever happy or sad, but that they achieve a kind of self-actualization when they move away from the suicide of modern life. They only achieve true life in the natural world, although that is the next victim of modern existence. In the end, 'Zabriski Point' is a praise of the humanities' attachment to the natural world. As even the most desolate pieces of the earth succumb to our notions of progress, we lose our souls in the way of the death of the human spirit.
