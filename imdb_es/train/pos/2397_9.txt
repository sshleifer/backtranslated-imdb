Having seen and loved Greg Lombardo's most recent film, "Knots" (he also co-wrote and directed that feature), I decided to review his previous work, and this film was well worth the effort and rental. Macbeth in Manhattan is an ironic expression, excellent version of Shakespeare's favorite, updated and transferred to New York. I was impressed by the ingenuity and intelligence underlying the script and I was impressed by the way in which the plot of the production in the film reflects the plot of the work itself, and very skillfully. The trials and tribulations of life in Manhattan are parallel to many of Shakespeare's plays, and Central Park is rarely used better than the forest surrounding Macbeth's castle. Mr. Lombardo obviously has an affectionate place in his heart for the stories of New York and New York (Knots is a fun and warm sexual comedy about six New Yorkers in their early thirties set primarily in a charming Brooklyn neighborhood, with offices in Manhattan and a loft in the center of the city) in good measure) and has spent a considerable time around the works of Shakespeare. The film has a good rhythm and the story reflects a deep understanding of the essential drama at the core of Macbeth. It reminded me of Al Pacino "Looking for Richard", another wonderful play by Shakespeare "inside a movie". I recommend visiting Macbeth in Manhattan.
