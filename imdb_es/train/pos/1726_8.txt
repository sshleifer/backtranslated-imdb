While I was thinking about "The Great Escape", I let my mind go back to this little gem of a movie from my childhood. I had read and reread the 1949 autobiographical novel that inspired it, and when it came to the only cinema (we never used that word in reality) in the city that showed "foreign" films, I was the first to buy. my ticket. <br /> <br /> As someone who appeared in the war news and propaganda films during World War II, I had a great interest in exploring the realities of that conflict as reflected in the memories and stories of men They were there in person. . This was later extended to a willingness over the years to buy any book on the subject and, finally, to read the equally compelling novels of Hans Helmut Kirst and Erich Maria Remarque, which provided an even deeper sensibility. The versions of the film, however, were different from this in that they rarely delivered the products. <br /> <br /> The middle of the film in black and white has never been served as well as in those years. I have never seen any Technicolor version of the war that seems as authentic as the deep chiaroscuro of films like "The wooden horse". If it is true that we are destined to be captive to the images of our childhood, then I confess it freely. <br /> <br /> And there will never be another like Leo Genn as the iconic hero of the British war. in the movie Not even Sir Alec.
