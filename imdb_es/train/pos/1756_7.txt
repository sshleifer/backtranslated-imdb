"The 40-year-old Virgin" made me laugh a lot. I do not care if it is considered a very sexual comedy, I just enjoyed many of the jokes and scenes present in this film. Steve Carell is perfect as the virgin nerd Andy Stitzer and I think the scene where Andy gets his chest hair removed is one of the coolest, especially because it's real. Many of the actors and actresses present in this film are known or already famous, by the way. <br /> <br /> Andy Stitzer has a peaceful life. It is a little strange and picks up many toys, but it seems harmless. One day, while playing poker with their friends at work, they discover that Andy is really ... virgin! And he's already 40 years old! After this amazing revelation, all his friends are trying to get Andy to sleep with a woman ... the problem is the confusion that Andy gets into, especially now that he's really starting to like Trish, a woman he met when he was buying a DVD player in the store where he works.
