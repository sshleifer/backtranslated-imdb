Erroll works for the Department of Public Safety and his job is to control sex offenders. Sometimes he pushes the line into his work and hits sex offenders. I do not blame him, but his boss is ready for him to retire, so Allison is coming. Erroll is now training her to do her job and it's like following someone. Allison is naive about the work at first, but does not realize how dangerous it really is and it's all Erroll's fault. He begins to go very far with his obsession to find a missing girl when his job is not to be a police officer. <br /> <br /> It's a pretty decent movie about a madman pushing the limits and working outside. Your "scope of practice". Erroll did a good job, but for Allison's safety. It also has a good mystery and, just when I discovered it, there was more.
