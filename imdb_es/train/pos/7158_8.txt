Holes (2003, Dir. Andrew Davis) <br /> <br /> When Stanley Yelnats IV is wrongly convicted of theft, he is sent to 'Camp Green Lake'. In this camp, the warden and his two henchmen, Mr. Sir and Dr. Pendanski, order the camp companions to dig holes after another. But for what reason? Stanley plans to find out. <br /> <br /> I never really intended to see 'Holes', and I must admit that I only saw the movie, because I'm a big fan of Shia LaBeouf, but even if you're not a fan of it, then it does not matter . 'Holes' is one of those Disney movies that the whole family can enjoy. The story is beautifully written and incorporates a wonderful idea to include flashbacks to the past. These do not distract and really give a great background story. The whole cast is great. The young stars act well and the addition of Jon Voight and Sigourney Weaver are a joy. Shia LaBeouf shows that even at age 17, she can act flawlessly. This is a Disney movie, that you would definitely enjoy as a family. <br /> <br /> "I learn from failure". - Stanley Yelnats III (Henry Winkler)
