Personally, I enjoyed Cutting it thoroughly. It was the first time I saw an Australian theater slasher movie. A genre normally restricted to Hollywood movies. <br /> <br /> With all the comedies and dramas typical of Australia, I loved being able to see a horror movie of its own that was not a scam of anything. I did not even think it was really a parody of other movies. It was a supernatural themed horror like Nightmare on Elm Street, not Scream or I know what you did last summer and, therefore, there were more suspensions of disbelief. I think it's time for Australian films to try to incorporate more into conventional genres. <br /> <br /> Cut was original, scary enough and, ultimately, just a little fun. I would give it seven out of ten and I would not treat it as something serious. He did what I expected him to do, he entertained me and scared me enough to be satisfying. I loved it.
