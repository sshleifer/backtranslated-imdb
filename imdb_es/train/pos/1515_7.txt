['Amicus made almost a good half dozen of these anthologies of terror in the 70s, and this one, of the outstanding terror writer Robert Bloch, is one of his best efforts. There are four stories, all worthwhile, but two, &quot;Sweets for sweet&quot; and &quot;Method to murder&quot;, are distinguished as highly effective trips towards fear. <br /><br /> In &quot;Sweets&quot;, Christopher Lee plays an impatient widower whose charming daughter (Chloe Franks) suffers from his negligence and brutal intolerance, so he sculpts a voodoo doll with which he expresses his distaste for his methods. Franks is a beautiful figure of evil villain and offers one of the best children&#39;s performances in a horror movie since Martin Stephens in &quot;The Innocents&quot;. This delivery is directed with great subtlety and the final outrage, which occurs off the screen, is a moment of sheer horror. <br /><br /> &quot;Method of Murder&quot; is about a horror novelist (Denholm Elliott) who is threatened by one of his own creations, the eerie Dominic. This episode attracts attention for its simplicity and its absolute terror. Dominic may or may not be real, so director Peter Duffell has a great time playing with our expectations. The brief shots of Dominic reflected in a pond or seen as a fleeting ghost in a meadow are truly disturbing. <br /><br /> The original poster, with a skeletal figure holding a tray holding the severed head of Peter Cushing, was a rich incentive for punters who focused on fear.']
