Very good martial arts film and Jet Li is the best since the master himself Bruce Lee. Li is excellent as the low profile librarian / policeman he keeps all the time. It has a presence and an appearance that is fascinating and credible as the king of kung fu that you do not get into. Franck Yip is simply beautiful in that original mixed race that is unique because of its mixed heritage, it has an innocence and a charm at the same time that I found unforgettable. The villain, the man with sunglasses and long hair was also very good, but I can not find his name in the credits. Can someone help me with that? Thank you ! Enjoy Hak Hap or Black Mask, in any language, it's good entertainment!
