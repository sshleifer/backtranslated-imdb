Another new version of "Fistful of Dollars", Sergio Leone's version of "Yojimbo" by Kurosawa (suggested by the novel 'Red Harvest'). <br /> <br /> This is strictly a B movie; Taken like that, it's pretty nice. the direction is clear, the performance full of enthusiasm, the limitations of his 'direct to video' photography well managed. <br /> <br /> The weakness of the film lies in the disastrous decision to marry the 'handful' '/' yojimbo 'in a sub-plot of Leone's' Once Upon a Time in the West'. Although Leone directed both "Fistful" and "West", his motivations behind the two films could not be more different. The 'Nameless Man' (Eastwood) is a socio-boundary path with a weak point for broken families. Harmonica (Chasles Bronson) is obsessed with her own broken family and obsessed with revenge. These two characters would not have had much to do with each other. To unite them, 'Gun Crazy' has to twist its plot and complicate it until we lose track of the story we follow. <br /> <br /> But after all, this is a B movie, and full of action and stupidity; It is entertaining at that level, but do not expect anything else.
