Probably the best film by Jackie Chan in the 1980s, and the one that put it on the map. The magnitude of this self-directed police drama is evident in the opening and closing scenes, during which a village and a commercial center of squatters were demolished. There are clearly differences between the original versions in Chinese and English dubbed, and many of the jokes fail to break through in the latter. The latter is also hampered by stars that do not look anything like their Chinese originals. In fact, the only thing that has corrected the dubbing is the trial in court, at that time, the trials in colonial Hong Kong were conducted in English, while the original has this scene in Cantonese. <br /> <br /> However, Chan The fighting style and martial arts choreography inject humor whenever possible, so that non-Cantonese audiences do not get lost very much. After all, it is not the dialogue that makes a film of Chan, but the action and painful exits. The story is easy to follow: Chan plays an incorruptible Hong Kong detective who chases a gangland godfather (Cho Yeun), and is assigned to protect a star witness (Brigitte Lin). The action is excellent from start to finish and there is not much time to breathe. It will never make you think, but it is an entertaining and well-linked film. It could be said that this is one of the best martial arts films out there.
