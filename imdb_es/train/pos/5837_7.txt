With Oliver Hardy tormented by the sound of horns, bells, telephones and trombones, his doctor Finlayson advises peace and tranquility and a diet of goat's milk. Partner Stan Laurel offers an excellent solution: living in a docked boat so that the salty sea air can help Ollie get all the rest he needs. It's a great premise for all the crazy fanatics that can happen, since the ship is adrift of the hungry goat, and an escaped convict (Richard Cramer) is saved for the trip. <br /> <br /> I have a kick of all the gags in the movie, starting with that sign in the speaker testing factory: "Silence while men work". The early story in the children's apartment shows a series of mixed mishaps of plumbing and appliances, with Stan making a banana inside a piece of banana. Laurel has a couple of big lines in the picture, like "We must have been disconnected", but the one that made me roll was his response to the criminal on board the ship: "Self preservation is the latest law of averages". precisely! <br /> <br /> I am not as good a student of the Laurel and Hardy films as many in this forum, all I know is that I enjoyed them as a child and I think they are as entertaining today as they were. in my youth. In that recount, "Saps At Sea" provides a decent hour of hornophobic fun, well on its way to hornomania.
