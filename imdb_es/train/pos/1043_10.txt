Since I can remember, I am only 18 years old, my mother and I have been and continue to watch old movies because in the long run I find them much more rewarding (but do not get me wrong, I love the movies I have today, not as much as I like them movies of the 40s and 50s) Anyway, now I have to say that by the time I started watching the movie, my eyes were glued to the TV. Of course, my favorite character was the grandmother played by Lucile Watson. But I loved the way that Betty Davis and her family were portrayed. The children ... did not act like children in the least. But there is a good reason for that, having had to hide and run most of your life, seeing the horrible things that the children saw in those days destroyed their innocence. So, people who say "oooo hated the way kids acted ... blah, blah, blah" he read between the lines and knew they saw things that kids should not see. <br /> <br /> Paul Lukas ... dear Paul did an amazing job !!! Now I know that a lot of people are angry that he went to Oscar and Bogie did not, but both did incredible jobs, so I think it could have gone either way. But the performance of Lukas was so surprising that at the end of the film I was about to cry. I loved this movie and I recommend it to anyone! :-RE
