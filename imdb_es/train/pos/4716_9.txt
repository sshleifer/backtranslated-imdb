This movie is too funny, a game of gangsters totally without a PC. If Mel Brooks made a photo of the mafia in the 1930s, it would probably look like that. You have to remember too many simple phrases to remember, and although it is not for everyone, anyone who does NOT laugh a lot of times does not have a pulse. Then, put it on and laugh Iceholes !!!
