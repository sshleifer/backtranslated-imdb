Although at one time I thought that this would become The graduate, I must say that Mother does an excellent job explaining the sexual desires of an older woman. <br /> <br /> I'm very glad this is a British movie because Hollywood would never have done it, and even if they had, they would have ruined it by not taking the time to develop the characters. <br /> <br /> The story is revealed slowly and realistically. The acting is magnificent, the characters have a credible fault and the dialogue is sensitive. I tried many times to predict what was going to happen, and I was always wrong, so I was intrigued by the story. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie. And I must confess that I will always look at my mother from a different perspective!
