My choice for the best movie of my life used to be "La noche del cazador" by Laughton, which is still excellent in my canon. But, it may have been supplanted by "Shower," which is the artistically Taoist film I've seen. The way in which taking care of others is represented by the flow of water, and the way in which water can be inspiration, comfort, cleanliness, etc., is the essence of the Dao. It can be argued that the themes NOFTH and Shower are similar, and that Lillian Gish in the first represents the purest form of Christianity, since the operators of the bathhouse represent the purest form of Taoism. I would not argue in any way against such an interpretation. Both films are visual joys in their integration of idea and image. However, Shower presents a vision so devoid of the sacredness of everyday life that I give it the thumbs up. I respect both.
