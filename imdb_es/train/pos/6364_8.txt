"Atlantis: The Lost Empire" was everything the previews indicated it would be. It is not often that you find that. Most of the time, the previews show only the best parts and then the rest of the movie is terrible. It is not like this. I liked the original plot, even though the subplots were not. The animation did not break through as "Shrek", but it was good nonetheless. The plot and the story line were well presented and there were only a few slow points. This keeps you interested. I found myself enjoying this. "Atlantis" receives and maintains your attention. You also have to think a little, but not too much. Once you think about it a bit, you can find out what has to happen, but you really do not know for sure how it's going to happen. <br /> <br /> The casting was also good. Michael J. Fox, like Milo was an excellent choice. Your personality fits very well. The gruff Commander Rourke was also well chosen with James Garner. His character reminded me of his performance in "Maverick", which I also liked. I really liked the casting of Claudia Christian as Helga Sinclair. His ability to play a meaningless personality makes the movie more interesting. It's a shame that she's a villain. <br /> <br /> In general, it is definitely worth it (8 out of 10).
