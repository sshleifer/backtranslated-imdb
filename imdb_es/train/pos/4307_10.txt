Well, maybe not immediately before the riots of Rodney King, but even a few months before it was timely enough. My parents said they saw him and the next thing they know is that the police were acquitted and LA was set on fire. It only serves to show the state of race relations in America. The plot has white Mack (Kevin Kline) and African-American Simon (Danny Glover) making friends after Simon saves Mack's life in the black ghetto. Meanwhile, the film producer Davis (Steve Martin in a serious role) thinks that gratuitous violence is really great ... until he is shot. There is also some existentialism in the film: Mack and his family realize that they are not living as they really want. <br /> <br /> It seems that "Crash" has renewed people's interest in race relations, but it came out much earlier. Maybe we can never have stable racial relations in this country. But anyway, "Grand Canyon" is a great movie. Kevin Kline states as my favorite actor. Also starring Mary McDonnell, Mary-Louise Parker and Alfre Woodard.
