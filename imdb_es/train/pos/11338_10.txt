I saw this in "Dances with Films", and it was amazing. I really felt for Jake. Talk about adding insult to injury! Not only are your parents divorcing, there is a monster behind you. <br /> <br /> It was both sincere and terrifying: there were several moments when the audience shouted with real fear. It reminded me of a Japanese horror movie, except that the story was really good. <br /> <br /> And that's what separated "Jake's Closet" from the film's usual pabulum, an excellent script with compelling characters. In addition, by mixing elements of the horror movie with the family drama, the film brings out the best of both genres and avoids the clich√©s of both. <br /> <br /> If it does not come out in theaters, definitely get the DVD.
