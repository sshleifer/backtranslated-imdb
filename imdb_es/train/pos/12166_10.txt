A very strange and convincing movie. He is a very clumsy and well wounded man who tries to navigate his life as a door-to-door fundraiser / seller. The director was able to capture a very disconcerting tone that really served the story. Original and disturbing at the same time he finds a lot of humor in the pain that accompanies life. There is a sequence in a test facility that really stood out and made me laugh out loud, which is not something I do as often as I should. One of the most memorable movies I've seen in a long time. I have not stopped thinking and I look forward to Bronstein's future efforts. Fantastic performances around him. The simple line "I really appreciate it". Now it is iconic for me.
