['It is moving to see a movie that does not hit men. In this case, the wife / mother leaves her family to &quot;get in touch&quot; with herself or pursue her libido. The father stays with the children and cares for them, leaving neither their work nor their love life to interfere with their love and responsibility towards them.']
