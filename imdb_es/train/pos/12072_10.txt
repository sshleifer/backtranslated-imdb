What would happen if Marylin Monroe, Albert Einstein, Joe Dimaggio and Senator McCarthy joined in a night of mind-boggling relativity? Veils and scathing exposures refer not only to the individuals they must have been, but also to what they came to represent over time. If you are confused by the allegory, or if you like your movies to be pre-digested and soft, you will not like this movie. It is a demanding work that rewards the viewer on many levels with the intelligence to appreciate it. <br /> <br /> For the moment, leaving aside the rigorous way of avoiding the use of the real names of the characters, we see Einstein, on the verge of giving a pacifist speech before a hell of the United Nations in search of of nuclear weapons, being visited by Marylin Monroe, after filming the notorious Seven Year Itch scene that some say led to the end of her marriage to Joe Dimaggio. They have a beautiful interaction in which Einstein stumbles upon the proper awkwardness of the faculty around the innocence of perhaps the greatest sexual symbol of modern times. <br /> <br /> Enter Senator McCarthy who believes Einstein is a red. He is determined to get Einstein's assurance that he will support the activities of the House Unanimous Activities Committee while handing over the last weapon in the name of peace. Add Joe, a surprisingly fragile and vulnerable person who may not be perfectly chosen as Gary Busey, who hates Marylin's exhibitionism and believes that Einstein has become his mistress, although Marylin only wants to prove to Einstein that he understands the Theory of Special relativity. <br /> <br /> But there is more. <br /> <br /> Like each of us, these characters have their deepest fears, which reveal one by one in disturbing flashbacks. It is these weaknesses, ultimately, that lend to humanity figures that we can not avoid seeing almost exclusively in today's summary. Finally, we see the shocking terror of Einstein's vision, and the film's statement becomes clear. It is a powerful and memorable moment. <br /> <br /> The insignificance is one of my five best films of all time. It is absolutely incredible.
