Along with "Brothers & Sisters", "Six Degrees" was one of my favorite new dramas of fall 2006. <br /> <br /> Great cast, but I really enjoyed the work of Campbell Scott (the photo of the return)) and Hope Davis (recent widow of the journalist murdered in Iraq). <br /> <br /> Apart from the performance, the writing was fresh and the performance excellent. The show was also filmed in New York, in the real city, not in Warner Bros. or in any other backlot studio, adding a secondary layer or realism. <br /> <br /> I guess people are more interested in the last "Survivor" and in another trash reality. Too bad it did not last.
