While listening again to Carmen de Bizet, the middle-aged choreographer Antonio (Antonio Gades) brings the sexy Carmen (Laura del Sol) to play the lead role. Antonio falls in love with Carmen, who is an independent and seductive woman incapable of accepting a possessive love. When Carmen has an affair with another dancer, Antonio is consumed by his jealousy as D. José in the original opera, intertwining fiction with reality. <br /> <br /> "Carmen" is another great movie from Carlos Saura's trilogy dedicated to El baile flamenco. The dramatic love story develops with the lives of the artists intertwined with the characters they are rehearsing, and often it is not entirely clear if what is happening is reality (with the dancers) or fiction (of the play). Paco de Lucía is another attraction of this original version of Bizet's famous opera, based on the novel by Prosper Mérimée. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Carmen"
