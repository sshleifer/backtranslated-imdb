Russell, my favorite, is wonderful in this movie. But more than that, the film covers a tremendous range of human passion and pain. Everything, from marriage to homosexuality, is approached and respected. The film makes the viewer realize that the tolerance of other humans provides the way to save humanity. Fabulous love story between Lachlin and Lil. I repeat his scenes again and again. Anyone who has been in love will empathize with these people. All the characters are cast and portrayed in an excellent way.
