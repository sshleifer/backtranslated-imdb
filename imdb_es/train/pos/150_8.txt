The latest film by Spanish director Agusti Villaronga is a study of how children who experience violence and isolation within their remote community become young adults with problems who need certain psychic tools to deal with their hidden mental weakness. Whether these tools are followed by religion at a fanatical level, caring for others or simply creating a macho image while engaging as male prostitutes, Villaronga creates a successful examination of how these vices affect three adolescents living in Spain under the Franco regime. All three witness the double disturbing death or their friends before they are adolescents and, later, bury the emotions they feel with their fragile bodies until they are again in a hospital for those suffering from tuberculosis. <br /> <br /> The cinematographic style of the text is usually visually opulent, as would be expected of the Spanish author, and it recalls the work of the Spanish compatriot Pedro Almodóvar with themes related to sexual desire, both heterosexual and homosexual. An element that is different between the two directors is that Villaronga prefers a supernatural tone spliced ​​with a stark and claustrophobic realism that opposes the use of surrealism by Almodóvar, although both styles are similar. <br /> <br /> The piece gives an idea of ​​the problematic The young psyche and contains disturbing violence and scenes of a sexual nature. I recommend watching this movie, as it contains elements that will remain in the audience for a considerable period after viewing it.
