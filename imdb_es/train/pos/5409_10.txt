I love this movie! The animation is great (for a pokémon movie), the CGI looks amazing. I love the music in the movie. So great that they kept the Japanese music. <br /> <br /> As for the story: it's great. He has a great feeling of friendship. Celebi is a very cute and powerful pokémon. Ash is really great in this movie, and I like his friendship with Sam. The only thing I did not like was Suicune's appearance, she just appears suddenly, helps Ash & co a bit and leaves. They could have done their part in the movie a little bit bigger. <br /> <br /> But in general, an awesome movie! I can not wait to own the USA version on DVD!
