Here is an excellent double bill by Barbara Stanwyck on a record. The first film, and believe me, the lesser of the two, is "To Please A Lady" (1950), MGM, which is paired with Clark Gable. It is essentially a star vehicle with Gable as usual, dominating the film with its presence on the screen. Here he plays a macho race driver who receives bad press from the feminist journalist Stanwyck and begins the battle of the sexes. Of course, after a long time, they finally end up in each other's arms and everything comes to a predictable and pleasant closure. Really a bit of a movement, but Gable and Stanwyck, two icons of the Golden Age, make it visible. <br /> <br /> But the real feature of this DVD is the second feature: a wonder and quite unknown. Small thriller called JEOPARDIA. Produced by MGM in 1953, this is a wonderful little gem of a movie that has not even been released! Here Stanwyck plays the wife of Barry Sullivan and the mother of his son Lee Aaker on vacation on a deserted and remote beach in Mexico when a sudden tragedy occurs. A dilapidated wooden pier collapses, trapping Sullivan under a heavy pylon and guess what? Yes, the tide is coming. Without a soul in sight and unable to free him, Stanwyck drives out to ask for help. After driving some distance, the only help she can get comes from an unscrupulous escaped convict (Ralph Meeker) who, in exchange for his help, wants more from her than money or a change of clothes ("I will do anything to save To my husband "). She or she does not? <br /> <br /> Meeker flees with the photo! It is delivered in a pretty brilliant performance! Once he enters the movie, you can not just take your eyes off him! An actor in the ardent Brando style, surprisingly never made much of his career in the movies. Although he gave splendid performances as the unfortunate and unfortunate cavalry officer in the outstanding "Naked Spur" western Mann / Stewart (1953) and as one of the damned French soldiers in the powerful drama WW1 Stanley Kubrick "Paths Of Glory" (1957) ). The only real claim to fame was like Mike Hammer in Mickey Spillane's "Kiss Me Deadly" in 1955. His performance in "Jeopardy" must have worked wonders with him, but he only had one regular career in the movies. He died in 1988. <br /> <br /> Due to this release, "Jeopardy" can now proudly occupy his rightful place as a classic noir. A memorable thriller, tense and exciting thanks to the excellent performances, the closed direction of John Sturges, the clear Monochromatic Cinematography of Victor Milner and an atmospheric score by Dimitri Tiomkin. Extras, however, are not great shakes except for a radio version of "Jeopardy" and trailers for both films. <br /> <br /> This album is also part of a Barbara Stanwyck set that celebrates its centenary. It's hard to believe that the lady would be over 100 years old if she were still around! <br /> <br /> JEOPARDIA: an MGM winner!
