['I question someone saying they are not interested in this movie. Some critics have said that it did not have enough action, others said it was too long, etc. Do not listen to them! If you like Shawshank Redemption and / or Braveheart, you will definitely love this movie! <br /><br /> The acting performances are excellent! Tim Roth, John Hurt and Jessica Lang are all extraordinary and Liam Neeson does an excellent job and is a very impressive character due to its size. The cinematography was brilliant and impressive. It&#39;s one of the few movies I&#39;ve seen in my life (along with Shawshank) that was virtually impeccable from casting, directing, writing, acting, etc. <br /><br /> I was surprised that this was not among the 50 or 100 films reviewed. I felt so passionate about it that I registered in IMDB so everyone could know the real scoop. I&#39;ve seen this movie about 10 times (each time with a different person) and everyone has loved it. You should be awake and pay attention carefully for the first 30 minutes, since they introduce enough characters at the beginning. If you have the attention span longer than most of these underage children who write reviews for movies on this site, then you will love this movie! Come on ... the 3 films of The Lord of the Rings in the top 9 and The Matrix in # 32?!?! That should show you the age range of most critics here! <br /><br /> This is one of the 50 best movies !!!']
