It is good to see that Vintage Film Buff has correctly categorized its excellent DVD release as "musical", since that is what this film is about, pure and simple. Like his unofficial remake, Murder in the Windmill (1949), the murder plot is just an excuse for an elaborate girl show with Kitty Carlisle and Gertrude Michael leading a cast of super-decorative girls that include Ann Sheridan , Lucy Ball, Beryl Wallace, Gwenllian Gill, Gladys Young, Barbara Fritchie, Wanda Perry and Dorothy White. Carl Brisson is also available to lend his strong voice to "Cocktails for Two". Undoubtedly the most popular song in the film, it is heard no less than four times. However, it is Gertrude Michael who steals the show, not only with her performance of "Sweet Marijauna" but with her strong performance as the rejected girlfriend of the hero. As for the rest of the cast, we could have done it without Jack Oakie and Victor McLaglen together. The only good thing about Oakie's role is her weak gag with the cult icon, Toby Wing. In fact, to give you an idea of ​​the extent to which the rest of the comedy has been outstripped and tense, the super silent Inspector McLaglen simply can not lay his hands on the killer, although, in this case, you believe. It turns out to be the person you most suspect. Director Mitch Leisen actually makes a great effort to point out to the killer even the dumbest members of the cinema audience, giving the player in question a close-up after a close-up.
