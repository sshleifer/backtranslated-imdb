First of all, I'm not going to praise IÃ±arritu's short film, I'm even Mexican and I'm proud of his success in mainstream Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Elsewhere, I see that most of the reviews focus on their favorite short films (and not so much); but we are forgetting that there is a subtle bottom line that surrounds the entire compilation, and may not be so nice for Americans. (Even if that was not the main purpose of the producers) <br /> <br /> What I'm talking about is that most of the short films do not show the suffering that WASP suffered due to the September terrorist attack. 11, but the suffering of other people. <br /> <br /> Do you need proof of what I'm saying? Look, in the short film from Bosnia, the message is: "Cry for the people who died in the Towers, but we (the Others = Eastern Europeans) cried long ago for the crimes committed against our women and nobody pays attention to us. as everyone has done to you. " <br /> <br /> Although the history of Burkina Fasso is more in comedy, there is the same thought: "You are angry because Osama Bin Laden hit you in such an evil, but we (the Others = Africans) should be more angry , because our people are dying of hunger, poverty and AIDS a long time ago, and no one pays attention to us as everyone has done to you ". <br /> <br /> Look now at Sean Penn's short film: The fall of the Twin Towers makes a lonely (and alienated) man happy. So, the message is that Power and Avarice (symbolized by the Towers) must fall so that people see the sunrise and the flowers bloom? It is remarkable that this terrible final result has been proposed by an American. There is so much irony in this short film that it is close to being subversive. <br /> <br /> Well, Ken Loach (well known for his anti-capitalist ideology) is much clearer and cheeky in going straight to the point: "You're angry because your country has been attacked by evil forces, but we ( the Others = Latin Americans) we suffer on a similar date something worse, and nobody remembers our pain as everyone has done to you ". br /> <br /> It's as if the creatives of this project wanted to say to the Americans: "Come now, United States, you are not the only ones who have become victims of world violence, you are not alone in your pain " and, by the way, we (the Others = the Non-Americans) have been suffering much more than you did a long time ago, so, we are in solidarity with you in your pain ... and, by the way, we are sorry because you have tried your own "Only the Mexican and French short films showed some compassion and sympathy for the Americans, the others are like a slap in the face for the US state, which is not the same as the American people.
