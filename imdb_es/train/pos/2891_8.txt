We saw it in "The Wonderful World of Disney" on ABC last night, and I came to the conclusion that things should be stricter in "the Mouse" than usual. <br /> <br /> Since this movie only lasted 74 minutes, and they had to pass it to 2 hours of television broadcast time, they did, and I'm not inventing, commercial breaks that lasted from 6 to 7 minutes. And during these commercial recesses, they had another announcement under the pretext of a "television show" presented by the annoying Kelly Rippa who loudly proclaimed the magical wonders of "Cinderella 2: Dreams Come True". <br /> <br /> Once and again, rest after break, Disney took the time from the real movie to tell the loyal viewers that we needed to get a copy of the sequel. Thank you, Disney, for giving us the service to create a sequel to your beloved gem of a movie. <br /> <br /> Anyway, all this commercialism and the ringing of the cash register hindered the task of entering the real movie of "Cinderella", because when the announcements ended, I had forgotten where the story had remained. <br /> <br /> But, of course, the original "Cinderella" still maintains its magic, and the story is still good, although we've all seen it countless times. It is a pity that they had to cheapen it with all the marketing for what seems to be little follow-up.
