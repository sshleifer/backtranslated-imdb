I had the privilege of seeing "Holly" at the Edinburgh Film Festival last week. What a powerful and moving story! Holly is a 12-year-old Vietnamese girl who is sold into prostitution by her own family and lives in a brothel in Cambodia. Patrick (an American) enters Holly's life and decides he wants to help her. When Holly is sold again, Patrick desperately looks for her. We continue your difficult journey through Cambodia and look forward to your meeting. <br /> <br /> Holly is one of the millions of children who are sold and trafficked every day. The film portrays this difficult subject without crossing the line. I left wanting to know more about the issue of child trafficking and asking how I can help. This film must be seen by all, since it is a beautiful story and exposes a subject that we should no longer ignore.
