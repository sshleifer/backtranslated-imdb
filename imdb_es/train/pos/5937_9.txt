After watching the short "Batman Dead End", I did not know what to really expect from World's Finest. Of course, Superman and Batman. All my comics of The World's Finest have them as a team. <br /> <br /> After seeing this trailer for 3 and a half minutes, it made me want someone to make a fan movie in series for World's Finest. if it is not a real film. <br /> <br /> Sure, some of Superman's stuff was cheesy, but movie trailers in theaters are always teasers, and they only give you certain aspects of the entire product. It seems you need a complete product. <br /> <br /> Besides the relative of director Sandy Collera who plays an extremely poor Perry White, most of the actors were unknown. If a real movie were made, the actors would be chosen to conform to the film's bill, although I think Nina Kaczorowski would be a good Lois Lane, especially if given a dialogue closer to the character. <br /> <br /> I'm glad to see Clark Bartram in the Dead End Batman costume, but he should upgrade a bit more and not be like the 40s Batman with the leather cape and hood of the 80s and 90s. His behavior is similar to that of Batman, but I still wonder about the validity of white contact lenses instead of just allowing his eyes to be seen through the mask. I think the goal was to bring him closer to both the comic character and the person in the film. <br /> <br /> Michael O'Hearn can not play Superman, period. He stands with a silly look on his face that simply says: "bofet√©ame". And the delivery of lines seems to be a problem for him. <br /> <br /> In general, I would love to see a complete story and a movie based on this ingenious work. There was a rumor that a movie of The Best of the World was being made, and with the correct additions to the script, it could be this. I hope more are done like this.
