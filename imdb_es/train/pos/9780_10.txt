I saw this film at the BIFFF Festival in Brussels, spring 2004. What a surprise! This German production, a shocking and elegant surprise, is one of the most terrifying films I've seen. Be careful: this is not a joke! This terrorist has a great cast of good actors (as an example: Peter Martell, as a European guru, has a strong presence), excellent direction, good production design, a very good soundtrack and a lot of heavy sfx gore like movies Italian horror in the eighties The flesh ripped to the bone ... and the blood turns red ... this wild Heart Stopper will grab you ... and give you some dark dreams ... A must!
