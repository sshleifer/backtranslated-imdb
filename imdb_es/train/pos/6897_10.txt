['It was released in France on DVD several years ago, I would like it to be re-released with English subtitles. Do not confuse this with a remake with Penelope Cruz who gets bad reviews. Gerard Phillippe is a peasant who is told by a fortune teller that he will marry the king&#39;s daughter. He leaves to join the army and goes to war. Her love, however, is Gina Lollabrigida in an early film for her. I will not ruin the end. Gerard Phillippe died a few years later at an early age, a great loss for the movement.']
