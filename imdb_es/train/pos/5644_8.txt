When the United States entered the First World War, the government forced Hollywood to produce propaganda films. THE LITTLE American is probably the best of all because it is starring Mary Pickford. <br /> <br /> Play a young woman divided between two men: Jack Holt (German) and Raymond Hatton (French), but her decision is delayed due to the war while the two men enlist. <br /> <br /> When the Pickford boat is sailing, is sunk by the Germans (think Lusitania) because it is carrying ammunition, Pickford has a big scene while standing in the lifeboat and yells at the German commander. Later, of course, she meets Holt and Hatton when they hold her as a prisoner of war in a castle. <br /> <br /> Director Cecil B. DeMille offers a really great scene in this movie as Pickford and Holt is roaming a bombed town. They pass a destroyed church of which there is only one standing wall. Against the wall there is a very large crucifix. As they stand and watch, the wall collapses, but the figure of Jesus remains suspended in the air. It is a very surreal moment in a film that, otherwise, is very simple and not very artistic. <br /> <br /> As always, it's a pleasure to see Pickford. She was always a very natural actress who avoided the histrionics that waved the arms used by many other actors of the time. She is also very very pretty. Holt is very good here in a leading role. Hatton is fine. Among the list of actors named in "extra" parts are Wallace Beery, Ramon Novarro, Colleen Moore, Ben Alexander, Hobart Bosworth, Norman Kerry, Walter Long, James Neill and Edythe Chapman. <br /> <br /> It's not a great movie, but interesting to see the US propaganda at work.
