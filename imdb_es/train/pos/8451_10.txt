How I got involved: when I started watching this series on Cartoon Network, I must say that I had never seen anything like it, and it was the best thing. But when I started to collect the series on VHS, and years later, I was part of the Anime Legends Bandai DVD. It was amazing, and really worth seeing. He had a lot of explosive action that will take you out of your seat. And, of course, the theme songs "Just Communication" and Rhythm Emotions were the best. <br /> <br /> Characters and Gundams: My favorite characters in the program were: Heero, Duo, Relena, Treize, Lady Und, Noin and Zechs. My favorite Gundams in the program that I liked the most are the Wing Zero, the Epyon and, of course, the Altron, the Deathscythe I and the II. <br /> <br /> Meaning of the Show: What this series also tells us is that in real life, wars are very difficult and sometimes we can win or lose. But peace can also be difficult to obtain, and I believe that the Gundam pilots are doing the right thing, and are trying to obtain world peace. <br /> <br /> But, however, this program is really the best of the best. So to close this review, after watching this show, watch the movie Endless Waltz.
