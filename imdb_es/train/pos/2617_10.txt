I saw King Leon more times than all my friends are together. Have a little sister ... you know how it is. For now I memorized both the plot and the lines. After Lion King 2 came out, it was like ok, well, let me see ... the second one was significantly weaker ... then I saw an announcement of lion king 1 and 1/2 ... it was like ok, there we go new . After seeing the 1 1/2 it was like wow. All my expectations (for repetitiveness) were broken. A truly charming and original plot keeps you glued to your seat all the time. I realized that the cartoon was full of so many funny moments that ROFlmao will be applied here 100%. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend seeing the cartoon.
