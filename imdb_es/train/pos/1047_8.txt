It may (or may not) be considered interesting that the only reason I really reviewed this movie in the first place was because I wanted to see the performance of the man who beat Humphrey Bogart in his CASABLANCA (10/10 role for the Oscar for best actor.) ( I would still have given the Oscar to Bogie, but Paul Lukas did a great job and deserved the nomination, at least.) Well, I'm glad I saw this movie, because I enjoyed it immensely, I think the movie preached a bit, but it did not I just did not care, I enjoyed the speeches and I never got bored with them. <br /> <br /> The performance was outstanding in this film, I especially enjoyed Paul Lukas, Lucile Watson (legitimately nominated for an Oscar), Bette Davis ( erroneously not nominated), George Coulouris and, curiously, Eric Roberts, who plays the middle child, I really enjoyed his character: a strange looking guy who talks like a kind of philosopher, he just criticizes me. or the name of the characters (Bodo) is fun. <br /> <br /> The final g, in which the character of Lukas was forced to do something that he considered wrong, although he did it for all the right reasons, it also worked for me. I agreed with why I felt I had to do what he did, and I understood why I could not explain it. The message that makes this film is good and noble, the landscape (that is, the house) is beautiful and the performance is excellent. Watch this movie if you ever have the chance. <br /> <br /> 9/10
