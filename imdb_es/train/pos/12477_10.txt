My family and I have seen this movie often over the years. It is clean, healthy, heartbreaking and comforting. Showing compassion between two families from two countries thousands of miles away and by the most amazing of coincidences, it is almost as if the hand of God had to intervene. <br /> <br /> 5 years Jodelle Micah Ferland who plays Desi, the little girl who suffers the heart, does a great job acting on their part, and for me she was Priam's choice for the lead role. <br /> <br /> In general, 10 out of 10. There are no disadvantages of this sweet human story. Children of all ages will cry, then they will see it happily and reunite the family that sees it with smiles and good feelings.
