I really liked Tom Barman's AWTWB. You just have to let it come and enjoy it while it lasts, and do not expect anything. It's like sitting in a caf√©-terrace with a beer, under the summer sun, and watching people go by. It definitely will not make you reflect later, that's true, but that's not a prerequisite for a good movie. The experience during the movie is excellent. <br /> <br /> I felt there were some lines that could have been resolved a bit more, but since I'm a Lynch fan, I do not care much anymore. <br /> <br /> And I loved the style or the style of this movie. It's polished, but fresh, and the soundtrack is a beauty. Any lover of music will get its advantages from AWTWB, I assure you. <br /> <br /> I'll give you 8 out of 10. <br /> <br /> (in terms of music, 10 out of 10)
