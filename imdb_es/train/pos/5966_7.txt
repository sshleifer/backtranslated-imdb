Actually, I never thought that metal was satanic and those things, but this movie looks like that idea. Although it is certainly not a movie to be taken seriously or for a really high rating, it serves its purpose, as it entertains while playing. The story has a metal band burned in his hotel, one of his fans has a dream in this regard and says that the band begins to kill itself from beyond the grave. So yes, a bit of the plot of "Nightmare on Elm Street" here. Granted, Freddy had never bothered a girl in a car before. There was another movie with a heavy metal band on it, but it was very different in the way he played, since he had a band that took over a city of children and made them crazy. This simply has the only fan of the band that helps the murderous spirit at first and then tries to stop it. There's nothing dreadful about it, since I do not remember all those bloody killings. Quite frankly, the scene I remember most is the scene of the girl wearing the headphones and then being annoyed by an incarnated creature of the band. Nothing great, but a good time padding.
