Wow, this movie had a big impact on me, it moved me. It is an incredible story about a girl in Cambodia who is sold in the sex trade. I can not stop thinking about the fate of the girl named Holly. The scenario of the film is realistic, the film was revealing, I can not imagine anyone moving away from it without wanting to help change this horrible problem that exists. <br /> <br /> The content of The Movie was very moving. It was one of the best movies I've seen this year. The girl <br /> <br /> who plays Holly does a fantastic job with her character. Ron Livinston gives a fantastic performance. The film moved me to tears, it says an important message that should be heard all over the world. Everyone should go to see this movie. I think this movie will make a difference, I loved it!
