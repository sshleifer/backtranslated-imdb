Undoubtedly the best of John Le Carre's novels, exquisitely transformed into a classic film. Performances by Peter Egan (Magnus Pym, The Perfect Spy), Rudiger Weigang (Axel, real name Alexander Hampel, Czech intelligence controller Magnus), Ray McAnally (father of Magnus swindlers) and Alan Howard (Jack Brotherhood, mentor of Magnus, British believer and controller), along with the rest of the characters, are so perfect and natural that the person responsible for choosing them should have received a prize. Even the small parts, like the Major Membership, are performed perfectly. It says a lot for the power of the performances and the strength of the characters in the novel that, despite Magnus' duplicity, we can not help but feel closer to Magnus and Axel than to Jack Brotherhood and the viscous Grant Lederer of US Intelligence . . I have read the book at least a dozen times, and I have seen the movie almost as many times, and both continue to hypnotize me. If I had a book to face a desert island, A Perfect Spy would be the option above all others.
