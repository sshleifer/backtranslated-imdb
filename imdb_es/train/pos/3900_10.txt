This is at the top of my list of the funniest and hysterical shows I've seen. I laughed so much that I'm sure I missed half the jokes. This shows Izzard as the brilliant talent comedian he is. What I particularly like is that he seems to be never "sinking" the material for his audience. His time is impeccable and the routine joins as a piece of performance instead of a series of gags. Thumbs up.
