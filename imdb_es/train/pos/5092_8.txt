I thought that King Solomon's Mines were very well made. My only reservation was Alison Doody. His performance was excellent, but his makeup and hair were not of the time, and always seemed to make him look out of place with the other actors. I thought Patrick Swayze was an excellent choice for Alan Quatermain. It was nice to see an experienced and robust-looking actor in this role after moving from film to movie with actors with blond hair and light skin like Val Kilmer, Brad Pitt, etc. It was an excellent choice and I enjoyed every minute of this movie. This version can not be compared to the 1950 version with Stewart Grainger. It was a big screen movie and not a television movie. I thought that both Quatermains were credible, but the two means must be kept separate. I hope to see this one more time, and I hope that Patrick Swayze will see this kind of role again.
