and laugh out loud in many scenes. <br /> <br /> The basic plot of the film is well told, a story of opposites trying to find a way to survive one another very close. <br /> <br /> This is undoubtedly the best film of Lemmon and Matheau as co-stars, and the interaction between the careless Oscar and the OCD Felix is ​​classic. <br /> <br /> The scene in which Oscar makes a double date, leaves the room briefly, and returns to find Felix and the two crying girls is invaluable. <br /> <br /> For any fan of intelligent comedies, The Odd Couple is a movie that "does everything possible to see it."
