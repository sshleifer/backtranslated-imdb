['One of the greatest hits of 1926, Brown of Harvard is an exciting comedy / drama with racing scenes and football that gave William Haines the role he needed to become a big star. He has patented Haines at all times: shameless, intelligent, who does not take anything seriously until he is rejected by everyone, mocks and becomes a man / hero and wins the girl. No one worked this formula like Haines. A fabulous comic actress (Little Annie Rooney with Mary Pickford, Show People with Marion Davies), Haines could move from comedy to tragedy with a change in facial expression. It is a total joy in this film as it was in Tell It to the Marines (with Lon Chaney) and in West Point (with Joan Crawford), where he repeats the formula. Mary Brian is good as the girl, Jack Pickford is very good as the sickly partner, Ralph Bushman is the rival. Edward Connelly, Mary Alden, David Torrence, Guinn Williams and Grady Sutton, co-stars. This film is now known for its homoerotic relationship between Haines and Pickford and for being the film debut of John Wayne as a Yale soccer player (but I never saw him). Haines was one of the five best box office stars from this image until 1932. It is a pity that he has been largely forgotten and that most of his films seem to be lost. He was one of the most attractive and talented actors of his time.']
