It's not a movie to be taken seriously, but it's a great little movie. <br /> <br /> It's definitely NOT just a piece of fluff. The performance, IMO, is excellent. <br /> <br /> One of those movies that you would not bother to watch, but it brings a smile every time it appears on cable. Like an old friend. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing if you have the opportunity. <br /> <br /> - - - - - - - -
