"The Classic War of the Worlds" by Timothy Hines is a very entertaining film that obviously makes a great effort and strives to faithfully recreate the classic book by H. G. Wells. Mr. Hines manages to do it. I, and those who watched his movie with me, appreciate the fact that it was not the standard and predictable Hollywood fare that comes out every year, for example. The version of Spielberg with Tom Cruise, that had hardly the smaller similarity with the book. Obviously, everyone looks for different things in a movie. Those who imagine themselves as amateur "critics" seek only to criticize everything they can. Others qualify a film on more important bases, such as entertainment, which is why most people never agree with the "critics". We enjoyed the effort Mr. Hines made to be faithful to the classic novel of H.G. Wells, and we found it very entertaining. This made it easy to overlook what the "critics" perceive as their shortcomings.
