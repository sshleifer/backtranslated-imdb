A chemist develops a fabric that never gets dirty or wears out, but it is considered a threat to the survival of various industries. In this charming comedy by Ealing Studios, Guinness is wonderful as the chemist of good manners but persistent. Greenwood, with his sensual voice, plays the love interest; Parker is his father harassed. Thesiger is fun as a patriarch of the web industry. While telling an engaging story, the film also raises some interesting questions about science, economics and politics. It is directed by Mackendrick, who then went on to make "The Ladykillers" and the sublime "Sweet Smell of Success" later in the 1950s.
