Like the comedy duo of its title, "The Sunshine Boys" has become a classic forgotten 30 years later. It is hardly mentioned next to other great cinematographic comedies of the seventies. This does not make sense given the special uniqueness of this film, perhaps the best that Neil Simon has ever written. <br /> <br /> Walter Matthau plays Willy Clark, once half of a legendary vaudeville comedy known as Lewis and Clark, now a bitter 73-year-old solo act who can not get a job in a commercial of french fries. His nephew and agent Ben (Richard Benjamin) are sure he can get a job if Willy only agrees to meet with his partner Al Lewis (George Burns) for a nostalgia celebration of the ABC-TV show world. <br /> <br /> Nostalgia is what "Sunshine Boys" has in its favor, right from the start, when a series of 1920s movie clips that show various artists of yesteryear blink in front of us with the accompaniment of "Be A Clown" by Cole Porter. Then there's the current scene of the movie in Manhattan, where flared pants and wide polyester ties abound. Times clash in Willy's glorious mess in a Manhattan apartment, where framed photos and cartoons of dead celebrities stare from the walls at the headlines of the tabloid tabloids and empty bags of Zabar. If you were alive in the 1970s like me, maybe you feel like you're in that apartment. <br /> <br /> Clearly, Willy has been living there too long. He's sleeping in front of the TV when the kettle in the other room boils. Willy wakes up and picks up the phone. <br /> <br /> "Hello, who is it?" A pause "It does not matter, it's tea." <br /> <br /> Old men who live alone can be sad material in the hands of anyone else, but Sim√≥n's ingenious wit and infallible sentiment for the character makes this adaptation of his 1972 theatrical success into a comedy. gold. The surprising thing about "The Sunshine Boys" is how much you brush your nose in the almost existential state of Willy without turning off at all. "Of 89 years and so, he does not die of anything" "Willy says of an old friend composer, before deciding that the man probably died when writing a song that rhymes" lady "with" baby ". <br /> <br /> Burns won an Oscar for his unobtrusive performance as the gentle but staunch Lewis, but it is Matthau who brings him to his home, his makeup and his pride but crumpled really selling him the idea that he already had 73 years when he did this. Willy is extremely detestable, and deserves Ben's description of "crazy crazy," but you support him, enjoying his small victories even when they cost the patience of others. His lines also kill you, especially when he is trying to kill Lewis, for whom the television meeting turns out to be a bad idea. <br /> <br /> "He's out of touch!" Willy tells Lewis at one point. "I'm still in demand, I'm still hot." <br /> <br /> "If this room were on fire, you would not be hot," Lewis replies. <br /> <br /> Director Herbert Ross films everything in a very informal and discreet way, with low lighting and mid-range shots even in emotional moments to make room for comedy and the message of general grace of the film through of silent acceptance. You never get the feeling of watching a movie, one of the many charms of "The Sunshine Boys", and the direction of Ross, like the performance of the three directors, helps a lot to achieve that end. <br /> <br /> Comedy is difficult, especially when the subjects are people who watch their lives go by, but "The Sunshine Boys" makes everything seem like a pleasure, because, for us, seeing it is.
