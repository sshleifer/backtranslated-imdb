Dana Andrews is one of those actors that I've probably seen in a dozen movies, but who has never registered for me. Often stolid, taciturn, who plays the same kind of roles and who looks a little like Glenn Ford, underestimated in a similar way, is an actor who strives to really appreciate; but once you hit the right movie ... <br /> <br /> And this is it. Preminger's grumpy look at the most vulnerable part of New York is as filthy and sordid as any 50s noir, and Andrews is in his element like the too-tough cop Mark Dixon who simply does not know how to play the game to get ahead: he hates the criminals too much to play by the rules always. At the beginning of the film, he accidentally kills the witness of a murder related to a game of illegal trash created by a mobster that Dixon hates for personal reasons, and spends the rest of the movie trying to cover up his involvement and take the mobster to his type of "justice". Along the way, he gets involved with the wife separated from the man he killed (Gene Tierney) and also has to try to free his father for the murder. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly photographed by Joseph LaShelle, with Ben Hecht's The Hard and Sparkling Dialogue and a truly powerful ending with elements of tragedy and grace in just a minute or two of time, this is another noir for age and it could be my favorite Preminger movie so far. Good as the most advertised Laura.
