I do not want to spend a lot of time here wandering about the plot: you've seen the trailer and, if you do not have it, it's online. However, I do not recommend seeing it, it was poorly designed and did not contain any of the laughter or magic of the movie. So those who avoid this movie because of their evil trailer should give it a try. It is fun. I was impressed by the intelligence and originality in this movie. The first 40 minutes had me on the ground in hysterics, my only problem was that it evolved unnecessarily to become a bad Austin Powers movie in the final 20. However, this is one of the few movies in which the end of the The season did not displease me. The rest of the movie (which is usually the case). All give a great performance (especially Joan Cusack) and there are really great moments in everything. Personally I plan to see him again when he comes out, just to capture all the details that I was laughing at during the first viewing!
