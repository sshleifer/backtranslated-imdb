I turned this on to see the amazing Ethel Waters, whose autobiography I am now reading. I admit that I was speechless when they started shooting pork chops and watermelon references, but people can not see this movie as a stereotyped or racist piece. It is practically a short film made by blacks, for blacks at a time when the entertainment industry was quite segregated and the stereotypes for the people involved were the jokes of their time, the old exaggerated tendencies for humor. We see that modern black films do the same, but with new trends (stereotypes), "ho's" and "hood" and so on. I think if you look back in eighty years, you'll find that today's movies will look just as racist. What the viewers should appreciate of this film is the talent of Waters and the little Sammy Davis Jr., who taps on his contemporary, Shirley Temple, and looks surprisingly like him as an adult. Everyone involved in this movie had a lot of fun doing it. Why not enjoy it for what it is, instead of what you think it should have been?
