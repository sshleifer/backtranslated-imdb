There are so many "Hollywood" movies made now that are not only torture to watch, but also have no connection with anyone's life. Of course, movies do not always have to have a deep meaning, but it's good to know that there are still filmmakers who care about telling "human" stories. I will not reveal the premise of this brilliant film, however, the script is surely one of the most complex and memorable I've seen in my life, and I'm also a 32 year old movie buff! Bug ranks in the top ten on my favorites list, which includes: On the Waterfront, Sunset Boulevard and Black Narcissus, to name just a few. This movie "on the move" should become one of your favorites too, that is, if you have a heart!
