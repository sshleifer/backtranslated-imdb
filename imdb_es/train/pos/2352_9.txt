I have to say that, when "Pushing Daisies" came out, I immediately won the fairy tale as that of such a grim expression. The narrator made a cake of the whole ordeal making death seem as routine as, well, Ned (Lee Pace) baking cakes. And that restored their lives was so routine. <br /> <br /> The trio of Ned, Emerson Cod (Chi McBride) and Charlotte "Chuck" Charles (Anna Friel), in addition to the sometimes Olive Snook (Kristin Chenoweth, who made the musical Wicked a delight, He made a fantastic dialogue and stupidity, definitely deserving the title of a comedy / drama (romantic). <br /> <br /> Ned and Chuck created a shy and not quite ready for love that is still exploring their feelings even if they can not touch - an obstacle that does not seem to really be an obstacle with aids such as gloves, cellophane and extravagant schedules throughout the apartment, but despite the discomfort they present while working their feelings around a strange secret that only a few You know, they still manage to show their chemistry on the screen by playing scenes like when Ned gives Chuck the hives.The presence of Olive, however, causes that there are some moments of rupture in the song in the bakery and unforeseen complications for the couple. <br /> <br /> The second season was drastically reduced, putting a stop to a show that had real potential In some of the episodes, the plot line was hasty and uncomfortable, so you ask " What just happened? "Both in the general plot of deceased people of the week and in the main storyline. The addition of Chuck's father plus two half-brothers to Ned did not help, and at least one of the lines of the plot felt almost recycled (the episode "Comfort Food" did not feel like the episode "Bitter Sweets" in the fact That the dead person of the week died at the meal? Some moving moments (the hives) happened to help improve the relationship between Chuck and Ned, but every time they got close, the writers decided to throw another wrench instead of leaving that the relationship developed (Oliver returns from the monastery, Chuck's dead father comes back to life and does not come back, you get an idea). <br /> <br /> It's a shame that it did not work, but the concept was good and It seemed surreal in a good way, enough Nice colors / happy smiling and unlikely scenarios to remind you that it is not "Dead Like Me." On the other hand, it is in "Pushing Daisies time", according to the creator Bryan Fuller, so it returns to be plausible. <b r /> <br /> It should have lasted longer, but at this moment it's just a nostalgic thought. Congratulations to any new show that tries to replace this gem of short duration.
