Yes, some people have said that this movie was a waste of money, but I'm the kind of fan of the dragon action / world end / sacred shit movie. <br /> <br /> But if you take it from My point of view of this movie it was that some of the best action scenes were pretty good. But it's that kind of movie that everything became more difficult at the right time, or almost when the evil collapsed, something was saved to save them at the right time. Although there were some funny lines and gangs throughout the movie that surprised me. <br /> <br /> The 3D graphics were very good. I want to say that for this type of movie the 3D effects were GREAT! The great battle that was shown in the trailers was at the height of the exaggerations that the film had. The fight between good and evil in the end was, I have to say it could have been longer and slightly better, it was still pretty good. <br /> <br /> Now, to the parties that I think could have been better. The beginning was quite good showing the parts that led to the great battles. I mean, if you really do not want to go see this movie in theaters, at least this is a DVDer ... <br /> <br /> in general, I loved the movie, but the plot simply fit into place for fast and fit harder just for the better.
