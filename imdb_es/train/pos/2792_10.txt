I love this movie. It is a great film that combines English and Indian cultures with feminist themes, such as girls who want to practice sports that were previously reserved for men. It shows the struggles of both an Indian person who wants to break down their cultural barriers and of women who want to break the gender restrictions found in sports, especially in England at that time. I feel that cultural struggles are more accentuated than the other issues. <br /> <br /> In contrast to the other comment, I do not think this movie is like Dirty Dancing or any other movie of this type. This movement is loved by many types of people, men and women, young and old alike.
