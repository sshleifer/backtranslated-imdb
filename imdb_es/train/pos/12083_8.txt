The second characteristic refers to a young woman in London who is desperate for a job, happy to accept the position of secretary with an old woman and her son. The thrillers about people detained in a house against their will always make me a little uncomfortable, I also end up feeling like a prisoner, but this rather elegant B movie is neither spooky nor claustrophobic. It is unlikely and improbable, but not lacking in interest, and our heroine (Nina Foch) is quick on her feet. Rehashing this in 1986 (as "Dead Of Winter") proved not to be wise, since the elements of the plot are not current. "Julia Ross" is extremely compact (too short in 65 minutes!) But she keeps the course very well until a climax too hurried, which feels a bit neglected. *** since ****
