The piece of the period, strangely entertaining and set in the 30s, is a twist on the classic cliffhanger series, as well as on "Raiders of the Lost Ark", made only on a low budget and much more elegant by the director Michael Anderson. The first scenes include a large amount of Gothic nuveau art, which predates Batman for two decades. Starring Ron Ely (Tarzan) as a hero of the perfect cast and the beautiful Pamela Hensley as the local Mona Latina who accompanies our hero in a gold hunt in the nonexistent Latin American country of Hidalgo. The best line, our hero for Mona, holding a fist on her chin just when you expect her to be tender with her and give her a hug: "Mona, you're a brick." <br /> <br /> Paul Wexler Blackhat of ham and cheese, Captain Seas is an absolute delight. Wait a bit of "Raiders ...", a pinch of "Batman", a bit of "The Lost World", a bit of "Lost Horizons" and a lot of campiness and you'll do fine. Beware of cult favorite Michael Berryman in a small part as an entrepreneur and enjoy the country-style patriotic music of John Philip Sousa. A leading candidate for the DVD release, it is certainly over. An unmissable delight for the whole family. 9/10
