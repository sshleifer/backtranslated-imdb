When I saw the Exterminators of the year 3000 for the first time, I had no expectations for that movie. Although, it was not as bad as you thought. It is a kind of Italian version of Roadwarrior, with cast, which is almost famous in Italy, including Venantino Venantini. Behind the story is Elisa Briganti and Dardano Sacchetti, who are also responsible for the history of Zombie meat eaters. You can also see other links to Italian horror movies: Luca Venantini plays the role of Tommy, and you can see that girl in Paura nella citta dei morti viventi (City of the Living Dead, also known as Gates of hell) as John Robbins and in the apocalypse of Cannibal as the role of Maria's brother. Pretty entertaining movie, with some boring parts.
