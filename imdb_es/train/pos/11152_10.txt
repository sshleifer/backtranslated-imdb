Seeing Midnight Cowboy is like taking a master class in acting / directing / cinematography / editing / writing. I was too young to see it when it was originally launched, and I only saw it for the first time a couple of years ago, but it has stood the test of time, and I've seen it several times since then. <br /> <br /> Everything about this film is brilliant, from the moving performances of Voight and Hoffman (although I know this movie well, I still find myself getting better every time Voight shows one of his innocently hurtful looks, or Hoffman coughs in his sickly and sinister form to the impressive cinematography and magnificently edited sequences of dreams. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that more of our contemporary filmmakers are not prepared to risk making films that are so visual and auditory Like this, at midnight you should be required to see a cowboy in all the film schools. <br /> <br /> 10/10
