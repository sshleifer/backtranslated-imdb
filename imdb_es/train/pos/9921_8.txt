I have been an admirer of Edward Burtynsky's work for years, and it was a pleasure to see the man at work, thanks to Jennifer Baichwal's documentary. The great beauty of the ship-breaking yard in Bangladesh, the stone quarry in Vermont, the huge assembly plant in China, the embattled Shanghai old quarters that are waiting to be demolished: these landscapes are captured so well by the photographer and the filmmaker. <br /> <br /> Sometimes I thought about old television documentaries about abandoned coal mines and plastic mold factories; The kind of things that I grew up seeing. Burtynsky's work has the great value of pointing out how industrial activity has only changed to Asia, it has not stopped. The strangest scene for me was the scrapping of computers somewhere in China: the garbage had a menacing air, while the workers were very jovial.
