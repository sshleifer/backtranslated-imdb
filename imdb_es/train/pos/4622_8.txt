At the beginning, I stumbled upon the Seven Minutes in the Sky of Linda Feferman when I was 14, I worked in a video store and I loved it. I recently saw the movie again and I realized that it is a lost treasure. Movie star Jennifer Connelly, almost twenty years earlier, would win an Oscar for Beautiful Mind, such as Natalie Becker. Byron Thames plays his best friend in the world, Jeff Moran. The film is definitely a softer, cuter and softer version of the Pretty in Pink and Some Kind of Wonderful models from the 1980s, and that's why it's so good. It's honest, not forced like those movies, and parents will enjoy watching this movie with the kids there. <br /> <br /> When Natalie's dad leaves the house on a business trip, Jeff convinces her to move because his family life sucks. With the support of Natalie's friend, Polly, exquisitely interpreted by Maddie Corman, she leaves him. But this film is not about putting children in situations and see what they can do. The three tracks are so natural and the script, surprisingly so honest, that the best of their performances is heartbreaking. These characters really care about each other. It is a great movie to show children that they are reaching pre-adolescence. <br /> <br />
