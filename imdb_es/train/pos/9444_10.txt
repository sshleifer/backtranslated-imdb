*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Full of memorable moments (like the previous quote, immortalized by Primus), Deliverance tells the story of four men who travel to the forests to go rafting. and get away from the big city for a while just to discover that your fun will soon have a bad turn. This is not a Hollywood movie. Virtually no special effects at all, the environment is extremely realistic and nothing at all is sweetened or made beautiful. The boys of the city look like the city boys, and even the tough guy Louis, accurately represented by Burt Reynolds, is clearly at the mercy of nature on this trip. This is a perfect example of a "what if" movie. What would happen if some friends rafted in an area of ​​the forest that neither of them was familiar with, and ended up desperately trying to avoid being judged and convicted of murders they were forced to commit to save their own lives? > <br /> There is clearly a very strong element of the film that deals with social and class structure and the relationship (or lack of it) between rural and urban peoples. When the four boys arrive at the forest at the beginning of the film, they clearly do not know very well how to interact with the people who live there, and they talk to them as if they were not sure if they will understand or be able to communicate. This communication block is memorably illustrated in the dueling banjoes scene, where they are trying to load gas into the car and the truck and get someone to drive the vehicles down the river for them. While Drew and the obviously indebted and probably mentally deficient child on the porch duel with his guitar and banjo (one of the best scenes in the movie), Louis is having some difficulty buying fuel, and Bobby comments on genetic deficiencies and how pathetic everything is. When the boy moves away from Drew, who had offered to shake hands after his great improvisational session, Bobby tells him to give the boy a couple of dollars, knowing that none of them is sure how to react. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of thing we see in Deliverance that sets up much of the tension that will follow. This great scene where he had a lot of fun (including the funniest scene from "southern redneck" to O O Brother, Where Art Thou?) He ended up with everyone uncomfortably unsure of what to do with each other. These people are apples and oranges, and they live according to completely different rules of life. The people Louis, Bobby, Drew and Ed are in the hills grew apart from modern society and modern laws, and live according to the rules of nature, which do not include those you should not kill. Confused by their uncomfortable behavior, the four friends threw themselves into the river, waiting for the oddity to end and the adventure to begin. <br /> <br /> (spoilers) When they briefly separate from each other and Ed and Bobby run into the hills by the river that quickly become unpleasant, the uncertainty about the way these people live, which was set in The previous scene comes into play to create the greatest tension during the scene. I think a good sign of a quality thriller like this is that the tragic element of the film, namely the actual assaults and murders, takes up a very small amount of screen time, but it's still one of the most memorable parts of the movie. Here there is no gratuitous violence, everything is there for an obvious purpose and achieves a surprisingly powerful effect. <br /> <br /> The movement is about the violent clash of two very different types of people, and what can happen when they are inadvertently at war with each other. The journey through the rest of the river after the assault, which occupies most of the film, releases a spectacularly effective tension, and keeps you on the edge of your seat while not bombarding you with so many things that numb you. It's surprisingly effective when we discover that Ed could have killed the wrong man on the cliff, and the tension in the film does not even stop when the three surviving members of the team reach the bottom of the river. , because they give a questionable explanation to the police about what happened up there in the river and why the deputy's brother-in-law is missing. <br /> <br /> This is a very disturbing movie, which is a testimony of it being a success, because it is quite obvious that a movie like this is meant to shake people up a bit. The Hillbillies are the human version (ie, more realistic) of the subhuman peasant peasants seen in children's films but quite similar as Gator Bait and Gator Bait 2, none of which could be compared to a timeless film like Deliverance. When we follow these four men through their fateful weekend in the forest, the natural element is so real and we know men so well and in such a subtle way that it is almost like us, as individuals in the audience, we are really a Fifth member of the team. It is not often that a movie can be seen that way.
