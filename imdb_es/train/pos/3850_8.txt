This is the last film in the Dutch language made by Paul Verhoeven before continuing with the Hollywood films "Basic Instinct", "Robocop" and "Total Recall", among others. He sets the stage by opening this story with a black widow spider that catches its prey in its net before we meet Gerard Reve, an annoying and self-centered writer with a morbid imagination. Gerard has been invited to be the guest speaker at a Literary Club meeting in a coastal city, approximately one hour from Amsterdam. Verhoeven allows us to glimpse how Gerard's imagination distorts reality. When asked if the writers are a bit close to madness, he admits when he reads the newspaper "and says" boom ", I read" doom ", when he says" flood ", I read" blood ", when he says" red ", I see" dead " "When he tells a story enough times, he begins to believe it," I lie to the truth. "He accepts an offer to be the night guest of the Club treasurer, a beautiful and wealthy salon owner. that her husband has died, begins to imagine that she is "a black widow." Is this her touch more of her reality or is she a murderer? This is a psychological drama and when telling which of these old movies have remained in my memory, I discovered that it is my favorite genre.looking at his body of work seems also to be that of Paul Verhoeven, and he is a master at making us question our own understanding of reality.It is a good change of pace from the usual Hollywood rate. I saw it in 1983 and it's a movie that "hit".
