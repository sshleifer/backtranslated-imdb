I remember seeing this when it premiered, in a theater in Palo Alto, and I did not expect much. I mean, an Australian movie? But finally it came to me. Here is a scene. Richard Chamberlain is sitting cross-legged on the floor of a run-down apartment in Sydney, facing an elderly Australian aborigine named Charlie. <br /> <br /> Chamberlain: "You were out of my house last night, you scared my wife, who are we?" And Charlie responds deliberately: "Who are you, Who are you, Who are you, Who are you, Who are you, Are you a fish, Are you a snake, Are you a man?" Who you are? Who you are? Who you are? It is an impressive scene, shot in close-ups, with Chamberlain's soft and attractive face filling the screen in opposition to Charlie's wide, bearded black face. <br /> <br /> The two types could not be more different and different. this film is the story of how Chamberlain accidentally stumbles into his boring life as a lawyer in the inexplicable, almost ineffable mysteries of Charlie's world. <br /> <br /> I do not think I'm going to talk a lot about the plot. It is a kind of apocalyptic tale. But I must say that whoever did the research on Australian aboriginal belief systems should get an A more. They have everything here, from pointing the bone to the time of sleep, a kind of parallel universe in which dreams are real. It is an extremely spooky movie, without musical stings or splendid special effects. Charly's world simply begins to intrude into Chamberlain's dreams, for reasons that have never been fully clarified. <br /> <br /> If there is a problem with the script, that's it. Nothing is ever completely clear. Chamberlain, who seems to have an extraordinary relationship with the aborigines, dies in the last wave? The aborigines? The whole of Sydney? The basic premise is a bit difficult to accept as well, although it is admitted that this is a fantasy. Aborigines are given the kind of spiritual power that Americans give to American Indians, while the fact is that mythology is mythology and while one may be more complex or satisfying, more elegant and beautiful, if desired, Mythology is still a problem. try to transcend an ordinary physical existence, demanding and, sometimes, disappointing. Charlie's mysticism is more convincing than Moses' miracles in Cecil B. DeMille's "The Ten Commandments," but they are brothers under the skin. <br /> <br /> But I do not care about that. Taken as a movie, this one is pretty good, and it's especially important to mark the celebrity of the director, Peter Weir, and the Australian film industry. This was the first of a great wave of films from the antipodes, some of them strident, like "Mad Max", and some subtle and dramatic, like "Lantana". I like Weir's things, which resemble those of Nicholas Roeg in being pregnant with a subliminal fear. Try "Picnic at Hanging Rock" to see an example of how to make a really creepy movie without a drop of blood.
