What's good about it: some ingenious and genuinely spooky little effects that will get under the skin even of the most experienced terror fanatics. He does not trust the stabbing of the soundtrack for his "gotcha" moments. Even if you've seen everything, there are still some things in this movie that will make you dumbfounded. <br /> <br /> What could have been better about it: the acting was, at times, flat and unconvincing. It had a quality of "video filming" in some places (although, for the most part, it achieved the atmosphere it was looking for), and the work of the camera is full of useless approaches of meaningless actions. Although the effects are really creepy, I think they may have gone to the well too many times with some of them. The end seemed rushed, and he overlooked what could have been more shocking moments. The viewer must discover many things for themselves, not as a challenge on the part of the filmmakers, but because they simply missed it. <br /> <br /> However, a good indie horror movie that is easily several steps away. above the average. Well worth the rent.
