['This movie (like Astaire&#39;s ROYAL WEDDING, which was shown after its presentation on Turner Classic Network last night) is famous for a unique musical sequence that has earned a place on Gene Kelly&#39;s album: as Fred Astaire dancing with a rack and then dancing around a On the walls and ceiling of the room, this movie had Gene Kelly dancing in a cartoon sequence with Jerry Mouse. The sequence is very well done. What is forgotten is that Kelly is telling the story behind the cartoon sequence to Dean Stockwell and his fellow students at the school during a break of the day, and sets the stage for the sequence by having Stockwell and the others close the eyes and imagine a type of pastoral fund. Kelly even changes the navy blue he actually wears in a navy blue &quot;Pomeranian&quot; uniform with blue stripes on it. Jerry Mouse does more than dance with Gene. Actually speaking, a first time it did not repeat for many decades. Finally, it also puts Tom Cat in his proper place: Tom appears briefly as King Jerry&#39;s butler, trying to cheer him up with a cheese platter. <br /><br /> But the sequence of the cartoons with Kelly took about seven minutes of the movie. Much more of this peculiar film is related to the story of Kelly&#39;s four days of absence lost in Hollywood, and how Kelly ends up knowing Katherine Grayson and (with Frank Sinatra) harassing José Iturbi in the MGM movie studio, the Hollywood Bowl, and own house. Except that the two sailors do not want to cause damage, this movie could have been quite disturbing. <br /><br /> Kelly has saved Sinatra&#39;s life in the Pacific and, as a result, gets a medal. Both are among the crew members in California who are receiving a four-day license. But the writers (to promote what would be a short film, Kelly plans to spend four days having sex with a &quot;Lola&quot;, a girl who does not look good in Hollywood) saddles Gene with Frank. <br /><br /> It seems that Frank is one of those idiots who appear film after film of film factories (especially musical comedies) that are socially underdeveloped and that need &quot;instruction&quot; on how to meet girls (or guys if the characters are women). Frank insists that Gene help him &quot;teach&quot; him how to get a girl. At that point, a police officer takes them to the headquarters to help the policemen with a small child (Stockwell) who insists on joining the army (and will not give the cops their real name and address). When a protest, Kelly can get this information from Stockwell by asking some direct questions (which the police could not do), insist that Kelly take the child home with his aunt (Grayson). Still protesting, Kelly is beset by increasingly complicated problems (mostly due to the simplistic view of Sinatra&#39;s stuff). Strange to see Lola the next day when sleeping late. Sinatra felt that he looked so calm sleeping that he did not wake him up. He is still dragged back to Grayson&#39;s house, since Sinatra feels that she is the right woman for himself, but needs Kelly to train him to make love. <br /><br /> I guess my presentation of the plot may annoy ANCHORS AWEIGH fans, but this kind of story is irritating to me. While the singing and dancing and concert music of Kelly, Sinatra, Grayson and Iturbi are first class, it&#39;s annoying to have to take seriously the idiots of someone like Sinatra&#39;s character. In the real world, Kelly would have defeated him at first by following him at the beginning of the four days of leave. What right does he have to insist (as Sinatra does) that someone saving his life should help him learn? how to get out That kind of shit always ruins the total effects of a musical for me, unless the musical numbers are so superior that they make me forget this kind of nonsense. <br /><br /> The harassment of Iturbi is equally annoying. Kelly tries to make Grayson like Sinatra when he says that Sinatra can get him a meeting with José Iturbi to listen to his singing ability. For most of the rest of the image, Sinatra and Kelly try to do that, and they keep fighting (at one point, for no good reason, Grayson herself ruins Kelly&#39;s attempt to get an MGM interview with Iturbi). It is only by sheer luck (that Iturbi feels sorry for an embarrassed Grayson) that he gives an audition of his talent. <br /><br /> Kelly, by the way, ends with Grayson. Sinatra&#39;s conscience at not being able to help her see Iturbi embarrasses him for bothering her (but it does not attract Kelly, oddly enough) and, in the meantime, he accidentally trips over a waitress (Pamela Britton) from his native Brooklyn. And, of course, without the help of Kelly, Sinatra and Britton fall in love. Oh, &quot;consistency&quot;! Your name is not &quot;screen writing&quot; necessarily!']
