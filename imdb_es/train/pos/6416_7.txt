Men of Honor is starring Cuba Gooding Jr., as the real-life diver, Carl Brashear, who challenged a man's Navy to become the first African-American diver in the Navy. Sometimes, at his side and, sometimes, his adversary, there was a man Carl Brashear really admired. His name was Master Chief Billy Sunday (Robert DeNiro). On Sunday, in many ways, he pushed, aggravated and helped Carl become the man he wanted to be. <br /> <br /> I loved Cuba in this movie. His representation here is as liberating and powerful as Denzel Washington was in The Hurricane. Through each scene we can see his passion, motivation and obstinacy to achieve his dream. We can see the struggle within him when he embarks to make his father proud. I also loved how the director created and generated a lot of tension in some of the key diving scenes. Brashear's encounter with a submarine during a rescue mission is moving and brilliant. <br /> <br /> The only flaw I could see would have to be in the cast. The characters of Cuba and DeNiro are very complex and exciting to watch. Which makes you feel a little sad when you have to run into two-dimensional support characters. The evil lieutenant commander. Hanks, the wife of Sunday (Charlize Theron), the eccentric colonel of the diving school (Hal Holbrook) and the love interest of Cuba are the characters that I discovered are not very deep. What could have made these characters more substantial and effective was a little more time to develop them. Why was that Colonel always in his tower? How is it that Sunday's wife was so bitter and always drunk? <br /> <br /> Another curious question has to be this one. What happened to Carl Brashear's wedding? I mean, if this movie is a chronicle of this man's life, would not his wedding be an important event? Maybe it's just me. However, Men of Honor are a perfect example of the triumph and faith that the human spirit surrounds. This film will inspire you and make you feel about this man's struggle. Which I think was the reason why this powerful story was told. I take my hat off to you Carl Brashear. I really admire your strength. <br /> <br />
