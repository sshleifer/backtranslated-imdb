Personally I have seen many Disney movies in my life, although none of them exactly matches Bedknobs and Broomsticks. Although I personally would not have crossed the action live with the animation, it was an improvement in trying to dress up people as animated characters. The film faces three evacuees of the Second World War who are sent to stay with a silent and socially uncomfortable woman in the country. I should say that the casting was brilliant. Angela Landsbury made a perfect Miss Price, while David Thomilson made a great interest for the love of desperate artists. The endings always surprise me and this was no exception. It was neither happy nor sad, although I do not know if this was intentional. The dialogue was not great, but considering that it was designed to be a children's movie, that's fine. In general, it would give the performance nine out of ten, the dialogue six out of ten, the casting nine out of ten and the outfits eight out of ten.
