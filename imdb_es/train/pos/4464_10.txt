Incredibly, no one in the artistic world could make you think. It seems perfect. The biggest and the best musical that has ever been made. Listen to the beautiful songs that are quite poetry. I am Italian and I am composed of American MUSICAL. Why can not you do something like that now? The Americans were the best and that's why I show you absolutely my devotion to this movie. There are words to describe the perfection of this movie. Suddenly my heart sings, what does the sunset do? I fall in love easily, jealousy ... and the scene with Tom and Jerry. The biggest without reservations. If you do not know that your eyes are not open, friends, you must see and appreciate it ... wake up!
