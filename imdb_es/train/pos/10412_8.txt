['The thief of Baghdad is a treasure. First of all, it&#39;s a good story. Although the main exhibition of my four children to this story, the most famous of the Arab Nights stories, comes from the Disney Corporation, the Baghdad thief kept his interest until the end. The story progresses at a good pace and includes a twist or two that reduces predictability. Sabu, who plays the young thief, Abu, is also equal to any of today&#39;s teenage actors on appeal, judging by the number of times I heard my oldest daughter say, &quot;It&#39;s cute!&quot; <br /><br /> In 1940, the film won Oscar awards for cinematography and special effects. Today, of course, those effects seem very outdated (&quot;Look, it&#39;s Barbie flying through the air,&quot; my daughter declared when she saw the genie fly). However, they fit well in the story. The film has, after all, more than 60 years. The effects fit with the script. In addition, what is seen in The Thief of Baghdad remained fairly modern for the next twenty-five years. You only need to compare the initial montage of a 1967 Star Trek episode to see this. In that, it was quite an achievement. <br /><br /> This qualifies as a family movie, although there are some stabbings near the end. The acting is so obvious and the wounds as bloody as those scenes almost as artificial as animation. <br /><br /> In short, a fun movie that is worth seeing, whether for a night of pure entertainment or for the historical value of the effects. I recommend it.']
