About two hundred members of a film society in Cleveland, Ohio, USA. UU., Call Cinematheque, met on August 19, 2000 to see a pristine film print of Michelangelo Antonioni's 1970 film, "Zabriskie Point." John Ewing, Director of the Cinematheque, who does an excellent job to get the best prints for his series, shared with the audience in advance that this impression was especially flown from Italy for this unique show. <br /> <br /> The audience was captivated as the film developed on the huge widescreen. Seeing this magnificent impression, shown in the way that Antonioni intended, he became aware that it is a work of modern art. It was even more fitting that the series is at the Cleveland Art Institute at University Circle. <br /> <br /> Antonioni's compositions are created for the Cinemascope landscape. Its beautiful balance of images, the surprising use of colors, the choreographic sweeping movements, everything is the work of a genuine artist, using the screen as his canvas. <br /> <br /> At last the audience could understand "Zabriskie Point". As his narrative developed, it became clear that this work is not about a story in itself, but rather about an artist's impressionistic representation of fleeting images of his subject. The setting of some of the most turbulent activities of the sixties provides only a dramatic engine for the broad collage of the artist. <br /> <br /> Antonioni is not bound by conventional narrative standards, and can stop at any time to creatively embroider an event with grandiose embellishments. The public was willing to flow with their incredible imagination, as their huge images on the huge canvas kept one in full attention. While the audience may have been involved only tangentially in the relationships of the characters, he realized that the theme here is human attention, the recurring theme of the director. <br /> <br /> He also realized that no smaller print or lower quality than this original in Cinemascope can do justice to this particular render. The audience, therefore, was even more grateful to see "Zabriskie Point" in its original and impressive format, and broke into thunderous applause at the end.
