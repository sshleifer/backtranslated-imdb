A very funny movie that presents characters that do bad things and let emotions like anger and the desire for revenge overflow. The cast is very good, there's a lot of action, and Stewart gets the girl and her revenge (with a twist) at the end. I've seen this movie several times and I always see it when it's on AMC or cable. Highly recommended ...
