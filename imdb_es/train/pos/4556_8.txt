I saw this movie with joy. <br /> <br /> This is possibly one of the best movies of all time. It has a timeless value, you can get so much out of it, it's amazing. There are parts that are touching, fun and just great. <br /> <br /> All aspects are successful, the representation of the story is perfect, every detail is 100% genuine, even small Irish subtleties have been covered. <br /> <br /> The use of low and high shots gives you two excellent views of Cristy (pay attention to that). <br /> <br /> The performance of Daniel Day-Lewis is incredible. I've never seen an actor do that, ever. It really is amazing. <br /> <br /> And it's so good to see, that it flows very well, it's probably the closest thing to the real life experience. I love. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen it, you should see it. Do not doubt it, there is something for everyone.
