['&quot;Pet Sematary&quot; is successful in two main situations. First, it&#39;s a scary horror movie. Those that simply do not occur these days. Secondly, it is an emotional, intelligent film in general. So if you&#39;re looking for chills, chills, chills and visually stunning settings, good acting, dialongos and horrifying effects; This is the movie you&#39;re looking for. A classic now and really a must for any Horror fan. <br /><br /> Probably the best adaptation to any of King&#39;s novels. The events feel a bit hasty compared to the novel, but that does not mean that this underestimated film is not a complete achievement of Horror / Drama. <br /><br /> Stephen King&#39;s novel is widely known to be very emotional and frightening at the same time. The film captures the same feeling mainly because there is a great development of characters and you can feel the love relationship between its members. Then, when everything seems to be happy (technically happy, because the title &quot;Pet Sematary&quot; does not offer appeal), a tragic event changes the atmosphere of the film, now it becomes very dark. The film has a sinister feeling from the initial credits, but after they kill Gage, the film becomes sad, gray and spooky. Dealing with the loss of a child is something that can ruin a family&#39;s life, and &quot;Pet Sematary&quot; demonstrates it dramatically. <br /><br /> The legend behind the Semataria mascot is more than a myth that nobody wants to experience, but sadness and despair lead an emotionally destroyed father to give him a chance. Unfortunately, the legend comes true and baby Gage returns from the dead. The previous encounter with the legend of the domestic pet turned out to be a tragedy, but this time it is much, much worse. What will happen to the lives of our All American family? Could Pascow avoid this tragedy? What about surreal nightmares? <br /><br /> Watch &quot;Pet Sematary&quot; to see one of the most moving and emotional horror films of recent times. You will not regret. The acting is very good, although I did not like the actor who played the father. He did not seem disturbed enough when situations demanded despair. But that&#39;s just my opinion. Denise Crosby really did a great performance and worked perfectly as the noble and tender mother. Baby Gage was amazing even in its spooky parts. *Shaking chills*. In general, this is a great classic of all times and a disturbing movie that moves the deepest fears of people ... the loss of someone you love, the dead that come back to life and a feeling of despair. <br /><br /> Something is certain ... I do not want to be buried, in a pet registry!']
