I really liked that movie! I am partial to see that I am a big fan of Disney, but I really enjoyed it. The action starts running at the beginning of the movie and continues! This is a bit of a game for Disney, they do not spend so much time developing the character (my husband pointed it out) and there are no musical numbers. It is strictly an action adventure. I enjoyed it a lot and I recommend it to anyone who loves Disney, whether they are young or old.
