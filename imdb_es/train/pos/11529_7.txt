As a biopic, "The Lady With Red Hair" (the story of how director / producer / playwright David Belasco transformed the famous divorcee of Mrs. Leslie Carter into an international theater star) is certainly not allied with the other biographical film of Warner. similar crop, "Yankee Doodle Dandy" (what is it?), but "Lady" is a nice movie in its own right, and shares some traits in common with the Cagney classic. <br /> <br /> Like "Yankee Doodle Dandy", "The Lady With Red Hair" is filled with an old flavor of show. (Among other things, both films present delicious theatrical sequences of approach, as well as the inevitable scenes in the backstage and in the offices of the theatrical managers). In addition, in "Lady" as in the biographical film of Cohan, the cast of support is composed of relatives and the actors of beloved characters of the time, all doing the kind of first class work for which we remember them. <br /> <br /> Should I add that, once again, as "Yankee Doodle Dandy", "The Lady With Red Hair" does not allow the truth to interfere in telling a good story? But, also as "Dandy", "Lady" manages, gloriously! - to convey the essence of the personality larger than the life of his giant show hero. Everyone knows that Cagney limited Cohan throughout his time in his brilliant and affectionate performance in "Yankee Doodle Dandy", but few viewers realize that Claude Rains did a similar service for David Belasco in "The Lady With Red Hair. " - And he did. with a style that almost equals that of Cagney. <br /> <br /> Rains-as-Belasco captures perfectly the galvanic personality of that legendary showman in all its splendor. Rains offers an extremely pleasant performance, extraordinarily observed and remarkably real as the man that all Broadway once called "The Wizard". See Claude Rains in action (see each shot as if he's having a good time!) In "The Lady With Red Hair" is watching David Belasco jump to life in the movie as if he could not wait to change things. on the main stem once more. <br /> <br />
