I've lost count of how many times I've seen this movie, I probably know all the dialogue upside down, but I'm attracted to it over and over again. <br /> <br /> In Hungary, a young Jimmy Stewart plays. the eligible bachelor "Kralik" who becomes the secret admirer of the innocent "Klara" of Margaret Sullavan. Kralik secretly becomes Klara's pen friend, and in his work, Klara entrusts Kralik with the contents of his letters (Kralik's). Clearly, Kralik is in love with Klara, but is unable to make his feelings known while competing with the "friend of the pen". Confused? Well, you will not be. This story has a sweet and almost sweet ending, but we all know that it is the end that we all want. <br /> <br /> Other characters that are worth mentioning are Frank Morgan who plays his usual role, this time as The owner of the store "Hugo Matuschek", Felix Bressart as "Pirovitch", the confidant of Kralik. Joseph Schildkraut as the arrogant womanizer "Vadas", so well played that you can not help but hate him from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Finally, William Tracy, who manages to fall in love with us with his trusted upstart. from a junior store "Pepi Katona". <br /> <br /> Recently rebuilt as "You Have Got Mail," starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, it's not as good as the original, although I suspect younger audiences would not agree. <br /> <br /> If this movie is on in your area during Christmas, I suggest you pour yourself a good glass of wine, put a log on the fire and have a box of Kleenex on hand.
