I acquired this, one of my favorite movies of all time on DVD recently and, as usual, during the visualization, everything left me speechless. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of Hazel O'Connor and the soundtrack of this movie makes me cry, especially the song "Will You". It is a journey of pure nostalgia for my return to my youth. This is in second place better than Quadrophenia (which was also starring Phil Daniels). <br /> <br /> A great soundtrack and a great view of Britain in the Thatcherite years of the gloomy 80s in which I grew up. The ending is very sad, for hours after the end of the movie I am like a crybaby baby. <br /> <br /> I hope to wear this DVD to see it repeatedly, I can watch it again and again and never get bored, just for the soundtrack alone. <br /> <br /> Hazel, I'm sorry to hear about your beloved dad. God bless you all. xx
