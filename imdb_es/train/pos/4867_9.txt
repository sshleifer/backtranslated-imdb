Ignore the plot and enjoy Fred Astaire doing A foggy day and several other dances, a duo with a hapless Joan Fontaine. Here we see Astaire doing what are essentially "scenic" dances in a purer form than in his films with Ginger Rogers, and before he learned to make the most of the potential of cinema. Best of all: the fact that we see Burns and Allen before their radio / TV comedy career husband-wife, doing the kind of dance they should have done in vaudeville and did not have the opportunity to do it in their movies University of Paramount of the 30s. (George was once a tap tap instructor). His two numbers with Fred are important points of the film, and it's worth waiting for them. The first trio of soft shoes is a warm up for the stimulating number of carnival "Chin up", in which the three sing and dance through the games and other attractions. It almost seems spontaneous. The fan of Fred Astaire and Burns & Allen will find it worth bearing under the "plot". I have seen this 4 or 5 times, and I find the fast forward button useful.
