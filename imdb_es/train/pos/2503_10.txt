I am extremely demanding with the movies that I see. I had heard about Moon Child completely by accident. I have been a fan of L'Arc En Ciel for some time and recently I was a fan of Gackt and Mizer. <br /> <br /> I finally discovered that the movie was being reissued and I picked it up without a second thought. <br /> <br /> Being as critical as I am about movies, I admit, action scenes can be somewhat clumsy at times ... but they are meant to be, as suggested by another user, is the calm par excellence before the storm, citing Gary Oldman de Leon ... without getting into the spoilers, the film hit me a lot, because you realize that the limits of friendship are unlimited and, as they say, the true friendship is loyalty and I like marriage, it is until death separates them. <br /> <br /> Hyde and Gackt give presentations that show why they are able to commit so much depth to the lyrics of their songs, their passion for music goes to the big screen and in the process. create an exemplary film that will reach your soul and provoke an emotional response. <br /> <br /> When watching the movie for the first time, I realized that it will probably stay in a large rotation in regards to my collection. I want to encourage anyone who reads this post to return to the movie if he wants to get away from the current Hollywood trend in the film ... this takes a completely new direction using the classic elements of the Yakuza movie and how it can go wrong with a cameo of Ryo Ishibashi of fame "Audition" and "Suicide Club" by Takashi Miike? <br /> <br /> Man ... I can not say enough about this movie, but I'll stop here. <br /> <br /> 10/10
