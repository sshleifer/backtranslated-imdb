['The film had many fundamental values of family and love. He expressed human emotions and it was an inspiring story. The script was clear (it was very easy to understand, which made it perfect for children) and, at times, it was fun and fun. There were some symbols loaded to search. The cinematography was acceptable. There was no sense of experimentation that many filmmakers were doing today (which, frankly, is receiving a bit of warning). It was filmed clearly but it had a good soft quality. Although the editing could have been done better, I thought it was a good movie to enjoy as a family. And the organization of the information was launched against you, something that I did not like either, but in general it was a good movie.']
