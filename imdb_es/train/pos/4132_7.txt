A comedy that worked surprisingly well was the small British effort "The Divorce Of Lady X (1938)". Mark the first couple of Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon, before that little film about the uncontrollable passion in the English wastelands of the nineteenth century. And while Olivier and Oberon are not particularly suited to the inflated comedy, everything flows very well. Oberon is Leslie, a young woman who ends up in the hotel suite of lawyer Logan (Olivier) of divorce by an unpleasant English fog that prevents travel. She does everything possible to irritate him, but, in the crazy way in which films are unrolled, he falls in love with her. And she falls in love with him. But Olivier believes it is a serious case of mistaken identity when Oberon's "Lady X" (that's all that leaves Oliver in a note) as a married woman. To make things worse and more fun, Lord Mere (Ralph Richardson) goes to Olivier to ask for a divorce from his wife, whom dear Larry believes Oberon must be. There is a good dialogue about the battle of the sexes and a fun exploration of sexual politics. You can see that Olivier is not too safe with comedy, but in reality Olivier is an accomplished professional, and he complies. And he handles the twists and turns of the screwball, maybe not easily, but with gusto. Oberon was not a great actress as an actress, but she was generally competent enough and, despite her well-known off-screen dislike, worked well with Olivier. This was filmed at the beginning of Technicolor, which today looks very primitive (everyone seems even whiter than Michael Jackson), but maybe the print should be cleaned.
