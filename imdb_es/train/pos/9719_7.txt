When I entered this movie, I had heard good things about it. Coming out of this, I was not really surprised or disappointed. Simon Pegg plays a character quite childish like his other films. There was a couple of laughs here and there, nothing very funny. Probably my favorite parts of the movie is when he dances at the club scene. I have to try it the next time I'm in a club. A couple of stars here and there, including: Megan Fox, Kirsten Dunst, that girl from X-Files and Jeff Bridges. I found it quite fun to see a cameo by Thandie Newton in one scene. She, of course, is in a previous movie with Simon Pegg, Run Fatboy Run. I see it as a launch, or you'll enjoy it to a certain extent or you'll find it a bit boring. I might add, Kirsten Dunst is adorable in this movie. : 3
