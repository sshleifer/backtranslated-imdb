Breaking Glass is a movie that all aspiring to be in the music industry should see more than once. It is a very dark story about the way a record company manipulates a singer to do things his way and make all the money possible with it. When I watch some of today's "star search" style television programs, both in the UK and abroad, I always remember this movie. Although they are not experts on the subject, the winners of these programs tend to have great initial success and then come down from there. This film predates these programs, although the effect seems the same. After getting rid of his manager, played quite brilliantly by Phil Daniels, the record company slowly changes, but his lyrics stimulate and finally burn. You potential future stars of tomorrow ... ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ C! YOU DO NOT HAVE TO KNOW !!!
