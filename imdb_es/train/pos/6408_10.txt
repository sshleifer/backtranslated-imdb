A Classic Hollywood Biopic is the best sense of the genre. Gooding and DeNiro provide spectacularly felt performances in the two leading roles, and the supporting cast is excellent, with notable performances by Carl Lumbly and Michael Rapoport. <br /> <br /> The only "mess" I could choose is that Theron's role was unnecessary and distracted (not his performance, which was fine, it's just that the movie seemed to add two unnecessary scenes to accommodate his role) . <br /> <br /> Apart from that, the characterizations, dynamics and actions of real life history are fascinating and unforgettable. The evolutions of the main characters and how their beings evolve are characterized by scenic artists. Despite the extreme length of the film, the rhythm remains intact throughout the entire process. The score is also excellent. <br /> <br /> Is this a predictable Hollywood movie? You bet So, Mike Leigh addicts should subtract one star, but everyone else should enjoy it tremendously.
