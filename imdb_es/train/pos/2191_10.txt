Shakespeare said that we are actors put on a big stage. But when this stage is Israel, the work that we interpret is multiplied by ten and all the actions we do are full of a difficult style. Dan Katzir manages to make a spectacular portrait of a part of life in Tel Aviv, but in addition, Katzir manages to penetrate the heart of the Israeli people and, these people, far from being simple prominent figures, speaks to us from the heart. . Katzir's film allows Israel to escape from the dark information points in which they live, and this wonderful country emerges in the light as a splendid bird that is born from its ashes. It is very good for me because the reality of the State of Israel, which Europeans only know from news bulletins or newspapers, appears as an intimate and absolutely human reality, the reality of millions of people seeking their place, exploring the whole. State, all culture with the sole purpose of feeling part of it. Katzir builds an absolutely marvelous documentary and shows that when a man films with passion, the deepest feelings are projected with force, and these feelings cross our hearts. Thank you, Dan, for opening our eyes and giving us one of the most beautiful portraits of the most wonderful countries in the world.
