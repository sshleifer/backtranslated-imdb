Genre: Dinosaur, animation, New York, time travel, circus.? <br /> <br /> Main characters: Rex the Tyrannosaurus rex, Elsa the pterodactyl, Dweeb the Parasarolophus, Ooo the Triceratops, a boy named Louis, a girl I called Cecilia and Captain New-eyes. ? Actors: John Goodman (Rex), Yeardley Smith (Cecilia), Martin Short (Stubbs the clown), Felicity Kendal (Elsa) etc.? <br /> <br /> What happens: four dinosaurs (see above) are fed some "Cereal grain of the brain" and now they are loving and friendly dinosaurs that are going to be kind to children. They go to New York, with big plans ?? <br /> <br /> My thoughts: this is a beautiful animated movie. The animation of the dinosaurs when they are tender and friendly is a little floppy and not so good, but anyway they look nice. I like dinosaurs when they are tender and kind, they are friendly, kind and good. I like (almost) all the characters presented, especially Elsa and Cecilia, but, of course, I also like others. In general, I really like this movie! :-) <br /> <br /> Recommended for: people who like good animated movies for children, people who like dinosaurs, John Goodman and people who think circuses are not always what they seem. Enjoy! :-)
