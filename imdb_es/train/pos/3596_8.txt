I finally sat down and saw this movie all the way, and I must say it impressed me a lot. Michelle Rodriguez is probably one of my new favorite actresses; not only is it the fact that she * can * act, but she chooses the roles that best suit her, which are more significant and important than at first glance would seem. I have read some comments that express their relief that this was not a feminist thing as horrible as they thought before, but I certainly do not agree. Diana is a feminist. She follows her dreams and believes in herself against what practically everyone around her thinks (with the exception of her caring brother Tiny and her coach and manager, Hector, who happens to be more a father figure than his real father) , which is what the word "feminism" is about. It is good to see films like this that show the true side of feminism, that they are not a group of losers of mania, but that they have dreams and can do anything. Diana is true to herself while remaining prey to love, and she and Adrian have a more realistic and complicated relationship instead of something that magically works. Girlfight is a true taste of reality and puts some faith in my perception of people. Thanks, Michelle. <br /> <br /> 8/10 - A very important film that is not only related to young women, but to all the people who want to go far in their lives.
