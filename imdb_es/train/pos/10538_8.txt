I work in a movie store and, as such, I am always looking for an excellent movie. I decided to review Nothing as it was in our Canadian section, and I have been trying to support the film industry in my country. I was expecting a surprise. The film features David Hewlett and Andrew Miller in a very entertaining story that seems to deepen much of our minds and relationships ... without working so hard. It is consistently comical through the interaction of the two characters, as well as some fun exchanges ("We can not be dead, we have cable!"). What else can I say without taking into account that it is worth trying, even if you leave it in the first half hour?
