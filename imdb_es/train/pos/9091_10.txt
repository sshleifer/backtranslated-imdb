A fabulous movie With everything you could want in a movie. Huge battle scenes and lots of other action. The suspense, and a romantic love story. <br /> <br /> Something like an old swashbuckler movie. Totally entertaining from start to finish. <br /> <br /> The editing was fast and you will never get bored for a second. History is like a classic history of problems in the Royal House. The actors are beautiful and the sets magnificent. The costumes are spectacular and the trick work is imaginative. The special effects are also amazing. <br /> <br /> Gary Stretch is really impressive as an actor and great to see. It seems like a safe bet for Super Stardom. <br /> <br /> John Rhys-Davies is wonderful as he usually is. He is one of the best actors of our time. <br /> <br /> And Cindy Burbridge, Ex Miss Thailand is excellent and perfect for the main lady, even making an English accent with remarkable success. <br /> <br /> I discovered that the movie has won numerous awards, and I can see why. <br /> <br /> Together, this is an incredible independent film. See it safely. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it. And give it a TEN + !!!
