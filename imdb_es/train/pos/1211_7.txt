I grew up in this movie and I remember when my brother and I played in the garden and pretended we were in Care-a-lot. Now, after so many years, I can watch the movie with my daughter and watch her enjoy it. If you are a father and you have not seen this movie with your children, then you should do it, so hold them in your arms and watch them get excited with the bears that care and care a lot! The songs, especially "Forever Young" are very sweet and memorable. Parents, I recommend this movie to all children so they can learn how nice it can be to care for others. When it comes to all the junk on TV, you can educate your children so that they have the right mindset about life with movies like these.
