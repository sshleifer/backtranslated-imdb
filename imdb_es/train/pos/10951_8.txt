Big S is not playing with taboos or forcing an agenda like, say Mencia or Chapelle (although I like both). She affirms the obvious in subtle, almost subliminal comments. His show will not change the world, nor is it. But, along with the hilarious Brian Posehn and Paget Brewster's ex-boyfriend Jay Johnston of "Mr. Show," this is a mean show with an appetite for destruction! My side was completely destroyed by the first episode. Look, I love this woman and I like her famous boyfriend, Jimmy Kimmel, she just gives the lines and lets the viewer run with that. The best type of comedy that exists. Deceiving anyone and anyone, like "Mary Poppins" in the second episode, when he sings to fake birds to make quick comments about society and existential university nonsense. This is highly recommended, but only for those who still have a funny bone (and did not lose it in their last lippouction treatment or tits job).
