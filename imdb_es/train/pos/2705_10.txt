This is a script that Ed Wood worked for 10 years to try to do. Aris Iliopulos finally got the nerve to film a script that Wood kept from his burning home at the expense of other more transitory objects of value. <br /> <br /> This is a film without dialogue, which some can foolishly describe as silent. . In fact, it's a pretty noisy movie, without the inane talk of most movies. In the hands of these filmmakers, the music and sound effects provide a rich audio experience that works better than almost any grist from the Hollywood screenplay factory, particularly in the latest stupid movie in which Billy Zane participated ('Beware ! ',' Oh no! '- J. Cameron .... ick ...) I'll take the wonderfully communicative monosyllabic grunts of Zane in this film in an empty dialogue any day. <br /> <br /> Billy Zane leads a team of players who obviously really wanted to be in this movie. Ricci is radiant as always, and the gods shine when you can put the name of Sandra Bernhard, Rick (and) Schroeder, Eartha Kitt and Andrew McCarthy on the same poster. <br /> <br /> The design is perfect, the Exquisite Stage pyramid, and Ron Perlman's bestial performance is simply wonderful. In general, it is a chaotic and visceral masterpiece created with love by the fans of Ed Wood Jr., author and cinenephile. A must for all who really love the movies in the way that Iliopulos and their cast obviously do. A movie to make you wish you had made it yourself.
