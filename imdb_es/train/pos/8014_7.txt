But if you like muppets, I challenge you not to like this one. Basically, the same regurgitated plot (this time New York, not LA) presents many funny cameos and muppet hi-jinx. Many of the muppets leave the movie very soon, as it focuses on Kermy and Miss Piggy. I had a great time. Fun to watch with your children.
