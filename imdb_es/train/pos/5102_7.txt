I do not care about the soundtrack, which is already played. <br /> <br /> However, Debra Winger is always interesting and, although this was a previous role for her, she is quite good as Cissy, girl of evil. Next to the tracks, he lived in a trailer with Bud, (Travolta), only to be replaced for a while by the cunning Madolyn Smith as a rival. <br /> <br /> I agree with an earlier review about Scott Glenn, he is used only for the plot, thrown into the mix to create suspense; The story is predictable and artificial. <br /> <br /> Also, even though I am from the East, many of us did not like the "Saturday Night Fever", while it had its moments, the perpetual stereotypes are beyond criticism. in this point. <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing for Debra Winger; she is still so nice, and she never had that Hollywood personality to which we are subjected today by too many actresses. 7/10
