It's time to pay tribute to the great Charton Heston after his recent death, but this movie is not the right one. His other films of a past generation were BEN HUR, THE TEN COMMANDENTS, OMEGA MAN and PLANET OF THE APES were his best works. <br /> <br /> This film made in 1973 tries to prophesy a future land, in 2022. That is so overpopulated that the human race has been manipulated by the authorities to eat a food product produced universally called "Soylent Green" that is manufactures with human flesh. This strange and implausible movie was as ridiculous at the time of its release as it is now and assumes that the population of India that would be about 2 billion at that stage would be that of the meat eaters without knowing it. <br /> <br /> Charlton Heston This character surpasses the secret international conspiracy that the world powers have devised to satisfy the nutritional demands of overpopulation through the use of cannibalism. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately for the producers of this film, the Green message they convey is not the Green Party of today's spirit. Thank God. Cannibalism was practiced by the indigenous populations of New Zealand, Fiji and Borneo until only 40 years before this film was made, but human civilization abandoned it for a long time. <br /> <br /> Another stupid prediction of the film is that women become almost quasi-sexual slaves by rolling back the tide of radical feminism that grew in 1972 when this movie was made. <br /> <br /> The movie was stupid and it is so stupid now but it contains a very unmemorable last movie The performance of the late and great Edward G. Robinson, but still is not a valid reason to return to see the movie more than for academic reasons. <br /> <br /> This is a failure of a movie and I would not even recommend it. Baby boomers or Charlton Heston fans. All the other reviews of this film, which I have read, sound the same in a dystopian society in whose future the centralized theme seems to involve the United States in which an ecological disaster has occurred. <br /> <br /> The only merit in the film is that the Earth faces overpopulation.
