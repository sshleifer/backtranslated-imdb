This is definitely one of the best stand-up evre shows. FOREVER. Eddie is so far from the wall that I've been watching this damn show for almost five years, and he still moves all the time. Simply everything, from its great physical comedy to the comments of the top of the head, is a masterpiece. You do not need to look beyond this line "The word grass, you say erb, and we say grass, because there is a ### ing h in it." Sparkly.
