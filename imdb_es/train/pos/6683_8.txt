['Forget about the depth of meaning, leave your logic at the door and have fun with this &quot;cartoon&quot; action live ultra camping, maniacally fun, totally absurd and ultra camper. MYSTERY MEN is a shipment of all the superhero movies you&#39;ve seen, but their super aspirants are so interesting, varied and well-formed that they are memorable characters in their own right. The dark humor, the total stupidity, the authentic action and even a moving moment or two combine to make this comic fantasy about the friendly losers a true winner. The comedic talents of the actors who play Mystery Men, including a Mystery Woman, are a perfect complement to Wes Studi, since what can only be described as a gangster Yoda and Geoffrey Rush as one of the strangest. The villains on the wall (and strangely charming) to leave the pages of a Dark Horse comic and enter the big screen. Prepare to laugh, cheer and say &quot;huh?&quot; more than once .... enjoy!']
