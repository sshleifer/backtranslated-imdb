EARTH is a must for children and adults. My son had a lot of fun watching all these fun birds and ice bears. We can learn a lot from this movie and we should be proud of our great treasure on earth. There are some animals in danger of disappearing. Exactly that problem should prevent all the authorities of our planet. <br /> <br /> This documentary offers many exceptional photos that I have never seen before. Then it is well accompanied by a celestial music. The director did a great job here that gets great respect. Nothing can prevent my family and I from giving EARTH the highest rate. I hope so much that things create a sequel.
