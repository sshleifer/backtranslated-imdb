['What Irving Thalberg did in making this film today will never be attempted again. Make a Chinese story with Western players, even if they are of the caliber of Paul Muni, Luise Rainer, Charley Grapewin and Walter Connolly among others. <br /><br /> Maybe it&#39;s partly because the story was written by a Western, Pearl Buck, who received a Pulitzer Prize for his novel in 1932. Mrs. Buck, daughter of Chinese missionaries, probably brought China closer to the consciousness of the United States than any other person. Not the political struggles of China, but the lives and work of the people of every day that we find in The Good Earth. Unfortunately, later, Pearl Buck became an apologist for Chiang Kai-Shek&#39;s Chinese Kuomintang in all its virtues and excesses. The rest of his literary production never coincided with The Good Earth. <br /><br /> In The Sundowners there is a great description of the comparison of China with Australia by Peter Ustinov. When asked the difference, Ustinov said that China was very large and very crowded, and Australia was very large and very empty. That&#39;s what you see in The Good Earth, China, very big and very crowded, more than she can deal with at times. <br /><br /> The Good Earth tells the story of Wang Lung (Paul Muni) when he was a young man who buys a wife in a large house where she was a slave. The O-Lan woman (Luise Rainer) has two children and sees him through all the good and bad times she has, drought, hunger, revolution and a plague of climatic locusts. <br /><br /> Luise Rainer won the second of two consecutive Oscars for playing O-Lan. It is possible that he has established some kind of record in the sense that he has to be the player with the best Oscar performance with the least amount of dialogue. Everything he does is practically done with facial expressions, his performance could have been in a silent movie with minimal subtitles. I think that only John Mills in Ryan&#39;s daughter had less words and was playing a man with mental retardation. <br /><br /> Muni does not always appreciate his support in that culture dominated by men. Rainer helps in the field, takes and raises children, does housework. When Muni becomes a property man, he takes a second trophy from the Chinese wife that causes him much pain. Still Rainer stoically carries it all. Still, Muni is not a bad man and is a tribute to the film and his performance and Buck&#39;s writings that you do not hate him and that the cultural divide closes. <br /><br /> Now we have a group of oriental players who do more than just Kung Fu movies. I&#39;m surprised that the good land of all the films has not been remade at this time. I bet the Chinese government will even allow some US company to do it in a real location. <br /><br /> Until then we have this great classic to appreciate and enjoy.']
