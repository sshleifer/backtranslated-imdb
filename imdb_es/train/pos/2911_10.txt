This is one of the best music concerts that anyone will see and hear. I grew up when All My Lovin 'was brand new and hearing it again today by the original artist of today is a measure of the power of Sir P Mc to charm any audience of any age. This doco goes behind the scenes to show us life on the road, not only for the band, but for the whole world up to the roadies. I saw this guy live at Aussie 1975 and I can assure you that his performance here on this DVD is not less than he did almost 30 years ago. I have a huge 5.1 surround sound system that does it justice and I would recommend it to anyone, especially a Beatles fan. This is the closest you'll come to a Beatles concert today. Singer, composer, solo / rhythmic / bass guitar, piano, ukulele, pure genius. There are few artists who can be alone with a single instrument and keep the crowd in their hand. If you want to listen to perfect music, buy a CD recorded in the studio. If you want to listen to raw music as it is intended and spontaneous for the crowd, with all the emotion and emotion of the crowd, this DVD is for you.
