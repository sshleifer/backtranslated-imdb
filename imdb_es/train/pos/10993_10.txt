This movie is a gem because it moves with a soft but firm resolution. <br /> <br /> I warn viewers that although it is considered a corporate spy thriller and that Ms. Liu is there, it moves to a skillful but silky level. He passed. It is NOT about explosions, car chases or flying bullets. You must be patient and instead, consider the details here. It's quiet because that's the main character. The viewer has to LOOK at it and think as this story unfolds. <br /> <br /> I will not give you spoilers, because that destroys the point of observation. The plot is what you've read in the other publications: an average white-collar man, in search of change and adventure, registers for a corporate espionage job. Simply go somewhere and secretly record and transmit internal data. <br /> <br /> Take it from there. <br /> <br /> This film begins in a surrealist walk, with a backdrop of corporate disillusionment that is intertwined with the underlying suburban paranoia par excellence. <br /> <br /> Then it starts to accelerate. <br /> <br /> The acting in all the parts is excellent, and yes, some of the acts are cartoon characters. But all fit, and entertain. And the rhyme of the light piano in the background is simply perfect as the sinister theme soft and smooth: Everything is not right at the beginning. <br /> <br /> And in the end: Everything is not what it seems. <Br /> <br /> Get comfortable and turn off the lights to see this ... and increase the sound: this movie wants you to LISTEN.
