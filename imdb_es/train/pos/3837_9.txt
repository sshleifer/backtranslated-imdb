In the 1940s, when the movies touched on subjects that were not yet admissible in the "educated" society, they resorted to codes that supposedly floated on the head of the majority of the audience while alerting those who knew what was happening. Probably no film of the decade was as loaded with innuendo as the strangely dark Desert Fury, set in a small oasis of play called Chuckawalla somewhere in the desert of California. The owner of the Purple Sage lounge and casino is the amazing Mary Astor, with pants and a cigarette holder; In the city he leads his handful of daughters, Lizabeth Scott, looking, in technicolor, 20 million dollars. But listen to the dialogue between them, which suggests that an older lesbian and her young and restless partner (one can only wonder if the original script by A.I. Bezzerides made this relationship explicit). Even more flagrant are John Hodiak as a gangster and Wendell Corey as his incredibly jealous torpedo. Add Burt Lancaster as the sheriff of the city, stir and sit down. Both Lancaster and (surprisingly) Hodiak fall in love with Scott. However, it seems that Hodiak not only has a past with Astor, but also had a wife who died in suspicious circumstances. The desert sun heats these ingredients to a boiling point, with staves and empurados exchanges. Do not miss this greenhouse melodrama, full of exotic and spooky flowers, if it is presented to you; It is an extraordinary movie.
