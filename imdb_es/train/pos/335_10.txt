I've been trying to discover this series for years! Thanks, IMDb! I saw this as a child and I have never been able to get it out of my mind. From the age of 6, of course, I was especially surprised by the cyclops episode, which was absolutely chilling (I mentioned it so much that my older brother made me a cyclops with a figurine of a plastic caveman, which I still have). What I also remember, however, was the atmosphere, which was unusual from the start: mysterious, austere and extremely authentic. Many years later, when I read the original, I experienced that same feeling. It is very difficult to capture, and probably impossible in Hollywood. Every 'Odyssey' that I have seen since then has been a huge disappointment. The characters in this series seemed authentic, real people, ancient Greeks, and not some Hollywood stars in disguise. This is a true masterpiece! But why is it not better known? And why is it not available on VHS or DVD? I would love to have the opportunity to see this again!
