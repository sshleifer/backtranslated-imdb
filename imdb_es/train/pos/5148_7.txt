I do not know what happens with these movies. But movies about history or religion are always criticized for their accuracy. Of course it is not 100% accurate. It is difficult to make 100% accurate movies today when even the "experts" do not agree with each other. Therefore, I like to judge a film more by what it is trying to say instead of detecting all the inaccuracies. <br /> <br /> So I start by saying that I liked this mini series. But I do agree with the criticism that his childhood years passed too quickly. The series should have been a three-part story, with the first part being his childhood. But if they did not have more money to shoot more stories, who am I to criticize that? <br /> <br /> There is only one real problem that I have with this movie and that is the fact that it is told in a story. book form Especially the second part, which is only a sum of the events that happened. I would have liked to see Hitler more human (more scenes in which he doubts himself, etc.). Noah Taylor did that more in the movie 'Max', which seems to work better, I think. However I am glad that this has been done and I have it on DVD. Just to remember more clearly what happened and see Carlyle give the best of himself. 7.5 / 10
