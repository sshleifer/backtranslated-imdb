The Three Stooges has always been one of the many actors I have loved. I love almost all the shorts that they have made. I love the six Stooges (Curly, Shemp, Moe, Larry, Joe and Curly Joe)! All the shorts are fun and also star many other great actors and actresses that many of them were in many of the shorts! In my opinion, The Three Stooges is one of the best actors in history and is the funniest comedy team of all time! <br /> <br /> This is a good Three Stooges short. It's fun and its cast includes Christine McIntyre, Symona Boniface, Gino Corrado, Fred Kelsey, Sam Flint, Chester Conklin, Theodore Lorch, Lynton Brent, Judy Malcolm, Vernon Dent, John Tyrrell, Heinie Conklin and Bess Flowers. The Stooges performed very well in this short film! I recommend this one!
