['A great movie, rather challenging than really entertaining. Unfortunately, there are no memorable quotes here, but this is my favorite: Alexandre: if you leave someone you&#39;ve loved, you have to say what I&#39;m saying now: &quot;Goodbye, I&#39;m leaving.&quot; But disappearing, hiding like a criminal, is ignoble. (I did not see it with English subtitles) <br /><br /> In my opinion, this expresses everything. There are so many tactics involved in the relations between Alexandre and the others, and yet, everyone craves a little more truth. However, knowing the truth can hurt even more, as Alexandre experiences it. The common interpretation is that the film criticizes the mere possibility of &quot;liberated love&quot; when describing the unwanted implications in the people involved. In fact, it shows this convincingly, but I would appreciate that the reasons are treated a little more in depth: it is not that liberated love is in itself doomed to failure, but people (especially men, I think) should work on themselves. and try to overcome the dominant morality before and not through the practice of liberated love. <br /><br /> That said, the movie is realistic and really worth seeing.']
