Well, this is a movie by Ivan Reitman. With the rare exception, Ivan likes to entertain. His films are generally not "deep", but they are often entertaining enough. My Super Ex-Girlfriend surprised me because I laughed more than I thought. Uma Thurman is so great, and I love her performances. I also like Luke Wilson, and Rainn Wilson was direct. It has never been taken seriously, the film is exaggerated and, however, is not very unique, nor goes where no one has gone before ... although it is a good rental and probably a correct date movie, especially if you have a Headache and I do not want to force your brain. It's escapist fun and there's nothing wrong with that. When you take things away from "super-girl," you have a story about relationships, and relationships went wrong. It's a boy who knows a girl, the boy leaves the girl. And in the end, the characters seek love. Not all of them are taken as "bounced" as well as they could ... a piece of life with a twist.
