I enjoyed the cinematographic recreation of China in the 1930s in this beautiful film. The story is simple. An older male artist wants to transmit his art to a young man even if he does not have living children. The faces of the actors are wonderful to watch. The story reveals the devotion and gratitude of children towards those who treat them well and their desire to be treated well. The operas in the film remind me of FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE, which was more sophisticated and intricate. The story here reminds me of a Dickens story about the days when children were almost like a home. The plot is a little predictable and a bit too sentimental for me, but it's worth seeing for the heroism, humanity and history represented.
