In this 1943 film, Judy Garland is considered not ready for the great moment of the man who loves her, Van Heflin. This film was undoubtedly a big change for Mr. Heflin, especially after winning the Oscar the previous year in "Johnny Eager." <br /> <br /> It was not Spring Byington too old to be the widowed mother of 5 children, four of them seem to resemble their grandchildren? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The singing and dancing are wonderfully organized, but the way in which the flourishing romance between Heflin and Garland was enacted left much to be desired. It was a kind of Gigi in which a young girl is finally swept away by a charmer.
