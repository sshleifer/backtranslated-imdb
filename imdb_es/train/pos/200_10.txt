Updated from a previous comment. The great and underestimated Marion Davies shows her comedy in this late silent comedy (1928) that also shows the wonderful William Haines. Davies plays a Georgia hick who crashes in Hollywood with the help of Haines, a bit of a player in raw comedies. They appear together in cheap comedies until Marion is "discovered" and becomes a great dramatic star. <br /> <br /> A great lampoon about Hollywood and its pretensions. Davies and Haines are a wonderful team, and shots of guests like Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, John Gilbert, Elinor Glyn, Talmadge Norma, Mae Murray, Rod LaRocque, Leatrice Joy, Dorothy Sebastian, Estelle Taylor Louella Parsons , Renee Adoree, Aileen Pringle and Marion Davies (must see) are up to the task. A must for any movie buff or anyone interested in the still defamed Marion Davies! Dell Henderson plays the father. Polly Moran is a maid. It is said that Paul Ralli is the thinnest protagonist. <br /> <br /> SHOW PEOPLE used Gloria Swanson's career as her model (I think Mae Murray is closer). Davies and Swanson were friends. But the story of this film parallels the emergence of Swanson from the comedies Mack Sennett from a roll with Charlie Chaplin to STAR in the Cecil B. DeMille films of late adolescence and early 1920s. <br /> < br /> Davies and Haines were great MGM stars and friends It's strange that MGM has never joined them on a talkie. They are very good together! A sweet romance and a charming parody of Hollywood principles. Greta Garbo and Bebe Daniels are mentioned but they do not appear.
