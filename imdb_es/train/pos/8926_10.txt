I do not think anyone, other than Terrence Malick and perhaps Tran Anh Hung, makes movies on a purer level than Claire Denis. That said, I do not love it, his most recent film, as well as his 2001 masterpiece "Trouble Every Day" (although it's very close), which in itself is one of my favorite movies. It's only because the narrative here is possibly a bit elliptical for its own sake. Do not get me wrong, the fact that this movie just has a plot is really one of the best things about it, but I think Denis took it a degree beyond what is necessary and, therefore, the film flirts with incomprehensibility, and some key points of the plot should have been clarified in some way (like the main character going to South Korea to have a heart transplant done, instead of showing him there suddenly without any explanation of where he is or why he is there ). In addition, some of the other characters seemed unnecessary and as if they were just excuses for Denis to use the actors he likes once more (the character of Beatrice Dalle in particular is a bit annoying because she hopes it has some meaning). Even so, the film is incredibly absorbing and the cinematography is beyond the incredible. It is definitely a masterpiece in itself. At least as good as Denis' most acclaimed "Beau travail", if not better. Claire Denis has to be my favorite French director at this moment, even better than Leos Carax. I must also admit that the South Korean sequence really does "Lost in Translation" better than the movie itself (and, unlike some, I'm also a big fan of that movie).
