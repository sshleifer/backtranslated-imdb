For the record, I am not affiliated with the production in any way. <br /> <br /> Hidden Frontier is probably the movie of Star Trek fans with the most episodes produced to date. More than 7 seasons (this is the last) that have produced about 50 episodes. <br /> <br /> This is not a feat without almost any budget and all those who volunteer their time and energy are volunteers. <br /> <br /> By its own admission, the previous seasons do not have as good production qualities as the later ones, but as the effects advance, the work of the green screen and the performance improve. <br /> <br /> I found it difficult to "dip in" so I started from the beginning and looked all the way. HF benefits from the arcs of history as all the best science fiction movies and fits perfectly into the Star Trek universe in which it is set. The characters and "relatives" of the original series were incorporated into the stories and add much to the feeling of the stories, sometimes improving the characters on the original. <br /> <br /> The whole experience includes an excellent web site, blooper reels, a high membership forum that is frequented by many of the actors and production staff, and a weekly chat. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for high definition and high budget productions, it is probably not for you. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for continuous adventures in the Star Trek universe with stories that give Star Trek credit and make you think, this is the option.
