['John Thaw is an excellent actor. I must admit that I was impressed by his rank in the role of an old curled curmudgeon who reluctantly accepts an evacuee from the streets of London (World War II era). <br /><br /> That said, the movie is also excellent. A very moving story with a satisfying ending. Some of the characters are a bit underdeveloped (the school teacher in particular), but none of them is essential to the plot. Basically, the story is about the old man and the boy, and the movie needs little else.']
