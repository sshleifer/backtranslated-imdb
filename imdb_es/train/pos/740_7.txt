"Foxes" is a serious look at the consequences of growing too fast in the 1980s. And, unlike the teen sex comedies that overshadowed it (Porky's, Fast Times at Ridgement High), the film holds up well against the weather. <br /> <br /> Your teen angst theme is as relevant today as it was 25 years ago. and Jodie Foster and sk8er boi Scott Baio (do you remember?) direct an excellent and young cast that is worth seeing. <br /> <br /> The movie follows four girls from Southern California as they move through an uprooted sex and drug-free existence. Teens spend their days in and out of school and their nights at parties, concerts or on the street. They are rarely at home because instant gratification is far from a pill, a party or a child. <br /> <br /> But instead of condemning them, the film is sympathetic, and blames the absent and carefree adults for forcing the teenagers to grow up alone. And it is impossible to displease the charismatic cast. <br /> <br /> The opening of the movie? A long and loving pan - sets the tone for what follows. We see the girls asleep at dawn amidst the objects that define adolescent adolescence, from Twinkies to a photo of a young John Travola, while Donna Summer's "On the Radio" is noted below. <br /> <br /> From there, the film takes speed while the girls go to school and to life. Annie (Runaway rocker Cherie Currie) is the wild girl who lives for the next party or pill. Deirdre (Kandice Stroh) is the crazy queen of the drama. Madge (Marlilyn Stroh) is the shy girl on her head. And Foster has the plan. It's your job to keep this crew enough to finish high school and at the same time keep your mother hunted for divorced and desperate men (Sally Kellerman). <br /> <br /> It's an almost impossible job and Foster finally fails <br /> <br /> Despite his age, "Foxes" is still a pleasure to watch. The hair, the clothes and the references to the Olympic skater Dorothy Hamill have not damaged the film. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is simply stunning, with impressive filtered shots of the L.A. basin. at dawn, at dusk and at night. Giorgio Moroder adds a soundtrack from the 80s with artists such as Donna Summer and Janis Ian. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the biggest disappointment of the film is that the young stars around Foster were never unleashed like the characters in "St. Elmo's Fire" (1985) or "Empire Records" (1995). "Foxes" shows why they should have done it. But maybe like the song "1985" by Bowling for Soup, they just hit a wall.
