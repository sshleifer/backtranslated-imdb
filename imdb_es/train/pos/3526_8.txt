Phantom Lady (1944) Dir: Robert Siodmak <br /> <br /> Production: Universal Pictures <br /> <br /> Scott Henderson (Alan Curtis), after an unpleasant and divided fight with his wife, seeks to drown his sadness at the local trough. There, he spies on a woman in a similar emotional state and, looking for some kind of company, invites her to a show in a club so that they stop thinking about their problems. She agrees, but only on condition that their names are kept. Sure enough, when Scott gets home, he finds the police there, waiting to question him. His wife has been murdered. Where were you at 8 o'clock this evening, asks Inspector Burgess (Thomas Gomez)? But Scott has an alibi, right? Only he does not know the woman's name. And the bartender remembers Scott but not the woman. Neither the taxi driver. Not even the drummer (Elisha Cook Jr.) in the club. Even the club dancer, whom Scott clearly caught looking at the woman (both wore the same hat), will not recognize that there was someone with him. Something is happening, but whatever it is, Scott is unable to defend himself in a trial and is sentenced to death for the murder of his wife (according to the "weakest evidence" in the judicial history of Hollywood). It remains to his loyal secretary, 'Kansas' (Ella Raines), who was later joined by a friendly inspector Burgess, to discover the real killer before Scott is executed. <br /> <br /> Phantom Lady is based on themes that are repeated, almost compulsively, in Woolrich's work. For example, the schizophrenic antagonist is also seen in Black Angel and The Leopard Man. In addition, there is the character who becomes mentally upset by the death of a lover or spouse who is in Rendezvous in Black and The Bride Wore Black. It can make a spectator feel like he is stepping on a well-worn ground. But in the right hands, the febrile plots, the dialogue I feel, the narrative inconsistencies, everything is next to the point. Fortunately, Phantom Lady was being guided by healthy hands. <br /> <br /> This is the first noir of Siodmak. He would continue to distinguish himself as one of the most outstanding practitioners of the style (if not the most prominent) (The Killers, Criss Cross). Here he is fortuitously paired with cinematographer Woody Bredell (they would meet at the Christmas holidays and at The Killers). There is a great narration made in the camera. In a shot, the deterioration of a character's mental state is shown when sitting in front of a 3-way mirror, suggesting multiple personalities. The same character, who is an artist, has Van Gogh's self-portrait with his bandaged ear hanging on the wall of his apartment. But what Siodmak and Bredell are really doing in Phantom Lady is practically creating the look to noir. Launched very early in 1944, it's all here; the wet pavement, the bags of atmosphere and terror, the contrasting contrasting ones, the savagely expressionist versions of reality (when Kansas visits Scott in jail), the discordant axes of light, etc. It is an excellent image to look at. <br /> <br /> Franchot Tone aside, the cast, as well as the theme and relative inexperience of the director (and, presumably, the budget), suggests the ambitions of the movie "B". I thought Tone was a bit hammy. Alan Curtis (High Sierra) is not a big deal, and he's actually quite weak in some scenes. Ella Raines is mostly good (and quite beautiful). His 'sex scene' with Elisha Cook Jr. is so delirious that you have to see it to believe it. Another prominent scene is when Kansas pursues the bartender for questioning. It is a persecution scene, as she pursues him restlessly through the streets, with a stop at a subway station. There is a good real tension there. <br /> <br /> *** of 4
