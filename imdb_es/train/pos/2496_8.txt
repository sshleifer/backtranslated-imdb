No garbage, not even close to garbage. Is not it an original? that is the last thing that could be said about "2.4 children". Predicable? Certainly not! Although it was a somewhat unusual series for the BBC, it was hilarious, fun and witty. I especially liked Belinda Lang and John Pickard, which I think was done wonderfully. Gary Olsen was also very good, as were all the other cast members. I never knew why the conversation was canceled until I read here today about the death of Gary Olsen in A relatively young age. I wish they would do more comedies of this kind, much more of them (and show them here in Israel). Very high!
