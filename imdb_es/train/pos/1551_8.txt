It seems more than strange that a combination as absolute as "Dukes of Hazzard" and "The Hills Have Eyes" (the new version) can find distributors of DVDs while the old, and very superior works like this film, are not found in Nowhere. With all the ongoing debate about the morality (or lack of it) of war, and the interest in espionage (consider the multiple productions of Jack Ryan, Bourne, XXX and "Mission: Impossible", this seems to be an obvious choice It's true, it looks like a 1968 movie because it's a 1968 film. But apart from the consideration of style, this is still a production that really has something valuable to say, and it has many twists in the frames To keep the audience entertained, if not something else, DO SOMEBODY please consider putting the soundtrack on some kind of CD, either in a compilation with other Morricone music or as a standalone version. people in the industry bother to read what our fans have to read tell about their products, but if you are reading this and other comments, please take us seriously.We are paying for your luxurious homes with the money we earn with so much effort on tickets, DVD and CD.
