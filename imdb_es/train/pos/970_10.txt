Now, I've seen a lot of movies in my day, but from each one there have been a few very select ones that have been very good for me. And I am a 19 year old man who is impressed by this film aimed at a younger audience. This is a very underestimated gem for those who watch foreign films. Almost all the acting is credible, the graphics are decent (so you will not even worry while you watch the movie, trust me, criticize the graphics would be stupid), the story is well written and is a movie that everyone can enjoy, not only children. <br /> <br /> This is basically what this movie did to me. One, it made me laugh ... a lot, two, it made me feel the characters as you're supposed to do, and three, it's a very uplifting story. At the end of this movie you will feel good. Sure, what in the anime has not presented to a small child who has become a great warrior and anything to defeat a great evil. It is a formula that is used a lot. But, in this case, it is forgivable because although they use puppets for some characters and some average graphics that you would see 5 years ago, you should not judge their appearance. It's very moving, the ending is original and it keeps you in the movie as you're supposed to. However, if you try to compare this with other films like "The Endless Story" or whatever, your opinion will be diverse. Look at it as it is and you will enjoy it. <br /> <br /> It's been a while since I was impressed like that. The only other movie I've had this feeling about is when I saw TMNT a long time ago when it came out. There is something about this movie that I felt about TMNT that really made me love it. So do not analyze too much or take this movie too seriously, just enjoy it.
