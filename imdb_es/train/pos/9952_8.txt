Before watching this movie, I thought that this movie would be great as Flashpoint because before watching this movie it was the last film by Jenna Jameson and Brad Armstrong that I saw before. As for the sexual scenes, I was disappointed, I thought that the sexual scenes of Dreamquest would be great like the sexual scenes of Flashpoint, but I was disappointed. Except for the Asia Carrera sex scene, any sexual scene in this movie does not make me feel very good (you know what I mean). The great Jenna Jameson does not do those kind of sexual scenes of which she is capable. Felecia and Stephanie Swift, those two lovely girls disappoint me as much as the sex scenes. <br /> <br /> Although it is a movie for adults, but if you do not take into account that factor of sexual scenes, this movie is very good. If typical adult film standards are concerned, this film definitely raised the standards of adult films. History, acting, direction, sets, makeup and other technical things of this film are really great. The actors in this movie made a very good performance, they all did a great job. Dreamquest definitely raised the quality level of adult movies.
