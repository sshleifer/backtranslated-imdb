There are few really fun movies about science fiction, but this one will leave you speechless. Jack Nicholson's first takeoff of the Martians is a lateral division. The plot has a very smart turn that has been seen to enjoy. This is a movie with heart and excellent performance of all. Make some popcorn and have a great night.
