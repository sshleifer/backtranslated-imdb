"L'Anglaise et le duc" by Erich Rohmer is a perfect piece for "The Commune (Paris 1871) by Peter Watkins". Both films, screened at the Toronto International Film Festival this year, illustrate in an ironic way how storytellers shape history. Ironic, given the tragic events that took place in the United States during the festival. <br /> <br /> Located in Paris during the French Revolution, the film, based on the "Memoirs" of Grace Elliott (Lucy Russell), is a first-hand account of how she survived those intoxicating but dangerous days. He also details his relationship with The Duke of Orleans (played by Jean-Claude Dreyfus), who, in contrast to herself, is in favor of the Revolution. <br /> <br /> It's true, you do not know which side of the story Rohmer is going to fall for. Rohmer, one of the first French "New Wave" filmmakers, has often been criticized for being too conservative. After all, in the midst of the days of youthful rebellion-Vietnam in the late sixties and seventies, I was filming small romantic confections like "Claire's knee". But do not bandage the old man, friends, he has always been a student of human nature, not an ideologist, and "L'Anglaise et le duc" continues to confirm this. <br /> <br /> Rohmer's characters are never the "bad guys" or the "good guys"; they are, above all, human beings who are capable of showing a range of human potentialities and limitations. That's why his films are always provocative, and this movie is no exception. . <br /> <br /> Now for the technological nuts and bolts. <br /> <br /> Rohmer, although he made his way in his 80s, is still at the forefront of film innovation. The appearance of "L'Anglaise" is like something you've never seen before. You guessed it, the old man, like several festival directors this year, has gone digital. <br /> <br /> All the exterior scenes of the film look as if they were taking place in their original Parisian configuration of the 1780s. In fact, you can get so distracted from marveling at the authenticity of the look of the movie that m. I have to go back for a second screening to capture the subtleties of the psychological points of view and, yes, I will say, of the film. <br /> <br /> Toronto presents some of the world's youngest filmmakers this year, as well as some of the oldest in the world. And the old masters are standing there in the avant-garde of the cinema with the young people. <br /> <br /> Long live the youth. Long life to old age. And live Erich Rohmer. <br /> <br />
