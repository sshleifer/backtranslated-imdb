"The sweet is never so sweet without the bitter." This quote was essentially the theme of the film in my opinion. Tom Cruise plays a young man who was given everything in his life. He takes things for granted and turns around at full speed in this great movie with a magnificent twist. This film will keep you involved in the plot and unable to pause to go to the bathroom. <br /> <br /> It's a movie that really makes you step back and look at your life and how you live it. You really can not appreciate the best things in life (the sweet), like love, until you have experienced the bad (the bitter). The theme will really lead you to "open your eyes". <br /> <br /> The only complaint is that the film is distorted a lot in the points and it is difficult to really understand. Although I think the end is perfect. I recommend you look at it and see for yourself.
