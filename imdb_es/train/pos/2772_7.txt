I have always believed that David and Bathsheba were a film originally intended for Tyrone Power in 20th Century Fox, although Gregory Peck gives a good account of himself as King David, the monarch with wandering eyes. <br /> <br /> A lot of biblical themes are covered in this film: adultery, redemption, sin, punishment and, in general, what God expects from his followers. <br /> <br /> When you are a king, even a king prophesied biblically Kingdom, you certainly have many perogatives that are not open to the rest of us. King David has many wives, including a really cruel one in Jayne Meadows, daughter of Saul, David's ancestor. But his eyes spotted Bathsheba in her garden one night. It turns out that she is as unhappily married to Uriah the Hittite as David with many women. Uriah is one of the captains of David's army. David sends Bathsheba and he is the King, she comes running because she has also set her eyes on him. <br /> <br /> What happens, an adventure, a pregnancy and a death carefully arranged for Uriah in a battle. But a Deity who sees and knows everything, has grasped all this and is not only punishing David and Bathsheba, but the entire Kingdom of Israel is being punished with drought, disease and pestilence. <br /> <br /> The sexist law of the day demands that Bathsheba have a death by stoning. David shows weakness in his previous actions, but here he approaches the plate and asks to put everything. He even puts his hands on the Ark of the Covenant, which was an instant death as seen in the movie. <br /> <br /> My interpretation of this is that God admires the guts, even if you are wrong, and leaves David aside. and he forgives them both. Bathsheba becomes the mother of Solomon and she and David are the ancestors of several successors in the divided kingdoms of Israel and Judah until both are conquered. <br /> <br /> Susan Hayward is an attractive Bathshee trapped in a loveless marriage with Uriah played by Kieron Moore. The only thing that awakens Moore is a good battle. I liked Kieron Moore's performance as the rearguard of a brave and rather stupid horse. <br /> <br /> No one can impose the law like Raymond Massey. His Nathan the Prophet is in harmony with the character of John Brown who played in two films, with the same intensity. <br /> <br /> Then, when his own law demanded death, why did God save Bathsheba and keep David on the throne? Maybe it was the fact that I just did not want to train a third party for the job. He had already replaced Saul with David. <br /> <br /> But I believe that the Christian interpretation could be that this was a sign of the Next Testament, that one could sin and receive mercy if one asks for it with penance. I will let the biblical scholars present the interpretations. <br /> <br /> Watch the movie and you may have a completely new theory.
