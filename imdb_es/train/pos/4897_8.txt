['This film attracts him from the first moment because it catches our attention when we recognize, yes, that this story opens with a cliché: a funeral. <br /><br /> In other hands apart from those of Judi, I would not have given him an 8, since this material has been done over and over again: the great meeting of once famous, choose one, please, team, army platoon, group of theater, singers, band. <br /><br /> But this movie never resorts to cheap sentimentality, and when you think it&#39;s going to leave, it goes in a different direction. An example of this is the flowers that are sent by an admirer to Judi. <br /><br /> The members of the band are an interesting group and they travel over the clichés as well. One is in prison, one has found religion, the other is a person, and one has sunk into dementia. But the joy of living rediscovered by Judi, ignited by the interest of her granddaughter, takes us and makes us overlook the sometimes simplistic nature of the plot. <br /><br /> The cast is who&#39;s who of talent, Leslie Caron, the incomparable jazz musician Cleo Laine with her incredible high notes, a final performance by Joan Sims, brava Joan, a cute like a flirty button Ian Holm having a ball, and Olympia Dukakis as a A divorcee who monopolizes money and lives in the highlands of Scotland with her ghillie and whiskey. The final scene is the Hollywoodland standard fare, the starry-minded children of the star became fun-loving supporters, the old lovers met, the youngsters swept up in the old music of the timers. Life should be that simple. But I would see him again, and I intended to do it, with my own granddaughter. Because in the right hands, sometimes you love these old blatant clichés. 8 out of 10.']
