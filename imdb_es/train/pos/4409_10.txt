['This movie is one of the sleepers of all time. I gave it a rating of 10. The story is of the famous &#39;Bushwhackers&#39; from Missouri who fought on the south side during the War between the States. The clothes they wore were authentic, the story and the reason they fought is very accurate and well researched. In fact, there was one of the battles that did not take place as shown ... but it&#39;s not bad for Hollywood. The actors were well chosen and were the most brilliant actors or the director really knows how to get the best out of them. I suspect it was a combination of excellent management, super casting to find the right people and excellent performance from the actors. Not just one or two ... this movie really worked! It has action, romance, suspense, good and bad (sometimes depending on your individual perspective) and history, all in a movie. He even has the future Spiderman and Jewel. And she is good!']
