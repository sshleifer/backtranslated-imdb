The 100 black-and-white half-hour episodes of the early situation comedy "Mr. Peepers" were originally aired from 1952-55 on NBC. Like many baby boomers, this and "Ding Dong School" are my first memories of television. Since both were later published in syndication, it is difficult to know how many of these memories are actually linked to the original transmissions. <br /> <br /> It's worth taking a look at "Mr. Peepers" for more than your nostalgia value. It represents a comedy style of situations very different from the programs like "The Honeymooners" and "I Love Lucy". The genre could have gone in two different directions in those days and ended up taking the abrasive course of those two shows; That's probably why they still seem contemporary. <br /> <br /> "Mr. Peepers", who was distinguished by his intelligent and moderate tone, may seem slow and boring in comparison. But in reality it is more a matter of adapting to the different style. Once you enter the characters, you will win the most intelligent viewers. Credit must be given to the show's producer, Fred Coe, a key figure in early television, whose dramatic anthologies are also worth watching ("Philco Television Playhouse," "Lights Out," "Playhouse 90," "Producers Showcase," "Playwrights 56", "Fireside Theater", etc.) even in the kinescope. <br /> <br /> "Mr. Peepers" offered a much softer style with Wally Cox (to be the voice of "Underdog" a few years later) in the lead role, Robinson Peepers, a school science teacher secondary of good manners. His glasses were his trademark and a symbolic link to his name and his role as a passive observer. <br /> <br /> The series provided Cox with an excellent support cast. Tony Randall played his best friend, history teacher Harvey Weskit. Jack Warden played Frank Whip, the noisy gym teacher whose mild intimidation gave the program most of its elements of conflict. <br /> <br /> There is an interest competition for love that involves the school nurse, Nancy Remington (Patricia Benoit), and the viewers quickly line up with Mr. Peepers, which seems to be much better for the gentle Nancy. His marriage on the screen, near the end of the 1953-54 season, attracted national attention, an early version of "Who Shot JR? Frenzy. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, what do I know? I am a kid
