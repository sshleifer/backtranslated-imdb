*** Possible spoilers *** <br /> <br /> I recently saw this movie with my 11-year-old son and was pleased to see that he laughed in the right places and was thrilled with the action sequences. Ron Ely is right as Doc. Cool, quiet, almost always in control (and with an occasional glint in his eye). What more could you want? I've never read a Doc Savage book, so I do not know if it's true to the source, but I liked the clear tone and tone of the derring. Many people have compared this movie with Raiders of the Lost Ark, which I do not think is fair. The difference in the budget is surprising (the attackers must have at least 10 times the budget). Doc Savage does not have the extensive location work that Raiders has. The special effects are also minimal, but for people, the story is very funny and the humor is fair. Sousa's music is catchy (I love that theme song, every time I watch the movie, I end up humming the song for days). The best way to approach this movie is to RELAX and enjoy. Highlights include the exciting opening sequence in which the fabulous five and Doc chase the Indian sniper along the rooftops of New York and the VERY funny fight sequence between Doc and Captain Seas. Not so good the villain who sleeps in a giant cradle (seriously!). In general, a great movie to watch on a rainy day. I give it 7 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Doc Savage, Doc Savage ... thanks to the man who is here!
