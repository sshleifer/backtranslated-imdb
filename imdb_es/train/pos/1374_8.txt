A French movie that Ester Williams would love. But synchronized swimming was just a bait for the story of three girls in a Paris exurb who found themselves. There is no doubt where Sciamma's sympathies are, since all the children are represented as "animaux", but in reality only the 3 girls are focused, and all the time, with the few adults and the other teenagers in their mostly in the background. Marie is a girl stick, unattractive, but determined. She wants to be a swimmer and forces herself to Floriane (a quality beauty Renascence by a critic) and is also a friend of convenience to Anna: not unattractive, but for her, the time of perfection of her body It was short, and now she is a teenager in the body of a woman. What follows is a journey to self-realization without a roadmap, but there is a sadness in all three that is not natural: where is the joy and carefree talk of youth? While the outcome was impressive, with the self-absorption of Floriane beautifully portrayed, as well as the equally beautiful union of Marie and Anne, everything seemed abstract, the Sciamma puppets.
