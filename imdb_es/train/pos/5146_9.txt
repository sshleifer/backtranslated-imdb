As someone who was born to a German mother and an English father (who spent five years in a prisoner of war camp) I come from a unique position. One of having to deal with the different Nazis on one side of the family and the victors of the Second World War on the other. This miniseries can not delve into every part of Hitler's psyche and must provide the viewer with a general idea of ​​the situation at that moment and in the best way that Hitler's mental state can. In this the series does quite well. Carlyle is very good like O'Toole, however, I would like to have obtained more information about the relationships with others at the party because Hitler did nothing on his own. He had people around him who followed him to the letter often without questioning and certainly without questioning later in his murderous career. What was going on in the minds of Goebbels, Goring and Hess? It would have been useful to see more of these relationships. But I hope it makes people investigate the issue more. It could also make people understand why someone like Saddam Hussein can not be allowed to continue in power.
