"The Odd Couple" is one of those films that far exceeds its reputation. People know it, they sing the main theme, they complain about living with a sloppy "Oscar" or an annoying "Felix" ... but they are sub-selling the movie without knowing it. This is not just about a clean guy who lives with a careless boy; It is a portrait of two friends who help each other through the agony of divorce. It is also very fun from beginning to end, but it is the kind of comedy that emerges from realistic, stressful and simply horrible situations. Then, some viewers have found that the film is a little uncomfortable, but I think that its plausibility is its strength. Also, Matthau's bulldog face simply breaks me! My favorite comedy, for a field mile.
