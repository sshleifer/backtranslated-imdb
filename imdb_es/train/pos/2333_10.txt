I recently started watching this show, and I must say that it really made me laugh. You have to appreciate the unreal aspects of this, along with everything else. Some other people said that this show should have more realistic reactions of the dead, among other things. If you are going to accept that Ned can make the dead come back to life, you have to accept that the other completely crazy pieces of the show. I could not help but smile after every episode I saw. I really think it's great that there is a program out there that can take a very strange theme and really make it great to watch. I love the narrative, I think it adds a bit of awe to the whole show. You can not always compare the old programs of a writer with the new ones, you have to take everything as if it were your own entity. Definitely, give it a try, and just enjoy the ridiculous parts as they are.
