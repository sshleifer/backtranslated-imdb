"One of Hung's best early efforts, humor is very present in some places when Hung tries to imitate Lee's facial movements and expressions, and also at a time when Hung is making fun of Jackie Chan Drunken Master. It's also pretty good, especially when Hung takes a trio of martial arts experts in the end, it's not the best movie, but it's pretty good for the 70's kung fu, especially if you're a Hung and / or Lee fan. However, be careful: most of the videos The versions of the film are of rather bad quality, there is also a character on the black face that some people may find offensive. <br /> <br /> Sammo Hung is a pastor of pigs moving to Hong Kong to fight some bad guys Sammo lights up his Bruce Lee imitation when he fights! <br /> <br /> This movie is often presented as a parody of Bruce's "Enter The Dragon" Lee, but it's not exact Sammo is a rural pig shepherd, obsessed with Bruce Lee, who moves to Hong Kong to help his relatives run a small outdoor restaurant. In the new job, he is forced to defend the restaurant of local gang members seeking protection money. When Sammo changes to fighting mode, he ignites his personification of Bruce Lee, which must be seen to be believed! This film is quite careless, in many of the fight scenes Sammo fights against people who are obviously actors instead of martial artists, and there is a character who is supposed to be black and who is played by an Asian man in heavy makeup (and ridiculous). But what this film lacks in budget and precision, it makes up for in atmosphere and energy. Highly recommended for a good mood ".
