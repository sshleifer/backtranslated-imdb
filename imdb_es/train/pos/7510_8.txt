['... but the mileage of the general viewer can vary in the stylized look of Mary &quot;American Psycho&quot; by Harron to the American sexual psyche seen through the lens of the immortal Queen of Curves, Bettie Page. <br /><br /> I will not bore anyone with a recitation of the iconic status of Ms. Page, an excellent and valued teacher from Nashville, Tennessee, who moved to New York with the hope of becoming an actress and ended up being the Queen of Bondage of the Universe. Nor will I review the schematic bio-pic plot of &quot;The Notorious Bettie Page&quot;, although I offer a great appreciation for the technical aspects of the film (a sequence of animated magazines covers the springs instantaneously), the inappropriate use of a vintage camera . in spite of. Finally, I will not discuss the timely applicability of the themes of innocence and perversion, freedom and control of the film, the sacred and the secular; They are there for the viewer to absorb, if they wish. The more things change, the more they stay the same, as the saying goes. <br /><br /> What I&#39;m going to digress for a moment is the splendid performance of Gretchen Mol as Bettie Page. The truth is that Mol&#39;s face does not look like Bettie&#39;s, nor is it specially built like Bettie (although only a fool would deny those beautiful breasts, and no fool, me!). He does not even have fun with the thick, dark bush that hid the most intimate charms of Miss Page, but the fact is that Mol embodies the spirit of Bettie Page in all senses, forms and forms. It is a &quot;comeback&quot; bravery of an undeserved semi-darkness. I have never met Ms. Page (and, unfortunately, I never will, most likely), but I have devoured the photos and videos, and I read all the available biographies and interviews, I bought the exchange cards and other probabilities and purposes , and to be honest, I wished Mrs. Page since I discovered her as a teenager for the first time between the covers of the dusty hairdressing magazines and five and ten. Mol perfectly captures the essence of women as I conceived them, unpretentious, in what I consider a performance worthy of an Oscar. Liv Tyler could never have matched Mol&#39;s brilliant intensity of characterization in a million years, and I, for one, am grateful that he abandoned the project. Not that I care to see her totally naked, I hasten to add, but I can not imagine that her style of sensuality has been translated into the exuberant innocence of Bettie Page. <br /><br /> &quot;The Notorious Bettie Page&quot; is not for everyone, nor are slavery and discipline. I suspect that it will do much better on disc than in theaters; legions of fanatics devoted to Page and the curious will take care of that. I can only hope that the DVD is full of enough extras from Bettie to show the uninitiated how good Mol&#39;s work has been. <br /><br /> Beyond that, the tip of the hat to an excellent cast of support, especially Lili Taylor and Chris Bauer as Paula and Irving Klaw, whose celebrity photography business was Bettie&#39;s door to immortality. <br /><br /> A final note to the young writer who opined that Mrs. Page had no effect on her generation: take a look at Madonna&#39;s conion holder and contact us. Bettie Page is, whether you know it or not, the true godmother of fetish clothes. Without it, Madonna and the rest of her relatives could never have existed.']
