['First things first, I was never afraid of this gem underestimated as a child (&quot;Little Mermaid&quot; on the other hand ...). As my title says, this was one of my favorite childhood movies that I still love as a teenager. It&#39;s a beautiful and bittersweet film about a misfit German shepherd named Charlie (with a fantastic voice from Burt Reynolds) who is killed by his boss / partner in crime (it&#39;s called ha, ha is Carface). Charlie is sent directly to heaven by default because &quot;all dogs go to heaven because unlike people, dogs are naturally good, loyal and kind&quot;. Chalie is sent back to Earth because he finished the clock of his life, where he gets even worse with his best friend, Itchy and an orphan girl, Anne-Marie. I used to see this all the time as a child and sometimes I still see it. Anyway, it&#39;s a beautiful bittersweet movie like I said before that could leave a tear in your eye ...']
