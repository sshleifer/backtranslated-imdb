Yes it is. In fact, it is somewhere in my 20 best favorite movies of all time. Number 15, I think. Anyway, I'm generally not one of the plots, but I think the plots work best in anime and RPG video games (for example, Final Fantasy 7) and not the movies. But this one has everything. Vivid drawings of planets, stars, a very well written script. While this is not really for children, they can still see it, it does not contain graphic blood, guts and silicone. But I do not think they'll understand it.
