['I see this movie for the first time almost 21 years ago when I was a Matin√©e ITV (before the days of cable and satellite). I was out of school with the mumps and I was totally involved in the movie. I bought it in a video for about 10 years and I want to get a DVD copy of it. David Niven is my favorite actor of all time and I think it&#39;s a farce that they&#39;ve seen him so many times when the Oscars appeared. I also think that the queen should have knighted him, since he easily did the same for the film industry, if not more than Sean Connery or Anthony Hopkins. the way the film changes from black and white to color and vice versa is well done and the film has star actors like Roger Livesy, Marius Goring and an early appearance by Richard Attenborough.']
