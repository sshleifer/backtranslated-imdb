This movie is a great example of good storytelling. The acting is excellent. The story is inspiring without being too manipulative or false. There were a couple of points where they probably made people a little bit more good or bad than they really were, but considering it's a Hollywood movie, they showed incredible moderation. There was not a single explosion in the movie, even though they had an opportunity to do so. The film, although it had parts of suspense, did not become an action movie. In this way, the story focuses on an extraordinary man in unfortunately ordinary times. Well done!
