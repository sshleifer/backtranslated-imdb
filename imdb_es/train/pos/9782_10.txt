Peaches is truly a wonderful movie. I write this to refute a review of someone named 'Auscrit', who has appeared on this site. First, the idea that the first Monahans movie "The Interview" is somehow TV is an extraordinary statement. Here is a film that has been widely praised around the world, as it is simply one of the best Australian films ever made. I totally deserved to win the best image. Peaches is a brave, bold and courageous game. For me it works on all levels and now I've seen it twice. Monahan is a filmmaker who shows great skill and incredible sensitivity. For 'Auscrit' to make the comment that it is another television movie, etc. and that Hugo Weaving is not good, he just does not 'catch' the movie. Or more particularly, he does not want to get it. Frankly, it's the kind of comment one expects from another filmmaker who is jealous or bitter or both. Or someone from within the industry, be it distribution, exhibition or bureaucracy. Your average punter, I found you just do not write comments like that. I have noticed other comments on the site and reference to the film Sommersault. One has to wonder what people think they are looking at. Unfortunately, in Australia at the time the SS was launched, the push was: if you did not like it, then there was something wrong with you and not with the movie. This manipulation of the media is quite common. The reality is that the only similarity between the two films is that they are rights to movies. Unfortunately for me, SS is a movie about nothing, which could have been told in 15 minutes. I see it as a one-dimensional movie about anxiety. Peaches in comparison is a masterpiece. Personally, I can not wait for what Monahan does next, as he is clearly far ahead of any of his contemporaries when it comes to cinema. In conclusion, if the film does not win all the AFI and IF prizes this year, then it is a rigged game. As for Auscrit, find something more constructive to do with your time.
