This fantastic whodunit is an early prototype of what soon became a very popular film genre. I was happy to see William Powell running a detective story with charisma and charm, and without the silly attitude of his character Nick Charles (from the series "Thin Man"). While the story is good by itself, I think what really makes it fun to watch this movie is the fantastically imaginative direction of Michael Curtiz. From a visual point of view, this is a film with a rich texture, with Curtiz showing an incredible command of the medium; From split-screen images to odd camera angles and imaginative flashbacks, Curtiz proves he was one of the best Hollywood directors. Highly recommended if you are a fan of this type of movies.
