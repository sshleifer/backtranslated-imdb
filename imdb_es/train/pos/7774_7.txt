"Written in the wind" was an enormously successful universal image. Only Douglas Sirk could do it, a man who saw the possibilities in the material they gave him. Based on a popular novel by Robert Wilder and an adaptation of George Zuckerman, he had all the elements that make an excellent melodrama: nymphomania, a great oil fortune, alcoholism, incest and a soft touch of homosexuality. Mr. Sirk paved the way for what would follow later in the telenovela genre, mainly, "Dallas" and "Dynasty," just to mention two. <br /> <br /> The fact is that this movie was completely filmed. A study. Most of the decoration is false. Like many of those photos from the 1950s, "Written on the Wind" was shot in its entirety in a studio. Just look at the scenes that are supposed to take place in Manhattan, Miami or even the lake, one can see how the landscape is a painted background. Mr. Sirk could not care less about realism as long as he told the story his way. <br /> <br /> We recently saw a screening, part of a resurgence of Mr. Sirk's work, where people laughed. in some of the most dramatic moments, especially during the scenes where Rock Hudson appears, who plays good Mitch Wayne. There is also something graphic in the way that both Robert Keith, who plays patriarch Jasper Hadley, and his own daughter, the evil Marylee, caress the derrick that adorns the old man's desk, a kind of phallic art object. . <br /> <br /> Douglas Sirk probably wanted his cast to deliver the best performances, which makes sense in the way Dorothy Malone plays the nymphomaniac Marylee, and to some extent, Robert Stack, who plays Kyle, the tormented heir of history. That would probably be the easy explanation of what appears on the screen. The only one that seems normal is Lauren Bacall, who was not asked to make her character of Lucy Moore appear to be nothing more than a grounded person trapped with the wrong crowd. <br /> <br /> Along with his other Hollywood films, "Written on the Wind" show the genius of a talented director who gave the audience what they wanted to see: stories bigger than life that could only be seen in the big screen
