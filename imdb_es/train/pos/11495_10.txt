We saw this in one of the local art theaters in the Montrose area of ​​Houston, TX. It was a total surprise compared to the article published in the theater bulletin, but art left us stunned. It was beautifully done and (apparently) photographed in a schloss (German name for the castle) somewhere in the Munich area. It is a very explicit exploration of the sexual relationships of a group of twenty to twenty men and women isolated from the limitations of day to day life. It's fantastic in more levels than I can remember. We return home after the movie and we talk and talk until 4 am the next morning. <br /> <br /> The version we saw was in English (mostly), so there must be at least two versions since the first reviewer saw the Movie in (probably its original German version). I searched and searched for a videotape version but I never came up with anything. I would absolutely love to have a VHS or DVD version of this. Explore relationships at a fundamental level and it is also an excellent tutorial on how to relate to your partner. If someone knows the writer / director, convince him to release it again, preferably on DVD these days. I can not even imagine getting tired of seeing the sincere performance of the actors who are now probably over 40 years old. Please, bring it back.
