A delightfully unpretentious shipment of Romeo and Juliet. Focus without more expectations than having a good time and enjoy this. A talented group of comic actors said goodbye and had a riot in this vehicle of carefree artists. The bad reviews were due to a snobbery about the Shakespeare treatments. Some people feel that all movies should be "important" --- If you share those views, do not get upset. The credits are read "presenting" to Angelina Jolie, who is not even close to being true, but is incredibly beautiful as the character of Juliet and, as always, her performance is wonderful, and, considering her age at that time, even Su dialect is pretty good. The recreation of this classic story with Italian families fighting in the restaurant business in New York is very fun. Look at it in the right mood and you will laugh out loud.
