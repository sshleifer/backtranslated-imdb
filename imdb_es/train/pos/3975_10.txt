If you lived in the 60s, this movie can sometimes be painful and sometimes very happy. Everything is there, but the small print of the tabloids of the culture of the counterculture prevailed at that time. These are the roots of a social revolution that is still unfolding: "do not speak too soon because the wheel is still spinning, because times are changing". While the film focuses on the revolutionary nature of LSD and its dissemination at that time, that alone contributed greatly to the evolution of intelligence, influencing engineers, scientists and helping in the development of computer-related activities. . Greetings to the filmmakers of one who was there: you have captured the era better than I have seen before.
