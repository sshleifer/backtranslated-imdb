I had no idea what Jane Eyre was before I saw this miniseries. I had read and seen many classics before, and I thought that most of the classics were boring, oversized and overrated stories with quite interesting arguments at best. This miniseries by Jane Eyre completely changed my conceptions. <br /> <br /> Zelah Clarke is a fabulous actress, and she gives a wonderful performance of Jane Eyre. His accent is charming and his calm and firm nature corresponds exactly with the character of the young governess. Timothy Dalton is an incredible Rochester. His passion and energy in the film makes me believe he was born to play the master of Thornfield Hall. I could not sleep all night after having seen this miniseries. The plot is both disturbing and inspiring. The characters are played brilliantly, and the story is incredible. This is the best version of Jane Eyre that has ever appeared in the film. <br /> <br /> Later, I read the book and I was surprised at how close this miniseries of the writings of Charolette Bronte was. Jane Eyre is now my favorite movie and book. If you want to see a masterpiece that will change your life, look at the Jane Eyre version of the BBC in 1983.
