Miriam Hopkins is "The Lady with Red Hair" in this 1940s biopic of Mrs. Leslie Carter that also stars Claude Rains as David Belasco, Richard Ainley as Lou Payne, and an excellent cast of supporting players, including Laura Hope Crews and Victor Jory. <br /> <br /> Miriam Hopkins and Claude Rains give wonderful performances. Hopkins was a beautiful actress who really makes us feel for Mrs. Carter. Rains is great as the flamboyant, selfish producer / writer / actor / businessman David Belasco, one of the biggest names in the theater. <br /> <br /> Although Ms. Carter's second husband, Lou Payne, was the advisor to this film. It is a poor representation of the real events of Mrs. Carter's life. True, there was a very publicized and bitter divorce, and she was undoubtedly seen as a scandalous character because of that and for becoming an actress. However, she had custody of her son Dudley, so there was no battle for custody. Once he broke up with Belasco, he did not return to him and, in fact, started working in vaudeville and, in fact, made some films towards the end of his life. She married Lou, and he became her protagonist in many productions. <br /> <br /> The driving force of Mrs. Carter at the beginning of this film is regaining custody of her son, but she finally realizes that in her time away from him, she is completely connected with her father. Also in the movie (and I'm not sure it was true in real life) she traveled with her mother and lived in a theater pension, which gives the movie a more interesting atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Not a bad movie, probably not a portrayal of the greatness of Carter or Belasco. One of Mrs. Carter's most famous moments was in The Heart of Maryland, where she wore a wig with six-foot braids. Offstage, fans flew their hair while hanging 35 feet above the stage and clutched the center of a bell to keep it from sounding. Pretty visual.
