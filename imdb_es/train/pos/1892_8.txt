['After seeing Arthur on television several times, I laughed so much that the role of Dudley Moore as Arthur, a happy and happy luck, a drunken millionaire was hysterical, but John Gielgud, like the figure of his servant / father, Hobson was equally charming. I bought the DVD a few weeks ago and I saw it, even though it was almost 27 years, it is still as nice as it was always the role of Liza Minnelli, since the love interest was fascinating, the chemistry between the two was magical. <br /><br /> Arthur Bach, (Moore) is a spoiled drunken millionaire who has a bar bill that reads like the national debt that has no desire to grow and enjoys acting like a child. His activities are supervised by his dry English butler Hobson (Gielgud). It seems that nobody really cares about Arthur, except him. Arthur&#39;s father (Barbour) offers an ultimatum if he does not marry the terrible blonde socialite Susan Johnson (Eikenberry) in four. weeks that will cut the inheritance of his son of 750 million dollars. <br /><br /> However, Arthur finds himself and falls in love with Linda Marolla (Minnelli), a young working-class waitress and tie thief, now facing a difficult decision to marry for love or money. When Hobson dies, Arthur finally grows up and breaks up with Susan before the wedding, leaving him to keep the money and his true love. <br /><br /> Arthur is a truly charming romantic comedy for everyone.']
