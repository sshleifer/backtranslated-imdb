What is so taboo about love? People seem to have significant problems with transgenders. <br /> <br /> The title of this movie did not get my attention. It was a grainy shot 4 minutes into the movie, which made me stop the navigation channel. I could not believe how amazing this movie was. It touches so many levels of human emotion that it once did not cease to touch me in any way. It is, by far, one of the best independent films I've seen in my life. I did not see these characters as a genre, simply human. I would recommend it to anyone who loves movies. Especially the independent films. I commend all the intrepid filmmakers!
