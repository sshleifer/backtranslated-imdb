That's what t.v. It should be. And Pushing Daisies lives up to those expectations. A beautifully designed and well-designed show, Pushing Daisies is one of the few shows left in primetime that has integrity, is good for the whole family and ignites your imagination. It is not about the normal action, sex, money or murder angles of any other program on television. It is a spectacle that makes you think and laugh, but although the basic plot may seem impossible, the concepts are real for all of us. Wanting something you can not have, waiting for someone to love us, fleeing from your past and looking for family, even in the most unlikely places, etc ... <br /> <br /> I realize that ABC has basically canceled this wonderful program at this point, and most likely replace it with some program beyond the integrity point. I guess everything goes back to money ... it's a shame that now there are no other programs on ABC that really make you feel good after watching.
