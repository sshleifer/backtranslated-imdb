['Ernst Lubitsch&#39;s contribution to American cinema is enormous. His legacy is an outstanding group of films that will live forever, as in the case of &quot;The Shop Around the Corner&quot;. This film has been transformed into other, less distinguished films and a musical work, without the charm and elegance of Mr. Lubitsch&#39;s own and definitive version. <br /><br /> Margaret Sullavan and James Stewart worked together on several films. His characters in this film stand out as an example of how to be in a movie without appearing to be acting at all. Both stars are charming like the correspondence friends who do not know each other, but fate made them work together in the same store in Budapest. <br /><br /> The reason why these classic films worked so well is the incredible support that the studios created in one image after another. Here, we have the wonderful Frank Morgan, who plays the owner of the store. In addition, we see Joseph Schildkraut, Felix Bressart, William Tracy and Charles Smith, among others, doing an impressive job to make us believe that they are in Budapest. <br /><br /> That&#39;s why these movies will live forever!']
