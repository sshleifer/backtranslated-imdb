I discovered that this is the most pleasant Muppets movie, because I felt it was the most cheerful and had the best delivery of comics in most of its lines. The Muppets try to go to Broadway to sell an original musical they have written, but along the way they run into the usual problems, including Kermit's memory loss here. While there are not as many great cameos here as in the original "Movie of the Muppets," there are some that include Joan Rivers and Dabney Coleman. Simply the moment and the delivery of so many lines is great, and the situations in which the Muppets are are very funny. The original songs are also good here, and the ending is satisfying. There's not much more to say about the movie, but Muppet fans should see it for sure. It's Muppet's funniest movie and surely everyone will enjoy it. <br /> <br /> *** 1/2 of ****
