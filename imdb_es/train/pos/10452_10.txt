['I want CÃ©line and Jessie to go further in their relationship, I want to tell you that they were made for each other, that in many moments in the movie we want them to die for each other. His story is what we always wanted and probably most of us never came. It&#39;s about love but not stupid things like &quot;notting hills&quot; or that kind of movie. This is life and I believed in them, I thought they were falling ... This was very intelligent and moving. I just finished seeing him a minute ago and I&#39;m still there ... I want to go to Vienna. I want to see you again as soon as possible. <br /><br /> I must say that now I was becoming a misanthrope and I felt that if love was just a false concept, but with this film I realized that maybe somewhere, in some way and at some point, something could happen. <br /><br /> I am French and did not know July Delpy very well despite Kieslowski &quot;three colors: white&quot; ... Now I have to see his other works because he looks like an angel and has a perfect performance. <br /><br /> I saw &quot;before sunset&quot; (the sequel to Paris) a few days before seeing &quot;before sunrise&quot; and it does not matter. Both are masterpieces. Proof that you do not need to impress your eyes with technology to get pure feelings. I&#39;m sorry for my English that I&#39;m trying to do my best. <br /><br /> Franck in France']
