I watched this movie and listened to the writer and director, Juan Gerard, speak at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival. <br /> <br /> All I knew was that it was the story of an 8-year-old boy. Old boy at the time of the Cuban Revolution in 1958 and how it affects his home and family. <br /> <br /> Your opening scene will remember "Cinema Paradiso". In fact, the film is full of references to classic films: The Roulette Wheel (Casablanca), "chicken clucking" (Rebel without cause), references to Bunuel, "Touch of Evil"; You will find more. The homeless man (Georg Stanford Brown) is a reference to Cuban folklore that often uses a black man as a type of Greek choir. <br /> <br /> What this movie really is is the culmination of a dream. Gerard's desire to honor his family and the medium of the film that he has loved all his life. <br /> <br /> This is the true story of Juan Gerard and all the people around him are real, as are the events described. Gerard is actually an architect and engineer (and passionate about movies), but his dream was to make this film. He and his wife decided to live that dream and Harvey Keitel became an "angel" who believed in Gerard and agreed to produce and star in it. Keitel holds the screen powerfully like the mysterious and secret grandfather "Che". Brown and Keitel are the only Americans in the cast. Iben Hjejle (High Fidelity) and Gael Garcia Bernal (and your Mama Tambien) offer strong support in key roles. <br /> <br /> Honestly, the first half of the movie suffers a rigid delivery of lines, and some overestimates, but stay with it. The last half is much better since the events of the revolution combine for the bittersweet and the honest climax. It is the first effort of Juan Gerard, but he is honest as he is and his passion and heart are really manifested in this sincere first effort. I would definitely see him again, and I hope he continues his film career. <br /> <br />
