This movie is fun to watch. If you liked "Dave" with Kevin Klein, you'll love this. He thinks that "Dave" left South America while Dreyfus plays Jack Noah, an actor between jobs, who is selected by the head of the secret police's island of the Parador, to replace the drunkard of a dictator, Alfonse Simms, after having had a heart attack and died. Noah advances with difficulty, helped in his role by the former dictator's lover, while trying to thwart Raul Julia's plans. Jonathan Winters also makes an appearance as a wealthy American immigrant who turns out to be CIA. Also starring Polly Holiday and Fernando Rey. <br /> <br /> There are some absurd moments, like the body of the old dictator is frozen for a year and the final scene, where Sonia Braga, who has the bee cradling the body bloody and full of Dreyfus bullets You see moments later, all in pristine white, without any stain on it. But in general it is a great romp.
