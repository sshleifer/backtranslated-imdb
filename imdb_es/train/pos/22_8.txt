If you advance through the horrible song, you will find a classic fairy tale below. Christopher Walken is very funny and surprisingly good on paper. His characteristic acting style works well for the cunning Puss in Boots. The other actors are fine by their parts. I did not find any of the performances terribly false or uncomfortable. However, the king in particular seems a real fool, and I wonder if he is supposed to be. I can not remember the original story. The special effects are typical of the eighties, but at least they are not too fake like some of the computer generated rates we see today. In general, I recommend this movie for children and adults who are children at heart.
