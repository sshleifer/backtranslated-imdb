If you are a fan of black movies and you think you do not do them like they used to, here's your answer: they just do not do them in Hollywood anymore. We must turn to the French to remember how satisfying, subtle and brilliant a well-made film of that genre can be. Read My Lips is a wonderfully unpleasant little gift for the faithful of director Jacques Audiard, with clear narrations and excellent performances by Emmanuelle Devos and Vincent Cassel. <br /> <br /> The basic plot could have been written in the 1940s: silly but the sexy ex-convict and a smart but slovenly femme fatale (who happens to be ruthlessly ambitious) discover each other while living lives of grim despair and longing , they are manipulated to achieve their own ends, they develop a complex love / hate relationship, they cook a criminal scheme that involves robbery, double crosses, closing calls and a lot of money. All action is carried out in depressing, seedy and / or poorly lit places. <br /> <br /> Audiard has created some modern twists, of course. The fatal woman is an unappreciated office worker who turns out to be almost deaf and uses her lip-reading ability to take revenge on those who marginalize her. And where can expect love scenes that discover that both characters are sexually awkward and immature. Add some modern technology and music, and it looks like a contemporary movie, but make no mistake: it's the old-school black cinema. It's as good as any movie in the genre and easily one of the best movies I've seen all year.
