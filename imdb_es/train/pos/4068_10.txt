Impressive, this is without a doubt the best anime caricature ever made. The first time I saw a castle in the sky in the late 80's was when I was a child and left a lasting impression. Years passed and I forgot the title of the film, and just by chance, surfing the Internet I found this masterpiece again. After reading the comments and analysis of other people, I am not surprised that you have so much recognition and have touched so many because it leaves an impression. A true fantasy adventure, a must for all children and adults. It is better not to reveal the story, so I would say that watching this movie will have a clear and open mind. If you have children, treat them, I promise you will love them. There is not much to say about this work of art, but if you have not seen it, enjoy it.
