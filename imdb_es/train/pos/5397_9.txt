Tenchu ​​aka. Hitokiri- directed by Hideo Gosha, starring Shintaro Katsu and Tetsuya NAkadei belongs (together with Goyokin, HAra Kiri and Rebellion) to the best existing chambara films. <br /> <br /> It is the story of Shintaro Katsu (who plays Okada Izo) working for Nakadei, who wants to become the daymio. Okada, being the "cleaner" for Nakadei, is treated like a dog, and after a while he realizes what it really is for Nakadei. <br /> <br /> But there is much more in this movie. Fan of Japanese cinema should have seen it !!!!!!! <br /> <br /> (Tenchu ​​means Heavens Punishment)
