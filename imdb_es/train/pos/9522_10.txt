This is the first Tom Hanks movie that I have had the privilege of seeing in the theater, although it is my favorite. When I heard that I was going to play an assassin, I was a bit stunned and thought, "Can Mr. Hanks get this out of the way?" And he did it in haute couture. The film from the depression era of this decade of 1930 is about loyalty, redemption and a way you do not want your children to stumble. Tom Hanks heads a stellar cast as Michael Sullivan. Being the family man and the secret life of the hitman Oscar-nominated Paul Newman. This film, Tom Hanks, is based more on the reaction and the look than on the dialogue, which offers an excellent performance. <br /> <br /> On one night of one of his works, Michael's son, Michael Jr., played by newcomer Tyler Hoechlin, witnesses the coup. And the partner in the crime of Michael Sr., also theater actor Daniel Craig can not get that information. So he dismisses Michael's son and wife, except Michael Jr. So the two head to Chicago to get Conner Rooney (son of Mr. Paul Newman's Mr. Rooney). <br /> <br /> The drama and the intense plot really gets complicated as his father tries to fix things, even though his son is on the way. On this deadly journey, someone has hired a success for Michael Sr. The murderer would be the photographer of the late Harlen Maguire, played by a Jude Law with stained teeth. <br /> <br /> The movie will make you feel the old days. And with the beautiful and disturbing music of Oscar-nominated Thomas Newman, you can not help but appreciate this movie by Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes. So sit down and enjoy the wild ride.
