['I really like this movie because in Australia, Chinese movies like these are never shown in prime time. I must say that this is one of the best serious films in history, which describes the difference between the people of Hong Kong and mainland China. It really shows that there is discomfort between the two, but it can only get better as HK is learning Mandarin. He also showed me how in Mainland China the indie rock scene exists, and that the Chinese do know how to play the guitar and make the house start to sound. Who said that China is not ready for rock music? Daniel Wu is absolutely magnificent, with his clear and crispy voice, honest acting and a total chick magnet. I recommend this movie to those who do not know much about Asians to clean themselves of typical Western stereotypes, and people who only love Chinese / Asian cinema like me. Check it out!']
