For those of you who think that the anime is only about giant reptiles that rape schoolgirls, think again. There is a totally different side to Japanese animation. Yakitate! Japan is one of those shows. It is a story of sweet character of a child with the gift of making delicious bread. His universe consists of creating a Japanese bread that can match the famous European breads. The show is as rare as they come and I'm sure that non-Japanese viewers will miss many of the jokes. But it is still very nice to watch because of the complete and innocent vibes of the show. <br /> <br /> In the world of Yakitate! It is not uncommon for people to appear to have had an orgasm after eating bread. The bread is amazing and can give the consumer a wide range of superpowers, from traveling in time to swimming like a fish. That strange aspect makes it one of the least predictable and fun shows I've seen in a long time.
