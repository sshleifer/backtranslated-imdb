This is not a bad movie. It's not very fun, but it's interesting and entertaining. It has some fun moments. Cher gives a good performance <br /> <br /> in a role that is very opposite to her real life. Your performance <br /> <br /> is only worth it. If this movie had come out <br /> <br /> today, it would not have been nominated, but by the standards of the 80s, <br /> <br /> it was excellent.
