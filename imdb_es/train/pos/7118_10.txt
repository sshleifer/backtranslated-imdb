This is a great classic film from the 40s and well produced. There are very dramatic scenes in this film with John Garfield, (Al Schmid), "Force of Evil", '48 and Dane Clark, (Lee Diamond), "Last Rites", '88, fighting against the Japanese during World War II being completely surrounded And with a single machine gun. When Al Schmid was able to return home after being injured with a horrible injury, his problems began to begin with his family and his engaged girlfriend. Dane Clark gave an exceptional support role as Lee Diamond, who did everything possible to help his friend Al to get his life back. There is never a complete victory for the War and let's not forget all the staff of Brave Wounded Military in the Veterans of All Wars Hospitals and our current Iraq Veterans!
