(Question) What do you call 100 film critics buried up to their necks in the sand? (Answer) A good start. Well, I do not know Peter Mattei from Adam, but if he is the budding author who suggests his filmography, "Love in the time of money" is a "good start". A classy movie with capricious music in the style of a music box, this film analyzes a chain of tenuous relationships as it moves from person A to person B to person C ... etc ... and ends again with people A and B in the form of a carousel. The film gently explores the unhappy circumstances of nine people with finely rendered nuances that begin and end with a street prostitute and her client. The disadvantage of this film is the lack of a story that may have something to do with the many critical hits it received. Last night I saw the giant "Angels in America" ​​and I got bored at the end while this small concatenation of character studies kept me spellbound. With precaution. I may be the only person who really liked this movie. (SECOND)
