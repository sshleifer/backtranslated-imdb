At the time, this film had a controversy written all over (like most of Verhoeven's projects). <br /> <br /> It contains very graphic scenes with scenes of death; A parachute that does not open the body of the guys * smack * on the ground. A boy eaten by a Lion * chomp * teeth in his throat. And a guy who is being run over by a speedboat * zoom * bloody corpse going down. <br /> <br /> But in addition to Gore, this film also contains some brilliant scenes (and incredibly beautiful), filmed in the city of gray fishermen that is Vlissingen; <br /> <br /> Thousands of rosebuds flying over the screen, in a somewhat irrelevant part of the film, a beautiful (holy) woman who puts flowers in a milk jar, surrounded by dripping chunks of meat blood. a torrid scene of love between two male characters, in a cemetery. <br /> <br /> The story concludes in a frantic but satisfying 10 minutes, which does not disappoint, and will leave you with a sigh of relief. <br /> <br /> Of course, with the pros the cons come, some special effects are too exaggerated, and obviously they are made to see to what extent Verhoeven could push the gore factor (for example, the various eyeballs hanging) out of their plugs). In addition, while the two main actors, (Jeroen Krabbé and Renée Soutendijk), do an excellent job of giving life to their characters, the character of Herman (played by the unlovely Thom Hoffman) simply feels enormously underdeveloped, which makes him difficult to care for, even after his tragic death. <br /> <br /> I have done everything possible to give you a little idea of ​​what to expect from this incredible movie, and as you can see, it is not easily summarized. in words. So do yourself a favor, if you find this movie somewhere, look at it! And enjoy the unique style and essence of this masterpiece.
