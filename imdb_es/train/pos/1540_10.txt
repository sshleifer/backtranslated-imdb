This is an incredible movie. I can not remember the last time I saw a Swedish film in layers. It is funny, tragic, convincing, and above all it is a piece of the life of a small Swedish city. Crush the clichés, and dwell deeper. It makes you feel connected, not only with the main characters, but with all the characters. <br /> <br /> Big city girl that goes back to her roots, her small hometown, to celebrate her father's 70th birthday, crossing paths with People she has not known in several years. Although the story itself is not unique, it offers a new approach. The center of the story is the relationship between three sisters (in different stages of life), who are not very close. Or at least he does not realize how close they are. <br /> <br /> A key reason that makes it so easy to connect with the people in this movie is the immaculate cast. First, I am more than pleased by the fact that there is absolutely no Swedish actor called 'A-list' in this film. Usually, there are a handful of actors who have the ability to find their way into almost all major productions in Sweden. This time, the production company managed to keep it real by choosing actors who actually seem to love their profession. Sofia Helin is probably the first Swedish actress since Eva Röse to show that you do not need words to convey an emotion. <br /> <br /> Writing is also very attractive. The dialogue is more than credible, and compared to other Swedish films of the last year or two, progress is made for miles. Maria Blom controls everything from the beginning, and if you did not know it, you would never guess that this is the first time she writes And she directs a feature film. I can not wait for your next one. <br /> <br /> Once you start seeing this, you really want to see it.
