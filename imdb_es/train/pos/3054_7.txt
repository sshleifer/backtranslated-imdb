"Panic" is a kind of crime-drama comedy with William H. Macy, Donald Sutherland and Neve Campbell in the lead roles. Alex (played by Macy) is a guy who kills people to live. But for the time being he faces a depression and that is why he is seeing a therapist. That's where he meets Sarah (Neve Campbell) and falls in love with her. He also faces another problem: he wants to leave the family business (the murders), but now he does not know how to say this to his father. <br /> <br /> What follows is the story of a man during his life. The crisis of middle age, which faces the usual problems: falling in love with a pretty girl and everything that goes with it. <br /> <br /> Pretty good interpretative performances of the cast. Macy is excellent as the depressed Alex. I had high expectations for this and it was a good movie, but I did not deliver it completely. The story was quite flat and clich√© .. <br /> <br /> 7/10
