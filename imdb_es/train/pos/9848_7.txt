I watched this movie with my son's eyes and I was not disappointed. The story is known, some abandoned orphans must be brought to their parents by an unlikely trio (mamooth - saber tooth tiger and a lazy animal) ... And I do not want to forget to mention the incredible animal of fury. his hazenut. This really made me laugh a lot during the whole picture. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell: it works, it's fun and it's a "must see" for your children (they'll like it).
