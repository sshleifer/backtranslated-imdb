In the 1930s, studios would use short films like this to test new actors, given their relative ease of production compared to feature films, so it is interesting that this is the protagonist of Shirley Temple, who has long established her same as the most famous child star of all time. On the other hand, she probably was not the one being tested, I guess it would have been Frank Coghlan Jr., who played Shirley's brother, Sonny in the movie and had a comparatively less impressive performance. Once again, a 9-year-old Shirley Temple was probably not an easy act to accompany. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with an impressive visual gag that involves a dripping ceiling, which I guess was designed to have Shirley Temple look down on the roof, illustrate the working-class status of the family in the movie and offer a clean transition to the next scene, which presents Shirley trampling merrily in the rain. <br /> <br /> It's Sonny 'On his birthday, and his father makes occasional and terribly frustrated efforts to hide the fact that he wants to give Sonny a dog he really wants for himself, but Sonny fears dogs because he was bitten by one once and has been scared. as. It is curious that, when his father insists on getting a dog, Sonny decides to run away from his house instead of having a dog in the house, and while he runs away without a destination in sight, it is also curious that the film illustrates what it looks like. be an indifference for homeless people that surpasses even the astonishing indifference that exists today. <br /> <br /> Sonny passes a man who cooks bacon in an iron pan next to the train tracks (just after a train that flew by, given how close he was to the tracks, you would think they would have flown to the type of tracks, but it does not matter). After Sonny gives up on sharing breakfast due to the bitter look his smile receives from the boy, he continues and the homeless boy disappears from the movie. It is interesting to consider what a longer film would have done, because it leaves this poor man as a loose end. <br /> <br /> It does not matter, Sonny soon overhears a dog complaining under an easel when it passes over. and jump down to find a dog covered in burrs. It may seem trite that I immediately pick up the dog and adopt it, since he has just left home because of his fear of the dogs, but it seemed to me that he did not need to be reminded of his power over the dogs, but his lack of power over the Tan. Soon as he saw a dog in need, he overcame his fear. <br /> <br /> Hey, if that's all it takes, all I have to do is find a helpless spider and I'm ready! <br /> <br /> It's a very convenient movie in which everything works exactly as it should, but it's cute and funny enough (and short enough to be) like a funny movie. We no longer expect an epic plot in a 19-minute movie, but Pardon My Pups still has a great deal of story and character development in its brief execution time. And it also presents a fight scene at the end of the film that should have made Charlie Chaplin proud. I'm hardly an expert in the Shirley Temple movies, but it's not hard to see how she became the most famous children's star of all time.
