This is the maximum individual show in which Eddie Murphy is at his best. Just forget about the crazy professor and the distinguished gentlemen, this is the real Eddie Murphy. His imitations of Mr. T. (pretending he is gay), Michael Jackson and other artists are murderers. I think it's also quite daring to make fun of the artists who were very popular at the time. My favorite act is the one where he is at his annual barbecue with the family and plays his drunken father and Aunt Bunny who falls off the stairs. <br /> <br /> This show is the best medicine when you feel bad! If you see the sequel 'Raw' do not be disappointed. It's pretty good too, but it does not match 'Delirious'.
