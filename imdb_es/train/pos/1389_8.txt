The Williams family lives on a ranch located in the middle of the remote desert. They are in considerable danger when the place is suddenly pushed into a vortex of time where the past, the present and the future collide in a tremendously chaotic and unpredictable way. The director John "Bud" Cardos begins the film with a fascinatingly mysterious note and gradually allows things to become stranger, crazier and more exciting as the crazy story unfolds. In addition, Cardos fills the screen with a lot of dazzling images and does a good job of creating a genuine sense of wonder and admiration. The admirably honest performance of a cast of the game qualifies as another great advantage: Jim Davis as the good patriarch Grant Williams, Dorothy Malone as his cheerful wife Ana, Christopher Mitchum as the troubled Richard, Marcy Lafferty as his charming wife Beth, Natasha Ryan as Sweet little girl Jenny and Scott C. Kolden like the brave Steve. Extravagant special effects offer an inspired combination of gnarly miniatures, orderly stop-motion animation monsters (such creatures include a thin, thin, hairless guy, a large, bulky, fangled beast, and a squalid type of lizard), and paintings Matt witty. The exciting orchestral score by Richard Band really hits the point of agitation. The sharp and sunny cinematography of John Arthur Morrill also works. A funny movie
