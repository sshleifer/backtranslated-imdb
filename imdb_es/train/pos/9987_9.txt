The story moved me a lot and as I am going through something similar with my own parents, I really connected. It is so easy to forget that someone whose body is failing was once vibrant and passionate. And then there are the mistakes they made and they have to live with them. I loved the performance of Ellen Burstyn and who is Christine Horne? She is fantastic. A real find. There is probably one of the most erotic scenes that I have seen in a movie, however, nothing was shown, it was just very well done. In general, the appearance of the film was impressive, a true emotional journey. Cole Hauser is very good in this image, humanizes a man in a downward spiral. I liked the way the filmmaker approached this woman's life, never sentimental, never too much, enough to hook us, but not enough to get stuck.
