This cute and animated short features two comic icons: Betty Boop and Henry. <br /> <br /> Henry is the bald, somewhat corpulent guy in comics who never talks. <br /> <br /> Well, here it speaks. ! <br /> <br /> He wants to get a puppy at Betty Boop's pet store, and when he forgets the store, some hilarious hijinks are produced. <br /> <br /> Betty sings a song about pets, Henry gets into a battle with birds and a monkey, but everything works in the end.
