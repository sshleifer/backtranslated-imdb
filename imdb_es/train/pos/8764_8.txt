Alice (Claire Danes) and Darlene (Kate Beckinsale) have always been best friends and, after graduating, they decide to travel to Thailand. Due to an incident, they meet a strange mysterious and attractive young man who invites them to go with him to Hong Kong over the weekend. But at the airport, Alice and Darlene are mistaken for drug heroin and sent to prison. Now is the time of maximum survival and true friendship. This was a pretty good movie, I've seen it a couple of times and after a while you realize that there are some holes in the plot, but the movie still keeps you entertained. Claire Danes did a great job as usual, she is a great actress. I would give Brokedown Palace 8/10
