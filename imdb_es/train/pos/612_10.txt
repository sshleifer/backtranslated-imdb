['This remarkable film can be summarized very easily. First, while comparisons with the &quot;promised princess&quot; are inevitable, it is almost pointless to do so. While both films combine wit and adult humor with a fairytale background, &quot;Stardust&quot; is very different from any other fantasy / science fiction movie I&#39;ve seen. It is a hybrid of those genres, but its plot and script are so unique that, along with the interpretations, special effects, cinematography and score, the final product is not so comparable to anything that has appeared in history. silver screen. Second, the score is very effective in simultaneously encouraging us to the story and the fantasy world in which it develops and drives the story while creating the just amount of admiration and emotion needed to make the magic credible inside. of the kingdom where it is. the characters exist. Third, I did not find the film remotely difficult to follow or confusing in any way. In fact, the interesting interaction between the three main subplots made it even more appealing to see. Melted wonderfully, and acted magnificently in all areas. This fantasy adventure (with elements of science fiction) was the best I&#39;ve seen since &quot;The Return of the King&quot; (not that I&#39;m comparing the two). Granted, it&#39;s not that easy to summarize, but do not let any crude and / or ruthless and cynical criticism or the film&#39;s pathetic public relations prevent you from participating in the best moment you can have at the movies this summer (or possibly even in a long time)!']
