] Have not you seen this movie? You have not even heard about this movie? I would not be surprised One of the few truly "independent" films produced in the last ten years, no studio had faith in the image and was never picked up for a major distribution. The independent company Kino Films gave BOESMAN AND LENA a very limited career with almost no promotion, and most of the major film critics did not even bother to review it. I suppose that a film based on an act, a play about apartheid and its effect on two people never had an opportunity in the current market, and it is the loss of the intelligent film lover. <br /> <br /> For the record, both Angela Bassett and Danny Glover deserved Ocsar's nominations (as did the director of photography) but the film received so little fanfare that I can not even blame the academy for that. This is a challenging, stimulating and heartbreaking film, and in fact it requires the audience to find it on their own terms. Keeping that in mind, it's definitely not a movie for meaningless entertainment. Director John Berry wisely does not try to disguise the work of Athol Fugard. Sure, they give us some fractured flashbacks and some impressive stage shots, but the film version of BOESMAN AND LENA is still, in general, a story of two people living in inhumane conditions. <br /> <br /> Stripped of their basic human rights, Boesman (Glover) and Lena (Bassett) have no one else to attack but the other. A third character joins them for a while (Willie Jonah, unbelievable in a largely silent role), but the focus of the film never deviates from the title characters and what they have become. Bassett and Glover give brave performances as the broken couple, performances that simply could not be improved. BOESMAN AND LENA deserve to be rediscovered from home videos, vigorously and brutally stimulating, both intellectually and emotionally. Undoubtedly, the best movie of the year 2000.
