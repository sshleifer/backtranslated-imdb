"Foxes" is a movie I remember because of its portrait of teenagers in the late 70s. Since I'm exactly the age of Jodie Foster, I got involved with this movie. It deals with the frustrations, temptations, relationships and rebellion of young people. The soundtrack is great with inspiring rock, for example. "More than a feeling" from Boston and sad numbers like "On the radio" by Donna Summer. The music of my adolescence. Yes, I will always remember this, even if it was not huge.
