This is your standard musical comedy of the 30s, with a great advantage that it has some well-known actors of the 30s in a funny little publication. <br /> <br /> There's not much in the story and basically the movie is all about its kind of fun and 'carefree' environment, with a touch of typical Hal Roach comedy. It seems to be a "Cinderella story", but I certainly did not think it that way while watching the movie. The story is much confused in the narrative, which presents many different characters and also a small appearance of cameo, when the main characters come to Hollywood studios. <br /> <br /> Of course, the highlight of the movie is when Laurel & Hardy makes an appearance and shows some of her routines. It's like watching a movie and falling short with Laurel & Hardy for free. In addition, the usual Laurel & Hardy, Walter Long, appears in the routine and James Finlayson (no mustache this time) as director of the short film. <br /> <br /> It is certainly true that all subplots and comedies distract from the main plot and character, but in this case there is no problem, as it is much more fun and interesting to watch than the main plot and the typical shallow main character. <br /> <br /> The movie is without a doubt. it is not worse than any of his other genre films of the same period of time, although the classification here suggests otherwise. <br /> <br /> 7/10
