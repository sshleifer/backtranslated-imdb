He was probably one of the few Australians who did not watch tennis when this series aired. I have to say that when William McInnes first appeared, that is a fucking actor! But as the series continued, it lessened his performance and I loved him completely. He was such a bad guy but he made me laugh. I watched the program to see Hugo Speers (Heart and Bones, The Full Monty) and Tom Long (SeaChange, Two Hands). It was interesting to see Speers play a nice, quiet man, and even more interesting to see the undulating muscles of Tom Longs! I sigh ... Seriously, Long's performance was a total shock and really brilliant. He stole the show. Martin Sacks was also good in a small role, and the main actress presented an entertaining performance. I would recommend this program if you enjoy the stories with a twist and watching Tom Long walk without a shirt ...
