This was a very original decent movie and a brave move for everyone involved. I do not care if it is not the best organized movie of all time, the fact that Eddie Murphy is doing something that is not a formula and that I do not know what will happen next, makes it one of my favorites. . I wish more films were as imaginative as this one, instead of the same old formula for entertainment.
