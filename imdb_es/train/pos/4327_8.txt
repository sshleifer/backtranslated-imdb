I like this presentation, I've read Bleak House and I know it's as difficult to present the whole book as it should be, and even others like Little Dorrit. I must admit that they did a very good show with the staged Nicholas Nickelby. I love Diana Rigg and I could see the pain of Lady Dedlock, even through the expected arrogance of the aristocracy. I'm sorry, I think she's the best Lady Dedlock ... I'm not sure who could have made a better Jarndyce, but I'm fine with Mr. Elliott. It is not easy to present these extensive Dickens books. Oliver Twist would be easier. This is long, and if you do not mind, all legal situations can be boring or boring. I think this presentation is entertaining enough not to be boring. I loved Mr. Smallweed, he can be entertaining. There is always a child. Jo will break your heart here ... I think we should have the opportunity to judge for ourselves ... <br /> <br /> I have to say that I loved the program. Maybe if I read the book again, as I usually do, after seeing the movie, maybe I can be more critical. Meanwhile, I think it's a good presentation.
