I saw it last night with low expectations. The reasons are that, in general, I do not like movies "made for television" and I have rarely liked "cast reunion" movies. But, the critic in the Los Angeles Times seemed to like this, so I gave it a try. I am happy to have done it. It was pretty good. Adam West and Burt Ward meet as themselves. But, in a way, they were acting like their "Batman and Robin". They were being campers and they did not take themselves, or this movie too seriously. The movie begins with them looking for the Batmobile designed by "George Barris", which someone stole before being auctioned for the home of an orphan. While they are looking for the car, they also remember the series they did together. This is said in flashback. It was well done. The actors they got, for young Burt Ward and Adam West, were dead. And, for a television movie, he focused on the reality of his actual behavior on and off the screen. I give this one 9/10, I liked it a lot.
