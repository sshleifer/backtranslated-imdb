I loved seeing this. I had no idea that it was part of a larger series. I must have been around 6 years old when I was on television. I just thought it was fun and, for some reason, I felt a deep fascination with something that was clearly in the President's bath tub. My parents had recorded this from television when it was originally broadcast on NBC. The tape even had the old Sanka coffee commercial along with some others. I am planning to return home soon and I will try to record the tape on my computer so that those who want a copy can do so. If any of you would like to contact me, I think you can do it through the IMDb site, feel free. I will keep you informed and I will let you know when I have the program in digital format.
