My school's theater club will put on this show in the spring of 2002, and I can only hope we are as good as this! Recently I saw this movie as a kind of "research" of my role (Rosie Alvarez), and I would like to say that Vanessa Williams is the best. <br /> <br /> Wow! The casting of this movie was correct (with one exception). Jason Alexander, oh my God, is there something he can not do? It was the most wonderful Albert Peterson of all time. I loved all your funny facial expressions and the dancing during "Put your face happy!" He is so big! Vanessa Williams, as I said before, is the coolest. She was a beautiful Rosie, and her transition from secretary to seductress was totally believable. Tyne Daly was very funny as the hateful mother of Albert and George Wendt was magnificent as the annoying Mr. McAfee (however, I LOVED the performance of Paul Lynde in the 1963 version!). Brigitta Dau raised me as Ursula Merkle; She really stopped him! And Marc Kudisch was an amazing Conrad Birdie ... "Suffer!" <br /> <br /> There was only one cast that I did not understand, and, as you will see in the previous comments, many other people did not. I do not understand Chynna Phillips as Kim McAfee, what was that? I mean, she's really pretty and very talented, but ... she seems a bit old for the role. Hey, maybe I'm delirious. <br /> <br /> Well, anyway, I recommend this movie. It will leave you smiling! <br /> <br />
