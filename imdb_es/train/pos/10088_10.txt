Elephant Walk (1954) Starring an old Peter Finch as lord of the mansion in some plantation abandoned by God where there is always the danger that the elephants or the English madmen stay in the midday sun and go crazy. Well, eventually they do, after the outbreak of typhoid fever or cholera, of course, and there's a lot of chaos. Taylor replaced a sick Vivien Leigh in this boiler / adventure movie. When the elephants assault the house and trap Liz on the grand staircase, I still have goose bumps. Thank God, Dana Andrews is close to save the day. One of my favorite guilty pleasures. In color too!
