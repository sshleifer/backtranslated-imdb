Although Kris Kristofferson is good at this role, who would not want to see Elvis Pressly instead? With addiction to drugs and the fall of supreme fame may have scared Elvis' agent from being part of the movie, it was a mistake. This would have been a perfect movie for Elvis. Although the soundtrack is far from excellent, Paul Williams and Barbra Streisand do a decent job in creating an original soundtrack for this "period" piece / musical. Something from a love story, this is more a drama about the fall of grace and the gift of redemption. As it is the majority of the tragedies, the hero of the story was to die. In addition, Gary Busey is once again perfect in a not so perfect role.
