I was in France, around March 5, and I love going to these film festivals. I knew about Cinémas d'Amérique Latine de Toulouse, but I've never been to see her. I decided to go and then I caught Zero and they go 4. <br /> <br /> The movie is awesome. It did not impact me as much as the Mexican users, because it was subtitled in French, but it's still shocking. <br /> <br /> This film is a satire on urban violence, kidnapping and crime in the streets. in Mexico. It is a crude portrait of the city. From a metropolis. Secuestro Express, with an impressive Mia Maestro, which was also a satire of kidnappings, almost, but with a more serious tone, and I think so, something like a connection with Cero and van 4. A kind of redemption story and that How much is too much? Man on Fire, which was incredibly strong, was not a satire, but a crude portrait of the streets of Mexico. Or it's like the brave one. A movie that hits you and hits you in the bowels very hard. This is like the usual suspects, it has some twists and turns in the plot, but that makes it even more believable. Verdict: a movie that surprises and makes you believe that there is no security on the streets. Awesome dialogue, awesome direction and amazing performances. Zero and van 4 is a movie that you will not soon forget. It leaves you shaking and dazed.
