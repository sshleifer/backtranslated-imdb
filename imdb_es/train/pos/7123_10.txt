Sometimes I watch a movie and it impresses me a lot. and even then it's not easy to explain why I liked it so much. This is mainly true for unusual movies? The ones that one can hardly compare with the rest. Good evening, Mr. Tom is one of these special movies. Is there much emotion in that movie? and the performance was so good that while watching the movie, I cried and laughed as the story progressed. The young Nick Robinson ?? is a boy (William) evacuated from London due to air attacks during World War II. Mr. Tom played by John Thaw is an old man who leaves the town to which the evacuated children were sent. <br /> <br /> At first, Tom refuses to take on any responsibility, such as caring for a troubled young man. But he accepts now that he has no choice. During the stay, Mr. Tom discovers how horrible life has been for William. Along with her luggage, did her mother send a belt and written instructions to her son's host? Do not hesitate to use it. This belt is berried in the field? Never be used in such a brutal way. Mr. Tom provides a real home for William, and the boy is happy with his new life, goes to school, makes new friends and discovers hidden talents. Suddenly, a letter from William is called her home in London with a letter that mentions that she does not feel well and that she begins again. Only this time it gets much worse? Are there many feelings that you can feel in this movie? Love, fear, sadness, happiness, pain, hope? and much more. Good evening, Mr. Tom is another masterpiece of British cinema comparable only to others like Dear Frankie and Billy Elliot. If one is to compare. I have really enjoyed watching it and I highly recommend it. Before finishing this review, I would also like to mention the great performance of Thomas Orange in the role of Zac. It reminded me of a friend of mine from my own childhood (:
