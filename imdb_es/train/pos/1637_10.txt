I love this movie and I've seen it several times over the years. It gets better with every visualization. I agree with all the positive reviews here. Yes, it is gritty and brutally realistic as life on the prairie was in those days. I found myself making comments while looking at him. Someone here said that Rip Torn was a mistake. I could not disagree more. He is brilliant as the stern and miserable Clyde Stewart who says little and works like a slave / work horse. Conchatta Farrell is fantastic as widow Elinor, whom Clyde hires as housekeeper / cook (along with her 7-year-old daughter). Lilia Skala is excellent as a distant neighbor called grandma. Also a star is the raw prairie of Montana. It is a country both beautiful and brutal to settle down. There are some scenes that are both repulsive and necessary. There are no special effects here, what you see is real! He even has a tremendously perfect musical score and a great script. Once you see Heartland, you will never forget it. It deserves all the 10s that arrives here.
