Prince plays 'the Kid' in this semi-autobiographical film of a talented but narcissistic young musician who has a less than stellar family life. It is true that the performance leaves much to be desired (except Morris Day and especially Clarence Williams, both with a perfect tone), but the film is still excellent and is among the best of the eighties. It has the best soundtrack of ANY movie of the last 50 years, at least, highly citable lines, and the scene of the garbage container is HILARIAUS! Also, Apollonia is simply stunning. In an unrelated, when I saw Prince at a concert in 2004, he flew through the stadium. He's an expert showman and it was one of the best concerts I've ever experienced. <br /> <br /> My degree: A <br /> <br /> DVD extras: Disc 1) Comment with Director Albert Magnoli, Producer Robert Cavallo, and Director of Photography Donald Thorin; Theatrical trailer; Trailers for album 2 "Under the Cherry Moon" and "Grafitti Bridge") 12 minutes at First Avenue Club; "Purple Rain: Bachstage Pass (a half-hour presentation in the movie that I'll see later on his page);" Riffs, Raffs, and Revolution: The Impact and Influence of Purple Rain, "a 10 minute presentation, 30 minutes of the MTV Images premiere (when MTV did not suck the donkey balls), 5 Prince music videos (Let's Go Crazy , Take Me With You, When Doves Cry, I Would Die 4 U / Baby I'm a Star and Purple Rain), 2 Videos of The Time (Jungle Love and The Bird) and a music video of "Sex Shooter" by Apollonia 6 <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Apollonia shows her fine ass tits
