** possible spoilers ** <br /> <br /> I like this movie and I have no problem keeping awake. It reminds me of myself at 20, except that this is even better. As Veronica says, two girls at a time. It highlights the tenderness in me, the informal conversation, these two real-life girls, instead of prostitutes, making fun of us every step of the way. I get into conversations too. Even if they are absolutely b.s. sometimes, so what? Almost all the girls I've talked to and who are on top of themselves are usually full of the same unrestrained and irrational self-centered free b.s. philosophy. It's just a lot of nonsense, and as sensible as the others b.s. Philosophy chicks are often in: astrological charts. The only deal with this movie is that the boy is almost as feminine as the women, he is in the same b. and bad mood. The brunette girl is actually the most masculine person that exists. <br /> <br /> I think it's kind of funny that the brunette girl gets so obviously turned on by Veronica. He would love to take Alexander's little blonde away, but Veronica plays her all the time. She's brilliant. Get the brunette to think there's something between them, and then steal the child-boy / man, which is appropriate since they seem to be from the same age group. The brunette knows she has had until the end, when she drops her face to the palms of her hands while Marlene Deitrich sings to the bottom that, paraphrasing, there are a million couples in Paris tonight, but I only have this refrain. <Br /> <br /> But do they get married in the end, Alex and Veronica? MMM? I can only imagine a super tumultuous relationship that ends in a break before marriage. They are too selfish to be something like rungs. <br /> <br /> Although I like the movie. It kept me entertained, it looks nice and it's sexy.
