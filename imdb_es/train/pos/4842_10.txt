If the very idea of ​​Arthur Askey twists your guts, do not worry, you can still see and love The Ghost Train, like the equally wonderful Back Room Boy, is a movie that is simply too good for one person to sink into. The performance, even that of the main actor. Personally, I love Askey, maybe it's because I enter his world, instead of waiting for him to enter mine, which is a mistake that many people make. The phantom train is so intensely atmospheric that you could not possibly see it without being amazed at the deep, dark world in which it transports you, it is immersive in a way that few cheap and cheerful flaggers managed to be during the desperate start. '40 and it's a movie that I imagine that few people have ever seen for the first time. The cast is, without exception, extraordinarily good, maybe Linden Travers makes it a little thick, but with the backdrop of a lonely train station in times of war, she could hardly touch a fool and not excel. The sad demise of the lovely Carole Lynne earlier this year broke the last link we had with this incredible movie and now it's really in the past, but patiently waiting for us to press Play.
