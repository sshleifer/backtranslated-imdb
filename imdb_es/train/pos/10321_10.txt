Most people miss Hollywood's point of view. If a hero can stimulate heroic actions in the mind of a child, within the limits of the law, then I approve of the lessons taught by Doc Savage. <br /> <br /> In all times of conflict or war, the public and government look for heroes to decorate. The film industry takes the heroes to the screen for people to identify themselves, such as Doc Savage, James Bond, Superman, Batman, Spiderman and others. Doc Savage is remembered by more than one generation as "the best of the best" before James Bond, Superman or any of the others. All the others that follow Doc Savage are only a part of the character, not the "Bronze Man".
