['Wonderful cult film from 1979 in which the students of Vince Lombardi High School face a new dictatorial director called Miss Togar (Mary Woronov). Togar hates music and blames students&#39; musical tastes for their transgressions. Riff Randell (PJ Soles), the Ramones fan and Ramones fan, who most of all wants the rock group to record their songs, is the leader of it. <br /><br /> Now * this * is an impossible movie to resist. First of all, the soundtrack is incredible, with songs by artists like Alice Cooper and Velvet Underground, as well as the infectious variety of Ramones songs. &quot;Teen Lobotomy&quot;, &quot;Sheena is a punk rocker&quot; and &quot;Blitzkrieg Bop&quot; are just some of them. Then the cast really gives it their all, with Soles an ideal choice for the role of Riff; She is a true delight. Vincent Van Patten and Dey Young are sincere like Tom and Kate, Woronov is well against the guy like the smug and scornful Togar, Clint Howard has one of his best parts as an Eaglebauer businessman who occupies the bathroom, and New World clients like Dick Miller. , Paul Bartel (particularly funny as music teacher Mr. McGree) and The Real Don Steele are fun as always. And, of course, it&#39;s a pleasure to see the Ramones playing themselves. <br /><br /> The movie has real spirit. The level of energy is high, with the author and director of the story, Allan Arkush, who brought great talent to the process. There is also a great sense of humor. The gag of the paper plane is a great example of this. This extends to the &quot;erase&quot; style of scene transitions. There are even hilarious giant mice created by the remarkable effects of future makeup Rob Bottin, in one of his first concerts. <br /><br /> As good as a movie that defends authority, the right to party can be defended. &quot;Rock &#39;n&#39; Roll High School&quot; is, simply, a wonderful cult movie. <br /><br /> 8/10']
