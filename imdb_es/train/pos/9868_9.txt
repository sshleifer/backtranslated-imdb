Obviously, this is aimed at the same market as Monsters Inc and Shrek, but it is different in its less caricatural feel (despite the deliberately caricatural characteristics of the leading creatures). The story is not one that had a massive moral in his face at the end (it's more like pulling the sleeves of his shirt), but he only chooses to tell a story about the relationships between different "animals". You know the result, but you can not avoid being attracted to it. <br /> <br /> The characters themselves are much more than their voices (the advantage of the less famous actors who make the voices), unlike most Disney movies. They are well round and completely believable, strangely. The group dynamics are brilliantly well presented and the revelations and peculiarities of the characters are subtle and pleasant. You will find yourself encouraging them much earlier than you would like to think. <br /> <br /> The animation is brilliant, as you would expect, and you will pray for the opportunity to participate in the ice slide in the film. You will fall in love with the characters, especially the comic relief of the prehistoric squirrel and their desperate attempts to bury their nuts. I left wanting the obligatory merchandise, especially the lazy toy, only to disappoint me the next day when I could not find anything vaguely related. <br /> <br /> What, strangely enough, makes the film even more pure. <br /> <br /> Better than Monsters Inc or Shrek.
