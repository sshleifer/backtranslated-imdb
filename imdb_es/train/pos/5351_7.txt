Although this movie is a bit full of cheese eighty, I have a place for her on my DVD shelf and I do not know why. I think I like it because the moral of the story is that "television is trash, so turn it down and go get a life". For those of you who decide to pay attention to the message, then you should try to read the book, it does not look like the movie at all. To ruin it for you at the end of the story, a mortally wounded Richards ends up crashing a plane against the network building, killing himself, all in and shutting down the network at the same time. I read it many years ago, but today it would be difficult not to compare it with September 11.
