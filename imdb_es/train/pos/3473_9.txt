I admit that I had some uneasiness when I first saw the progress of this film. Was VH-1 standing on hollow ground here? I mean, Harris and Quinn do not really look, they do not even sound like John or Paul. But I must admit that this movie really surprised me. It is far from the exploitation film I expected. Instead, it is a study of characters, a discreet, capricious and, ultimately, bittersweet to friendship and the last lesson we all learn: it is difficult, if not impossible, to capture what we once had and what has past.
