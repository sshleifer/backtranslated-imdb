Jeff Wincott is not just a Hunk, he can kick his ass! This movie has some of the best martial arts moves I've seen in a long time. Well, maybe Bridgette Nielson is not the first person I'd hire to play a ruthless politician. However, he did a GREAT job! And let's not forget that Wincott has a partner in this movie played by Karen Sheperd, an expert in martial arts. So she's not Cynthia Rothrock, who cares? She is so good, if not better! (Just check out his fight scene at the end of the movie, one word: OUCH!). My suggestion would be to buy this movie as soon as possible, because if you have not seen it, you are really missing some martial arts action.
