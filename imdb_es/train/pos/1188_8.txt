Initially I had doubts about this movie (just for the theme), but the richly drawn characters, the fabulous scenes of the buffalo hunt and the dramatic conclusion make it worth seeing. Initially I had trouble distinguishing between the two buffalo hunters, but as the film progressed, they became more and more distinct. The final scene still haunts me.
