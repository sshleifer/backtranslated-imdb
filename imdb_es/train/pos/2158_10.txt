I do not like "ratings inflation", but I had to give it a 10. I can not think of anything that I did not like. I saw it last night and today I woke up thinking about it. I am sure that the new Hollywood version of which they spoke to me, with J Lo and Richard Gear, will be excellent, but this original Japanese version of 1996 was so emotional and stimulating for me that I find it hard to think. in any way that could be improved, or change its configuration to a different culture. <br /> <br /> A story that I found worth seeing, and with scenes of punches or guns firing or something like that! Imagine that! <br /> <br /> All the characters seemed well developed, ... even the non-primary characters had a good character development and a nice performance, and the casting seemed very appropriate. <br /> <br /> It is always difficult to find a good movie-musical in our days, and maybe this does not qualify (there is a lot of learning to dance, but not singing) but I really think that Gene Kelly and others who defended a place for the dance in our lives they would have thought very well about this movie and the role of dancing to help tell a story about a middle-aged man, successful with a family in Japan, looking for something ... he does not know exactly what. <br /> <br /> To the team of people in Japan who contributed this film, thank you for creating it and doing it.
