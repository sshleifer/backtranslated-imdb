The inspiring story of Carl Brashear (Cuba Gooding, Jr.), a black man who grew up in poverty in Kentucky and then joined the US Navy. UU., Aspiring to be the first black Master Diver in the history of the Navy. We are shown the series of struggles since childhood in which Brashear has to overcome to make his dream come true (and then keep it alive). The main challenge was not the Master Diver Bill Sunday (Robert DeNiro), the head coach of the diving school to which the Navy sends Brashear, who does not particularly sympathize with Brashear's objectives, but which ultimately becomes an unlikely friend and supporter. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie; Fast-paced and with lots of action, although it is not an image of "action" in the normal sense of the word. There is also a very human story here, and an interesting study of racism and the struggle to overcome it; There is also a sense of the struggle that took place in the 1960s between the oldest and the youngest naval officers (the "old navy" versus the "new navy"). The performances are quite good, especially those of Goodings. I thought that DeNiro was perhaps a little exaggerated in his interpretation of Sunday (although, who knows, Sunday might well have been this extreme type of loose cannon) and the representation of Sunday's wife, Gwen (by Charlize Theron) also made me question if these parties were "encouraged" to provide entertainment value. <br /> <br /> However, a good movie. I never wondered if it was worth tuning in. <br /> <br /> 7/10
