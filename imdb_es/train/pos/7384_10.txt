Whoopi was the only reason why I saw the Oscars that year. She is hilarious. Of course there was an important serious side to the show. She was great not only because it's fun, but because she said some things that needed to be said in a public forum. The whites should be reminded that the ceremonies, employment and representation of Hollywood awards are out of racial balance. There should be no need for "black" awards shows. Judges and judges of white bread, of milquetoast, should take their heads to the sunlight and see that the great material is not limited to directors, producers, actors, etc. "white" Allowing Woody Allen to go on the air was the depth of bad taste. It did not have to be there. The fact is that this is the first presentation of an Oscar I've seen since "The Color Purple" was awarded. That miscarriage of voting made me bitter to see the programs until 2002. Which is not to denigrate other presenters. Billy Crystal is a riot.
