Vanilla Sky is a remake of the 1997 film Abre Los Ojos (Open Your Eyes). And in my opinion, a much more human and emotional version. Tom Cruise plays David Aames, a selfish egotist who takes the emotions of other people for granted and only thinks of himself. Jason Lee plays Brian Shelby, David's best, and in many ways, just a friend. Penelope Cruz plays Sof√≠a Serrano, Brian's girlfriend who accompanies him to David's birthday party. Cameron Diaz plays Julie Gianni, David's occasional bed partner. Kurt Russell plays Dr. Curtis McCabe, a psychologist who interviews David. All their interactions, and the consequences of them, make Vanilla Sky one of the most emotional and complex thrillers ever made. I will not explain more of the plot, because it is much more convincing, less you know. Ignore all the people who call this film too confusing to follow. If you pay attention, you will not be confused. The movie is very complex, but not confusing. And in my opinion, one of the best movies that have been made.
