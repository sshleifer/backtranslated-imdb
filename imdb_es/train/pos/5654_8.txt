I saw the show 10 years ago and I loved it! Now I'm in possession of the DVD and I was watching the series, and waiting for the scenes I knew were on the show (when Lucas confronts Gail at home) and I realized that it was missing, I was suddenly watching the seduction without the advantage. above. Then I logged in to review the entire BIOS of the stars and found the comments that the programs were out of service. Thank you!!!!! But there seems to be some conflict. Some comments say "Strangler number 19 and then Triangle 20, when another had them in reverse, and also Potate Boy 5 and Dead to the World 6 were also reversed. Can anyone clarify ?????
