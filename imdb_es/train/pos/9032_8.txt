Maybe it's not the most original way to tell a story, we've seen all this in many movies ... but, anyway, I really liked October Sky. He got something, a great direction and a good performance from all parties, especially Laura Dern (the teacher) and Chris Cooper (the father). I want to be a rocket engineer! :)
