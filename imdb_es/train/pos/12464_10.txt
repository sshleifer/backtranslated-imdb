Noni Hazlehurst, Colin Friels, Alice Garner, Chrissie Amphlett and Michael Caton. What more could you want? Monkey Grip, based on the award-winning novel of the same name, explores Nora (Hazlehurst, a single mother who falls in love with a heroin addict Jobe (Friels).) A simple story is made truly extraordinary through the magnificent performance (in particular Noni Hazlehurst) and good use of the small budget.The only flaw is (if you can pick it up) is that the story takes place in Melbourne, although for budgetary reasons, the film was filmed mainly in Sydney, so, in a few scenes Trams (scenes from Melbourne) and then a Carlton post office (scenes from Sydney.) Apart from that, "Monkey Grip" is a must see (excuse the clique, but it is) at least for an award-winning performance of " Play School "and host of" Better Homes & Gardens "Noni Hazlehurst. <br /> <br /> 10/10
