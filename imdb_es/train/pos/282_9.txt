This is without a doubt the most terrifying game I have played. It's not the average type of shots of everything that moves (which usually does not matter to me), but the acceptable gfx, interesting weapons and magic, excellent surround effects ("Scryeeee, scryeeee ..") and more incredible atmosphere. I love the Scrye, which allows you, in certain places of the games, to see or hear events that happened there in the past. The only game I had to take regular breaks after a few minutes of play just because of the intensity of the atmosphere. I'm a big fan of terror, especially the Clive Barker stories and movies, and participating in a horror story like this makes me crave more games that emphasize the atmosphere and a more immersive story. 9/10 (-1 because I'm not a fan of the fps, and maybe the game was a bit short?)
