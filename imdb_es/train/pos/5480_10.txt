This is a great movie, it shows what our government will do to other countries if we do not like their government. This is not as bad as what Reagan and Bush did, the number one in South America, but EE. UU He still has no problems with other countries like this. This movie also proves that the US media is launching government propaganda. This is exactly what they did to Aristide in Haiti. The reason why this coup against Ch치vez was not successful was that Ch치vez was elected with more than 90% of the votes. <br /> <br /> This movie is not just a political documentary, it would still be a great movie if it were. a drama, it is amazing that this is real. <br /> <br /> The other critic lies when he says "Ch치vez seizes the waves", the private media runs propaganda against Ch치vez all the time.
