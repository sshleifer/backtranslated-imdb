Nothing revolutionary here; simply an impeccable and elegant cinema. <br /> <br /> GARDE A VUE is almost exclusively confined to a monotonous police station, and mainly to an interrogation room, but the director Claude Miller (who made the wonderful film THIS SWEET SICKNESS, among others) the intercalates They evoke flashes of the exterior paintings as a minimalist locale scenography. Miller's moderation, especially at the beginning, is impressive, and his exquisite handling of the interior staging, therefore, fundamental, allows a captivating visualization. <br /> <br /> Lino Ventura is excellent as always, managing to legitimize a character. That, on paper, is a clich√©: the laconic, hard, tired homicide detective of the world. Ventura lives the role, making it completely credible, although the script allows us little access to its internal functioning; The film ends at the same moment that it seems that he will be forced to face his failure for the first time. <br /> <br /> Michel Serrault is equal to the task as the presumed killer of children who astutely struggles with the sole mind of flic The exchanges between the two are more often than not full of tension and the aura of a field of game in constant metamorphosis for a battle of ingenuity. The character of Serrault is, in turn, deplorably haughty, cunning and pitiful; then later ... <br /> <br /> The "message" of GARDE A VUE, if one looks for one, is a condemnation of the police methodology and the kind of pressures that make a policeman to be too jealous of it is necessary to close the cases at the expense of justice. For most of its duration, the film shines as nothing more than an example of how to turn a potentially soporific scenario into a suspenseful drama of the highest cinematic economy. <br /> <br />
