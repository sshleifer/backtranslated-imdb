All Dogs Go to Heaven is a movie that I've always liked. When I was a kid, I used to see this every two days. It is underestimated if you look at the IMDb rating and the comments of many people in general. This is not a bad movie as many say, it's a very good movie. This is good and your children probably like it. Although it is classified as G, some parents may find this a bit violent. Actually, it's a rather dark story, where dogs are similar to gangsters involved in the game, extortion and even cold-blooded murder. The film follows a dog named Charlie who had escaped the pound, is killed by his old friend, goes to heaven, but ends up returning to earth. Many younger children who watch this movie can feel as if they are watching a movie about big kids. <br /> <br /> There are some scenes that can scare small children, but I'm sure they will do well. Every time I watch this movie, it reminds me of when I was a little boy. I'm sure everyone has a movie that reminds them when they were younger, this is the movie that makes me feel that way. The performances of Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise are great, and this is the last film in which was a girl named Judith Barsi. Unfortunately, she was murdered at an early age, which is a shame because she had a lot of potential and she did not. You deserve what happened. Now that I know your story, I can no longer see this movie in the same way because your voice sounds so sad. <br /> <br /> The animation in this movie is excellent, the voice work is excellent, and the story is good, but a little different from many other movies for children. This was popular at the time of its release, but was overtaken by Disney's popular mega, The Little Mermaid. This is a film that is not also conceived by adults, but if you are a child, or if you grew up with this movie when you were a child, I am sure you will enjoy watching it.
