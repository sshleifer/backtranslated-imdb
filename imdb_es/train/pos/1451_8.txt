I've seen this movie about 6 times. And every time I see it, I am more impressed by the story and the acting. It's like seeing a train that gets moving. It is subtle in its approach, but very effective in achieving its objective. <br /> <br /> Spoilers-> At the center of the story there is a very good dichotomy. On the one hand, we have the Deputy Mayor, Eddy Calhoun (Cusack), who unknowingly tears the old boys' network that forms the heart of the commander of the New York Administration and, on the other hand, we have the Mafia boss, Zappati, who is deliberately trying to maintain the status quo by all necessary means. This situation culminates very well in the end when Zappati orders Alselmo to make it easy for himself by killing himself and Calhoun ordering Pappas to do the same, politically speaking. <br /> <br /> The movie also contains some really cool phrases. like (a personal weakness of mine): - It does not summarize the life of a man in a moment - The only new thing in this world is the story that he does not know <br /> <br /> In short, a great movie that deserves a qualification much higher
