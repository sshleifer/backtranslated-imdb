This movie is an absolute classic for the camp. That's why it was a classic Elvira and MST3000. Everyone knows the story. The scientist keeps his girlfriend's head alive in a pan of lasagna in his basement while he walks around the city and tries to find a corpse by checking the local girls. Finally, find a real hourglass body with the head of a girl with scars on top. The severed head befriends the failed experiment in the closet and the head of the cone comes out of the closet and rips off the "good" arm that remains for the assistant (the other is not correct due to the previous failure of a scientist), and all the place burns. <br /> <br /> The movie scared us as much as children that my friend would not go to his basement for a year after seeing it. As children we classified the most terrifying movies of all time and this was number four. Only one of those scary movies was really good (the original "The Haunting".) <br /> <br /> I had to give this movie a rating of seven for the huge amount of entertainment value it offers. Its spooky effect due to the production of shit and the strange sexual angle when the scientist looks for the bodies (complete with the soundtrack of porn) scares innocent children, while the ridiculous aspects make it a primary material to watch and talk about. laugh. I could watch this movie tonight and enjoy it while I prefer to go to the dentist to see "Chicago" again. <br /> <br /> Seven is the most I can give you, because your entertainment value is mere luck. The movie, like the cinema, is a disaster.
