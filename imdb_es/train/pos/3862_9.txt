As I am always looking for something new and unique, I saw this movie online. I thought it would just be another "B" movie, but I was surprised by the performance of the two main characters. All the actors in this film were very capable and well directed. The plot was wonderful and unique, as well as an excellent moral for the story. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely not for someone looking for a sexual romp, "Dumb and Dumber" or blood and guts. This is a wonderfully moving film that shows some grim realities of life, coupled with the kindness of the human heart and the frivolity enough to keep it interesting. <br /> <br /> I would prefer this movie to many "A" movies. I have even seen a large number with high box office profits. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie.
