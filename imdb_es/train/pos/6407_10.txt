I went to this movie in a cast and crew because my friend, who is a producer in the film, invited me. Forget what you've seen in commercials, forget what you've heard, see this movie for yourself. I was more surprised than that. In a world of The Grinch, Charlies Angels, The 6TH Day, Unbreakable, here comes a worthwhile movie! Glorious scenes, wonderful cinemtrofia and a cast that you want to eat with your heart. I found that this is one of the most powerful orchestrated films of this year and rightly so. Robert Deniro deserves an Oscar nod. If you could give an oscar to everyone involved as a package, this would be the movie.
