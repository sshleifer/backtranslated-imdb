['I have to say that Higher Learning is one of the 3 best movies I&#39;ve seen in my life. He has a brilliant cast, and an equally brilliant director. Singleton shows how life in college can be. There are 3 main lines of history, skinheads, African Americans and homosexuals. All the stories intrigued me, but the one that caught my attention was the story of Kristen, who was fighting against her feelings towards another girl. The end was great. After watching the movie 25 times more, I&#39;m still crying. I would have given this movie an 11, but I have to settle for 10/10.']
