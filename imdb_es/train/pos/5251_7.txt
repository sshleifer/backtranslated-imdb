Well, "Wayne's world" has been gone for a long time and the years that have passed since then have been difficult for the films to be shot. from movie spoils like "It's Pat" to the recent 80-minute yawn, "A Night at the Roxbury," many have undoubtedly lost faith that any other snl skit will make a successful transition to the silver screen. so do not be afraid because Tim Meadows is pouring out. the well-written plot keeps the audience's interest until the end and, while remaining faithful to the character of Leon Phelps introduced in the five-minute sketch, the story allows the character to develop. The humor (which consists largely of sexual jokes) is fresh and interesting and made me laugh more than ever in any recent movie. It's a great time if you do not feel like taking yourself seriously. Tiffany-Amber Thiessen of the fame "Saved by the Bell" makes an appearance in the film and it looks amazing. Finally, Billy Dee Williams, reliving his Colt 45 days, gives the film a touch of class. and for those who are fans of the movie like me, they will find that this movie is eminently quotable, "ooh, it's a lady!"
