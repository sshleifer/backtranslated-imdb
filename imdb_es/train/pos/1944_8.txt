This is an excellent movie about the characters in a swimming class for adults, their problems, relationships and interactions between them. It should have achieved a wider distribution, since it is much better than similar films from important studios at the same time. <br /> <br /> The swimming instructor is almost olympic, reduced to the teaching of basic lessons for adults and, often, the horndogging objective of his students. Try, more or less, to defend against them, with variable results. <br /> <br /> Student characters are the mainstream of the US. UU teachers, police officers, university students and retirees, all of whom have not learned to swim for any reason. The film covers their relationships, including friends, family and romantic conquests as they pass through the class. Several subplots provide fun fodder, which includes a teacher who is getting divorced, some high school students making a documentary and a girl who is only in class to meet boys. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie for dating, or just one to see when you're in the mood for a romantic drama with reality tones.
