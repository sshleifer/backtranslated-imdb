WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS deserves to be a better known film directed by Otto Preminger, the man who gave the world LAURA. And this time, he has the same stars: DANA ANDREWS and GENE TIERNEY. It must be said that Tierney here is not used to a large extent, which amounts to a supporting role, while the focus is on Andrews. <br /> <br /> He is a tough and hardened cop who is used to deal with a group of thugs. in a way too vigorous until one night, accidentally, kills a man in the process of arresting him. When the suspicion falls on a taxi driver (TOM TULLY), he accepts the investigation of the murder, but begins to feel guilty because he is in love with the taxi driver's daughter (GENE TIERNEY). By the way, Tierney looks a bit too stylish for the girl he's playing here and does not seem to fit into the scrawny backers of the story. <br /> <br /> The story takes a somber turn as the investigation deepens and it is discovered that the murdered man had a silver plaque on his head for his service as a war hero. In the end, it becomes a morality story with Andrews developing an awareness of his crime. <br /> <br /> It's fascinating like black cinema with performances capable of a strong cast. A good entry into the field of noir, directed to force by Preminger and very well played by Andrews and Tierney, despite the slight distortion of his character.
