This is a great movie for the fans of McCartney and the Beatles! A splendid moment is guaranteed for all. The audience (feat to some celebrities such as Nicholson, Cuzak, Michael Douglas) is, as always, quite amazing: from young children to former campaign activists. sixties. They know the words of all the songs by heart, and some of them cry when Paul bursts into "blackbirds" "yesterday", "all my love" and all the treasures of his catalog (which, except John Lennon and Dylan, can be claim such a repertoire?). There are two particularly moving moments: <br /> <br /> -The double tribute to Lennon and Harrison: the first "here today" was performed solo (the title was included in "Tug of War" 1982 and it was his best track ), then "something" when Paul uses a ukulele. <br /> <br /> - The interpretation of "The long and winding road", a key moment, when Paul's voice cracks as he moves. Tears in the hearts that members of the tour team hold in front of the stage. <br /> <br /> I remember, in the early seventies, when people used to despise Paul. Because he was not involved in politics, as his former partner was. They had to change their minds because Paul is a committed artist: "fame is excellent because it allows charity". The film shows different aspects of the activities of Paul, an artist. Who is anything but selfish.
