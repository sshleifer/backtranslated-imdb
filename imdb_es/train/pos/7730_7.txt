If in the 90s you are adapting a book written in the 50s, establish the bloody in the 50s and not in the 90s. See, the customs and values ​​of 40 years tend not to play as well, or sound true, so far down the road. It's a simple rule that Hollywood continues to violate regularly. And that is the problem with this movie. It should have been established in the era in which it was written. You would think it would be obvious, but nooo. I worked it out, but bmacv's comment explains it quite well. I will limit my comment to Rachel Ward. It seems that she made a diet of her ass completely out of existence for this role. As a result, she looks like a crack in chemotherapy, and is as sexy as a gay leather couch in friction. I discovered that his appearance of "could die at any time" is quite disconcerting, and he played down his supposed "heat" and the "sexual tension" that the film was intended to create. Apart from that, the movie was pretty good; a 7 + of 10.
