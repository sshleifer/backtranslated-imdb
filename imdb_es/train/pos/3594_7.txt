Michelle Rodrigez was made for this movie, when I saw her for the first time in Fast and the Furious. You could say that she was a tough woman. With this film, she has not only shown her performance, but she shows no fear and is as tough as she should be in this movie. She is more of a bad girl and that's what I like about her. This film is about a girl with problems, living life as a child and having constant problems with school and family. As she becomes interested in training her siblings to be a boxer, she decides to go after her love to fight and asks the coach of her brothers to train her. Even though they do not believe that she has the potential, they can be shown to be wrong. <br /> <br /> I think this movie was a bit slow at the end, but it was well done. It shows that people can do anything, even if they think you do not have the potential. I recommend it to be seen.
