I had the pleasure of attending a screening of The Pacific and Eddy last weekend at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival. This movie caught my attention recently when I found an article about it in Jalouse magazine. It seemed interesting at the time, but nothing very exciting. Anyway, I saw it in the festival program and decided to check it. All I can say is that I was speechless when they started shooting the final credits. This is one of the most beautiful and refreshing movies I've seen in a long time. The photography, the art direction, the acting and, especially, the direction, were impeccable and impeccable. Nothing is 'explained' to you in this movie and it really makes you think. Something that the vast majority of movies today do the exact opposite. The dialogue is carefully designed and, although this script is not a wall-to-wall talk, the words of the characters are very deliberate and meaningful. <br /> <br /> It's definitely one of those movies that deserves a second visualization and the more you see that, the more things you notice. It is a very layered and intelligent film. I'm not sure when or where it's playing, but you have to definitely see it for movie enthusiasts.
