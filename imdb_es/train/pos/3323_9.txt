I got this movie about a month ago and now I'm a big fan of Drew Barrymore fans. I love a happy ending and this film gives a brilliant with the truths of the Red Sox. This is a math teacher who takes some promising kids on a math trip to a company where the successful Lindsey (Drew) shows them some information. This then leads to quotes from Ben (teacher) and Lindsey. But not everything is simple when he confesses that he is a big fan of the Red Sox. <br /> <br /> First of all, everything is fine, but then your baseball gets in the way of Lindsey's life. Everything is fine at the end and it took an opportunity for Drew to run across the field! I got it for two pounds at Blockbusters, so I was happy. If you like movies like this, I suggest you watch a little more of Drew's work as Charlie's Angels and 50 first dates or even his new movie with Hugh Grant in Music and Lyrics.
