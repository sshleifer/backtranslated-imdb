['The Bourne Ultimatum (2007) Review: After an exciting set of two, we get the final delivery. Here is my opinion: <br /><br /> The Bourne Ultimatum has it all. We have Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) in the shelter of those who know everything. He has been running for too long. This time, it ends. <br /><br /> The Bourne Ultimatum has a great plot, impressive writing, fantastic direction, suspense and some of the best actions of the summer. Matt Damon possibly delivers his best performance to date. He has the conviction and growing desire of the murderer in trouble. <br /><br /> Here there is a little intelligent humor and a good suspense. Reactions to certain events will make you laugh (in a good way) or encourage them. (or both) I heard a lot of smart laughter in the theater and a lot of applause. The audience was loving him. <br /><br /> The Bourne Ultimatum offers everything in a well wrapped gift package. All the goods and then some. This is, in my opinion, the best movie of this summer. <br /><br /> The last word: excellent conclusion. The best of the trilogy. This is how summer movie thrillers should be done. I love the Bourne trilogy.']
