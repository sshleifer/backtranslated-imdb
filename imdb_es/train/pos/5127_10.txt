['Well, I&#39;ve come a long way from Houston, but every time I see this movie, I go back to the dream of a little cowgirl to ride a day in Gilley&#39;s bull. (It burned before I was old enough to drink.) <br /><br /> If you grew up in East Texas, then you know that this movie is an accurate representation of contemporary life at that time. If you did not do it then trust me and watch the movie. Or you will join the many who love him (and at the same time, strangely rejected), or at least, you can make fun of the red collars. (There is a lot of material to mock.) This movie is not about being a PC (what it was like in the 80s) or it hides the white trash element and is honest with time and place. <br /><br /> I have to be a 10 for me!']
