I sat down to watch this movie with much restlessness and little hope. I did not think it would be possible for this film to live up to its theme. But he absolutely did, and then some. First, I must say that Jared Harris did an extraordinary job as John Lennon. Sometimes it seemed that Harris was channeling Lennon. The resemblance was often strange, and he clearly studied Lennon's gestures and vocal inflections. Aiden Quinn was quite good as McCartney, who also looked a lot like Macca, although occasionally he tripped over his Scouse accent. <br /> <br /> This work of fiction was well written and well directed. It was pure fantasy, of course, but sometimes I felt like a voyeur looking through a keyhole in this meeting. The scene on the roof was especially moving, since McCartney told Lennon what he had never heard as a child: that he was worthy and important, and that it could never be his fault that his parents abandoned him. I also enjoyed the scene in the park where the two danced with total abandon to the reggae band! <br /> <br /> My only complaint would be this: I'm not so sure that John was as caustic as him. portrayed in the film at this stage of his life. He had adapted quite well to his domestic situation, and in fact it was known that he was quite friendly when the fans approached him. Only a few years later, he was very kind when his killer approached him for the first time to ask for an autograph on the day he was killed. <br /> <br /> For the most part, this movie served to awaken those feelings again about what might have happened. I would have been if Juan had lived a little longer. I'm pretty sure the Beatles would have been together again at some point. And I'm pretty sure that Lennon and McCartney would still be friends today. <br /> <br /> Well done, VH1. I will see it again and again. <br /> <br />
