It is always sad when most viewers overlook "marginal" films like this one. "Panic" is a wonderfully compelling and moving study of a character who feels trapped in the futility of his own life. <br /> <br /> William H. Macy, like Alex, is as convincing as ever. This good actor seems to have a special talent for pulling his strings, no matter how defective his characters are; We may not always tolerate the lifestyles of the protagonists he plays, but the emotions of fear and confusion that he evokes in us are often too painful and familiar. The title, "Panic," initially seems paradoxical, given the lack of overt emotion. At one point, Alex tells his doctor that he rarely gets angry. However, as this story unfolds, it becomes increasingly evident that anger and despair, not indifference, are the driving forces behind this man's existence. <br /> <br /> More than once I remembered his performance in "Fargo". Another film strongly driven by the characters. In both "Fargo" and "Panic" we assist a middle-aged man who, in some way, seems to have become out of sync with the rest of his life. He has lost his way, and the only way back apparently seems to be through darkness. He knows he is making bad decisions, but despair overcomes self-control and common sense. <br /> <br /> Alex connects with Sarah, a 23-year-old woman (played in a mesmerizing way by Neve Campbell), whom she meets in a doctor's office. office. Thematically, this union is less coincidence, more the work of destiny. Alex feels a little comfortable being with Sarah, perhaps feeling that she is a person adrift, like him, someone who has lost himself and is floating aimlessly for the rest of his life, impotently waiting for his inevitable conclusion. <br /> <br /> Choosing films like this is a clever and compelling way for Neve Campbell to respond to critics who question her acting skills. Too often, it is the characters who have interpreted the weaknesses, which does not offer Campbell any depth to flex his acting muscles. However, this performance may be revealing to many. <br /> <br /> In a perfect film world, not only would there be many more films like "Panic", but they would also arrive and be appreciated by a much wider audience. If you watch movies for the richness and depth of the characterization, instead of just the latest cutting edge special effects, then, for you, "Panic" is a must. A +.
