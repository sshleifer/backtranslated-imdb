This movie is close to being my favorite piece of celluloid. There really is not much that I need or want to say here. Except maybe "Watch this movie" and "Enjoy the excellent work of Daniel and Pascal", which accompanies you through this careful, fun and heartbreaking story about "pass the eighth day", his own day! <br /> <br /> Watching this movie made me think seriously about how I spent my eighth day = my life! It seems that some of us are wasting precious time doing things we think we should do. Whether it's a nice race or simply consume TV shows and ball games. What we often overlook is the satisfaction of being something for another person: making a difference. About taking space and time to be spontaneous and live - NOW! (on the eighth day) ... At least that's what I got from "The eighth day".
