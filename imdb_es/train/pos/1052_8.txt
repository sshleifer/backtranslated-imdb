A remarkable documentary about the historical achievements of the Association of Women Lawyers (WLA) of Kumba, in southwestern Cameroon, in the legal protection of the rights of women and children from acts of domestic violence. In this Muslim culture, where men have always been sovereign over women, according to Sharia law, one can imagine the difficulty of imposing secular legal rights for women and children. After 17 years of failed efforts, the leaders of the WLA recently began to win some victories, and the purpose of this film is to share these victorious stories. <br /> <br /> The leaders of this legal reform movement are Vera Ngassa. , a state prosecutor, and Beatrice Ntuba, a senior judge (President of the Court). Both of them interpret themselves in this film, which may contain images taken spontaneously, although I imagine that a large part of it, if not all, consists of later recreations of real events for the camera. Four cases are reviewed and all the plaintiffs also participate in the film. <br /> <br /> Two cases involve repeated beatings of the wife, with forced sex in one case; another involves forced sex in a 10-year-old girl; and another one concerns the repeated beatings of a boy, 8 years old, by an aunt. One of the battered wives is also looking for a divorce. We follow the cases from the investigation of complaints to the results of the tests. The results in each case are favorable for women and children. The perpetrators receive harsh prison sentences and / or fines; Divorce is granted. <br /> <br /> The aggressive prosecution of the aunt who beats a child shows that these criminal justice women are in fact neutral with regard to law enforcement. Also worthy of mention is the respect with which all parties are treated, including the guilty parties. This is a very important and well made movie. (Interesting is the fact that one of the directors, Ms. Longinotto, also co-directed the 1998 film, Divorce, Iranian Style, which dealt with related issues in Tehran).
