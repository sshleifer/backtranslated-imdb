The series were short tracks that were originally shown in theaters along with a feature film related to the serialized pulp magazine. Known as "chapter reproductions," they were extended moving images divided into a series of segments called "chapters" or "episodes." Each chapter would be screened in the same theater for a week. The series would end with a suspense, since the hero and the heroine would be in the last dangerous situation that could not escape. <br /> <br /> The public would have to return next week to discover how the hero and the heroine would escape and fight the villain once again. The series were especially popular among children, and for many children in the first half of the twentieth century, a typical Saturday in the cinema included a chapter of at least one series, along with cartoons, news and two films. <Br /> <br /> The golden age for the serials was 1936-1945. This was one of the best of the era. <br /> <br /> Fox has been seen in many movies, but Reed Hadley ("Racket Squad", The Undying Brain) was excellent in the role. <br /> <br /> The action is constant, and we are taken chapter by chapter until the last end where we discover the identity of the malefactor. <br /> <br /> Fox triumphs, as he always does.
