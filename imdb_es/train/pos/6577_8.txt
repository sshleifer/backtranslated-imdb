With few exceptions, most of George Bernard Shaw's works have practically disappeared from the theater these days. Too much arch, too talkative seems to be the general verdict. This version of the BBC of one of Shaw's funniest works does not refute that verdict. It's certainly arched and talky, but it's also wonderful. And because of the quality of British theater, it is perfectly integrated with actors of which, with the exception of Helena Bonham Carter, most of us have probably never heard of it. Carter is splendid as the Bulgarian girl who houses the professional "chocolate soldier" (Pip Torrens) and later falls in love with him. One could quarrel with the especially ridiculous interpretation of Sergius (Patrick Ryecart), the Bulgarian cavalry officer who directed the charge towards enemy lines and succeeded only because the enemy had the wrong ammunition for their machine guns. However, the role invites to act in excess and, obviously, Ryecart was told to act in excess. The other players are perfect lyrics. Carter as the self-dramatizing Bulgarian "aristocrat" and Torrens as the Swiss soldier of fortune are at the center of the work, of course, and they are wonderful. Yes, "Arms and the Man" appears as a filmed work. But it is unlikely that you will ever see a Shaw movie that does not betray its origin. The plots are generally smart. However, Shaw is all about dialogue. The action is minimal (even in St. Joan) and the sets are immaterial. Enjoy this for what it is.
