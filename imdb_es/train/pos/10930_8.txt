['&quot;In the world of old-school kung fu movies, where the images of revenge reached ten cents a dozen, it took a lot for a film to stand out, and even more so that it&#39;s a fan&#39;s favorite. After all these years, Chang Cheh&#39;s best film continues to exert influence on the Hong Kong film industry, from the themes of loyalty, brotherhood and revenge explored by John Woo (who started his career in the Hong Kong film industry working for Chang) during the heyday of the heroic bloodshed during the late 1980s, to more modern films such as A Man Called Hero, which sports a character in a costume inspired by this film.The influence has also spread to other areas , from music like the Wu-Tang Clan, television ads for Sprite and videogames like &quot;Mortal Kombat.&quot; So, what makes this film so special? plot - on the surface - it&#39;s pretty simple. They are members of a dishonest group known as the &quot;poison Clan&quot; that is looking for a treasure hidden by their sifu. All members of the clan have extraordinary kung fu abilities, denoted by their animal styles, or &quot;poisons&quot; (the lizard can scale walls, the scorpion has a death blow, etc.). The twist is that since the clan always wears masks, not everyone knows who the others are. Thus, a simple plot becomes almost a thriller of suspense. We&#39;re not talking about the usual suspects here, but it&#39;s way above many other kung fu movies of the time. Supposedly, Golden Harvest was not very happy with Chang&#39;s script, like most of his films, they felt it was too dark and violent, and they really wanted him to add a lot of comic relief. Fortunately, Chang stuck to his guns and stayed with his original script, which has since become one of the best for the movies of his time, if not ever, completing an almost perfect dramatic arc and providing the perfect backbone for the extraordinary. Sequences of action. <br /><br /> But what really solidifies the film are the poisons themselves. Chang Cheh found a magical formula with the cast: not only did he win talented martial artists (whose movements competed without the help of cables or other special effects, but he embarrassed most modern martial artists), but also great actors. The formula turned out to be so popular that, in general, Chang had one or more of the poisons in his later films. Returning to the topic that concerns us, in most old-school movies, actors seem to play cardboard cutouts, but here the actors really create characters. It seems that everyone has a favorite poison (mine is Philip Kwok, more known by many as Hard-Boiled&#39;s Mad Dog - as Lizard) and it is this personal connection with the characters that The Five Deadly Venoms generates which makes it a True classic of the genre. &quot;Even if you&#39;re not usually a fan of old-school movies, you need to take a look at The Five Deadly Venoms,&quot; even though there&#39;s nothing more to see where the modern films draw inspiration from. &quot;']
