I watched the film twice in the space of a week, both times in a cinema in Orpington, Kent, United Kingdom. The place was full both times and the people had to be rejected. Since the beginning of the film with Henry Winkler who was "injured" on the football field, the entire audience began to laugh, a laugh that lasted until the credits. <br /> <br /> For lovers of the American struggle, this movie is a must, but get ready to see Henry Winkler like you've never seen him before. Also look for a well-known actor whose trademark fighting movement is a head, but! <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity to see this movie and it is the best family comedy!
