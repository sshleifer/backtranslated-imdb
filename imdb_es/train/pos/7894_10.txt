This is a great show, and it will make you cry, this group of people really loved in real life and shows again and again. Send me an email and we will chat. I've been to Australia and they really talk like this. <br /> <br /> I want you to enjoy Five Mile Creek and convey these great stories of right and wrong, and friendship to your children. I have the 40 episodes on DVD-R that I have compiled in the last 5 years. See my tribute to Five Mile Creek at www.mikeandvicki.com and listen to the expanded musical theme. Let's talk about them. <br /> <br /> These people are great!
