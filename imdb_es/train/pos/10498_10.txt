It's a little easy That's it. <br /> <br /> The graphics are clean and realistic, except for the fact that some of the fences are 2d, but that is forgivable. The rest of the graphics are cleaner than GoldenEye and many other N64 games. The sounds are magnificent. Everything, from talking to the SFX, is pleasant and realistic. <br /> <br /> The camera angle is a little frustrating at times, but it's the same for all platform games, like Banjo-Kazooie and Donkey Kong 64. <br /> <br /> I received this I played as a Christmas present in 1997, and since then, I have obtained 120 stars in 10 times.
