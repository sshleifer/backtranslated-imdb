I just watched Hot Millions at TCM and I had completely forgotten about this gem. Ustinov creates an intelligent and dividing plot that makes him pass ingeniously from two swindlers to ingenious ... Well, you'll see. Maggie Smith is perfect as the clumsy secretary / neighbor who has difficulty maintaining a job but has a warm and vibrant personality that is reflected in this image. She creates an excellent portrait of a warm, witty and real person that in the long term ... well ... <br /> <br /> Molden and Newhart as top executives take on the challenge of doing what could be banal roles and make them go to a comic life of their own. <br /> <br /> Robert Morley and Ceasar Romero are just a pleasure to see and I know that at least in Romero's case, Ustinov is extending a helping hand. <br /> <br /> This movie is meant to be a shot at the growing age of computing and it's a problem for the average scam artist, but in reality the characters are so funny and so fun to see that the computer sub-plot It's almost lost ... I say almost. <br /> <br /> Put aside your usual expectations of modern comedy and look for the great presentations and the friendly, indulgent and deeply enveloping plot in this image.
