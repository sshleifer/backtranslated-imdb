"Mr. Harvey lights a candle" is anchored in a brilliant performance by Timothy Spall. <br /> <br /> While we can predict that your master teacher, your teacher to the fullest will have some kind of degradation or catharsis based on some deep, secret past, it is amazing how your emotions are revealed. The variety of sentiments transmitted by Spall is quite moving and more than generally interpreted as part of Mike Leigh's repertoire. <br /> <br /> While an expected boring school bus ride has only been used for comic purposes, as in "The Simpsons," this central situation of a visit to Salisbury Cathedral in the script of Rhidian Brook is well contained and structured for dramatic purposes, and is almost formally divided into acts. <br /> <br /> We are introduced to the British urban range of racially and religiously diverse children (with their uniforms I could not tell if this is a "private" or "public" school), as they meet. the black children rapping, the serious Asians and Muslims of the south, the white thugs and the bad girls? But transmitted in a very natural and individual way. The young actors, some of whom I recognized from British television as "Shameless," were exuberant in representing the usual range of high school social pressures. Celia Imrie gives more warmth to the role of supervisor than martinets who normally have to play. <br /> <br /> A break in the journey leads to a transforming crisis for some, while others remain graciously oblivious. We think, like the teacher portrayed by Ben Miles of "Coupling", that we will receive a didactic lesson on religious tolerance, but it is much more about faith in people and also in God, which is why the BBC demonstrated it in England In the time of Easter and BBC America showed it in the USA. UU during Christmas. <br /> <br /> Nathalie Press, who was also so good at "Summer of Love," has a key role in Mr. Harvey's redemption that could have been played for the preaching of the movie of the week, but It is moving when they approach each other in an unexpected way (unfortunately I saw his intense scene interrupted by commercials). <br /> <br /> Although it is a bit many times I called attention to this road trip as "a pilgrimage", this quiet film was the best evocation of "goodwill towards men" that I have seen in most of Television movies with vacation themes.
