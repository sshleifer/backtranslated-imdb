<br /> <br /> In 1970, after an absence of five years, Kurosawa did what would be his first film in color. Ka-Den de Dodes is a film that focuses on many interrelated stories that take place in a small slum in Tokyo. <br /> <br /> The title comes from the sound a child with mental retardation makes when imagining that a train is operating. . Little by little we get to know more the people of the small community, the two drunks who exchange wives because they are not happy with the ones they have. The old man who is the center of the city who helps a thief who tries to rob him. The very poor father and son who can never afford a house, so they imagine their own. At the end of the film, all stories are completed, some become happy, others sad. <br /> <br /> As this was Kurosawa's first color film, you can see that he uses it in his favor and it shows. . Maybe too much This movie goes in many different directions and it is difficult to establish and get into it. But do not get me wrong, the Dodes Ka-Den may not be the best Kurosawa, but being the best director of all time, it's much better than 99% of today's films.
