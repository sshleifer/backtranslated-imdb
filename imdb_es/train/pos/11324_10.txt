['I have to agree with everyone else who has posted. <br /><br /> I saw it a long time ago, but I will tell you that every time I listen to certain music from this anime it reminds me of the story, the beautiful animation, the characters and the feeling I have when I see it, and it makes me cry. (a feeling so happy but sad). However, I find that the love story in her felt a bit rushed and did not explain things correctly but did not ruin any part of the visual experience. <br /><br /> I liked this anime so much that after the end I just had to do a little research (and see the ending a few more times) and I found all my answers and many more. I love how they configured the historical legends to fit into this anime, it was amazing and I really wanted to investigate much more (I&#39;ve always been interested in many historical figures associated with this anime) <br /><br /> I think it should have been a longer series, but if this is all they had to work with, they did it very well. I would recommend it to anyone who likes emotional anime with an excellent story, well-constructed characters (some mysterious ones) and a bit of fantasy action. <br /><br /> Also, although this was based on a H game, it does not have any of that and I really prefer it this way (I have no problem with mature anime, in most cases I prefer it)']
