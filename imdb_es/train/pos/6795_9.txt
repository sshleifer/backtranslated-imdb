One of the most intelligent serial killer movies in recent history. ZODIAC KILLER offers an imaginative view of the background and the story of one of the most famous serial killers. The filmmakers create an unexpected good insight into the pathology of this mysterious murderer, and anyone who remembers the Zodiac will be intrigued. Others will want to discover more about this enigmatic criminal. Unlike many serial killers, Zodiac was not crazy, but very methodical and self-promoting. The director here plays the spectator's expectations and takes it out. The film is constructed as a murder mystery, or a "cold case" style thriller. It is an intelligent horror film of research style / procedure that will put off the gore-hounds in search of cheap emotions. <br /> <br /> Some people do not like any movie recorded on video. This attitude is very old and provincial. It is an attitude and vision of films that puts technical problems above the value of entertainment or artistic value. These attitudes are on the way out. ZODIAC KILLER is a low-budget film, no doubt, but the most demanding viewers will look further and find a carefully crafted gem.
