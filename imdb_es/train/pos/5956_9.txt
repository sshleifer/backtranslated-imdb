['Yes, this is a very low budget movie. So acting is not an award-winning material and sometimes the action is slow because the filmmakers are filming longer sequences and not a million instants that are then edited in a movie. This film makes up for it with an outstanding script that takes vampirism seriously, explains it and develops a complete plot from it. Apart from the vampire story, we get detailed information on genetics, legal and police, martial arts action, philosophical reflections and good metal music. Congratulations to Dylan O&#39;Leary, the director / writer / main actor. It is beyond me how this man could have fulfilled all these roles and done them so well. I think to appreciate this movie, you have to be well versed in all kinds of subjects to see that the writer did a lot of research and knows about all these things. There is also a great camera work, interesting camera angles and an underwater vampire attack, something I have not seen before, but which pays tribute to the attack of underwater zombies in Fulci&#39;s Zombie. The casting is good, to the extent that the sexy woman is really sexy. The main vampire also looks perfect for the role. The female victim looks vulnerable. My only complaint is that for a low budget horror movie, there should have been more nudes. If you want to see an original vampire movie with a great story, this movie is for you. I look forward to seeing future projects by Mr. O&#39;Leary.']
