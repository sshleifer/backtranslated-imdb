This is probably the best documentary I've seen in a long time. Jonny Kennedy was and remains a tragically beautiful inspiration. Not only was he a survivor of one of the most painful diseases, but he used his beauty to show the world that there is life after death and never to give up reaching people and spreading their love. Seeing the minutes of his long fight was heartbreaking. Hearing his intelligent comments and seeing his lovely gestures was moving. And to see him smile was indescribable. I feel blessed to have been touched by this little giant. Please, if you ever have the chance to see this movie, consider yourself lucky to have met Jonny Kennedy.
