This is the best film that has been made to address the issue of AIDS. It is a documentary about two men who live and die of this disease. The movie is beautiful, heartbreaking, funny and incredibly moving. Above all, it is an incredible story of true love. Be sure to have some tissues ready before watching this movie, you will need them. Extraordinary.
