Rock 'n' Roll High School was one of the best films ever made. I think the only reason it was so amazing was because of the Ramones! You could not have made the same movie and put something like the Sex Pistols, or The Clash instead of The Ramones, it just would not have been the same. Dey young, Clint Howard, Vincent Van Patten, Mary Woronov, Paul Bartel and the monters hall, were added to the film. The whole movie is about the Ramones ... especially Joey! So everyone showed up to see Rock 'n' Roll high school if you're a big fan of real PUNK. Not the new and sissy garbage ... but the loud and fast class. The kind that only the Ramones could do. R.I.P (Rest in peace) Joey Ramone 1951-2001. Dee Dee Ramone 1952-2002!
