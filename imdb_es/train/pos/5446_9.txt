National Lampoon's Class Reunion is a classic comedy film from the early 80's that combines unique characters, lots of laughs and good music by Chuck Berry. When Walter Bailor feels absolutely humiliated by his classmates at his high school graduation, he takes the opportunity to take revenge for his class meeting. One by one, he stalks his classmates, including an innocent blind girl, a fat, horny man, the beauty of high school, the king of all preparations, and even the ugly old woman who served everyone. children during high school. This movie has a kind of scary element and has some brief scenes of sexuality, so I would not recommend it for young children, but it's a great movie for teenagers. If you are looking for a movie with a beautiful score, complex characters or killer special effects, you may not like Class Reunion. If you want to sit for 90 minutes and have some great laughs and lots of fun (and who does not), this movie should be on your list of movies to watch. ++
