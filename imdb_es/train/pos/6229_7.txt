One of the many musicals about sailors on leave, is the usual sailor who meets a girl, complications occur, happily resolves itself as an argument. Continue smooth enough, but also drag in places. The dialogue is not as fast as 'Top Hat', for example, and Randolph Scott seems out of place. <br /> <br /> There are compensations. It has some of Irving Berlin's finest songs, which include "Let Yourself Go," "I put all my eggs in one basket" and "Let's Face the Music and Dance." He has Fred and Ginger who, when they are dancing, take any movie to heavenly heights and they do not disappoint here. They do a fast tap dance, a comedic dance and an elegant and revolving dance, all in the same movie! Great versatility and art. <br /> <br /> He also has Harriet Hilliard who is pretty good in her role. She had a varied career, becoming the most famous Harriet Nelson with Ozzie. Here he is playing without being sentimental. His two songs are delivered simply and effectively. She makes a good contrast with Ginger but you can believe they are sisters in the movie. <br /> <br /> A bigger adjustment has made the film even better. Pretty good though
