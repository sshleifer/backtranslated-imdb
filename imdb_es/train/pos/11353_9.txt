This movie was excellent. It details the struggle between a committed detective against the dedicated ignorance of the corrupt communist regime in Russia during the 80s. I give high marks to this film for its unrestricted look at the birth and development of forensic investigation in a globally isolated community (thanks to the "Regime"). This is a graphic movie. It presents an uncensored image of violence and its tragic remains. Nothing is "covered in candy" with exaggerated blood or blood to separate us from the cruel reality on the screen. This movie is based on the Russian serial killer Andrei Chikatilo. I am familiar enough with the real story to have a deep appreciation of how real the movie was. It is not a comedy, but for those who appreciate dry and dark humor, this film is a must.
