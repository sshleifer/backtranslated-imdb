The 1960 television series Bewitched owes his idea of ​​this movie. This is the movie that Jimmy Stewart and Kim Novak made just after they were released on Vertigo by Alfred Hitchcock. This is not as obsessive as that, but Novak is just as captivating. This was the tenth film by Jack Lemmons and he is good at supporting both here and Ernie Kovacs. The movie has many good things about it. Hermine Gingold is very good in this movie, almost as good in support here as she was in The Music Man. The cast is very solid. <br /> <br /> This movie has a New York City feel in the late 1950s and a cat as bewitching as any feline in any movie. It's worth seeing, since it's a love story with all the excitement of anyone, and a bit of magic too. <br /> <br /> It's not Vertigo, but I think because it followed that movie, the viewers did not. Rate it as well as it deserved, I'm sure that William Asher has seen it, so the 1960 series was created. I'm not so happy with what Will Ferrell did on the big screen, this movie is much better than that.
