['I am from Belgium and, therefore, my writing in English is quite poor, sorry for that ... <br /><br /> This is one of those little-known films that play only once on television and seem to disappear in the air. I was browsing through my old collection of VHS videos and found this title, I searched for it and had an IMDb score of more than 7/10, that&#39;s pretty decent. <br /><br /> I must admit that it is a very well made film and that is why I am baffled. This is the only movie made by this director ...? How come you did not do a lot of movies after this pretty good ...? Someone with so much potential should be forced to make another movie, ha ha ;-) <br /><br /> Anyway, I&#39;d really like to see him do his job and make another good movie like this, please ...']
