This is one of those movies, like Dave, American Dreamer and Local Hero, which shows the interest of the viewer over and over again. Light films rarely win the Oscars, but whoever did the casting for Soapdish deserves one. Even after one has seen the film and knows what is coming, it is still nice to see how the various facets of the plot unfold. It is true that the whole drama is melodrama; But that's totally appropriate for a movie with a soap opera background. My favorite line comes from Whoopi Goldberg: "Now, why can not I write sh * t like that?" I think it's unfortunate that television censors and websites insist on all this unnecessary sanitation.
