TIllman Jr.'s drama about the first Diver of the African American Navy (Gooding Jr.), who defies all odds and achieves his goals despite a strict bitter coach. The script is not bad, a bit extreme at times, but the direction and acting are first class, and this film is inspiring and achieves what it is supposed to do. I liked DeNiro at the head, although it is not on par with his masterful works (taxi driver, godfather and everyone else) is as good as his other good performances, as in King of Comedy or Angel Heart. DeNiro is always convincing and credible here, very good performance, Gooding Jr. is not bad, definitely one of his best performances. --- IMDb rating: 6.6, my rating: 9/10
