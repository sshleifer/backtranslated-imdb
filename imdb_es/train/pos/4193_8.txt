Director Sam Fuller has something of a cult, particularly in Europe. However, most of his films are more than forgettable. However, he directed a really great movie in "Pickup on South Street". Made very early in his career, the films that followed were very inferior. <br /> <br /> From the first frame to the last, "Pickup" works on all levels. It is filmed with impeccable fluency, with excellent performances throughout the year. Richard Widmark and Thelma Ritter, both players with an excellent record of top-level performances, are at their best. Widmark, who was no stranger to the interpretation of villains, although he was really stingy, still manages to reveal the slightest humanity, which makes his character fascinating, in addition to making the character of Jean Peters more credible. <br /> <br /> Fuller has no punches in this really hard movie. There is a scene in which Jean Peters is mistreated by Widmark. It is really shocking in your reality. This is not the case of a carefully choreographed photograph. <br /> <br /> Less self-conscious than many films of the time, it remains a great example of the genre.
