... so, what about those 10 lost minutes that were so horrible that they had to cut them out of the original movie? We spent three years in the movie production code ... Barbara Stanwyck had starred in the original work, but here, Carole Lombard plays Maggie King. Co-star Fred MacMurray is probably best known for "Double Indemnity," with Stanwyck, as well as for his hit television show "My Three Sons." Look out for a young Dorothy Lamour (Bob Hope movies) and also fabulous Franklin Pangborn, who conducted almost all the films that were recorded on tape. Of course, he works in the beauty salon on the boat! Add the sublime Charles Butterworth and Anthony Quinn. Good time and smart jokes at the beginning. Maggie's friend, Ella, is played by Jean Dixon, who was the best friend in "Holiday" and "My Man Godfrey." In "Swing High", Maggie, the tourist, meets a soldier who leaves the army. Maggie loses her boat when she leaves the port and becomes entangled with the soldier. Quinn has a small scene at the local bar in Panama where Johnson (MacMurray) has been playing the trumpet. Maggie, Harry (Butterworth) and Skid come together to try to figure out how to return to the United States. Some good songs by Lamour. Good (but brief) performance by Cecil Cunningham as "Murph", the wise and helpful owner of the local salon in Panama. While others have lamented how bad it is, it was not so horrible, and it's even a bit exotic, with the fake regional setup of Central America for the first half of the movie.
