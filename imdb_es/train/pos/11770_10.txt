I was hoping that this would be good as a Timothy Dalton James Bond fan and, although it was not his well deserved '3rd Bond Outing', it was a laugh. Belushi brought some good humor to his part and Dalton did it very well, but it was probably underutilized. his part liked a camping version of Jack Nicholson in some good men. The other Brit was a bit shocking, but overall it was a laugh.
