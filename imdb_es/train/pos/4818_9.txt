I always mistrust a little before seeing the films of the British era because I usually find them in insipid and boring scripts (such as, for example, Vanity Fair or The Other Boleyn Girl), but with a magnificent production design, European. The landscapes and the thick British accents that make films suggest an artistic value that they really do not have. Fortunately, the excellent film The Young Victoria does not fall into that situation and deserves an enthusiastic recommendation for its fascinating history, the excellent performances of Emily Blunt, Paul Bettany and Jim Broadbent, and the costumes and places that unexpectedly make the film quite rich for the eyes And I say "unexpectedly" because I usually do not pay much attention to those details. <br /> <br /> "The Victorian era" was (in my humble opinion) one of the key points of contemporary civilization, and not only in the social aspect, but also in the scientific, artistic and cultural. but honestly I did not know much about the origins of that era, and maybe that's why I enjoyed this simplification of the political and economic events that prepared both the disembarkation of the modern era. I also liked the way Queen Victoria is. portrayed, who is like a young and intelligent monarch whose decisions were not always good, but at least they were inspired by good intentions. I also found the description of the romance between Victoria and Prince Albert interesting because she is equally interested in the combination of intellects as well as the emotions she evokes. The only flaw I found in this movie is that the screenwriter Julian Fellowes used some clich√©s of romantic cinema in the love story, something that feels a little out of place in his script. <br /> <br /> I really liked The Young Victoria, and I really got a pleasant surprise. I hope that more period films follow the example of this film: costumes and landscapes should function as the support of an interesting story, and not as a replacement.
