This is a great movie for any fan of the Hong Kong action movies. Apart from its small plot, the weak drama and fragments of comedy antics, the film is full of action with firearms and martial arts. It kept me entertained from the beginning to the end. I thought Shannon Lee was amazing in the movie. <br /> <br /> Having an action director like Corey Yuen is what keeps the Hong Kong action strong. This modern action movie is highly recommended !!
