This movie is very entertaining and it is never boring, it even runs in almost 3 hours. Al Pacino, Michelle Phieffer and the rest of the cast are great in the movie and are very credible. The violence was a bit extreme in the movie, but then it showed how cruel the drug trade was at the time of the movie. The ending is incredible and is probably one of the best scenes in history. Great movie and you probably enjoy it a lot.
