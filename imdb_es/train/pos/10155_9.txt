I just can not understand the negative comments about this movie. Yes, it is a typical romance between boys and girls, but it is done with so much style and elegance that time flies by. Henstridge (talk about winning the genetic fund lottery!) Is as magnetic and attractive as ever (who says that the movie's golden age is dead?) And Vartan has his own. <br /> <br /> There is a chemistry simmering between the two cables; The movie is more alive when they share a scene, a lot! It's done so well that you're willing to come together ... <br /> <br /> Ignore the negative comments: if you feel a little sad, look at this movie, you will feel much better. If you are already happy, then you will be euphoric. <br /> <br /> (PS: I am 33 years old, I am a man from the United Kingdom and a hopeless romantic is still looking for his princess ...)
