This movie is so complex that you can give it a description and keep rolling it. you have a main character insecure, problematic and fascinating (played by Jean-Pierre Léaud) who is caught between two (no, three) women. We listen to his social, philosophical and moral idiosyncrasies in endless monologues, we see him working his magic around the three women he loves. This could be the premise for a poultry movie, full of rigid, cold and uninteresting comments. however, director Jean Eustache manages to keep it fresh, ironic and witty. Being such a long film, one can not help but laugh when, after 2 hours of courteous speaking, Jean-Pierre Léaud suddenly screams into the phone while recalling a cheesy line from a movie. These types of situations are purely cinematographic and can not be completely restored in a comment. Nor can anyone restore the tragic and painfully beautiful monologue of Françoise Lebrun towards the end of the film. 3 hours and a half and every minute is worth it.
