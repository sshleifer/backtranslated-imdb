Excellent comedy starring Dudley Moore with the support of Liza Minnelli and the good speaker John Gielgud. Moore is Arthur, a man belonging to a multi-million dollar family, who came close to getting 750 million dollars, as long as he marries a lady (Susan) from another multimillion-dollar family. In principle, Arthur accepted the conditions, but finally refused when he met Linda Marolla (Liza Minneli). Arthur was just a parasite because he did not work, he just enjoyed drinking a lot and having fun with prostitutes. After several serious thoughts in his life and for the first time, Arthur decided not to marry Susan just a few minutes before his wedding. The ending was happy for Linda and Arthur, although the latter knew that his life will change in the future to come. This comedy is a good life lesson for anyone. Rich people are not usually happy with their ways of life.
