It's hard to tell her more about this movie without spoiling it. I enjoyed it because I did not expect what I was seeing, but an ordinary sexual drama, so ... It's a psycho-sexual thriller, in which nothing is what it seems. Presents Emmanuelle Seigner, who is not alien to the genre (and the nudity) in which her husband, Polanski, had directed. And a spooky performance (did I say creepy / yes CREEPY?) Toreton (the actor of Bernard Tavernier). It seems that a Pascal Bruckner meets Roman Polanski (better than Bitter Moon), like a Chabrol gone by the way or Clouzot thriller (I've seen someone mentioning Les Diaboliques), but closer to Les Yeux without Face by Georges Franju (Eyes faceless, the godfather of Dr. Phibes and more). A gem! I'm just afraid they'll blow this up in a Hollywood remake like they did with Nighwatch and The Vanishing.
