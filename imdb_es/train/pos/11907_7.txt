Hitchcock was of the opinion that the audiences are not really interested in what puts the protagonists in danger, only that they ARE in danger and need to escape. <br /> <br /> This movie shows that Hitchcock was not 100% correct. The police believe that Jean Simmons is guilty of a crime, when clearly it is not. Trevor Howard decides that his best course of action is to run for it. And so, the body of the film has our charismatic couple dodging in and out of trains, buses and coaches - jumping through the rocks at the top of a waterfall - climbing through the roofs of the shipyards. <br /> <br /> All the good and exciting things - But I could not stop thinking that everything was unnecessary. They should have stayed still. <br /> <br /> In other words, the MacGuffin was not strong enough.
