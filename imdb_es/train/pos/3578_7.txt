Arnald Hillerman, 12, accidentally kills his older brother Eugene. His feelings are arrested by the fact that his family can not interact with him (or feel that it is not right). His ONLY refuge is his grandfather, who is the ONLY one who seems to feel compassion for him. Realism will captivate lovers of "real life" movies, but it will not satisfy those who want action and excitement.
