I'm Italian and when I recently went back to watching this movie, I was surprised by its beauty: the first time I was 10 years old and I liked it, but today I can appreciate it with the minds and feelings of adults. Now I can understand that it was a masterpiece of a special season of Italian cinema (Pasolini, etc.), by then it had already happened. <br /> <br /> Hollywood epic movies are good ... for fun. Maybe this 'Odyssey' did not have an English version because it is not funny enough ... it is not suitable for the audience of popcorn and coca. However, suitable for Homer's pathos and existentialist reflections. <br /> <br /> In Italy, a very good DVD version was recently released: INTEGRAL, with excellent colors. You can find it in some shared files, but it's only Italian and without subtitles. Pity: also the dialogues and the voices of this film are remarkable.
