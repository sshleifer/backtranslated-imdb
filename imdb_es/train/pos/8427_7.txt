['This is one of the strangest movies of the Zat么ichi series due to its unusual rhythm and the role that Ichi plays in the film. Interestingly, this was Zat么ichi&#39;s first film made by the new producer of Shintaro Katsu. Now, instead of just playing the blind swordsman, Katsu is in charge of making the films. This could easily explain why this movie seems so different in style to the previous 15 films. As for the role of Ichi, the film is very different because it is not in the film as much as usual. It is also easy to cheat and actually, for a time, it does a lot to hurt people instead of helping! <br /><br /> &quot;Zat么ichi R么yaburi&quot; begins with Ichi talking to an old woman who tries to take advantage of her blindness. Interestingly, in this scene, Ichi says he has been blind since he was a small child, although in a previous movie he says that his blindness began when he was 8 years old. This is a minor mistake, and only a crazed fanatic like me would have noticed. <br /><br /> This film is made over a period of at least six months and is more likely to have lasted a year, so you can see what I said about the strange rhythm. Most movies in the series take place in a few days or weeks. Ichi arrives in a city where there is a chief (Asagoro) who strives to be nice to Ichi because he knows the reputation of the blind man. The boss is quite charming and, surprisingly, Ichi is totally deceived by the evil man. At the same time, he meets another boss (Shushui), a kind of guru for the poor. Shushui urges people to abandon all violence and even Ichi falls under his teaching, giving up his sword for many months. The teachings of Shushui are very similar to the Taoist teachings of China: nonviolence and acceptance of life as it is (for better or for worse). <br /><br /> Months after leaving this city and thinking that everything was fine, Ichi learns that as soon as he left, Asagoro showed his true colors: enslave the women, oppress the poor and be an imbecile. In a way, Ichi is responsible for this, since he helped Asagoro and counted him as a friend. Now, Asagoro has captured Shushui and several innocent people have committed suicide due to the actions of the evil boss. <br /><br /> When Ichi returns, he does not automatically accept that Asagoro is good or bad, but he proves it intelligently. This bit with a scarecrow is inspired and leads to an ending where, what else, Ichi kills the bad guys and liberates Shushui. This end was very good and it happened in the rain. So the final scene with Asagoro and the rocks is great, although the decapitation is a bit corny by today&#39;s special effects standards. <br /><br /> The advantages of the film are that, although they have a poor pace, they are different and can not be confused with the previous 15 (which often seem very similar). Also, it ends very well. The drawbacks (apart from the rhythm) are that some may find it displeasing to see Ichi so fallible and the scenes with Ichi and the other blind included for comic relief fall ... very, very, very flat. They are bad taste and without grace ... that is the type of floor that is.']
