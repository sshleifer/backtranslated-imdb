I recently had the opportunity to see "The Waterdance", and I liked it a lot. I really do not understand why it's called like that, since there's really no dancing, except maybe to dance in the strip club near the end. We are introduced to the main characters of the film, disabled in a hospital. The story shows a love story between a physically disabled man and a healthy woman, which is a very sweet story. Unfortunately, today you can not watch movies like that. I'm not "stuck in a distortion of time," I'm not saying that everything during the 80s and early 90s was better than today, but I really believe that the film industry is deteriorating and there is much we can learn from old movies . I mean old movies. Anything from 1920-1998.
