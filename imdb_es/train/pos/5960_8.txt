It's great to see Jorja Fox in a role where she smiles a lot. I also loved hearing her sing. Good change to see her out of her CSI / West Wing / ER roles. The film itself was entertaining, but it seemed to omit some explanations in many places. Several of the characters seemed miserable in one minute and happy the next, and it was in your imagination to find out why. However, each character was peculiar and, in some cases, could not wait to see what they would do next or hear what they would say next. This film was not full of absolutely clean people, but of realistic and complicated people who could make mistakes, feel bad for them and then find a way to solve them.
