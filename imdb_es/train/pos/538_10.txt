Back to Cabin by the Lake is perhaps one of the few sequels that can live until The Original. He had black humor, good suspense, beautiful girls and, of course, a psychopathic murderer. What are we missing? I do not think anything. Except that we were left with a small amount of Gore and nudity because it was made for television. Besides being one of the best sequels, it is one of the best thrillers to watch as a family. Recommended for everyone.
