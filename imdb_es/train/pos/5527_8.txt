Maybe there is a special reason why The Fox and the Child hit a special note in my heart. After saying goodbye to my new fiancee (for example, one day) during an unknown period of time, I felt a little overwhelmed by the different emotions and suffered the consequences of putting on the brave face I needed to see. <Br /> <br /> I watched some movies and TV shows, but my interest skyrocketed from what I was leaving behind to what is out there and what I have not seen. For that, I have to thank this movie. <br /> <br /> Being a nature lover and having heard about the film in advance, I was sure that I would like it anyway. But I did not just like it, I loved it. <br /> <br /> The technical mastery is amazing. How they did it? How did they capture the animals as they did? It is simply wonderful. <br /> <br /> The moral of the story is good and, although the ending is very French and ambiguous, it is happy / sad. Once again, I was caught a little off guard. As a man who generally keeps his emotions to himself, the ending was difficult as he traveled on a plane full of people he would see for the next 15 hours. Maybe it's because the ending reminded me of what I left behind. <br /> <br /> But during those few hours on the plane, I was happy to see something new and original. And that is life. Sure, there are things you love and you feel comfortable ... but the outdoors is a mystery to many. So the next time you see something out of the ordinary while you're out in the open; I'm going to explore it, observe it and embrace it. That is precisely what happens in this film and that is precisely what you should do with this excellent film / documentary about nature. 8/10 <br /> <br /> P.S. It's two months since the plane trip. We still do not know when we will see each other again, but we will.
