Laurence Fishburne is a good actor, and deserves respect for trying, but he's not in a class with the great Shakespeare like Olivier and Welles; and also suffers from Kenneth Branagh. This Irishman, always brilliant, cleans the show. Olivier recognized that potential in his production, and chose Iago with someone who knew he could take the stage. I did not realize the possibilities of Iago, the most evil character of Shakespeare, but Branagh shows us the depths. It is good to see the sights of Venice, too.
