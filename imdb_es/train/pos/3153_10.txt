['I&#39;ll make this short and sweet because I do not think there&#39;s much you can tell anyone about this show that I&#39;ve never seen it, other than that it&#39;s hilariously fun and unique, for me it&#39;s possibly the funniest show of all. <br /><br /> You really have to see it to understand its humor and it took me some episodes to really get into it, but once you&#39;re there there&#39;s no way out again. For example, the way the Hydes character always wants to see his friends get into some kind of problem as it happens, the more fun it becomes. <br /><br /> It&#39;s a classic classic, I mean the cast, the writers, the director, it&#39;s just a recipe for success. An actor that I think always has difficulty is Ashton Kutcher, but I want to say that is great in this show, I do not think it&#39;s possible that the character Kelso has been played by anyone else, it takes someone very intelligent to play someone stupid. All the main characters are great and it would not be worth a revision if I did not mention the cold stone slut Mila Kunis, which is now a spicy encounter with a ball, ha, joking, an incredible show.']
