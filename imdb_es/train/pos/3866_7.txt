This modest and fairly routine series deserves credit in the history books of television for two reasons: it was the first to win an Emmy for best syndicated series, and was the first series to come from the legendary studios of Republic Pictures, known for its low-budget but high-powered shooting in the 30s and 40s. <br /> <br /> Republic was one of the first Hollywood studios to jump on the small screen, which was still in its infancy. . But the possession of the studios as a fictional producer of television pulp would be brief. After this program, then they got into the other format for which they were known, the series of adventures, with "Comando Cody", as well as in other series, but like this one, they did not last more than 39 episodes. In addition, Republic was in its final stages as a studio; he would end his tenure in Hollywood as a rental for several series of Revue Studio, such as "Soldiers of Fortune", the original "Dragnet" and "Kit Carson", before finally closing its doors in 1959. <br /> <br /> Anyway, "Stories of the Century" was not as bad as for an oater, his business card was stories based on authentic figures of Western history, mainly outlaws like Black Bart, Johnny Ringo, John Wesley Hardin, The Dalton Bros and similar The late Jim Davis, best known for his role as patriarch of Ewing in "Dallas," did a kind job in the lead role as Matt Clark, a fictional railroad detective who has to deal with such outlaws, played by the veteran and soon future veteran character actors. <br /> <br /> Two amazing facts here: the incidents would develop on different timelines, some in the 1880s, others at the turn of the century, but Clark never gets old. And also, Matt has the good fortune to face two charming detectives as assistants, Frankie Adams, played by Mary Castle, and his replacement, Margaret "Jonesy" Jones, by Kristine Miller. The Lone Ranger could only wish for lady company. You can only spend so much time with Tonto for so long. <br /> <br /> "Stories Of The Century" is a production of Studio City TV by Republic Pictures Corp. In 1954 there were 39 episodes, of which 39 are in Public Domain and DVD.
