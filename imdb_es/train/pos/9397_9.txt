Vaguely reminiscent of the great westerns of 1940, such as "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre" (1948), "Red Rock West" is a story about conscience, greed and betrayal. Michael (Nicolas Cage) is a young, but honest, bassist from Texas, who goes west in search of work and money. Find both, but not the way you expected. <br /> <br /> The script of the film contains many surprises and twists in the plot. Excellent cinematography, skillful film editing and changing western music add tension and suspense. The expansion of the great sky country provides a wonderful environment. And the performance varies from good to excellent, with great performances by Dennis Hopper and J.T. Walsh The specially recorded country / western song by Dwight Yoakam gives the film a solid ending. <br /> <br /> With the correct label as neo-noir, "Red Rock West" also seems to me to be something else. The plot is full of incredible coincidences and improbable times, so that others may consider the script as defective. Normally, I agree. In this case, however, when combined with the mood of a bad mood, and the fact that the small town of Red Rock seems almost empty of normal daily life, the coincidences and the unlikely moment suggest a story that, beyond of "noirish", it's ... surreal. It is almost as if fate intervenes deliberately with unlikely events to force Michael to face himself. From this point of view, the coincidences are not script failures at all. They are necessary plot points in a nightmare story of a young man who must face his own demons ... disguised as other characters. <br /> <br /> All we need here is Rod Serling, in a postscript, explaining, in his always enunciated voice, that ... a young man, looking for himself, stops in a small and almost deserted thousands of kilometers from nowhere. It's your final stop on a trip to ... the twilight zone.
