Every time this film is on the BBC, someone at the Radio Times tells how it is a satire against the post-war world of rationing and the welfare state. I do not think this is the point of the movie at all. The film parodies the spivs (petty criminals who run the black market) and the housewives' league that campaigned against government restrictions but that were actually a conservative vanguard organization. <br /> <br /> Yes, of course, the movie sends the politics / social. situation but in the end people realize that they need all the controls to guarantee a just society, they want to be British and to get ahead instead of being foreigners. <br /> <br /> But I do not think they're going back to being exactly as they were before.
