A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved to a small town and must deal with a bad teacher (Glenn Shadix), their incestuous relationship, a lovely girl (MÃ¤dchen Amick) and a Hell of a great secret. <br /> <br /> Well, technically, this is a "bad movie". But who cares? It is fun! <br /> <br /> Impossible things happen (involving corn), people go crazy for kittens, there are bad phrases, there is too much cheese to handle! <br /> <br /> Then, yes. You will enjoy this. Much. It will not move you, it will touch you, it will neither scare you nor excite you in any way, but it will keep you entertained and laughing!
