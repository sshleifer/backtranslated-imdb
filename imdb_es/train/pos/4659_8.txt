Without Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith, this could easily have been a turkey. But they are brilliant. Ustinov is at his best, and for Maggie fans, it's great to see her in her early days, matching Ustinov every step of the way with and the moment. For the English in their fifties (and I'm on that stand), it's always fun to watch flashes and hear the sounds of Swinging Sixties, and although this film spends a lot of time in offices, it has a lot of nostalgia in the Sixties, including Buses Reds, Carnaby Street, a song by Lulu and a delicious drink from the skirt of a waitress, something England has never seen from public places. As an I.T. Engineer, I know that hacking tips are ridiculous, but they should not be taken seriously. Nor are the wonderful stereotypes of Italians, French and Germans.
