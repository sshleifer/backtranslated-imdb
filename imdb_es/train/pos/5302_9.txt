This movie kept me constantly entertained. When comparing this with Serial Mom, Mr. Waters has returned to his most acute side. This is not so polished. <br /> <br /> Here is a dark side. A message about how success and fame change a person, but the most important thing is how the people around you change. <br /> <br /> There is not a fake moment in this movie. <br /> <br /> The characters are somewhat caricatured ... but I want to believe that that is what Mr. Waters is trying to achieve. <br /> <br /> It's fascinating to see how Mr. Waters has evolved ... This is truly his best character. work.
