The 60s are a mini series well balanced between historical facts and a good plot. In four deliveries, we followed an American family, with 3 members. But we do not just see them. We also follow the story of several characters like a black reverend, an extremist student leader and a soldier in Vietnam. The filmography is simply extraordinary. In the first chapters, we see some shots of the Vietnam War, between the scenes. The next chapter, it does not start where the last one ended, starts some time later, giving us a little mystery about what happened. In general, the mini series of the 60 is a must, not only for fans of hippies, but for all who have little curiosity on the subject.
