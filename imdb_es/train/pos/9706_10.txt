The League of Knights is one of the funniest, strangest, dark and unforgettable comedies of our time. So much so, he paved the way for more comedies of his style, many of which have copied the style, but have never been successful. <br /> <br /> Unlike all the other sketches that are shown, the characters in La Liga de los Caballeros are all loosely connected. First of all, they all live in the fictional town of Royston Vasey, in the back of the far north of England. <br /> <br /> The first characters to greet the newcomers are Tubbs and Edwrad, the pig-faced owners of a supposedly local shop located so far away that most residents probably do not know of its existence. Other oddities include: the Denton family, with an obsession with hygiene, chastity and toads; Hillary Briss, who sells a special but fortunately unknown meat brand; Pauline, a reset officer with a sharp tongue and even sharper feathers; Mr. Chinnery, good-hearted veteran and threatens all four-legged things; Geoff Tipps, a plastics salesman with a vicious sense of humor, often involving guns, electric tubes and. . . . . . . PLUMS !!!!! <br /> <br /> Despite being a comedy in the heart, the League of Knights often transcends genres and never seems to be faking or cheating other people's material. There are several references to horror, such as the disappearance of a hiker, a pair of silent twins, an obsessive circus owner and a sudden outbreak of nosebleeds. Even more striking are the moments when the series acquires a more sober tone and the mentioned characters, like Pauline and Geoff, are shown in a more sympathetic and vulnerable light. The film adaptation is the best demonstration of this, but some fans may decide that they belong to a local. <br /> <br /> The third series also underestimated also takes a different route, instead of sketches, each episode focuses on an individual character with each one A story that leads to a conclusion involving a plastic bag and a van of the theater company. Although many fans do not enjoy the structure of the film or the third series as much as the first two, they are undoubtedly an example of how inventive La Liga de Caballeros can be and how scared it is to explore new areas. <br /> <br /> In short, the League of Knights is definitely worth checking out, as the welcome signs say: YOU'LL NEVER LEAVE!
