This is one of the best movies in history, even the best movie in history. I had forgotten about the movie for about 12 years. Until I saw an ad on TV for ADGTH and it brought back fond memories of me when I saw it when I was a little boy. And when I saw him a few nights ago, I became addicted to the movie. In general, I do not like animated family movies, but this one is special, it's the perfect family movie. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie always touches my heart and saddens me a lot, but that's what makes this movie. Incredible better than all the garbage that comes out today for children's movies. I mean that the movie has a G rating and it's about 2 dogs involved in the game, there's a lot of smoking, drinking, killing, dying and hell in the movie. Which I think makes the film from good to excellent. I want to say that today's films do not bring reality to children and in this film they did it. <br /> <br /> RIP Judith Barsi & Dom DeLuise
