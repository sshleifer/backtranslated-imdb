"The Incredible Melting Man" is a fantastically disgusting and energetic Z-grade production that all horror fans in the camps should simply see for themselves. The ideal way to describe this low-budget 70s gem is like a sassy copy of Hammer's "The Quatermass Xperiment" ... only a thousand times dirtier! Astronaust Steve West is the only survivor of a disastrous space mission, but he turns out to be the carrier of a horrible disease that makes him radioactive and ... makes him melt! In shock after seeing his face in the mirror (can you blame him?), Steve leaves the hospital, leaving a trail of sticky pus and dropping body parts. Dr. Ted Nelson has to find it urgently, since the disease also gave Steve an insatiable appetite for human flesh. The premise may seem absolutely stupid, but this movie is hugely entertaining and contains great makeup effects from the hand of Rick Baker. The melting uncle's face looks like a rotten pizza and his heavy breathing makes him sound like Darth Vader. Another great advantage is that the William Sachs script does not waste time in tedious scientific explanations or emotional discourses. The repulsion begins immediately and lasts until the last moment of the movie. Simply enjoy this silly gem of terror and try to turn off your brain activity as much as you can because, if you start to contemplate the stupidities of the script, you'll miss all the fun of camping!
