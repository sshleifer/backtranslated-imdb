Here I thought that "Nanook of the North" was the last word in the archaic semimodal "Eskimo" films. How wrong As an avid sea kayaker, I stayed up until 330 in the morning to see this in the hope of catching a glimpse of some handmade "leather boats". The movie did not disappoint me. Any kayak / umiak construction student should take a look here. (Note to the other SKers: they seem to be using Norton Sound kayaks with single-sheet paddles). <br /> <br /> But the movie went far beyond this limited interest. Even though there were other people who have noticed some small recoil shots, the movie has so much heart that they are just a little annoyance. It was (from the point of view of this very amateur anthropologist) probably the perfect moment to make this film. The first years of the thirties: the 'talkies' are so new that they (including Louie B. Mayer!) Actually let the Inuit speak in their own language. And there is so much that it was still, in spite of the melodrama infused, authentic. They are really hitting that polar bear, that whale and the caribou. A version of the fifty of this movie would have been so corny with "stars", technicolor, etc., to paste it. The seventies version? Not even A very good complementary piece of this excellent film is "White Shadows in the Southern Seas" (1928). Geographically, the specular image of "Eskimo" also deals with the relentless and profound disruption of Western culture / technology in a unsuspecting people
