Cusack does the best that David Niven can do in this case, although I do not know if anyone besides me noticed it. <br /> <br /> When I see it with this in mind, it is a "saturated" one that wants to be taken more seriously. that Austin's powers, but still, it's still pretty. Funny rewrite of an unappreciated comedy classic. <br /> <br /> Hillary Duff makes a version of Mata Bond on the lap of Britney Spears, too sexualized. The writers built a small reverse Oedipus twist in the plot, an interesting option. <br /> <br /> I never knew how calming Montel's voice was to this movie ... I think he found a new call making voices in the navigation system. !
