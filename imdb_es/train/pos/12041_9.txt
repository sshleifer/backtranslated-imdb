This is an old story of spooky ghosts. I showed it to some friends of mine in my movie club, and they were captivated until the end! There is no blood or blood, just a good old fashioned suspense. Start from the beginning, and build and build. The end is a real turn that surprised me. <br /> <br /> Well directed and well acted. It is also a "period piece", set in the 1920s, which adds to the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> I was so impressed that I got Susan Hill's book from Amazon. The movie follows the book quite closely. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that it is not available on DVD. My copy is VHS. This along with "Haunted" are probably two of the best ghost stories I've seen in my life. What shows that a little creativity exceeds "in your face" every day!
