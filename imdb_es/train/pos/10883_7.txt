This is surprisingly superior to the average, it's nice and well done, with some decent blood! All the characters are decent, and the story is quite funny, plus Molly Ringwald played the annoying bitch extremely well. I bought this in a pawnshop for $ 1, and it was surprisingly worth it, and the special effects were very good for the budget, I also loved the mask that the killer wore, since it was actually a bit creepy. The ending was really great, because I loved how they defeated the killer, and the ending, although predictable, was also very fun, in addition, all the characters, except Ringwald, were surprisingly quite nice! It's done and written in a decent way, and I think it was also quite creative and original at times, plus some of the scenes of death were very impressive. This killer did not waste time, and I loved it, and Slasher fans (like me) should really enjoy this movie, besides, the opening was also very bad, with them filming the movie! This is a surprisingly above average slasher, it's nice and it's well done, with some decent blood, and I say it's worth seeing. The address is good. Kimble Rendall does a good! work here with a solid camera job, using a spooky setting, good angles and keeping the movie at a fast pace. The acting is solid! Molly Ringwald plays the bitch extremely well, and I had trouble feeling sorry for her, after all that was supposed to be the heroine, it turned out better in the end, but not much. I'm surprised he decided to make this movie. , however she did an excellent job! Frank Roberts is fantastic as the killer, is threatening, creepy and had an incredible mask, and this guy did not get in, it was fantastic! Kylie Minogue plays the bitch very well in her little role. Jessica Napier is cute and does well like the other heroine. The rest of the cast is fine. In general it is well worth the watch! *** of 5
