People who speak badly about this movie are, to begin with, those who do not understand the film. These are the people who love the box office hits of films and are opposed to any movie other than the star of Leonardo DiCaprio. Wilder Napalm is a clean little movie that may seem extravagant and even stupid at first, but what it lacks in the plot makes up for in substance. <br /> <br /> One thing in particular about the movie that impressed me with its use of music, which plays an important role. Film music students will notice how important music is in the film, both in Vida's life and in Wilder's, and in the background. The theme of Wilder, the theme of Life and the theme of Wallace are heard in the opening sequence, and it is funny how some of the lyrics are reproduced. For example, in the scene where the men sing "Duke of Earl", Vida is with Wilder when the men sing something like "She is my girl", and then she approaches Wallace to give her something when the men sing the lyrics " She will be my girl "who skillfully shows the tension between the two brothers. There are all kinds of small complexities like this one inside the film, and even if it seems a failure abroad, the true film student will realize how good it is. This movie really is.
