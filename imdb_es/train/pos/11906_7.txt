['This documentary about William Castle, William Castle, takes some cheap photos in the naive environment of the 50s-60s in which he did his most characteristic work: he observes funny and silly people with ghost glasses, but he is also affectionate and animated. , with particularly brilliant comments from John Waters, who was absolutely the target audience for those things at the time, and Castle&#39;s daughter, who adored her father and is also quite perceptive about how she exercised her craft. (We never discovered what happened to the other offspring of the castle.) The movies were not very good, that is clear, but his marketing was brilliant, and seems to have been a man of sweet and hardworking family. Funny people keep popping up, like Diane Baker, from &quot;Straight Jacket,&quot; who looks great, and Anne Helm, whom she replaced at the instigation of star Joan Crawford. Darryl Hickman bursts into laughter at the happy memory of having worked with Castle on &quot;The Tingler,&quot; and there are enough pictures to give us an idea of Castle&#39;s level of talent, not very high, but very energetic. A pleasant look at a time when audiences were more easily pleased, and make you feel nostalgic for the simplest days to go to the movies.']
