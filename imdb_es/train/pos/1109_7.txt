Having seen only two of his photos before, I have reached an agreement with Altman. Before, however, he always rated his "boring" movie making style. You just have to be in the right mind to appreciate your crazy genius. <br /> <br /> "Health" is quite understated and very questionable out of print. In fact, I do not think it's ever been aired on VHS. Why is that? When all these fucking movies get DVD releases on a daily basis, is it left without any reason? Honestly, I had no real problems with this movie. It was, for the most part, consistently fun and fun. Almost all the scenes are mysteriously interesting for some reason, be it the wonderful dialogue or the subtle performances. Here is a real skill. <br /> <br /> And Paul Dooley's stay at the bottom of the pool halfway is fascinating. <br /> <br /> If you can, try to find a copy of this forgotten little one. jewel. It's not perfect, but it's much better than most sludges that are released on DVD. Hell, I'd be happy with a good VHS copy of this thing. <br /> <br /> It is often found in the Fox movie channel, so take care of it.
