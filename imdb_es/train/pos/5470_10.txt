BABY FACE is one of the best "forgotten" movies before the code. It was shown last night after the 1931 version of WATERLOO BRIDGE in the TURNER CLASSIC NETWORK, so I was able to see the movie as it is now with four more minutes of the restoration. <br /> <br /> Stanwyck lives in East St. Louis (where she may have met the drunken parents of "Myra", Mae Clarke, in WATERLOO BRIDGE). His father is Robert Barrett. She has lived with him since her mother's death, and (in the restored dialogue) he has been practicing her since she was 14 years old. Now, she is a resident waitress and a part-time whore in hiding, being her closest friend Chico (Theresa Harris), the African-American maid that Barrett continues to harass. One of the two positive points of Stanwyck's personality is that she continues to confront her father over Harris, threatening to leave if Harris is fired (and since they are dirty workers like Nat Pendleton, who like to see Stanwyck serve them, instead of Barrett he has to obey the taste of the dish that serves to serve him. <br /> <br /> The only one who comes regularly to speak who likes Stanwyck is the cobbler and intellectual Adolf Cragg (Alphonse Ethier), who She sees great potential in the energetic girl if she will only leave her abandoned at home, she is also promoting Friedrich Nietzche's philosophy and the idea of ​​the will to power, more on this later. <br /> <br /> After She hits the local political person (Arthur Hohl), and argues with Barrett about this, an explosion still kills Barrett, and allows Stanwyck to leave his hometown.She and Harris head to New York City and manage to obtain transport crane Atuito in a railway car when sleeping with a brakeman (James Murray). They arrive in New York and, after walking, they visit the Gotham Trust Company (established in 1873), and the friendly guard tells him where the personnel office is. <br /> <br /> Slowly, we see how Stanwyck climbs the corporate ladder up, similar (but more sordid) than Robert Morse dared HOW TO HAVE SUCCESS IN BUSINESS WITHOUT TRYING IT REALLY. But Morse was a man in a company dominated by men. Stanwyck knows that his sex appeal is his weapon. It goes by John Wayne, Douglas Dumbrille (a section of the film that I always felt was the most shocking, curiously, when I saw it), Douglas Wood, Henry Kolker and finally George Brent. Each one ends up falling for it, and either being rejected when it is no longer useful, or destroyed by it. Brent, the new president of the bank that founded his grandfather, finally marries her, and the crisis of the film is when the bank's economic situation is affected (especially after Brent buys him a fortune in jewelry and gives him valuable bonuses). Brent is accused. Will she defend it? <br /> <br /> SOON SPOILER: <br /> <br /> The only thing that is not admitted about these films is that the theatrical and moral conventions of the time still dictated the endings. The original ending caused Stanwyck to board a ship for Europe to abandon Brent to his destination, but realizing that he can not do so, return to his apartment house and discover that he has fired himself. She is traveling with him to the hospital when it ends. Now, before the rediscovered images were found, the film ended up with the apparently giving all their money to the bank to save it, and they retired to East St. Louis, to live happily if they are poor. <br /> <br /> Neither of these are good endings. Stanwyck should continue on his destructive course, with Brent as the last of his victims. But even without Breen's office, script writers (one of them is Darryl Zanuck, by the way) considered it appropriate that she find a moral center. She has none, at least none for powerful men (whom she hates). I do not think a depression audience would have tolerated that kind of conclusion. <br /> <br /> There are other problems, due to changes in the styles of public opinion and changes in society. It was a world of men in the corporate world in 1933, so Stanwyck has a great job for her. Wood (when they're going to fire her out of indiscretion with him) admits that she did not want her to work. <br /> <br /> But in 2006, Stanwyck would have been finding women everywhere. In the film there are unpleasant and malicious comments (obviously some based on jealousy) towards Stanwyck from other secretaries and employees in their rapid rise. In 2006, he would often face superior women, and find them cutting her quickly in the legs. Of course, if you find that one or two are lesbians, you might try that way but it's doubtful. And she does not seem to know any man who is gay either. They have male gay executives in business, who do not care about their legs or breasts. <br /> <br /> Then there is your mentor, Mr. Cragg. Cragg is remade in the "reduced" version to try to find a moral center. Actually, he pushes Nieztsche, but the way the Nazis pushed Nieztsche (in a broader sense) is to find the way to power and push him. While Nieztsche emphasized power at times, it was not the beginning and the end of all his theories. Otherwise nobody would read it today in university courses. Cragg is obviously self-taught, but only semidivated. In short, if someone who studied Nieztsche thoroughly would face Cragg, he would make him look like a half-educated fool. And this is Stanwyck's mentor! A good movie, and for his day it's worth 10 ... but with serious flaws.
