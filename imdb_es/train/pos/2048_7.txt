A brutally depressing script and some good low-key performances by Peter Strauss and Pamela Reed and some good shots at the location in Ohio propel this good television movie about hard times in the seat belt. As factories are closed and union jobs disappear, blue collar workers are threatened by everyone: management, owners, their wives and children. Strauss is completely credible in her role, and Pamela Reed is, as always, wonderful. See if you can recognize John Goodman before he gained weight. <br /> <br /> The heavy metal score: was someone playing a word game? - It is, sometimes, annoying, but the cinematography of Frank Stanley is spectacular, particularly in the scenes of the mill.
