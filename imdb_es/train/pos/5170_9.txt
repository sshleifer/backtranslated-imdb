I rented this movie when it came out on video and I enjoyed it a lot. I had the opportunity to buy it on DVD a few weeks ago and I have seen it several times since then. I would have to agree with the others when they said that Indian Summer was a nostalgic movie. When I look at it I would like to be able to have 10-14 again. I think that's why we all like the movie to a certain extent. We all sometimes wish to be able to relive our lives as children with the wisdom / knowledge of adults. Would not it be nice if all your friends / parents are young again? To not have to worry about his work, being a father, etc.? I know I'd like to jump into a De Lorean and go back in time. Although I enjoyed the movie a lot, my favorite movie of the all-time camp is Meatballs with Bill Murray. I wish they could do an Indian Summer version of that.
