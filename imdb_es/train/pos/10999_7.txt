This movie is about this weak guy who decides to become a spy for a glamorous high-tech company called Digicorp. This lean boy, Morgan (Jeremy Northam) is unhappy with his miserable suburban life and demanding wife, so he decides to become a spy. He is supposed to go to conventions of other high-tech companies and find out all the plans of the companies. Instead, Morgan is attracted to a beautiful woman (played by Lucy Liu) and practically these two companies force him to become a double agent. How will Morgan get rid of this? Can you trust the beautiful but mysterious Rita Foster (played by Lucy Liu)? And most importantly, can Morgan come out alive? Woohoo! What a clever movie! I was completely impressed after 15 minutes of watching this movie. It is very exciting and you can feel Morgan's fear and confusion when he is doing everything possible to stay alive. The scene in which they put this horrible contraption on Morgan's head to brainwash him is brilliantly creepy and terrifying. Morgan is slowly going through a personality transformation that is not so obvious until you think about it once the movie is finished. From a weak boy with hair and bad glasses, he becomes a man who actively fights for his life. <br /> <br /> The ending, wow, the ending is amazing! The turn is very fun! It left me panting and screaming like crazy! Good performances from everyone, especially from Jeremy Natham, Lucy Liu and Nigel Bennett. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie!
