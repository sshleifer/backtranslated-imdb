['Like many of you, I&#39;m a big fan of the real, the noir movies of the 1940s, but Red Rock West was a real treat for all of us who yearn for the past. The term &#39;neo-noir&#39; has been used so often inappropriately in the last ten years that it has lost its meaning and impact. John Dahl&#39;s film, on the other hand, really deserved to be described as such. The cast is perfect everywhere and you would have felt at home with Tay Garnett or Jacques Tourneur. The plot is so narrow that you&#39;re hooked in the first fifteen minutes. James M. Cain would have appreciated it. Many contemporary films leave me wondering why they do not do them like they used to, and I&#39;m not even that old. Movies like Red Rock West give us hope for the future while paying tribute to the past.']
