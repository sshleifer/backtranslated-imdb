['I do not think this was an acting challenge for Richard Harris. This was a plot without complications, but interesting. It&#39;s a good movie to watch when you do not want to think too much, you just want to be told a simple story. The Canadian landscape was impressive. The beautiful autumn shots only made the image worthwhile.']
