Bell Book and Candle was released in December 1958 and features James Stewart, Kim Novak, Jack Lemmon. and Ernie Kovaks. This film had James Stewart and Kim Novak in their second couple on screen (after the Alfred Hitchcock Vertigo classic, released earlier that year). This was Stewart's last film as a romantic protagonist, since at age 50 he was considered too old to play that kind of role. The film is about a witch played by Kim Novak, who is attracted to a mortal played by James Stewart. She bewitches him and he falls madly in love with her. I enjoyed the movie and its cast. This film at that time was a moderate success that was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture Comedy. GimmeClassics
