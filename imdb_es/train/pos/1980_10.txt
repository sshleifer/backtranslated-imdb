One of the last great musicals of the 60s. I was 7 years old the first time I saw this movie, and since then it has always been my favorite. The musical numbers are all memorable. In the 1960s, people who were chosen in musicals had musical talent (unlike a CERTAIN Academy Award nominated for a current musical based in a large Midwestern city). All the leading roles were beautifully chosen ... Ron Moody shines as Fagin, as does Shani Wallis as Nancy. Oliver Reed was a menacing Bill Sikes (who fortunately does not have musical numbers, hahaha), and Mark Lester as Oliver and Jack Wild as Dodger were also great. Mark Lester introduces himself as an innocent person, which is what Dickens intended when he wrote the book! Then, of course, there are dozens of dancers acting in "consider yourself", "I would do anything", "Who will buy" and "We will be back soon", many of them were children! This is a great show for the whole family.
