I also just returned from an advanced screening of Redeye and I must say that I have not had so much fun in a movie in a long time. WES CRAVEN is at its best. He brings us an amazing end-of-summer thriller that he craved desperately. This is the thriller of the year ... without a doubt. <br /> <br /> All the actors are incredible and the action is realistic and fun. The F / Xs were great. Suspense was constantly built. I was on the edge of my seat for most of the movie. It has been a while since I heard an audience cheering and applauding and getting excited in a theater. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for emotions, action and a GOOD plot this summer, REDEYE complies. Go see it!
