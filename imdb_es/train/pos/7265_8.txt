Good story. Good script Good casting. Good performance Good direction Good art direction. Good photography Good sound. Good edition All good. Put it all together and it will end with good entertainment. <br /> <br /> The shame of this is that there are not enough movies of this caliber these days. We may consider ourselves fortunate that writers / directors like John Hughes can occasionally make their creative voices heard. <br /> <br /> Whenever I realize that I'm watching a movie for the third or fourth time and I still find it. totally satisfactory, I have to conclude that something about that movie is correct.
