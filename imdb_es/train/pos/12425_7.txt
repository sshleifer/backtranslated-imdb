Like I said, it's a hidden surprise. It is well written, well acted and well fused. I liked everything in this movie. Look that Hollywood is fine but the brighter side. Angelina Jolie is great at this and I'm watching all the movies with her and I can have it in my hands. It is worth taking a look.
