***** Spoilers here ***** <br /> <br /> What really scares you? Killer sharks, or maybe ghosts trying to return a message? Maybe a psycho with a chainsaw? <br /> <br /> Maybe. But those fears do not even compare with the horror that people do not even dare to speak or consider, and that is the death of their own son. "Pet Sematary" takes advantage of this base, the primary fear of adults, and then takes it to places that most can not explore. <br /> <br /> I have read comments about this movie that include bad acting, characters that do stupid things. Decisions, etc. I do not agree. The acting is actually first class for a movie like this. It may be impossible for many to imagine the desperation that results from such a scenario. But the events of the film are not only logical, but can be absolutely inevitable if such a scenario were possible. This is the true horror of "Pet Sematary": it is not that pets and people return from the dead as evil killers who hunt with knives and scalpels, it is that anyone who has lost a child could become so desperate as to commit The crimes that Louis Creed does. Despite warnings, or even past history. <br /> <br /> The film leads to those who are willing to go to the depths of a desperate human heart. The heart of a protector trying to compensate for not being able to protect. And the results are horrible. In fact, when the film is submerged in the territory of the slasher near the end, it is almost a disappointment, although I think it is perfectly logical how it got there. <br /> <br /> I'm a true horror fan, and I argue that this is one of the most terrifying horror movies ever made. If you do not believe it, see it again after having children.
