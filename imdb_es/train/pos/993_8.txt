Actually this movie was not so bad. It contains action, comedy and emotion. There are good actors in this movie, for example Doug Hutchison (Percy from "The Green Mile"), who plays Bristol. Another well-known actor is Jamie Kennedy, from "Scream" and "Three Kings". Jamie Foxx plays the main characters as Alvin, who was quite good and also fun, but the one who surprised me most was David Morse as Edgar Clenteen. He plays a character different from what he usually does, because in other films like "The Green Mile", "Indian Runner", "The Negotiator" or "The Langoliers" he plays a very nice person, and in "Bait" the played almost the opposite, a man without emotions, which was nice to see. The only really negative aspect of this movie are the various images of the World Trade Center, which makes this film seem a little outdated. In general, I thought it was a pretty good little movie!
