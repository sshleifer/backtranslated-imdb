A stunner of previous codes with Stanwyck playing a quiet whore who sleeps to the top. These pre-encoded movies really let everything go with nothing to the imagination. Stanwyck stands out as Lilly, the daughter of a clandestine father / owner who sold more than alcohol to his clients (Johns). After the old man dies (well!) Barb goes to the big city in search of better things. Use your feminine attributes to Sleep your way to the top. John Wayne makes a poor "cameo" and shows that the actors improve with age and with an interim coach. I loved the jokes and the strong lines between the actors. I highly recommend this movie to all movie fans and to see Stanwyck, who is great and beautiful as Lilly.
