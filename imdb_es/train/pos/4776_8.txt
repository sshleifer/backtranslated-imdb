I was watching this movie in one of my usual hours, which is very real at night. Usually, if a movie does not interest me, I start to fall asleep and I have to attack the refrigerator to stay awake. <br /> <br /> At first I thought that was what I had to do since the rhythm of this movie started slowly. along with the fact that his shots tended to stay with the character for a long time. But after a while, I start to get more into the movie, as it reveals more about the main character through his storytelling. In the end, you feel that you have known it all your life. The movie kept my interest so much that I did not even know that the sun was about to come out. <br /> <br /> Not much of Lynch's bizzare style, but there are enough extravagant characters to make the movie fun.
