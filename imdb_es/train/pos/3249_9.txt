Corbin Bernsen sent letters to four criminal associates with whom he has worked in the past and is a true intergenerational mix with Fred Gwynne, Lou Diamond Phillips, William Russ and Ruben Blades. They will meet him in this dark city of Montana and he does not explain why, because the state police of New Jersey picked him up in a court order. <br /> <br /> Of the criminal group that has met, everyone knows Bernsen, but they do not know each other. A lot of comedy involved are they feeling at each other. As the oldest Gwynne, although he denies it, he takes care of the others complaining, but he keeps going. Especially when they discover what Bernsen had in mind. <br /> <br /> As for Bernsen, he is lucky enough to be picked up by a pair of bumblebees by Ed O'Neill and Daniel Roebuck. He drops on O'Neill and escapes. <br /> <br /> After that, it's the four criminals who try to finish what Bernsen started and Bernsen escapes from the police. In the intricately drawn script, it is fascinating how both lines of history intersect with each other. Hoyt Axton, like the local sheriff, looks with amazement at what is happening in his city. <br /> <br /> Disorganized Crime is a fabulously funny caper movie from a group of players who seem to have had television experience or soon. I can not say that someone has excelled in the cast, they also seem to fit so well together. <br /> <br /> Ironically, none of these people are comedians per se, but they all exhibit a slight comedic touch that good direction produced. <br /> <br /> The disorganized crime is a very funny movie, the kind of film that the well-known pessimist Murphy would have written.
