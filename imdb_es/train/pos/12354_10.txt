A wonderful movie to watch with amazing scenes and talented actors, such as Misa Shimizu and Nagiko Tono. After 15 minutes of observation, your eyes are blocked on the screen and you do nothing but breathe in the atmosphere of the film waiting for what the destiny will bring to the characters. This film makes you abandon your position as a standard audience, it includes you, makes you part of the story ... The costumes and settings are brilliant; Especially the okiyas district is skillfully built. Definitely not very Akira Kurosawa, however, still receives a lot from the teacher, especially the stylistic narrative tells us that we are in a distinguished land of cinema that is very far from the Hollywood extravaganza.
