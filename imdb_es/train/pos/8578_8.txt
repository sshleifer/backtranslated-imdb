This movie is one of the best American movies of the 90s. If you are looking for a serious movie, look elsewhere. However, if you are looking for some action, a lot of laughter and a variation in the face of the police who fight against the mobsters, it is worth seeing. Everyone chews the landscape a bit, but that's what the movie is about, and they're all pretty funny. Donald Sutherland and John Lithgow have a great chemistry and they need to make another film together.
