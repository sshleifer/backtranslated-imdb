I agree with what the "vein breaker" wrote about the "Ahhhh" feeling that you get at the end of this movie. I loved the places they chose to shoot, the songs were well written and interesting, especially the psychedelic sound track in which Hans Matheson sings. It is trippy Nighy was fabulous in his role, Nail "nailed" him, Beano was the typical drummer and Rea kept him together. Bruce Robinson was amazing. Helena was a lovely girlfriend. But I felt that Juliet Aubrey's performance was magnificent. The scenes between Aubrey and Robinson killed me! Perfectly played and the music behind the scenes was perfect! What a pity that there are not many more musicians who have seen this movie! They must! I've told all my musician friends. Great quote from the character of Jimmy Nail: "It's supposed to be rock & roll, not the Phantom of the great opera!"
