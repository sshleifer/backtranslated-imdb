With this film being the only Dirty Harry movie that Clint Eastwood not only stars, but also produces and directs, you know it must be good. Although some say that The Enforcer is the best of the series, I totally disagree. In my opinion, apart from the original Dirty Harry, Sudden Impact and Magnum Force are the only two worthy of being in the series. Although The Enforcer is a good movie with a couple of good action sequences, it does not have the dirty and harsh impact that the other three movies have. This film captures all the emotion that makes a Clint Eastwood movie good, and has the quotes that make a dirty Harry movie good. In Diry Harry is "... Well, punk?"; in Magnum Force "A man has to know his limitations"; and in this it is "Go ahead, make my day." Also in this movie it's nice to see a change of scenery, since you get a little tired of seeing the same old streets of San Francisco in the other movies of the series. With the great performance of Clint Eastwood and his co-star Sandra Locke, and the good direction of Clint, this is, in my opinion, the best sequel to Dirty Harry of all time.
