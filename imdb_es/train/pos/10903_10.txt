['This man is nothing short of amazing. You really feel that you have lived your life with him throughout these tragic events, and in the end you cry together with his family. He was so passionate about his cause, not only for himself, but for making sure that others who survive him do not have to go through this terrible pain. I watch this video every time I have a bad day or &quot;fallen&quot;, and always manages to make me see the best and brightest side of life, like Jonny, even with his unbearable pain. My only regret is that I did not know about Jonny before, since I visited England twice during his life, and I could have said I had met him. It&#39;s comforting to know that Jonny is sitting in his cloud, pain free! Rest in peace, dear Jonny. You deserve it!']
