The first two sequences of this film configure the two conflicts: the -mathematical- conflict between soldier Todd and his repressed humanity, and the -physical- conflict between Todd and his replacement of biological engineering. Both sequences are quite exciting in different ways. <br /> <br /> The Peoples script wobbles a bit by solving the first of these arcs in the middle of the movie, which means that the second half is little more than a simple action game. <br /> <br /> Nonetheless, congratulations to the creators for creating a piece of action of gender with heart and even a bit of soul and especially to Kurt Russell who transmits a lot with very little. <br /> <br /> It's not a Great movie, but it's worth seeing.
