Historical drama and the coming of age of the history of free people of color in the civil war before New Orleans. Start slowly, but it fills with steam once you've learned about the main characters and the real action can begin. This is not just a story about the exploitation of black women, because they were free people. It is possible that they did not have all the rights of the whites, but they certainly had more control over their destinies than their slave ancestors. Young men and women in this story must make their own choice about how to live their lives, whether to surrender to the depravity of the system or live optimistically and contribute to their community. I enjoyed all the characters, but my favorites were Christophe, Anna Bella and Marcel.
