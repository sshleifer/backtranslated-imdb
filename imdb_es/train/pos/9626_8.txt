['Warning! Spoilers ahead! <br /><br /> SPOILERS <br /><br /> I&#39;ve seen a movie in German, so it could be, that I missed some clues. <br /><br /> Despite some weakness in the plot, it&#39;s a movie that came to me. I especially liked the performance of Lexa Doig. Sometimes I have the impression that she is Camille. But I can not help but wonder what happened at the end with Bob, Cassie and my baby. I believe that she, after having initially placed herself in Bob, finally ended up loving him and regretting what happened to her brother and was forced to lie to him. Otherwise it&#39;s a bit strange, that she would take her baby and love him. It&#39;s up to the viewer to decide, and I do not like those endings. Dean Cain was as good as ever, Eric Roberts ... well, I&#39;ve seen better but also worse. <br /><br /> I think the film is more an analysis of human relationships and a reaction to unexpected situations than a story of a crime. <br /><br /> The truth is I really liked it.']
