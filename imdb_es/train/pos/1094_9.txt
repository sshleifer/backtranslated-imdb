This is one of the few comedies that I can watch again and again and still laugh out loud. In other places, I have read complaints about racism and sexism based on sensible and politically correct ideas. There is none here, unless you define sexism as a woman as the housewife and racism as a family that employs a maiden of color. <br /> <br /> The lines are hilarious, and all the opportunities have never been better. Melvin Douglas is especially brilliant. <br /> <br /> If you have ever thought about or tried to build a new house, you will be relieved to know that no matter how infuriating the process, no matter how much a lamb counts. Wolves that you can feel, you're not alone!
