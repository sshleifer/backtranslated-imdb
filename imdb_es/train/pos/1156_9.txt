Years ago I followed a soap on TV. So I was curious about this movie, and I was rewarded for finding it. It's a wonderful parody of soaps, with jealousy, the usual insecurities of the actors and all kinds of charming excesses. But more than anything, an incredible cast and an incredible script. How did someone get all those first-rate actors to play in such a silly movie? And how did this little movie make the writers write the perfect lines? I never hear anyone talking about this movie, I do not even admit that I heard it, but it's wonderful and I recommend seeing it. Sometimes I wear it while cleaning the house, and I end up sitting on the couch, watching, laughing and enjoying everything wonderful. Congratulations to all who did it.
