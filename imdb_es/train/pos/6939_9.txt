I was very impressed with this movie. I would have to qualify it as one of the best westerns of the classical era. I say it for everything: acting, mature dialogue, sensible history and excellent cinematography. <br /> <br /> Director Anthony Mann, who made several well-photographed film films at this time, also made some westerns like this one. It has that same black cinema look. Mann and Jimmy Stewart collaborated on several westerns during this period. . If you like this movie, I recommend the Mann-Stewart movie "Bend Of The River". <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, the story is about a man, "Lin McAdam" (Stewart), owner of this prestigious Winchester 73 rifle, a weapon he won just in a contest. Then it is stolen and passed from villain to villain. All those villains are interesting characters. <br /> <br /> Helping Stewart to represent this interesting story are Shelley Winters, Dan Duryea, Stephen McNally, Millard Mitchell, Charles Drake, Will Greer and J. C. Flippen. They are all fun to watch. However, it was a bit difficult to see Rock Hudson playing an Indian ("Young Bull"), but you can not have everything.
