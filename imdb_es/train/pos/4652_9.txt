I think this movie is well made and realistic. If you are used to watching Hollywood "action" movies and use it as a standard to rate this movie, you are bound to feel disappointed. This movie is much closer to real life than 95% of what Hollywood can produce, and that's what elevates it above the average action movie. I have no experience with the Swedish army at all, and therefore I can not point out any error in the way they act. But as I have seen the extra "making of", I am convinced that a lot has been done to avoid mistakes. This is a film that I will recommend for others to see. High quality realistic film and history.
