In Paris, the shy and insecure bureaucrat Trelkovsky (Roman Polanski) rents an old apartment without a bathroom where the previous tenant, the Egyptologist Simone Choule (Dominique Poulange), committed suicide. The unfriendly janitor (Shelley Winters) and the harsh owner Mr. Zy (Melvyn Douglas) establish strict rules of behavior and Trekovsky feels harassed by his neighbors. Meanwhile, he visits Simone at the hospital and befriends his girlfriend Stella (Isabelle Adjani). After the death of Simone, Trekovsky feels obsessed by her and believes that her landlord and her neighbors are plotting a plan to force him to commit suicide as well. <br /> <br /> The strange "Le Locataire" is a disturbing and spooky story of paranoia and deception. The story and the process of madness and loss of identity of the Trelkovsky solitaire develop slowly in a nightmarish environment in the appalling location of his apartment, and what is happening is totally unpredictable. The performances are impressive and Isabelle Adjani is extremely beautiful. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Tenant" ("The tenant")
