I loved the movie. I loved the two families that cross paths in history. The only question is if Sam dies, how does his family line continue? He is the son of Madame Zeroni and Zero is supposed to be related, but is not any other boy mentioned? Hmmmmmmmmm Did you never mention any other son or wife before talking to him and falling in love with the teacher? Maybe she had a son before she became the kissing Kate Bandit? Even with the mistakes in the movie. Simply I loved it. The performance was great. I'm not sure where the story was with Mr. Sir being Marion a woman at the end, but it makes his character even more fun. The other "counselor" seemed concerned about the children but, of course, maybe not so much. The poor director must have had a really stinky childhood to be so cruel when he grew up.
