Finally! An Iranian film that is not made by Majidi, Kiarostami or Makhmalbafs. This is a non-documentary, an entertaining black comedy with subversive girls that subtly kicks the "system" in their butt. It's about football and it's fun, it's really fun. The director says that "the places are real, the event is real, and so are the characters and extras, which is why I purposely chose not to use professional actors, since their presence would have introduced a notion of falsehood." Those who are not actors will have you encouraging them immediately unless a. your heart is made of stone b. You're blind. With excellent writing, the film challenges patriarchal authority with an almost absurd freshness. He has won the Grand Jury Prize, Berlin, 2006. Dear reader, it is almost perfect. Where, where can I get it?
