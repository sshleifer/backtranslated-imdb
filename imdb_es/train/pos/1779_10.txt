['I love this movie! 10 of 10 hands down! That is very good! I&#39;m not a big fan of movies, but I must tell you that this opened my eyes. Amazing color and fast energy. I was lucky to see this in a screening during the Zoinks! Film festival in Boston, and the story really wrapped me from the beginning. He had many themes and characters for adults and when he finished, he wanted more. I hope you make a sequel. That would be fun. My only problem with this is the performance of Melissa Connor as Anya. UGH! She sucks. I&#39;ve seen a block of wood get a better performance. I do not know what the director was thinking when he threw her out. But if you ignore it, you can not avoid giving this movie ten big ones.']
