['(No spoilers, just details of the plot) I can not understand so much hate for this episode. Do you want to see a bad episode of Smallville? See Subterranean - now there is a sack of garbage. Tom Welling gives a good performance (I do not say it very often), and Michael Rosenbaum is great, but most of the time he is. The scenario of the alternative universe seems disturbingly realistic. The Martian hunter, who appeared earlier in &quot;Static&quot;, returns and tells Clark that the doctor who is the head of the insane asylum in which they are being held is actually a ghost from the ghost zone, and if Clark wants to return to his universe, you must kill it. A great general episode, with good performance and a decent pace.']
