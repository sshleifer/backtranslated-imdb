House of Games is a wonderful movie on multiple levels. It's a good mystery and a shocking thriller. He is blessed with the wonderful performances of Lindsay Crouse and Joe Montegna, and a strong and strong cast of supporting players, and introduces Ricky Jay, extraordinary card player, conjuror and magic historian. His dialogue, written by David Mamet, is spoken as if it were a game of manners and gives the film (in which reality is often questioned) an additional dimension of unreality. <br /> <br /> In the face of this, House of Games is a compelling vision of the unknown world of cheaters and cheats, diametrically different from The Sting, played only by glamor and yuks. On this level, he has an admirable success. <br /> <br /> However, you can not escape from the examination at a deeper level of a woman's odyssey, from the complacent professional competence to the incredible strength and self-realization. The only movie I know that deals with the emergence of personal strength in a woman as worthy is the undervalued soldier Benjamin. Unfortunately, that nice movie diffuses its focus, jumping between various themes and exploiting Goldie Hawn's excellent performance to pursue some easy laughs. House of Games adheres to your business. As Poe once said of a good short story, he comes relentlessly to his conclusion. <br /> <br /> There is another variety of films about women, personified by Thelma and Louise, a great creator of big-budget commercial money with the despicable theme that women are condemned, whether they realize their strengths or not. internal What nonsense. <br /> <br /> As usual, you should really see this movie in a movie theater. It must be something natural for film festivals. Name it for one near you if you have the opportunity. <br /> <br /> I bought the original version of House of Games and gave it to my 23 year old daughter. I better see it on a TV than not watch it.
