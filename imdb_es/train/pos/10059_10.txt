['This movie is the best movie of all. I do not remember the last time a movie made me cry. With a tear in my eye, I admire this movie. It has all the elements that a good movie should have: excellent dialogues, music, acting, story / plot. A story of friendship, courage, kindness and loyalty between a street performance famous for The King of Masks and a girl who sold as a child in a servants&#39; bazaar. The girl liked to be his granddaughter and the King of Masks liked a grandson. They were not conventional in reality. Each scene they were together had no price. The work of the camera is impeccable and it catches you. The performance is inspired. Xu Zhu was excellent as the king of masks. Renying Zhou &quot;Doggie&quot; looks pretty and played very well with her character. Zhigang Zhao as Liang Sao Lang was great. He played his kind and helpful character very well. If you do not have this movie, try it once, see it.']
