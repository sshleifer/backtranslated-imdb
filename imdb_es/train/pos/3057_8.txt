Wow, I really liked this movie, William H. Macy is great as the Sicilist Alex. <br /> <br /> All the performances here are really good, the plot is interesting and entertaining. <br /> <br /> Alex, a married hit man (like his father) with a young son, goes through a middle-aged crisis and wants to leave the family business, so he goes to the psychiatrist for help and in this place he meet with young people for free. It will be the spirit of Sarah who falls in love with. One day, Alex does not know what to do when he gets a job to kill a person he knows. <br /> <br /> I recommend that you see it if you like interesting and mature films. <br /> <br /> 8 stars = very good
