Jay Chou plays an orphan raised in a kung fu school, but expelled by the corrupt director after fighting with a group of thugs in the employment of an infamous villain. He meets the trickster Eric Tsang, who immediately sees the cash potential in the young man's abilities. Basketball is the avenue chosen for wealth, and Tsang is committed to getting him a position in a University team and promoting it in the media. The overall success leads to a basketball championship and a really nasty rival team managed by the same nefarious villain as before. <br /> <br /> I guess it's all a bit of Shaolin Soccer, but not so quirky or ridiculous: the plot is pretty close to the conventions of sports films, and it offers all the elements that the public expects from the installation. You've seen it all before, but it's the kind of thing that never hurts to see again when it's done well. Fortunately, it's actually done well here (some might say 'surprisingly' with Chu Yen-Ping in the director's chair ... I guess he had good 'assistants'): the script is presented and the presentation is elegant and stylish. Jay Chou remains quite expressionless in everything, but such is his style, and when he lets an emotion flow, it can be a pretty good comic effect. Eric Tsang compensates with a bigger character than the life he has played many times before (in real life, for example) that gets many of the most emotional moments of the film. <br /> <br /> Since the film revolves around basketball, it is good that the scenes of the basketball games wake up properly. The cast shows some real skill, including Chou, and some well done wirework and CGI add that hyperreal kung fu skill element that makes the scenes even more entertaining (assuming you like that kind of thing) and justify the plot / existence of the movie. <br /> <br /> There is only one significant fight scene in the movie, but it is a "one against many" style. Jay Chou seems to make many of his own moves, and it's quite impressive: it's clearly quite strong and fast, and Ching Siu-Tung's choreography makes him look like a true martial artist. I wish there had been more, but at least it's a long fight. <br /> <br /> Very much like the big box office success of the Chinese New Year that I expected to be out of the trailer and I recommended seeing it!
