Trick or Treat, Quickie Review This movie outing revolves around the culture of Heavy Metal and the horror movies of the 80s, two things that I love. Then, as you can imagine, this movie attracted me quite easily. Also, for no apparent reason, Ozzy Osbourne plays a preacher. <br /> <br /> This movie is about an unpopular young man in high school who, like all losers, ended up soaked in a world of "bad" Heavy Metal. Her favorite Metaldude dies and, of course, miraculously resuscitates, by playing her last unreleased album backwards. This allows the corpsified singer to kill people with demons and sh * t help. <br /> <br /> Well, sometimes it's pretty corny, but you know what? It has a surprising number of good qualities. Decent performance (including Gene Simmons as radio DJ), pretty good special effects, very short nudes, decent atmosphere ... In general, it's a decent horror movie. But what really sucks is the music. Ironic, huh? Well, this "super-evil" type of Metal is one of the most unpleasant, sharp, laments, Motley Crue rejects on the planet, and the "Metal" is little more than a Pop / Hair Metal pop of the 80's. He hits all the clich√©s here, from wandering like a gay fairy, to looking bad, to shouting "Rock and Roll!" in a tone high enough to make the Diamond King vomit. Apart from that atrocious musical performance, it's actually quite good. 7/10 <br /> <br /> www.ResidentHazard.com
