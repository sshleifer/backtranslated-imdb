Some may feel that the rating I just gave is a little generous, but as far as this movie is, I think the directors have done a good job with the one they had at their disposal. This is also a movie of an acquired taste! <br /> <br /> My immediate thought was the direct connection to the classic cult film 'The Thing', that is, the parasitic aliens of space, infesting the human host to quench the chaos whenever possible. <br /> <br /> You can see how this film pays homage to a movie of this kind and others of the horror / gore genre, although it cleverly maintains its own originality, well, these things fight with each other for one and then continue eating the fallen opponent! Just kill and choose a human when you need a new guest! Then choose another fight with another infected host! And this movie even throws a love story, but I will not say anything else, otherwise it gives way too much. <br /> <br /> GREAT! But as I said of an acquired taste, do not be surprised if you do not like the movie. It is low budget and yes, it thirsts for blood, with the creatures / aliens / things transforming their limbs into coarse-looking weapons, ie saws, drills, blades and even the odd weapon to decimate all, but decimate their opponent I found myself shrugged by what they were showing me, but at the same time stuck to the screen asking me what would happen next. <br /> <br /> So if you like gore, you like aliens, you like to fight and maybe even some love thrown in somewhere, then I should recommend this movie as a must. I wish I had found this sooner than I did!
