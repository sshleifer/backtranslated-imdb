Johny To makes here one of his best style exercises, making a strong movie with a good Yakuza story. The election of the new Yakuza boss is the beginning of a war within the organization. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, violence is used wisely in the context, making a very strong gang movie. Especially I love the way he tells the story, moving through all the roles within the Yakuza family and making us see the violence, as the only way they have to solve their problems ... <br /> <br /> Speaking about, the technical aspects, the film is a good example of the slow, rhythmic and planned way of filming a movie. One of the Hong Kong movies of the year. It's like hellish affairs, but without the easy scenes of action violence and confusing plot. Highly recommended for all lovers of Asian cinema. <br /> <br /> (sorry for my English, better do it in Spanish hahaha)
