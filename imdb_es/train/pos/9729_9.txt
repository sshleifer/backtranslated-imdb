Weak start, solid medium, fantastic finish. That's my impression of this movie, anyway. I liked Simon Pegg in the two movies I've seen him in --- Hot Fuzz, and Shaun of the Dead. His role here, however, took a completely different turn. It shows his rank as an actor, but nevertheless, I did not like the character much, since he was represented at the beginning. <br /> <br /> There is a kind of humor that I call "comedy of frustration". Their supposed "jokes" and ingenuity are only painful and uncomfortable moments. Like the character of Bean Rowan Atkinson plays. There are a number of other comic actors who portray similar characters as well. I have no intention of hitting you here, so I will not. <br /> <br /> But keep in mind that if you're like me, and you do not like kind and maddening idiots, Pegg shows those characteristics for the first time. Third of this movie. However, YES it improves. <br /> <br /> I read somewhere that this is based on a real story. Hmmm Maybe. The story of the film stopped being annoying and became a kind of "small" triumph in the last third. I do not need all the films to be sugar and light, but coincidentally, as this film improved, it also began to be increasingly a happy ending. <br /> <br /> It was also a pleasure To see an old favorite, Jeff Bridges, plays such a masterful role. I liked "Iron Man", but I was saddened by the fact that Bridges' character was a villain. The purely personal taste, of course, as his acting in that was excellent. However, it was a wonder here as the vision man of Bigger Than Life, the editor of Sharps. It was nice to see him in a role that he could really enjoy. <br /> <br /> In general, I liked it! I wish I had arrived 40 minutes late and I would have missed the beginning.
