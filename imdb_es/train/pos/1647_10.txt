['Excellent. With repentance and true representation of the life of the pioneer ranch in the western plains with an emphasis on the role and place of women. A movie in movement, made with love and based on real people and their real experiences. Low budget, independent film; he never made money. Definitely not the romantic and unrealistic Hollywood version of the pioneer life.']
