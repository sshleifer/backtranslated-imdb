I liked this program very much: we obtained the first and only series in the United Kingdom on channel 4. The characterization was successful, as the Simpsons, since all the different facets of the population of the small cities represented. <br /> <br /> There was no hint of laughter: I had not seen this in an American television comedy at the time, except Larry Sanders, and it really worked well here, which accentuates the suggestion that these crazy cops were I like it a lot, and not just for the cameras. <br /> <br /> In general, a peculiar little number that tickled me: I can not stop thinking that maybe I did not see it. certain audiences I think it would have been a cult hit in the UK if it had been shown at an acceptable hour. <br /> <br /> I will round this up with my standard comment: Where the hell can I get this to see it again? Any ideas?
