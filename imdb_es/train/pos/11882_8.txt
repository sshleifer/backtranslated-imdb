This movie was for a while in my collection, but was it not before a friend of mine reminded me of it? Until I decided that I should see it. I did not know much about Close to Leo? just that it was supposed to be excellent to get out of the old movie and that deals with a very serious issue? AIDS. <br /> <br /> Although the person who has help ?? Is it leo? the scenario involves the way in which Marcel (Leo's younger brother) strikes with the illness of his relative. At first everyone is trying to hide the truth from Marcel. Do you think you're too young to understand your brother's illness? the fact that Leo is also homosexual contributes to the unwillingness of the parents to discuss the matter with young Marcel. I know from experience that, on many occasions, most seniors do not want to accept the fact that sometimes, even when someone is young, this does not automatically mean that they will not be able to accept reality and act in a more appropriate way than they. same. With the exception of the fact that the family tried to hide the truth from Marcel, have they left me with a good impression? The way they supported their son? Even after discovering the truth about his sexuality and his illness. Did the fact that they allowed the young Marcel to travel with Leo to Paris to meet his ex-boyfriend go hand in hand with them? Most of the families I know will be reluctant to do that. There is a lot of warmth in the scenes in which the brothers spend time together? You can see them as true friends, concerned about each other. <br /> <br /> Near Leo is an excellent drama, which I highly recommend
