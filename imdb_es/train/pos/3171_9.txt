Bizco is a very original and funny movie. I think Adam Jones brings a refreshing new set of eyes to the comedy genre and really reinvents it in a good way. This film is intelligent, concise, and always entertaining and fun. As a writer / director, Jones exhibits complete control over his characters that are absurd and adorable. The story is definitely something you have not seen before, which is good. He is unique and funny, and he manages to work on visually fantastic elements, as well as in the lost slapstick genre to form a plentiful comedy. <br /> <br /> A very promising first film.
