['A super, unusual film by Audiard, Read My Lips is a suspense movie of lonely hearts. It&#39;s perfect for Vincent Cassel&#39;s generously gracious charisma and features a wonderfully contained performance by Emanuelle Devos. Devos is a recurring feature of Audiard in the same way that KArin Viard appears for Jean-Pierre Jeunet: she is incredibly beautiful (everyone considers her unattractive in this film), versatile and capable of a subordinate profile. <br /><br /> This is almost the definition of her role as Carla, a body of office dogs, mocked by colleagues who exploit her deafness. However, find an ami d&#39;exploitation, if you wish, in Cassel&#39;s ex-convict, Paul. Each exploits the unconventional talents of the other (theft and lip reading) to fight in their respective situations and form an unconventional romantic approach. Devos / Audiard handles the deafness of Carla and her companion, deformed inner world with a discreet and elegant style. <br /><br /> In this film (2001), Audiard already clearly has control of his handling of tension, action and investment of his frame in a truly visceral experience that will become the great success, a prophet, of nine years later. 7/10']
