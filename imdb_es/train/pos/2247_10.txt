I am disappointed by the lack of publications in this surprising and effective little film. Jordi Mollà, probably best known for his role as Diego in "Blow" by Ted Demme. Writes, directs and stars. <br /> <br /> I will not give up any point of the plot, as the movie (at least for me) was very exciting to have not known anything about it ... If you have a netflix account, or have access to a video store that would take her ... I highly recommend it. It is a crazy creation, fun and, sometimes, very stimulating. <br /> <br /> Mollà's address is * quite * impressive and shows a lot of promise. <br /> <br /> Unpredictable, with amazing images and a The main great performance that is spoken in the beautiful Spanish "We are not nobody" (God is in the air) is an incredible movie that you can show off to your friends. <br /> <br /> SEE IT.
