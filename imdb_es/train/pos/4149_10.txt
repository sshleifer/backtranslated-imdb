['When I read some of the comments on the message boards here, I expected this movie to be a total disappointment, but when I saw it I could not stop laughing. It has officially become my new favorite movie. <br /><br /> I do not know what all the hate is about here, maybe because a movie of this kind has never existed before. I can not name another completely female comedy. Many comedies will have one or two actresses in the lead, but there will be many male characters of support. This was almost ALL women, with the exception of Seth Meyers, Justin Hartley and the short appearance of Will Arnett, and it worked. All the actresses presented very funny performances (especially Missi Pyle) of a peculiar and adorable script. <br /><br /> The charm of this film, for me, seems to be in its subtle feminist message: accepting who you are, female success in the public sphere, the strength of female friendships and breaking gender roles. Although it is cheerful, each of the main characters faces a challenge, since their attempts to be more &quot;fun&quot; come into conflict with their feminist values and with what they themselves knew they were. <br /><br /> Missi Pyle proposed that this film miss a theatrical premiere due to its female cast and lack of a renowned actor to support the studies, and I agree. Everyone I have recommended this film has loved and I think it is a shame that a comedy that celebrates female nonsense has not been widely accepted and successful. <br /><br /> I recommend this movie to anyone with an open mind or a love of comedy focused on women.']
