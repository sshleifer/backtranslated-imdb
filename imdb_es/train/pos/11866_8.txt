Most people who have seen this movie think it's the best movie ever made. I do not agree, but this movie is very good. Tony is a bad guy and he knows he is intimidating and uses him to get ahead. It's about him and how he goes from washing the dishes to having a huge house and an office with cocaine all over the desk. If you want a family movie, this is not the way to go, but if you want gangster and revenge and things like that, then you will like it.
