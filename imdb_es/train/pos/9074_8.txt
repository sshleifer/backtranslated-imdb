The show is very funny. Good subject The jokes and some liners are really good. With little additional tuning can become a very popular show. But the only important negative point of this show is the cast. David Spade does a great job as Russell, Megyn Price does a good job. But who the hell chose Patrick Warburton, Oliver Hudson and Bianca Kajlich. <br /> <br /> Technically, Russell and Jeff are the main characters of the show, which makes viewers want to see the show. Russell is a playboy and Jeff is a kind of frustrated family man. The relationship is ... with an experience of all the problems faced by a married couple in a relationship. <br /> <br /> Patrick Warburton: He does a horrible job like Jeff, he's not at all suitable for the role. He is like a robot, literally there is no blow in his delivery of dialogue. <br /> <br /> The cast is really very important for the spectators to like. The bad performance will undoubtedly take the show downhill ...
