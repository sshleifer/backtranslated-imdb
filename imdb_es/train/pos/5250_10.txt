The world is formed by two different types of spectators ... There are types of "English patients", who can not bother to enjoy anything that is not high enough to appear on PBS, and there are the "Happy Gilmore", for who an hour and a half of genital word games are definitely worth $ 7. <br /> <br /> Certainly, there is a ton of gray area, but you know which side you're on. If you are an English patient, save time, save money and save us all your comments of "Oh, this movie is so childish and stupid". I know, you enjoy a lot of disparaging every movie you do not like, and every person that likes it, but maybe you can stop just this time. <br /> <br /> But you're the Happy Gilmore type. .. go see this ... You'll find it hilarious. Tim Meadows has created a hilarious character, and Will Farrell continues to be very funny in almost everything he does. Go see it. You'll be glad you did it. And that's fine
