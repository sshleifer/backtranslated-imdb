I have seen this movie. This movie is the best according to today's need. The dowry in marriages is the main problem today. When affirming this problem this movie is the best. In this film, Indian values ​​express themselves very well. Young people today must understand this problem. There is less population of girls. And because of this dowry problem, the girls committed suicide. If this problem continues, then the day when there are no girls is not far away. So, keep in mind this affirmation, young people today must understand that we can not accept the dowry in marriages. We have to learn from this movie that the dowry should not be taken. And if we understand this problem, we can see the new trend in society. This is the biggest change in society.
