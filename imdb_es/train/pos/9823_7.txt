['I really thought that this was not so bad. It is not a great work of art, but Dermot M was the strongest artist by far. Patricia Arquette was overreacting most of the time. Actually I was playing the cello, which was very impressive, and its lines were never forced. Besides, he is an incredibly beautiful man. Very sexy Add that to talent, and almost anything I&#39;ve been in is much more tolerable. He always gives everything, even if some of the projects in which he has been involved did not reach the highest rating. It is not the actor&#39;s fault in most cases. Unfortunately, it has been in some strange movies that just did not resonate at the box office. Always with actors from the A list, but not always a &quot;success&quot;. But he &quot;is worth every penny&quot; of any rented or purchased DVD. Watch The Wedding Date with Debra Messing, one of his best films in general. IT&#39;S EACH CENT! ; (If you have not seen it yet, do it, then you will understand that quote!)']
