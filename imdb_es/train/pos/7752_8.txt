Barman just wanted to make a movie because he wanted to. As simple as that, and successful. Not only in your goal, but also in making a wonderful movie, especially visually. He knows how to use trays, slow motion sequences, tracking shots, crane shots, etc. in a beautiful and smooth way. This gives the movie a very relaxing feeling. <br /> <br /> The story is about the lives of 8 very different characters who have nothing in common except one thing: a party everyone is attending, which is also the turning point of this movie. The beauty of this image does not lie in the question of how the characters affect each other (compared to a similar movie, of course, better like Magnolia). I just do not think that was Barman's idea. Beauty lies in the different details of the experiences that people make or break their lives. Barman is very successful in telling those little stories that describe small experiences. He knows the people ... and Antwerp. <br /> <br /> The movie soundtrack is also excellent, but it's not a surprise, since we know that Barman is also a very successful composer and musician with his band DEUS. The music is sometimes hot and at the same time relaxing, which contributes to the feeling of sun and softness of the film. Other times we hear funky pop / rock melodies that give some scenes the strength they need. <br /> <br /> There is only one defect, and that is the last half hour. Was the execution time, which was breaking me? Or were not the last scenes as fresh and precise as the scenes until then? I can not understand ... <br /> <br /> As a whole, a beautiful sunny film that lifts the Belgian cinema. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10! <br /> (It's the breeze that flows through a girl's hair on a sunny afternoon that makes her even more beautiful - it's the cool breeze that relaxes you when it happens to you at a party full of people when someone open the door, it is the breeze that blows the perfume of that beautiful girl sitting next to you in the park that you just met a week ago, it's the breeze .....) <br /> <br />
