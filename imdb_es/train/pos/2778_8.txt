I saw this with few expectations and I loved it! Dubbing it as Beckham is a fairly typical coming-of-age film about a rather atypical girl. This is the main role of Parminder Nagra ("ER"), playing Jess, a teenager in England who finds herself trapped between her traditional Indian family and her love of soccer (which is football for the Americans). And although he is actually much older than his character, he plays the role of perfect tone. <br /> <br /> This is a film about friendship, specifically Jess's friendship with Jules (Keira Knightley), her teammate who will also attend. through family problems, especially with her mother, who wears purple nail polish and little ties on her shoes, and who wants Jules to be more feminine, wear lacy underwear and flirt with children and is terrified of playing sports It means that your daughter is a lesbian. Jules and Jess love to play and have problems trying to convince their families to let them go after their dreams. Also, unfortunately, both love the same man: Joe, his coach (played by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers). The love triangle causes some tension in your friendship. <br /> <br /> At some points, Bend It Like Beckham falls into clich√©s. In others, the scenes take too much time, and this movie could probably have benefited from a stricter edition in general. <br /> <br /> But this was a refreshing and fun movie about growth, cultural shock and love for football. It's about female empowerment, chasing your dreams and supporting your friends. Fun, charming and fun, Bend It Like Beckham is the little movie he could ... and he did it. <br /> <br /> Excellent. 8/10.
