This movie did not have parts that were hilarious, mostly just funny average units, but neither did it have parts that were really bad. The worst part was Sid's voice. His slur slur was too much for me. For about 5 minutes I was sick of hearing him talk. Apart from the annoying voice of the lazy, the movie was good. There were numerous secondary jokes that if you catch them they make the movie much better. This is a good movie for children. It has enough to keep adults happy and enough to entertain children. This is definitely worth renting if you have kids and want to watch a movie with them.
