['The fourth of the five westerns that Anthony Mann made with James Stewart, this involves a biting rancher named Jeff Webster, who takes a cattle trip from Wyoming to Alaska, through Seattle. He hooks up in Seattle with his buddies Ben Tatum (Walter Brennan) and Rube Morris (Jay C. Flippen) who he sent in advance to make preparations for the trip by boat, heading north. <br /><br /> But first, he has to endure the insubordinate hands, the cheats of riverboat captains and the charms of the shy and manipulative Castillo de Ronda (Ruth Roman) who believes that Jeff could be a valuable ally in the future. That&#39;s why she hides him in the boat while the captain searches for the previous (and justifiable) murder of a trail hand. <br /><br /> Jeff also has the misfortune of meeting the sordid judge Gannon (John McIntire) who runs the city of Skagway, Alaska. Gannon locks up Jeff for interrupting his audience by running his cattle through the city. He fined Jeff for the ownership of his cattle and Jeff just has to eat raven for the time being. <br /><br /> Meanwhile, Jeff agrees to walk through Ronda to Dawson to deliver the supplies. But this is just a ruse so that Jeff, Ben and Rube can return to Skagway and recover their cattle. Of course, Judge Gannon finds out about this and is right behind, but Jeff delays him with a rifle while Ben runs the cattle across the Canadian border out of Gannon&#39;s reach. <br /><br /> After avoiding an avalanche and another shooting with other Skagway men, they finally arrive at Dawson where Jeff sells his cattle to the highest bidder, who turns out to be Ronda, who then quickly establishes a new gambling house in Dawson. Jeff then takes his money and buys a claim and starts looking for gold. <br /><br /> But then Judge Gannon approaches Dawson to participate in the gold action up there and tells Jeff that he was getting a bit bored with Skagway and wants to try his luck at the Klondike, himself. That means bringing in a hired gunman and stealing some of the other miner&#39;s claims by force. Jeff and Ben now feel it&#39;s time to clear up while the events are going well, letting Rube pledge himself as an ineffective sheriff against Gannon and his gang. <br /><br /> They look for a way back only to find themselves ambushed by Gannon&#39;s men because Ben made the mistake of opening his big mouth. Ben is killed and Jeff is seriously injured, but that does not save Judge Gannon from his debt. The final shooting of the night on the muddy street of Dawson takes care of that. First, Jeff kills two of Gannon&#39;s best gunmen (Jack Elam and Robert Wilkie). Then, when Ronda comes out to warn Jeff that Gannon is trying to slide behind him, Gannon shoots him in the back and she dies right there in Jeff&#39;s arms. Then Jeff kills Gannon while hiding under a wooden sidewalk. Revenge has spoken. <br /><br /> This is another western that is right up there with THE NAKED SPUR and THE MAN FROM LARAMIE. Why the universal DVD uses a scanning and scanning print instead of the widescreen printing that TCM uses, that surpasses me. You will end up losing half of the glorious Alberta cinematography of William Daniels. So if you like well-written 50s westerns, this is a list A keeper <br /><br /> 8 out of 10']
