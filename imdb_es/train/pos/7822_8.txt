It is sad to see this movie now that we know how the ANC was affected by international capitalism. Biko died for very little. Woods achieved little. Yes, absolute apartheid was abolished, but white minority groups reserved the entire apparatus of power, leaving the ANC government more or less impotent. As Naomi Klein writes in The Shock Doctrine, in the conversations between black and white leaders "the Deklerk government had a double strategy: first, based on the growing Washington Consensus that there was no single way to run an economy, it described key sectors of economic decisions, such as trade policy and the central bank, as "technical" or "administrative." Then a wide range of new policy tools were used: international trade agreements, innovations in constitutional law and structural policies. " adjustment programs --- to hand over control of those centers of power to experts, economists and supposedly impartial officials of the IMF, the World Bank, GATT and the National Party --- anyone, except the fighters of the liberation of the ANC " The statistical results are horrible, there have not been many changes, and AIDS has flourished See Cry Freedom from this perspective It's deeply ironic, actually tragic. The ANC has been transformed from being the solution to being the main problem.
