While the elements of the plot of "The Eighth Day" seem to have been made many times, the film still retains much of the spark, mystery and symbolism that had the first film by Jaco Van Dormal. Although not as good as "Toto the Hero", which will always remain on my favorites list, the movie still leaves us with many emotions. Daniel Auteil, from 2001, the unfeeling "The Closet" plays down his part, fearing overreaching (rightly, the role could easily have been ruined if the actor was too dramatic). However, I felt that the part needed a bit more realism, focusing more on the character rather than simply on the character's growth. <br /> <br /> Do not enter into this film expecting the black humor and the unexpected twists you got from "Toto the Hero" because you will be disappointed. However, the movie still serves as a decent movie, if not flawed
