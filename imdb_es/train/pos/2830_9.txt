The extraordinary Rosemary Forsyth is the main reason to see this movie. You will never know why she never became a bigger store. But she is exceptional and steals all the scenes she is in. Garson Kanin directed this piece of fluff and the cast is first class, with Robert Drivas and Brenda Vaccaro especially memorable. A "9" of a "10".
