['It is an extremely difficult movie to watch, especially because it focuses on the innermost core of all our lives. But ultimately it is a very beautiful and moving movie. Anyone who finds him cynical, I have to say that he must have missed the whole message of the movie. For those who really watch the movie, they will see that the way in which problems are treated is absolutely necessary, and the result is, ultimately, uplifting. Of course, it is very difficult to see, a difficult and even brutal issue. However, it is extremely relevant for society and for all. It shows the top of what the world cinema is doing right now (I will not restrict that term to just France) and everyone should try to see it. I will say that it is better to go with your head clear without being fooled by conflicting points of view and letting the film work for you.']
