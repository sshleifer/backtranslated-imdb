I only wish that Return of the Jedi, was directed by another person, I mean, there are too many scenes of ewoks, completely unnecessary. In addition to this time, our heroes are seen as different people: Princess Leia no longer struggles with Solo, Luke looks bored, Darth Vader is not as bad as before and Yoda simply dies. <br /> <br /> But there are many extraordinary things going on in this episode that I just can not hate. <br /> <br /> SOME SPOILERS 1- Jabba the hut 2- The attack sequence of Sail Barge. 3-The emperor (now that's bad) 4- Speeders chase the endor forest. 5-The last battle. 6-The seduction scene of the dark side. 7-The return of Anakin to the good side of the force. 8- And the last celebration. <br /> <br /> Some of those are so good that they can bring tears to your eyes. If some scenes had been cut and another director had been hired, this would have been as perfect as episodes 4 and 5, but it is still extraordinary. 9 out of 10.
