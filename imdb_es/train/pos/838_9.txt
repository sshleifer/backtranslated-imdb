['*** 1/2 Pierce Brosnan, Greg Kinnear, Hope Davis, Adam Scott, Philip Baker Hall. Directed by Richard Shepard. <br /><br /> A well-formulated story and film, Brosnan has never been better in a cinematic role outside of his &quot;Bond&quot; movies. After &quot;After sunset&quot; in 2004, his new role brings laughter and a great moment. The professional hitman, so to speak, Julian Noble in a job in Mexico City ends up finding exactly the opposite of himself, a very nervous businessman, Danny Wright (Kinnear, possibly one of his best roles) also in business there . The two duos on the screen produce a comically charged laughter disturbance, and they can not deliver the laughter. Davis in one of his best roles since &quot;American Splendor&quot; offers another charming and witty performance. One of the nicest years and best movies. My final grade 9/10']
