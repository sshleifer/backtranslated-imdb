One of the best movies of real crimes ever made and very faithful to the book by Truman Capote who invented the genre of true crime novels. Haunting Quincy Jones musical and excellent performance of Scott Wilson and Robert Blake as Dick and Perry, the killers. Why Wilson did not become a big star after this movie is a mystery to me. <br /> <br /> The black and white cinematography and editing in this film are first class. The recreation of the murders is frightening and, since it leaves the real murders to your imagination, it is even more frightening than if they had shown that the shotgun is fired. The film was filmed in the royal house of Clutter that had been sold to another person after the murders. The film has a very documentary feel, in addition to the scenes in the real house of Clutter, other scenes were filmed in the service stations and stores to which the assassins really went. Nancy Clutter's beloved horse, Babe, is even in the movie. Will Geer has a great role as prosecutor in the brief trial scene, which was not only filmed in the courtroom but has several of Clutter's real murder juries who are presented as the jury of the film. <br /> <br /> This is a solid, terrifying movie every time you see it.
