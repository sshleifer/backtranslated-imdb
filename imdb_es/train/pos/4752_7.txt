A fantastic story of a Martian attempt to colonize the Earth. (Things must be pretty bad on Mars). Two state police officers investigate the scene of a reported UFO accident. What has landed is buried under the ice at Tracy's Pond, but there are steps in the snow that lead to a nearby restaurant. <br /> <br /> The diner has no customers since 11 o'clock that morning. Now there are a handful of bus passengers sitting waiting for permission to cross a structurally weak bridge. The bus driver insists that six passengers were on board the bus, although he did not realize who they were. The problem is that now there are SEVEN people waiting for the trip to resume. One of them is an extraterrestrial, but which one? They are all suspects. There is the old fool (Jack Elam), of course, who seems to exercise a sub rosa wit. There is an overwhelming entrepreneur who must arrive in Boston (John Hoyt). A young couple on their honeymoon. (Execrable performance of the husband, Ron Kipling.) Except for couples, nobody has noticed anyone else. And even couples are suspicious of each other. Bride to the new husband: "I could have sworn that you had a mole on your chin." The story continues in a cheerful but slightly creepy way: the phone rings for no reason, the lights turn on and off, the juke box lights up on its own, and none of them should be taken seriously. <br /> <br /> It's a very nice set game and the climatic revelation is worth it. There is no discernible "depth" in it. It is not a moral message about people in the pod who pose as normal citizens. It is not a warning of any kind, just a fairy tale that entertains and entertains. <br /> <br /> I always enjoy it when it's on. It is especially interesting to see John Hoyt as an irritable and impatient businessman, knowing that in 1954 it was the Roman senator who devised the assassination of Julius Caesar in the version of the Shakespeare play by MGM. And here it is, with three arms. <br /> <br /> Go.
