I saw this movie for the first time several years ago, and I connected it in an instant. It's great and much better than J. F. K. because you always have to think 'Can it happen to me? Can I become a murderer? You can not turn off the TV or the VCR without thinking about the plot and the end, which should not be lost under any circumstances.
