When I rented Domino I expected him to be very stupid. I hate movies that have a really striking edition and cinematography and Domino has also just received very bad reviews. The only reason I saw it is because I liked Keira Knightley, Mickey Rourke, Christopher Walken and Tony Scott at other times. I also enjoy based on adventure stories. Yes, the editing and cinematography were frenetic, the story was weak and the acting was mediocre, but I still loved this movie for some strange reason. Domino was very, very entertaining and often very fun. I think it was horribly underestimated when it was released, because everyone wanted more an emotional trip like the latest Scotts movie, Man on Fire, and instead, they got a wonderful entertainment. Actually, I understand why everyone hated Domino so much, even though I loved and recommended it.
