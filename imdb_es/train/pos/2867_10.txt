['I lost my father at a very young age. So young, in fact, that I have no recollection of him. Over the years I have learned many things about him. One of those things was that he loved westerns, and seeing Bonanza every Sunday night was an absolute ritual for him. I myself remember the end of the show&#39;s career, which was 8 years old when the show ceased production in 1973. Seeing this show over the years somehow makes me closer to my lost father a long time ago. It has all the right elements to make a program successful: laughter, tears, the edge of your seat&#39;s suspense, and even annoyed you sometimes. Remembrance of the original program career, came shortly after the death of our beloved &quot;Hoss&quot; Cartwright, Dan Blocker. One episode in particular, and the end of the closing credits, showed a picture of Blocker, and faded to black, and I can also remember my older sister with tears in her eyes to see this. I can remember this as if it were yesterday. On behalf of my late father, who is not here to say it, we love Bonanza. Long live the Cartwrights.']
