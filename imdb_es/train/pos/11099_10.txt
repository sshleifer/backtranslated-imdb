Chase has created a true phenomenon with The Sopranos. Inflexible performances, solid writing and good music make up what has possibly become the best show in history. <br /> <br /> The entire cast is strong, but Falco and Gandolfini earned every inch of those Emmys. Anyone who doubts this only needs to sample some episodes; Particularly from the first seasons. James Gandolfini is absolutely fierce, absolutely frightening, and you still find yourself loving him, fascinated by him. <br /> <br /> Many of the people I've talked to about The Sopranos (who have not seen it yet) will. Say "I'm just not a fan of mafia movies / shows." Whatever is. Run - do not walk - and get it. Those same people tend to love "E.R.", but I bet they do not care about hospitals ... It's not about context.
