It's appropriate on a musical Sunday to make your heart beat faster, and no one can do it better than Little Richard. The man could sing the drawer of the ladies and define the rock and roll. <br /> <br /> Look at Leon to provide a definitive characterization, as he has done with David Ruffin in The Temptations and Jackie Wilson in Mr. Rock. 'n' Roll: The Alan Freed Story. <br /> <br /> This was a fascinating biopic when we saw Little Richard struggling with his father, with his church and with himself about who he was. He won the battle and there is no one else who has his voice or style.
