I saw this when I was in The Wonderful World of Disney as a child, so I did not remember much of that. When I saw him recently, I sat there thinking: "This is the strangest thing I've seen." <br /> <br /> "Travel" scenes look like something caused by an LSD overdose. The animated characters are mostly versions of Jungle Book and Robin Hood, strange colors / with voice. I noticed some things not so Disney: children threatened at knifepoint and prostitutes (during the song of Portobello Road). <br /> <br /> It was very entertaining, although the musical numbers were long and I can see little. Children get bored with them. In addition, the subject was a little dark, since it was established during World War II.
