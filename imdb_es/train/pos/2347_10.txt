I've been a fan of Pushing Daisies since the beginning. It is wonderfully thought out, and Bryan Fuller has the most remarkable ideas for this program. <br /> <br /> It's amazing how much TV you need a creative and original program like Pushing Daisies. It is a great relief to see a show, which does not look like the rest, in the sense that, if you compare it with some of the newer shows, like Scrubs and House, you will see the similarities, and it becomes tedious at times. Look at programs so close in identity. <br /> <br /> With a magnificent cast, a wonderful script and hilarity in each episode, Pushing Daisies is by far one of the most remarkable programs on your TV.
