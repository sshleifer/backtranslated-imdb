MAIN SPOILERS !! THIS IS FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE SEEN THE MOVIE! <br /> <br /> The commentators have touched on the main theme of "honor" in the film, and too many comparisons with "Braveheart". I'll point out some things about this movie that I have not seen other comments touching: <br /> <br /> This movie has a decidedly different opinion about abortion. The first character to get pregnant is the villain's girlfriend (Roth), and when he coldly suggests an abortion, she says it's too late for that. The embarrassment of her situation ("I'm going to have a bastard bastard") leads her to commit suicide in a much later scene. The second character found to be pregnant is Mary, Rob's wife, after a rape by the Roth character (and at least one sex scene with her husband, Rob). At the end of the film, when Rob leaves for a final confrontation with Roth, Mary asks him what he should do about the pregnancy from questionable origins, with a tone that suggests abortion. Rob responds in a noble tone, "it's not the child's fault," and then says what he thinks the name, girl or boy, should be. It seems to me that this "pro-life" stance on the part of the hero is very un-Hollywood. Rob walks from the darkness of the house to the bright exterior to make this comment, not a coincident symbolism. <br /> <br /> Another related issue is that the character of Roth is a bastard, someone who evidently does not know who his father was. , and has few kind words for his mother, although he carries a picture of her in a case hanging from his neck. It is a coincidence that Roth (without family stability) is the itinerant definition of psychopath, while Rob is the strong figure of the husband / father and, of course, the hero. In the final sword fight between Rob and the villain (Roth), the first cuts the second deep through the chest: the left side of the chest, over the heart. His patron and pseudo father figure (John Hurt character) holds the picture of the mother in his hand and looks at it, before snatching it from the dead Roth's neck. <br /> <br /> I also found interesting the direction of the rape scene, which was not entirely graphic, but neither was it off-camera and implicit. I found it surprising in its description of fact, with Mary convincingly showing the characteristics of someone who goes through the test and the post-traumatic stress (as we call it now). My point is that the rape was not sensationalist or simply implicit, which seems an interesting intermediate way for Hollywood to take. <br /> <br /> At the scene of the final fight, I have to correct an earlier commentator: the Roth weapon The chosen one was a rapier (or perhaps a short sword), the weapon that Rob chose was a Claymore. Someone was really doing his homework in this whole scene. Roth would have an advantage in such a situation, but, of course, the Claymore is a distinctly Scottish weapon. What surprises me most (as a fencer and someone who has read a bit about the subject) is that this last sword fight is one of the most compelling films ever made: the actors really seem to try to kill each other. - They are not the usual bars of the opponents sheet that we see in most movie fights (including the movie opening fight). Even more faithful to the story, Roth is seen several times using the rapier as a push weapon, which is his purpose by design. (Harpoons were cut, but mainly a push weapon with the edges used mainly to stop an attack by opponents). Rob uses the Claymore in wide bars, as is the intention of the design. The fight diminishes as I would expect: Roth wins effectively. Although Rob wins the day by grabbing Roth's weapon (more symbolism) and killing him with a powerful slash. <br /> <br /> Friends, it's RARE to see this level of historical accuracy in a movie sword fight. <br /> I will also point out that, for whatever reason, I remember the year 1995 (the year of publication) clearly as a moment of distrust of the US government. UU Hollywood was obviously tuned in to that, with the release of "Rob Roy" and "Braveheart," and I think anti-government leanings are the reason why both films get so much comparison. <br /> <br /> I think the different perspective that this film offers is refreshing for avid movie fans, tired of the same old and not-so-hidden messages from Hollywood.
