Pakeezah has a very interesting story (which is well documented in the 'Trivia' section) about how he came to be. It seems as if destiny conspired to prove Kamal Amrohi (the director) while at the same time secretly wishing to see him complete his masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Pakeezah relies on metaphors, poetry and visual utterance. As a result, the intensity with which emotions emerge reaches a dimension that may not be very real but that is very effective and leaves an impact on the viewer. <br /> <br /> Meena Kumari lives the tragedy of Nargis and Sahib Jaan as her own. The other stars of the film, besides her, are Ghulam Mohammed (the musical director), Lata Mangeshkar, Naushad (background score) and Joseph Wirsching (the d.o.p). His music and cinematography leave you enchanted. <br /> <br /> Pakeezah is a classic of world cinema. It reveals new layers every time you look at it again. Kamal Amrohi is one of the rare poets of cinema and he left us all a gift.
