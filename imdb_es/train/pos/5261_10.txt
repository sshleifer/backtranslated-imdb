Do you like really inventive comedies or do you love "the wreck of the wedding", if the answer is the last, stop reading now? I can not believe that this movie is not better valued. Basically, Meadows plays a character not unlike Austin Powers. There are many creative moments in this gagorama. From the harshness: Leon playing with himself on the porch, the ex-boyfriend cheated to eat. . Oh good. To inspire madness, clown sex, Broadway routine, voiceover. Meadows is as big as the Infant Lion, but very sweet. Some great lines "do not blame the wang", "strange and strange world", too many. . . Why this movie was not huge is a mystery. Great comedy
