The Lion King series is easily the most important achievement in Disney animation. The original Lion King is the best masterpiece in cel animation. Lion King II: Simba's Pride is the best direct sequel to video that Disney, or any other studio, has done for an animated feature. He deserved a theatrical premiere. The same can be said about this movie. It has the original cast, Elton John songs, a hilarious story, exciting action and touching moments of the characters. Everything you've come to expect from this series. It is not so much a new story, but a complete and extensive story about Timon and Pumbaa, and its place in this story. What impressed me most was the care in the animation. Very often, the Disney shorts about the quality of the animation of their video and television efforts. But here, they perfectly combine the new animation with the images from the original movie. The scenes never seem out of place. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella are in full swing as Timon and Pumbaa. Matthew Broderick, Robert Guillame and Moira Kelly repeat their roles as Simba, Rafiki and Nala, respectively. We even received a return visit from Whoopi Goldberg and Cheech Marin as the hyenas. There are many laughs in this movie. So if you like the Lion King, you need this movie. The story is not complete without it.
