Well, I have to say that I waited for it to arrive. <br /> <br /> I will not try to spoil it and some people have spoken with much brilliance of the pilot. On the other hand, I'm not sure I understand the detractors who claim to be fans of BSG and not like the pilot. <br /> <br /> What the hell were you waiting for? !! The background is being established 50 years before BSG, we are there to assist in the birth of the Cylons, see the life of the Adama family (if we already know of BSG), get a deeper explanation of the population of Caprican and its perception. of the other colonies, and potentially the origins of the belief of God of the human and the unique belief of God of the Cylons. <br /> <br /> I do not expect the same profusion of special effect or space opera as in the previous series, I make the difference between the two, although I know that Caprica will reinforce the BSG. <br /> <br /> This is a promising 1h30, I think this will also push the scenarios to be as good as BSG. I expect a lot of the following, but I have no reason to doubt that we will learn much more. <br /> <br /> Seeing the deleted scene from the DVD also provides more material for your brain to chew. <br /> <br /> We expect January 2010
