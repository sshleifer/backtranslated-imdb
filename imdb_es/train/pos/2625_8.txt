Surprisingly, it is not terrible and is well animated for one of the Disney sequels to launch videos directly. As in the previous sequel (The Lion King 2), I'm glad that Disney has recovered most of the original voice actors, which makes a big difference and maintains a good level of traditional animation. The plot wanders for a moment, but we are distracted by an endless series of jokes that range from fun to boring. To break the argument and the jokes, we were given some silly musical sequences, which like jokes, range from entertaining to a quick trip to the fridge. For the most part, MST3K-like moments are bland and full of unexploited potential and do not really add much to the film, apart from acting as a vehicle for a one-hour flashback. The new characters are at least nice, and the old ones are doing their thing, so I can not blame them there. In general, this film is not bad and is a good frivolous filling between the most serious titles of the Lion King.
