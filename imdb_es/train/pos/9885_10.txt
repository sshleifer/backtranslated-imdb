The young Erendira and her tyrannical grandmother provide a great fantasy of the new world. This interpretation by Gabriel García Márquez "The history and history of Candida Eréndira, ..." can not rub Márquez's purists in the right way, although the story remains intact and still has the full force of the work. The strength of this film is in its performance, especially Popes like the grandmother. The fans of Márquez and the newbies of Márquez will enjoy this movie for its true witt brand.
