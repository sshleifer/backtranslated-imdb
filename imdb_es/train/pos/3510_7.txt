Real movie fans will love this authentic movie. <br /> <br /> I do not agree with the trolls that qualify this movie as a star and call it unrealistic. Although I have no experience or come from the environment of the protagonists, I have spent many years working in low income and working class neighborhoods and I feel that the performance was very real and representative of how teenagers behave. I do not know what is the basis of the comments of others that the film is "unrealistic". The dialogue is excellent. <br /> <br /> The low-budget production value did not bother me a little. I felt that the natural lighting enhanced the character of the film. The focus was entirely on the story line and on the development of the character, and not on the dazzling Hollywood proposal or melodrama. <br /> <br /> I completely bought the motivations and reactions of the character. The performance was credible and impressive for new and non-actors. <br /> <br /> If your idea of ​​a good movie is Transformers or Fast & Furious, skip it. If you like dramas based on good character, look at it. <br /> <br /> (As for negative commentators such as "trolls": click on their names and you will see that most do not have other reviews or only negative reviews).
