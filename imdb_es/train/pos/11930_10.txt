This movie was pretty good. I'm not a big fan of baseball, but this is a movie that was made to help understand the meaning of love, determination, heart, etc. <br /> <br /> Danny Glover, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Brenda Fricker, Christopher Lloyd, Tony Danza and Milton Davis Jr. are presented with a variety of talented actors and understanding of the sport. The plot was believable, and I love the message. William Dear and the guys put together a great movie. <br /> <br /> Most sports films revolve around real stories or events, and often do not work well. But this movie reaches a 10 on the scale of perfection, although there were some minor mistakes here and there. <br /> <br /> 10/10
