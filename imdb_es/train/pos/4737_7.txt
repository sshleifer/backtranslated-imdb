Hak hap (Black Mask) is what I would like to call ballet with fists and explosions. Surely the plot has been tried and heard before, (a biological engineering soldier who is part of an elite combat force of supermen who decides he feels that killing and brute force are not the ways to solve everything and becomes a pacifist, and a librarian, but when he learns that the rest of his group is trying to get an antidote that will keep them alive by attacking the police, his best friend is a policeman, he becomes the black mask.) style to which the film points. , very visual, it works and at least for me it is entertaining. I love martial arts movies that are a spectacle. People who fly lighter than air and recover a fraction of a second after impact maintain the pace and action without stopping. But that's what this film is about, anyway, a sample of Jet Li doing what he does best, and that's a spectacular ability to show off his skills, which, to say the least, are first class. As with most fast-action martial arts movies wing. Jackie Chan and Sammo Hung, who now appear for the first time here in the United States, these films have little plot and many amazing physical feats. But I must say that, even with the big holes left in the plot (like, how do we see him safe in his apartment when only one scene before having 20 men who are not more than 15 feet away from him with a signal of escape? Who knows the scene cuts it in the apartment ... oh, well, suspense of belief, I suppose), the movie for me is still interesting. It's only until the last 20 minutes that the movie seems to feel it could have been a little shorter. But still around a great high-speed action movie.
