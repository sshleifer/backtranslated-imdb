This was an excellent episode, one of the best of both seasons. On the right, the horror of a change, with a story that is well above the average episodes of MOH, if there is such a thing. The wife of a man almost died burned in a tragic car accident, in which he drove. Her airbag worked, she did not. It burns beyond recognition (great makeup by the way), and you are not given much opportunity to live without a full skin graft. BUT, even in a coma, she is still dying, but modern technology returns her, and when she dies for a few minutes, her ghost appears as a very vengeful spirit. Of course, there is a butcher shop, and also some extremely bloody murders, and also, some extremely sexy scenes. What more could you ask, could you ask? Well, not much, because this baby has it all, and a very satirical ending, which should leave a smile on most of the faces of the spectators. I also loved the direction of Rob Schmidt (wrong turn), he has a great ability for horror. Excellent episode, this is one that I am buying for sure.
