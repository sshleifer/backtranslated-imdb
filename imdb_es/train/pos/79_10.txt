I loved The Real Mc Coys (1957-1963) It's a shame that Lydia Reed has decided to be forgotten and not appear. She was excellent at the show. Of course, Walter Brennan was great, as was Tony Martinez. I loved it when he called Amos Se√±or Grampa. I bought Season I on DVD and I can not wait to buy Seasons 2-6. If there were only more shows on TV like this, everything would be better. This show appeared briefly in the summer of 1999 but then disappeared. God bless all the deceased members of the cast and, please, Llydia Reed, make yourself known again to the public. You are loved and respected. Real Mc Coys will live forever.
