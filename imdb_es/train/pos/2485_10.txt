['What an ambitious project Kenneth Branagh undertook here and how well it was done! This is the first filmed version of &#39;Hamlet&#39; to use the full text of Shakespeare&#39;s play, but Branagh did not do it just because he was &quot;there.&quot; His intention, I believe, was to make the game accessible and comprehensible to the general viewer without obstructing it, so to speak. In return, he asks viewers to do a little work themselves, a fairly fair proposition and make it a bargain. <br /><br /> The stage is a European generic of the 19th century and this does more than work well, it maintains a modern or old aspect of a possible distraction of the work itself. The production design and cinematography and both outstanding, which helps enormously when you&#39;re watching a four-hour movie. The casting of Branagh is once again inspired and the acting is equally. The management fulfills the arduous task of making this a film instead of a deluxe version of a work. Since much of &#39;Hamlet&#39; is based on an inner monologue and there are relatively few duels, battles, etc., this can be a daunting task. But everything Branagh tries to do seems to work. <br /><br /> Branagh has always been one of the most interesting actors / writers / directors, although not always the best, as he made his big splash with &#39;Henry V&#39;. One complaint I had with him was what I saw as a tendency to ruin him sometimes. In his portrayal of Hamlet here, he could be charged again, but there is a working method. Let&#39;s face it, &#39;Hamlet&#39; is not an easy job to understand for the average person and if you&#39;ve never seen it before, you need help even if you&#39;ve read the work. Hamlet has most of the lines of any Shakespearian character and Branagh makes sure that his viewers know what this man is thinking and feeling throughout the film, even if he does not know the literal meaning of each arcane word. This performance of Branagh was at least worthy of an Oscar nomination. <br /><br /> There are so many other performances highlighted here that are almost too numerous to mention, but some of them must be recognized. Derek Jacobi, like Claudio, is excellent, but even he takes a backseat to Kate Winslet when it comes to delivering praise. His interpretation of Ophelia is impressive in its depth of feeling, only that it stands out even more because of the fact that he was only about 20 years old at the time! She seems to me the best young actress there is. Other super artists in no particular order are Richard Briers, Nicholas Farrell, Michael Maloney and Reece Dinsdale and Timothy Spall as Guildenstern and Rosencrantz, respectively. Honorable mention for Julie Christie, Charlton Heston and Robin Williams, who manages to do his thing here successfully. Even Billy Crystal as a gravedigger works. The only cast member who does not, inexplicably, is Jack Lemmon. In the opening scene it appears, and while the other three actors do a great job to establish the tense mood, Lemmon sounds like he&#39;s just running lines in the essay as a favor. You know that this must have been a real dilemma for Branagh, since everything else about movies screams that it is the job of a perfectionist. <br /><br /> It&#39;s not to be funny when talking about a four-hour movie, but it seems a bit too long. Some monologues and conversations tend to spread a little, if I can be so bold, and some judicious pruning would be welcome. <br /><br /> Did I forget something, apart from Patrick Doyle&#39;s score? Without a doubt I did it. I will summarize by saying that Kenneth Branagh could have made the definitive version of the &#39;Hamlet&#39; film, and it will be a truly monumental production that surpasses it.']
