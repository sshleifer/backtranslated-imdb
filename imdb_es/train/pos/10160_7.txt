I entered this movie thinking that it would be a film of poor quality. I came away surprised and very funny. Eve was good, but Lake Bell stole the show. She had an incredible comic timing. The jokes in this movie were surprisingly original and really funny with one or two flat jokes in the middle. The plot was enough to unite everything, a woman (Eva) dies the day of her wedding and returns to torment the woman who is dating her future husband, its sound is implausible, but in reality it works quite well. all right. <br /> <br /> 7/10 - In general, it is a movie clock that is worth it, if you do not have it on DVD when it comes out.
