['I&#39;m surprised that I actually had the courage to watch the biopic or &quot;Che: Parts 1 and 2&quot;. Why? Because if my Cuban parents in exile ever discovered that I saw this film about this despicable mass murderer of the Cuban revolution, I would be punished for life. Hey wait? I am an adult, they can not punish me anymore. The director Steven Soderbergh, and the rookie commie (sorry Steven, but I had to take Soder&#39;s shots here) divided the film into two parts about the revolutionary life of Commander Ernesto &quot;Che&quot; Guevara. &quot;Che: Part 1&quot; presents how Che in the mid-1950s joined the guerrilla team of Fidel Castro in his revolutionary quest to overthrow the regime of Cuban President Fulgencio Batista; which, as we all know, was a revolutionary success for them, but a gigantic guerrilla disaster for many Cubans when they became communist. &quot;Che: Part 2&quot; introduces Che who is trying to revolutionize the t-shirt industry by throwing T-shirts with his scary bear face on t-shirt makers. Ok, I&#39;m chatting a lot of shit on your way! I wanted to say that the &#39;Che: Part 2&#39; focuses on Che in the late 60s, trying to return the revolution, this time to a poor Bolivia, but with very different results, in fact, Che ended up being dead flesh enchanted when he was captured and killed by the Bolivian militia in 1967. Soderbergh does not include the intermediate time of those two cases in Che&#39;s life when he commanded the despicable prison of La Cabana Fortress in Cuba, where he mass murdered many Cubans who opposed This is where I think Soderbergh executed a film injustice by not showing the spectators how atrocious Guevara was, and I decided to see &quot;Che&quot; in the hope that Soderbergh would not captivate him, but rather present how disturbed he was. Soderbergh did not do the latter and, unfortunately, decided to present Guevara as a revolutionary hero, which was not the case, he was a sick man who, thank God, is probably now รก at the bottom of the barrel of the devil. Now, I have to be an objectivist. Re viewer and must admit that the performance of Benicio Del Toro as Che was extremely important and worthy of merit. And that Demian Bichir was a disturbing singer like Fidel Castro in his meticulous performance. But the rest of the cast of &quot;Che&quot; was mostly composed of mediocre performances by actors portraying Guerrilla soldiers. And as much as I admire Matt Damon, why did Sodebergh incorporate him into the revolutionary mix in a Spanish-speaking cameo that features a Bolivian delegate? Soderbergh did not have to present this biographical film, which mostly consists of &quot;talking too much and not enough action&quot; in 4 hours and 30 minutes. We&#39;ve had too much of Che, even posthumously with those ridiculous shirts, so why give us much more of him? But I guess when you have the Del Toro by the horns (as you did here with Steven), I think it&#39;s your salvation not to fully execute &quot;Che: Parts 1 and 2&quot;. *** Average']
