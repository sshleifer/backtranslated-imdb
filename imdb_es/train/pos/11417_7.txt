This movie seemed like a project that had many of the right ingredients, but somewhere along the way they did not come together. I do not know who did it, but it has a somewhat similar feeling to that of Disney. While some parts are unlikely (such as when a preteen is running for public office) and tend to avoid taking history seriously, there is a good deal of normalcy (whatever) to maintain balance and perspective. The acting is fine. Interestingly, the relationship between Frankie and her grandmother is convincing, but the relationship between Hazel and Frankie is a little ... out of place. It is interesting to see how she has to strive to maintain the balance between her best friend, her grandmother and her two passions: ballet and baseball. I was a baseball player myself, it was quite painful to see Frankie try to defend himself against a boys team, but he does a good job of showing the fight he is facing. I read somewhere that she is not really a dancer, but the editing in this movie did a very good job of making her dance look not only natural but also beautiful. Overall, it was a good movie about honesty and ambition, but his star, Mischa Barton, did not achieve the level of realism we saw during his performances in "Lawn Dogs", "Lost and Delirious", and his small but shocking performance in the opposite side. Haley Joel Osment in "The Sixth Sense".
