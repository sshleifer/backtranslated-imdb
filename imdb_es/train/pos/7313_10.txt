['Some spoilers If you&#39;re a big fan of horror movies, you&#39;ll know that Halloween paved the way for many slasher movies. Often imitated, never duplicated, this film is a true horror classic and it is definitely one of the most terrifying movies ever made, if not the most fearsome. <br /><br /> In fact, I saw this movie after seeing the rest of the series (do not ask me why). Honestly, I saw the other 7 movies before I saw this, that&#39;s how it worked. But I would have to say that it destroys all the others. It&#39;s really scary, and seeing Michael coming out from behind a bush or walking in the dark sends a chill down his spine. My favorite part of the movie was when Michael stabs a boy and leans to the side. It is one of the strangest images in the history of cinema. <br /><br /> Later, like the movies on Friday the 13th, they were more fun and less intense than this movie. I like the F13 series better than the Halloween series, but this single movie is better than all the F13 movies. Michael Myers is a scary villain because he&#39;s realistic, you can imagine a crazy guy like him killing people. I admit that this movie gave me nightmares after seeing her for a few nights. <br /><br /> The good thing about this movie is that it is not based on gore or humor to entertain the audience. It&#39;s just pure terror. It is a pity that the last films of the series have moved from this one, because it is the best example of a spectacular Slasher movie.']
