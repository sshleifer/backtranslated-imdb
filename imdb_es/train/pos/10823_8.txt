I've always liked Johnny Concho and I wish that this movie came out on VHS and DVD. Frank Sinatra offers one of the most unusual performances of his career in this race. <br /> <br /> When we meet Frank in the main role of the film, he is the brother of a famous gunman who is out of town at the moment. The brother attacks terror in the heart of the city and Frank takes full advantage to intimidate the people of the city in his shadow. Only Phyllis Kirk has any feelings for him. She is the daughter of stockist Wallace Ford and Dorothy Adams. <br /> <br /> Two other armed men arrive William Conrad and Christopher Dark and it turns out that Conrad has killed Sinatra's brother and he comes to his city to take charge. They humiliate Sinatra and take him out of the city. Kirk follows him. <br /> <br /> During the night Sinatra turns from punk into a coward and becomes a man looking for some kind of spine. It's a well-performed performance, almost as good as his Oscar-nominated role in The Man With a Golden Arm. Pity for some reason that this has not been seen in years. <br /> <br /> Two other notable performances are Keenan Wynn as the former combatant turned preacher who helps Sinatra find what he needs to face Conrad and Dark. And then there's Conrad in what I think was his career role on the screen. It is a villain of incredible malevolence, pure evil embodied walking and talking on the silver screen. <br /> <br /> However, what I like about Johnny Concho is the unforgettable climax in which Conrad and Dark are treated. Let's say I think Johnny Concho was MGM's response to High Noon and a primer for what you do when evil causes a collapse in all law and order.
