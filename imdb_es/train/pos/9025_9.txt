The movie belongs to Inventor - genre Underdog. Jake Gyllenhaal, Laura Dern and Chris Cooper bring a bit of interpretive enthusiasm to the story with several standard elements. Well filmed, well edited, with a lot of well-played supporting roles. <br /> <br /> Some have declared that this movie is classic American. It is that and more. I agree with those who say "The film celebrates the emotion of youthful inspiration". <br /> <br /> The film is a welcome reminder that achievement can be rooted in common. <br /> <br />
