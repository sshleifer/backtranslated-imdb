Yes, this movie is predictable and definitely not award material. But then it does not try to be something it is not. A fun-filled game with real funny phrases, a stellar and very funny performance by Peter O'Toole, a grounding and a realistic interpretation of Joan Plowright. The performance of the band was in the place, each one interpreting its paper in a skillful and comic way. The music was good, although not great, but it filled the movie very well. From some of the negative comments I deduced that the subtlety of humor overflowed. A good example is the comment about the "strange baseball game", well my dear American, which was cricket, from which baseball is derived, and his explanation to the ignorant American band was very funny for those who do know cricket. . Besides, you were not supposed to grimace when Carl broke a window; It was funny how Lord Foxley said "Oh, yes!" to get more money for the break and the manager said at the same time "oh no" also referring to the money. My God, it seems that every joke should be explained to some people ... In general, I enjoyed it and had a lot of fun. Worth seeing.
