I saw this movie when I was a child in Creature Feature when I lived in New York. It was a pretty spooky movie, although not as good as Horror Hotel. I just bought this movie on DVD, and it's different from what I remember because on the DVD that I bought there are several scenes in which the actors speak in French and / or Italian and subtitles are not provided. Then the other actors respond in English to what was said. Something weird. Also in the DVD box, the names of some of the actors are written differently from IMDb. <br /> <br /> Aside from that, this movie is different in that the character of Elsie takes off her clothes and provides a nude filmed in a scene and in another scene Julia tries to force Elizabeth (Barbara Steele) to kiss with She pushes her on the bed and kisses her while Steele resists. That scene existed in the TV version, but it was very edited. I wonder if there is any extra material that can be incorporated into a remastered outer-space edition. It seems sad that some of these old low budget classics have been spliced ​​and sold in all kinds of edited versions. Where are the master tapes and all the images not used? <br /> <br /> Aside from the first twenty boring minutes before Allen is handed over to the Castle, the rest of the movie is pretty good. There are not too many special effects (but Herbert's face after Julia hits him is good). The spooky atmosphere and the strange, exotic and seductive look of Barbara Steele make the film much better than it should be. I can honestly say that if Barbara Steele had not been in this movie, it would be a big zero. She makes the movie a ten!
