CB4 was horrible, but you may have given the idea to Cundieff. More like Spinal Tap than anything else, the movie is smart from the start. It surprised anyone who saw him again in the mid-nineties. The performances are played to laugh, but not so much so that they are cartoon characters, more like the Marx brothers. These guys are real and slightly different. They react to situations like any of us could. Well, we may not have a tantrum when our performance hats arrive late to the concert, or they take out guns and hit an executive of the record company, but you get an idea. N (n *** as) W (with) H (hats) takes himself seriously enough to cheer you up, and then you're hooked. rent or get this at all costs, even if you do not like rap music, this will leave you insane. Comparing this with CB4 is like comparing George Lucas' Star Wars with Gil Gerards' Buck Rogers' I think you see my point
