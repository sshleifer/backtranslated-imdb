When I saw this movie a few days ago, my eyes were completely fixed on the screen. His greatness attracted my attention to such an extent that I focused all my attention on it throughout its duration. I would recommend watching it not only anime fans, but anyone who likes big movies (or likes really strange things). The art style is beautiful, the sound is perfect and the symbolism inside is impressive. I have heard complaints about the strange insertion of English text in the film, but I think the way it is done is complementary to the strange style of the film. The self-attributed description of "Hello Kitty on acid" does not do justice to this film of absolutely epic proportions. I would like to find more works from whoever has done this and see them.
