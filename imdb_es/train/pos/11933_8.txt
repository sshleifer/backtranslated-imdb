I think this is a lovely family movie. There are many funny scenes and moving moments throughout the film. The actors are great and the effects well executed. Danny Glover plays George Knox, who runs the terrible baseball team 'The Angels' and is excellent throughout the film. Also fantastic are the young actors Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Milton Davis Jr. Christopher Lloyd is good as Al 'The Angel' and the effects are excellent in this excellent Disney movie. A moving and moving film that everyone should enjoy.
