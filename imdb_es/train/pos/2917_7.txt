While this movie is not a classic in any way, it is very entertaining, as I remember it. I saw it about 15 years ago on HBO and I loved the movie. It was written by the same guy who wrote and directed "Arthur" and, although it is not as fun as that movie, it shows the potential that Steve Gordon achieved with "Arthur".
