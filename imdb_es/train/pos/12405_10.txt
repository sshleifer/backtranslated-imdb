I captured this movie in 1990 on video by chance and without knowing what I was in. Many terror fans may have missed this idea that it was a typical prison movie and those who did did not like it, since it was not what they wanted to see. The factors mentioned above are probably the reasons why you have a low rating, but just ignore it and turn it on if you are a fan of the genre. <br /> <br /> He has solid suits in all departments, from the script and the atmosphere. To the performance and the prison itself. <br /> <br /> An absolute diamond, a film that I still have on video until today. Check it out.
