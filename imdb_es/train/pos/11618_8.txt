Rachel McAdams. Cillian Murphy Wes Craven. The dream team. This is one of the best thrillers of 2005. A great plot. A great turn A great candy for the eyes. This is one of Wes Craven's best films, apart from "Scream" and "A Nightmare on Elm Street". This could be the best. The plot is one of the best things in the movie and it is very simple. Lisa Reisert (McAdams), a troubled hotel manager, boards a Red Eye back to Los Angeles. Little does she know that she has been followed by Jackson Ripner, also known as Jack the Ripper (Murphy). They take a couple of drinks and end up sitting together on the plane. Later, he reveals to him that he is a murderer who was sent to kill the secretary of National Security who stays at Lisa's hotel. And what does this have to do with Lisa? Well, she would have to move her room to the upper suite so they can bomb her, if she does not, Ripner will murder her father (Brian Cox). The spin and the presentation of the story really give it an extra touch, and the secondary characters and the secondary jokes really add more value to it. In general, definitely one of the best thrillers of 2005. Definitely worth seeing. <br /> <br /> 3 1/2 of 4 stars
