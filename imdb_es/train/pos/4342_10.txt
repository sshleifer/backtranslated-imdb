This movie really did not surprise me, as such, it got better and better. I thought: "Paul Rieser wrote this, huh? Well ... we'll see how he does ..." Then I saw that Peter Falk was in that. I appreciate Colombo. Even though I was never a big fan of the show, I've always liked to see Peter Falk. <br /> <br /> The performances of Peter and Paul were so natural that I felt like a fly on the wall. They played so well that I practically felt dizzy with joy! ... And I had not even been drinking! <br /> <br /> This movie was so well done that I wanted to talk to Paul on the phone and let him know how much I enjoyed it! But I could not find your number. It must not be included in the list or something like that. <br /> <br /> This was one of those movies that I had no idea what it was about or who was in it or something. It just went on and I thought, "Hey, why not, let's see, if I do not like it, I do not have to see it ..." ... and I ended up loving him!
