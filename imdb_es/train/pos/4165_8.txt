['No, this clitoris of terror made for television, hilariously horrible, is not a dessert cake mortal possessed by a demon. Even so, this exceptionally frightening cathode ray garbage, although unmistakably amusing and, therefore, amusing, achieves an impressive apex of absolute and tireless silliness and atrocity that is quite tasty in such an execrable, absolutely preposterous way. Richard Crenna, looking haggard and possibly drunk, and Yvette Mimieux, acting as if she had never overcome the brutal rape she suffered at the &quot;Jackson County Jail,&quot; slowly portray a disgustingly nice and respectable suburban couple whose Small quaint, boring and numbed city existence tears when the adorable German shepherd they take, as the family pet, turns out to be an ancient lethal evil spirit. Very soon, Mimieux and his two disgusting children, Kim Richards and Ike Eisenmann (the psychic alien moppets from the drawings of Disney&#39;s &quot;Mountain of Witches&quot;) are worshiping a crayon drawing of the ugly and ugly canine entity in the studio . Boy, does not it sound really scary and disturbing now? Well, scary and disturbing this ridiculously ridiculous joke is not, but it sure is funny, thanks to Curtis (&quot;Nighttime Tide&quot;) the hopelessly weak direction of Harrington, caricature (not so) special effects, an almost painful and ridiculous situation. plot, and a game cast that bravely struggles with absurd history (in addition to the protagonists, both Martine Beswicke and RG Armstrong appear briefly as members of a satanic cult and Victor Jory has a good cameo as a useful Native American shaman). Favorite scene: the malted Mephestophelion mutt puts the blow on Crenna, practically forces him to put his hand in a blade of a lawnmower that turns violently. While fans of disgusting movies get stuck in the perfectly rotten stench of this stinking stupid, lovers of television trash should consider that this endearing waste is the equivalent of Alob.']
