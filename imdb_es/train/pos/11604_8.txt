In the seemingly endless quest to find well-made and well-performed horror films, it is very rare to find one that even remotely approaches the brand. Needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised when I came across "Burned at the Stake" on a cable network in the United States while I was changing channels. The premise is reasonably simple. In 1692, the young Ann Putnam (Swift) is the clearest witness against the alleged witches, and makes unfounded charges against anyone who wins her displeasure. Manipulating it for his own purposes is Reverend Parris (Peters), who also serves as a court guide on matters related to witchcraft and Satanism. Things get complicated when Ann begins to accuse the members of the Goode witchcraft family. Salem (around 1980), Loreen Graham (also played by Swift) begins to have unusual visions shortly before visiting the Salem Witch Museum. A strange man in a seventeenth-century costume tries to approach her there and the building. He continues to stalk her while strange phenomena begin to involve her more and more. Soon, it seems that she is being possessed by the spirit of Ann Putnam. Unfortunately, a more detailed description is quite involved and goes too far. Although the film is not action-oriented and is likely to be of little interest to many viewers, the performances are good and the seventeenth-century dialogue used in the film's many flashbacks sounds very convincing. The production values ​​are solid with the possible exception of some of the special effects. In a side note, the film's technical advisor was Laurie Cabot, the official witch of Salem. Viewers who appreciate a well-made, atmospheric, but discreet horror movie can appreciate this. The writer / director, Bert I. Gordon, has had a long career in horror and science fiction films and is best known for his work in a series of "big insect" movies and similar works years before.
