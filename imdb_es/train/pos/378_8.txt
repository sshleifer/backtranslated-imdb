These days, Spielberg's "purple color" is remembered mainly for being nominated for eleven Oscars and winning nothing. What is even more alarming is that Spielberg himself was not even nominated for Best Director. Needless to say, the filmmakers deserved more praise than they were granted. <br /> <br /> The story is about the trials and tribulations of Celie Johnson (Whoopi Goldberg), an African-American woman who was initially dominated by her incestuous father and then by her abusive husband. The film covers several years and focuses mainly on Celie's relationships with the women around her. It is told from a decidedly feminine perspective, but there is no need to fear that it is a saccharine 'film for girls'. <br /> <br /> The story is interesting, animated with humor sometimes, although the struggles of the central character are paramount. Some may not appreciate the change of tone towards the end of the movie, but I did not care, although similar content in a smaller movie would probably make me roll my eyes. <br /> <br /> The film received three Oscar nominations for its performance: Whoopi Goldberg (Best Actress), Oprah Winfrey (Best Supporting Actress) and Margaret Avery (Best Supporting Actress). I think Goldberg and Winfrey certainly deserved it and that Danny Glover was incredibly stiff. <br /> <br /> As already mentioned, Spielberg did not receive a Best Director nomination for his efforts. Such omission breeds belief, since Spielberg's leadership here is first-rate. I'm not particularly crazy about the Quincy Jones score, but it's not below average in any way. <br /> <br /> In the end, the story is satisfactory, well told by a master filmmaker who works at Pulitzer. Award-winning material Try it and you'll probably be as bewildered as I am about how Oscar's night could be treated so badly.
