Excellent story about teenagers, leaders, soccer players of the high school "stars". How far will you go to protect your friends? Lie kills How much can you lose if you study with an innocent girl? Can love overcome the odds? Can you defeat small-town people with a narrow mind? When your friend writes down and you "lose", will you do everything in your power to pay for it or will you be a man and respect your right to choose? Will you violate it and show it as your victory over a "problematic" girl? Can you defend the only one who has sin is to have an opinion of their own, to be able to make their own decisions, to choose for themselves? It made me think twice before making a judgment about who was right and who was wrong, but one is certain: a film and a very disturbing topic in general. Thumbs up!
