I've loved this movie since it first came out. I was about nine years old and now I'm 27. I remember playing the game in Sega Genisis. I had a lot of fun, I would love to show my son this movie. He also likes Michael Jackson and I know he will love this movie just as I did as a child. Although he is much younger than me when I saw him for the first time. I can not wait for it to come out on DVD! I hope it comes out on DVD! Please, come out on DVD! I'm dying to see it again !!! Well, that's my comment. I hope that someday soon I can see this movie again. I love all the videos in this movie. My favorite mini-video is Badder!
