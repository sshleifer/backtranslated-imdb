One of my favorite movies that I previewed in Seattle. Tom Hulce was amazing, without words he could express his feelings / thoughts. In fact, I sent Mike Ferrell some donation money to help distribute the film. It's good. The system says I need more lines but I do not want to give away things from the plot. I was in the audience in Seattle with Hulce and the director, a writer I believe and Mike Ferrell. They talked for about an hour. It's not really a dry eye in the house. Why Hollywood is still stupid, I do not know. (Actually I know, it's our fault, look what we see). Well, you get what you pay for the boys. Get this and see it with someone special. It is a jewel.
