That movie was amazing! I can not get over his songs. I think I'm too old for musicals, but that movie deserves some credit here, guys! My special favorite was Jack Wild. I, being a lover of British actors, can not abstain from all those young men with fresh faces and good looks. I never knew that when Jack was making that movie he was sixteen years old! He looks like an eleven-year-old boy. It's low, that's what helps. Try to post your answers, fellow posters, so you can relate to your experiences. Oh, and about Oliver Reed, that guy, Bill Sikes, I think that drone look is really familiar. Any idea where he has starred before? If so, post it, I'd really like to know.
