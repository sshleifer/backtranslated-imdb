Let's start this review on a positive note. I am very happy that they did not decide to fight with Tony for the shooting and do a retrospective season as if some people were rumored. Actually, the creator and writer of this episode David Chase did the opposite. Actually we do not know if Tony will live or die. He is in a coma and his chances of recovery are very low or nonexistent. This episode seemed to move very slowly, and the sleep induced by the coma in which Tony was involving a mistaken identity and a tunic, the Asian monks who slapped him were absolutely strange. After 45 minutes I got a little tired of everyone being sad, but that should not be a reason to criticize this episode. It was a strange and unpredictable episode, but it was still well written and intense. Edie Falco gave an amazing performance that defined her career in this episode as the wife in conflict who had to face the possible disappearance of her husband. I also found it interesting that AJ dropped out of school and swore a vendetta against Junior, that AJ probably will not have the balls to draw. Silvio is now the acting boss who opens numerous doors to problems in later episodes. There were also a lot of great occurrences in this episode, and I think Vito 'Pole-Smoker' Spadafore can face his demise if he's still a greedy SOB <br /> <br /> This was not a big episode and disappointed just because Although Tony kills people, we, as a public, adore him and feel he is our show hero. This was a necessary episode for the series, although it was a small snoring that induces the conclusion. Congratulations to the performance of Edie Falco, and to David Chase and the writers for creating this totally original and unpredictable plot twist. This is the only season of 'The Sopranos' where I do not have a good idea of ​​where it will go. I can not wait for next week's episode. My rating: 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> Best line of the episode: (Paulie to AJ): "Come on, Van Helsing!"
