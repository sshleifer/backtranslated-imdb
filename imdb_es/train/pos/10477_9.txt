Walking the tightrope between comedy and drama is one of the hardest acts of cinema. How do you get the laughs out of other people's misery and do not start to feel bad when it lasts too long? <br /> <br /> Well, this little amazing gem of the movie will offer great laughs, beautiful scenery and quite a good buzz too. I particularly like the concept that a trick of the story made alcohol legal since the Europeans liked it, and that marijuana was illegal, since "those other races" used it ... it's certainly true and exposes a racial side to the marijuana laws so openly exposed by the populations. Around the world. <br /> <br /> An extraordinary commentary on the "Extra DVD" ... two of them ... review the whole film with the two actors, and then again with the writers. I kept seeing things that I was sure were not in the first movie, but then I realized how easy it is to miss much of the subtle comedy of the first shot. What a flash! Do not miss it! 9/10 stars
