In Iran, women are not admitted to football games. Officially, it is because vulgar language and the behavior of the male audience should be avoided. But, of course, it's about sexism. Women are lower forms of human beings. <br /> <br /> Some brave girls oppose this and try to enter the stadium using different tricks. The soldiers capture them and keep them in a kind of cage, until the police pick them up. <br /> <br /> Despite the situation of madness, this is a movie with a lot of humor. It is also encouraging to see how people always find different ways to fight oppression. They will touch you at the same time you have a lot of laughs. Good job by director Jafar Panahi. This is in many ways a heroic comedy.
