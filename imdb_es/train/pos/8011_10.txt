['This was the best Muppet movie I&#39;ve seen! It turns out that Miss Piggy&#39;s fantasy of meeting babies was the cause of Muppet Babies. The songs will stay in my head forever. I&#39;m just saying it because that stupid Hey Dude Nickelodeon song still remains in my head. I&#39;m sorry, a little off topic there. But anyway, what I like is Animal after the credits that say &quot;Goodbye! Goodbye! Goodbye! Goodbye! Goodbye! See you later!&quot; That gave me a lot of laughter. My absolute favorite is the game at the end. I was surprised that the Sesame Street characters appeared at the wedding. I&#39;m glad that this movie was very entertaining. I borrowed it from the library and now I have bought it because I can not keep the library copy forever. In conclusion, I proclaim that this is the best movie I&#39;ve seen in my life. In my case, it&#39;s even better than Austin Powers in Goldmember, which was my favorite movie!']
