This is a rare movie about an archaeologist who studies the culture of the ancient Hohokam Indians. She takes out a (really false) mummy from a burial cave and brings it home to study it. Well, very soon she starts acting weird and talking to this mummy. And soon after, his son is possessed by the spirit of the mummy. Even the strangest events occur when the spirit tries to destroy the woman's family. Actually, this is REALLY BORING, and it will make you fall asleep the first few times you try to see it. But if you continue with that, you can reach the end. <br /> <br /> Ahah! What is the secret of the mummy? Is the spirit of the mummy angry at being removed from the cave? You may not be able to determine what the motivation of the spirit is, but if you like scary scams on a low budget (and 70's hairstyles!), This will have a certain comforting appeal. <br /> <br /> The way I've done it. The story described is much clearer than the boring and boring way in which the film exposes the story. Can a boring movie really be fascinating? Well ... somehow this accomplishes that. Maybe this is a good movie in the background but executed in a rather uncomfortable way. I do not know. What I do know is that I enjoyed it enough, despite its boredom. <br /> <br /> The fans of "Spider Baby" will be interested to know that in this film a couple of musical tracks of that movie are used. (Including an instrumental version of the theme). <br /> <br /> With a terrifying and fairly well-made sequence showing rocks and rocks possessed by rolling by themselves and eventually attacking some people in a caravan. Other scenes in the movie are simply creepy or quirky; but this scene is pretty scary. <br /> <br /> Look at this! It's weird and it's worth your time. You may even want one on your shelf.
