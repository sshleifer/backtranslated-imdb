Liam Neeson portrays the legendary Scotsman Robert Roy Macgregor of the early eighteenth century. He is a true actor. He captivates the audience with his charisma as he does in all his roles. Jessica Lange is excellent as his wife Mary. Maria is such a beautiful woman. It is his love that makes Rob Roy the legend, but it is his passion that makes his love eternal. They need each other. Tim Roth as evil Cunningham is perfect; One way or another, when you watch the movie, you'll find Cunningham disgusting. The landscape of Scotland is beautiful. The environment and the conditions of the times are represented quite well. If you like history, romance, passion and love, you will enjoy Rob Roy. There is violence and blood, but it is inevitable to tell this story as it should be told; No gratuitous violence. And you have to listen carefully if you're not used to a Scottish accent. An important point that makes this film so good is that no actor or actress is glamorous; they get dirty and actually look unattractive in various scenes. It is your ability as actors that attracts you, not based on marquee names, popularity or sex symbol appeal. This is something special.
