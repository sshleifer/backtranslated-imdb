Ironically, for a work not available on film or video for so long, ARMS AND THE MAN has remained constantly available on stage over the years since its debut in 1894, largely because it has aged as well as a solid satire In nature. Heroism and the business of war. Every time the world sinks into a fight, ARMS AND THE MAN rises increasingly timely and relevant. <br /> <br /> This is the work that Oscar Strauss converted (leaving aside most of Shaw's best ideas) in the successful operetta. , THE CHOCOLATE SOLDIER (when Hollywood came to * that, * they put aside the last vestiges of Shaw instead of paying him for the rights, he was, by then, an Oscar winner in his own right). While the best of Shaw has always been his ideas and his dialogue instead of his arguments, in ARMS AND THE MAN, the plot also shines and the teacher manages happy endings for all involved. <br /> <br /> Young Raina (Helena Bonham Carter), daughter of an officer and the richest man in her city, is engaged to a Bulgarian cavalry officer and everything seems fine until a disheveled Swiss mercenary (Pip Torrens) from the other side climbs up his drain fleeing from the battle where his army has been defeated. As usual in a Shaw satire, nothing is as it appears for the first time and social conventions are raised on the head in the light of simple reason and not so simple. There are no "good guys" or "bad guys", just people from a variety of classes who manage the best of their wits, just like life, only better, and naturally, with Shaw, the wit is perfectly perfected by all involved. <br /> <br /> The first film version (from 1932) (from Shaw's own script) of this more traditional and traditionally funny stage satire, and one of the first to make a real hit on this side of the Atlantic, He has been among the disappeared for a long time. Shaw did not sell the screen rights of his plays, he only got his license for periods of 5 years, and it seems that with the rapid evolution of sound technology making the 1932 films seem primitive only a few years later, Shaw he did not renew the license to show them. . As a result, we are immensely indebted to the BBC for finally releasing its 1987 broadcast version in a DVD box with nine other brilliant works. (Somewhat sad, PYGMALION, which many consider the best of Shaw, behaves less well on this set in a production with Lynn Redgrave and James Villiers). <br /> <br /> Even paired, as it is on your DVD, with the least impressive of an act, A MAN OF DESTINY, ARMS AND THE MAN, is a real treasure. <br /> <br /> Helena Bonham Carter continued, after taking over televised roles like this, to a major film career that will bring many viewers to this first role. They should not be disappointed, as Carter offers a performance commensurate with the innocence that the public expects of her, but under the somewhat pedestrian direction of James Cellan Jones (and despite the uniformly beautiful and well-observed physical production of the BBC), the fire Malicious of the role (and his outrage at having been underestimated in the last act) accumulates in only 80% of its potential. <br /> <br /> The same can be said of the real star of the piece, Pip Torrens, as Bluntschli the "Switzer". Despite its mortal danger, this is a good and engaging performance, but it does not focus on the physical comedy implicit in the opening scene, where the young soldier can barely stay awake. <br /> <br /> Production of a wonderful game transferred to the small screen with aplomb. It deserves to be widely seen and, ideally, propitiate a big screen remake even more animated with the style and enthusiasm of Wilde's recent ANALEAL HUSBAND remake. Virtually * anyone * WEAPONS AND MAN should be appreciated, and with good luck, we might get to see the original version of 1932. 'Up to one or another surface, this production will please anyone who loves good Shaw.
