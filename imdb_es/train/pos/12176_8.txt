Paul (Jason Lee) is a low performance player who is simply committed to a type A princess named Karen (Selma Blair). She chooses her clothes and her daily schedule. At his bachelor party, Paul gets a little drunk and somehow ends up taking a pretty dancer named Becky (Julia Stiles) to his excavations. "Nothing happened," as they say, but the duo wakes up in the same bed. Suddenly Karen's phones. She is on her way to Paul's apartment. Understandably, Paul pulls Becky out of the place, though her underpants are left behind. But, there is even more fun ahead. At a family dinner at the home of Karen's parents, Paul runs into Becky again, upon learning that she is Karen's cousin. Talk about some explanations to do! But, instead, Paul decides to fake a stomach problem and hides in the bathroom. Will Karen ever find that Becky spent the night at Paul's house? And what will be the consequences? I'm sorry for the critics who pan movies like this. You should definitely be happy, because this movie is fresh and fun. Of course, it does not hurt the matter that Lee is a fun and accomplished man, Stiles is a charming beauty or that Blair is a fianc√©e as natural as beautiful but anal. The rest of the cast, including James Brolin and Julie Haggerty, is also quite nice. The look of the movie is wonderful, as are the costumes and settings of California. Best of all, the script is imaginative and inspired, creating great laughs for the audience. In short, if you want to tickle the proverbial jokes, get this movie tonight. It may not be Academy Award material, but it is absolutely guaranteed to turn a bad day into a very good one.
