Hilarious film, evocative, confusing, bright. It reminds me of L'Age D'Or de Bunuel or Holy Mountain of Jodorowsky, many strange characters who seek and seek ... what is it? I laughed almost all the time, keeping a peripheral eye on the disconcerted and, at times, horrified reactions of the audience that surrounded me in the theater. Entertaining from the beginning to the entrails and poisoned entrails until the end, if it was an end. I wish I could remember every detail. Sometimes it obsesses me. <br /> <br /> Honestly, though, I only have the most positive memories of this movie. As it seems he is not available to take home and look, I guess I'll have to wait a few more years until Crispin Glover reappears in his big slide show (and the subsequent projection "What is it?") ... I saw this film in Atlanta almost directly after having been involved in a car accident quite devastating, so I was a little dazed at that time, what was maybe a very good mental state to see the arthropods who speak prophetic and delays in the costumes of superheroes and divine Glover in their proper configuration of corpulent-Q, girls with little clothes that rise from the floor like a magnificent dady dream of DADAist. <br /> <br /> Is it a statement about life as we know it? Of course, everyone expects art to be just that. Rather, I think that the truth is more evident in absences and in negative space. What he does not tell us is what we must deduce, but it is much more valid than the lies that other people feed us day after day. Rather a "WHAT IS IT?" More than 5000 movies like "Titanic" or "Sleepless in Seattle" (shudder, gag, moan). <br /> <br /> Thanks, Mr. Glover (besides, he's a fun man to watch on the screen or in his great slide show - Smart, funny, quirky, and outrageously hot). Make more movies, write more books, keep the nightmare alive.
