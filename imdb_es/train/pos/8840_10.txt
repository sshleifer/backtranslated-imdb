Watch Before the Devil counts as one of my best experiences of all time in the cinema. I have been intrigued by my mixed response to the film, and to me, the extremes of opinion indicate that the film touched something that the general public had adopted or rejected. It's one of those movies that has stayed with me, and I keep thinking and thinking about it. <br /> <br /> Surely the DVD will illuminate some of the themes and elements of the film? What it includes: Sidney Lumet's return film, the time-shift technique implemented in storytelling, the excellent combination of Lumet and Masterson and why it works so well, the masterful direction, the relatively rare approach that the Hollywood movies to the male characters and their condemned struggle to become a check book for their women, the presentation of Marisa Tomei, little presented but resonant, and, of course, the superb Hoffman with that central monologue on the sum of their parts, for me the heart of the movie. <br /> <br /> Ugh! Surely a masterful film. So imagine my disappointment to see the expected DVD - just to find no comments, no hidden scenes, no interviews, no extras. <br /> <br /> Hey, distributors, solve them!
