UC 0079, the one year war is about to end. Cyclops, a working group of Zeon, has attacked a neutral colony of Side 6. Its target, a new Gundam that is being built exclusively for Newtypes (supposedly built for Amuro Ray from the original saga of Gundam) inside it . When little Al Izuruha, a Zeon MS fan, encounters a Zaku after the battle erupts in the colony, he becomes friends with rookie MS pilot Benard "Bernie" Wiseman. The two become good friends, Al is treated as an honorary member of the Cyclops team. Through the show, Bernie acts as a father figure to Al (whose real father is always working) and seems to be captured with the Federation's Christina McKenzie, but in the end they must meet ... in battle. He soon learns that war is not child's play and Bernie must choose to make the maximum sacrifice to complete his mission. <br /> <br /> For only 6 episodes, Gundam 0080 is a well-done show. The mobile suits are extremely well designed, and the animation may seem outdated but it really shows emotion in the characters. If you liked 0083, take a look, or if you're new to the world of Gundam, this is a good show to begin with. If you look at a drama and character development program, this is for you, it focuses more on that than on the battle of mobile games. I would rate it more as a drama than an action. <br /> <br /> Mobile Suit Gundam 0080, War in the Pocket. <br /> <br /> Sometimes you have to lose to win.
