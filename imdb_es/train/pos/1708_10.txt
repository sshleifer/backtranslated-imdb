Looking at some of the negative posts, you really have to wonder what some people do for fun ... <br /> <br /> I was lucky enough to see the movie during its brief theatrical presentation. The audience laughed. I'm watching a tape while I'm writing and it's still a lot of fun! <br /> <br /> It also has a sweet side, with unexpected twists of genuine pathos. The deceased and great Royal Dano is especially effective as the lone farmer Wrenchmuller. Ariana Richards and J.J. Anderson are great as the main children. And the actors in Martian costumes, although limited to mimicry, do a great job. <br /> <br /> Another thing to look for are the background details. The film is full of tributes, pastiches and references to other science fiction and fantasy movies. Take a look at Martian costumes next time. One of them wears a Marty McFly costume, another is a Ghostbuster, a third wears the uniform of Casa Atreides and the fourth wears a flight suit of Ultimate Starfighter.
