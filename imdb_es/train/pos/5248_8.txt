['Granted, like many other similar films, it came from an SNL sketch. But Tim Meadows does a pretty fantastic job of turning a 3-dimensional one-dimensional character into a moderately viable comic character. He releases the sentences of a line in an entertaining way with a fair frequency, Billy Dee Williams is in this although his days of Lando are long gone, and everything is very well filmed. It&#39;s true that it&#39;s not a great art, but if you went to Wayne&#39;s world in search of Gone with the Wind, you did something wrong. Nice for what it is .......']
