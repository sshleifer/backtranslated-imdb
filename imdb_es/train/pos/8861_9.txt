Says Andy: "Nobody hurts, everyone wins". Before he says it, we know that the opposite is true: everyone gets hurt, nobody wins. This is a new line in American movies, or maybe an old chain that has finally been returned. Think of "Eastern Promises," "There Will Be Blood," "There is no country for the old." These films are dark, serious, extremely well made, and do not worry about happy endings. I love them. "Before the Devil Knows You're Dead" fits the general description, but creates an atmosphere of its own. The debut screenplay by Kelly Masterson is the closest thing to a Hollywood movie about a Greek tragedy. Sidney Lumet, who pays tribute to his partner and veteran director Stanley Donen, soberly and expertly turns the grim story into an outstanding drama of old-school characters. The opening shots, although of an obese accountant in the style of his trophy wife, look like the painting of a Dutch master. On the contrary, the condominium of the drug trafficker looks more like a chain of Mondrians. Great performances around. Only the character of Albert Finney, Charles, feels a little exaggerated, his eyes wide open and his mouth open almost all the time. But then he is in a deep, deeper problem than any of the problems that most of us will know. For compensation, Marisa Tomei is super hot. But, of course, you do not need me to tell you that. Why her character, Gina, would want to be with a guy like Andy, we're never told, but that's fine. Action is character, after all. The unique and magical touch of the music of Carter Burwell makes this excellent film a masterpiece. Do not miss it
