I only give 9 of 10, because I need to see it again, in a more current mental framework to have a new perspective. What I remember is an amazing psychological thriller that dazzled my brain and my eyes when I saw it. I would see it every time I came to HBO in the past (probably 1990 or so). I may even have recorded it, but that recording does not exist anymore, I'm sure. <br /> <br /> I wrote to GreenCine to try to get this title, they do not currently carry it. I hope I can find it at a local video store. <br /> <br /> I would recommend testing it if you find it somewhere. It is interesting at least. If you enjoyed movies like Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice, Gummo, or something strange and in that sense, try this one.
