Comedy about the romantic mismatches in New York City. Peter Bogdanovich is obviously in love with all the women in his photo, he reveres them, but Audrey Hepburn is (naturally) a bit above the others because, after all, she is the princess Bogdanovich who probably fell in love at the cinema 30 years before. He shoots her in loving close-ups, gets into the sheets between her and a wonderfully boiled / soft Ben Gazzara, and lets her room shine everywhere. The love connections made in the course of the movie are fast and fun, although I grew tired of John Ritter's TV-style nonsense. Colleen Camp, Dorothy Stratten and the sensational and earthy Patti Hansen are thrilling to watch. But it's really Hepburn's Valentine's Day and she absolutely shines. *** since ****
