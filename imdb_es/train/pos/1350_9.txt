In "Anne of Green Gables" (1934), Marilla Cuthbert (Helen Westley) and Matthew Cuthbert (OP Heggie), middle-aged brothers living together in Green Gables, a farm in Avonlea, on Prince Edward Island, decide to adopt a child from a distant orphanage to help on his farm. But the orphan they sent was a precocious 14-year-old girl named Anne Shirley (Dawn Evelyn Paris, a veteran of Disney's "Alice" series, who would later adopt her character's name). <br /> <br /> Anne was only 11 years old in Lucy Maude Montgomery's original novel, but the same actress could not go from 11 to college age during the course of history. The film suffers a bit from this concession, since many of Anne's reactions and much of what she says are more entertaining from an eleven-year-old girl than from an adolescent girl. As in the book, Anne is bright and quick, eager to please, but dissatisfied with her name, her constitution, her freckles and her long red hair. However, Anne is a child of the imagination who enjoys life very much and quickly adapts to her new family and the surroundings of Prince Edward Island. <br /> <br /> In fact, Anne is the original "teen drama queen" and the film's screenwriter chose to focus on this aspect of her character. What transformed the basic genre of slightly amusing family drama to comedy. A change that charmed audiences and continues to frustrate the purists of readers. <br /> <br /> Since the comedy is very much in the spirit of Montgomery's story, I see no reason to disagree with the changes, but to serve as a fair warning to anyone who expects a totally faithful adaptation. The element of comedy is the strength of the film, since it is one of the first self-reflexive parodies of the Hollywood conventions. The actress Anne Shirley was one of the beauties of all time in Hollywood and the film is black and white. Much of the fun is in seeing the endless laments of the title character about his appearance and the hair color that contradicts what appears on the screen. Anne regularly gives her rural companions meaningless melodramatic lines such as: "If you refuse, it will be a pain for life for me." Perhaps the most fun time is when you correct the spelling of your name on the classroom blackboard. <br /> <br /> Tom Brown does a good job since the love interest of Anne, Gilbert Blythe and Sara Haden, steals all the scenes in which she appears as Cuthbert's pompous neighbor. <br /> <br /> Then again, what do I know? I'm just a boy
