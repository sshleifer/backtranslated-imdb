The second alternate tale of the Gundam universe (G-Gundam being the first), Gundam Wing is another different view of the Gundam verse. Familiar elements are found, but Gundam Wing is really different from its counterparts. The biggest are the Gundams that are nothing more than terrorists fighting a single organization. In truth, the series does not really become a program about the war until episode 7, but in truth the real conflict, Eva's wars, does not happen until later episodes. <br /> <br /> The best positive aspects of this series are its characters. All the main characters have been developed throughout episode 49 and you can really sympathize with each of the roles they play. Another great advantage is the fantastic character design and wick of the series. The designs put to shame some of their Gundam counterparts. <br /> <br /> One of the biggest criticisms of this series is the number of UC fans who say they are tough from the original UC saga. Why does Gundam Wing get this rap when the most apparent Gundam Seed clone of UC is beyond me? It is true that many moments have arisen, but they have been told in new ways and there are also distinctive differences. <br /> <br /> Take, for example, the usual comparison of Zechs Merquise and UC Icon Char Aznable. Throughout the series, Zechs is more despicable in the Alliance and also in OZ forms, while the Red Comet shone as a symbol of Zeon. Another big difference is the fact that Zechs loses many soldiers under his command, hence the other nickname that gave him in the first episodes: "Killer of their own men." Char does not have this label. <br /> <br /> The problems with this series are not the mumbo jumbo philosophy but two problems. The first is the reused animation video of the Gundams attacks. Of course it's fun to see Heavy Arms attacking tanks, MS and planes for the first time. But in its fourth reuse, scenes like this age. <br /> <br /> The second problem is that the whole series is supposed to take place over a whole year. If you really think about all the events that are arising in the series, many things happen in a single year. <br /> <br /> But I guess you can easily dismiss this fact by ignoring the first lines of the introduction from time to time. According to its classification, this is probably the best of the Gundam tales of the alternative universe and a great introduction to the world of Gundam. After all, this was the first Gundam anime that aired on American television.
