I have to admit that I entered Fever Pitch with low expectations. It's not a big revelation for me to say that the last Jimmy Fallon movie (Taxi) was catwomanly bad, and that the Fever Pitch trailers were fine but they did not hypnotize me. I was already preparing some cheese baseball games for my review ... <br /> <br /> "I like Jimmy Fallon, but Taxi was the first in his movie career ... Well, now we have a steeeeee-riiiiiike twoooooooo One more punch, and it's back to SNL! "Or" buy some peanuts and cookie cookies, but do not buy tickets for Fever Pitch. You'll leave the theater and never come back! " Then the film had to leave and be much more entertaining than I expected. But hey, I could not let my puns go to waste, right? Another reason why I thought I would not mind the movie is that I hate the Boston Red Sox. My whole family hates them. The mere mention of the name of Pedro Martinez makes me run to the bathroom. Oh man, wait ... <br /> <br /> ... Alright, I'm back. Anyway, my mother, who is a fan of the St. Louis Cardinals, still believes that the World Series was manipulated last year. She refuses to believe that the Sox won it legitimately. But I'm man enough to admit that Fever Pitch made me sympathize, if only a little, with the plight of the Red Sox fans. <br /> <br /> Anyone who has a passion for sports will be able to relate to this Movie at some level. Unless you have a favorite sports team, you can not fully understand the extreme highs and lows that a fan like Fallon's Ben can go through. There is nothing as fresh as the smell of a new season and nothing so smooth as a clean slate. Well, figuratively speaking. It's the joy of being a sports fan. "Wait until next year," it becomes your mantra, your motto, your prayer, and Fever Pitch effectively captures that essence. <br /> <br /> I love the fact that the film takes a fictional story and throws it against the real-life backdrop of the unlikely Red Sox World Series last year. I do not like it so much that I want to get married, but you know what I mean. I expected this to be handled in a very cheesy way, and while the humor is a bit silly, it's actually quite realistic. <br /> <br /> You see, Ben's uncle took him to his first Red Sox game when he was 7, and when he died he left Ben with his two season tickets. Ben has not lost a game in 23 years. At the start of each season, he has a draft day in which he and his friends get together to find out who can go to what games with him. He makes everyone dance for the Yankees games and every time someone complains, he threatens them with tickets to games with the Royals (sorry, Mr. Shade) and the Devil Rays. It's a very good scene, and it works very well because, actually, I know people who do the "ticket draft day". I must also admit that I can relate to when Ben goes to dinner with Lindsey and her parents. The Red Sox are playing a road game, but instead of watching it live on TV, Ben decides to record it. One of the most dangerous things in life is to record a game and then be in public and try to avoid hearing the result. Been there. It is a very tense and terrifying situation. Weeeeeell, Ben enters the danger zone when a guy shows up at the restaurant and mentions watching the game. Ben immediately covers his ears and starts screaming like a banshee so he will not hear the result. Lindsey is embarrassed, and her parents do not know what to think. Yes, sports fans can be weird, I do not deny it. But it is real. <br /> <br /> Now, if you expect the raw and restless things for which the Farrelly brothers are known, then you might be disappointed. However, they do have their moments, like when Ben says he likes how Lindsey sometimes talks to one side of his mouth "like an adorable stroke victim", but overall this is definitely a softer and more romantic side that the brothers are showing. . <br /> <br /> That does not mean that the movie will ever get too sad. Fortunately, when the sap begins to ooze a little, the Farrelly know when to retreat. A romantic moment with Lindsey jumping to the field and running to Ben to declare his eternal love for him becomes Ben responding sincerely: "You have to tell me about the gardens. Is it fluffy?" Jimmy Fallon proves that with the right material he can handle himself well on the big screen, and Drew Barrymore remains a constant source of romantic comedy charm. Fever Pitch is just a good and solid entertainment that analyzes the genre of romantic comedy. It's a movie that boys and girls can relate to. Particularly the boys who practice sports fanaticism at some point during the year and the ladies who must deal with them. <br /> <br /> Now, if the Red Sox fans could shut up the "Curse of the Bambino" I would thank them. My Memphis Tigers NEVER won the NCAA basketball championship, so I officially declare that my situation is greater than yours. <br /> <br /> LOS GIST Fans of Jimmy Fallon, Drew Barrymore, romantic comedy, the Red Sox, baseball or sports Fanaticism in general should consider taking a look at Fever Pitch. I would not go out of my way to hurry up and see him at the first available moment, but it will be a great matinee. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3.25 (out of 5)
