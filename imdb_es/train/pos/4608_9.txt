Jackie Chan is considered by many fans of cinema and martial arts as one of the greatest action stars to adorn the silver screen and Police Story consolidated his reputation as the possible successor of the late and great Bruce Lee. If Enter The Dragon discovered the so-called landmark of Lee's greatness in the '70s, then the same can be said for Police Story and Jackie Chan in the' 80s. <br /> <br /> Forget about the Rush Hour trilogy , or any of your efforts in the US UU., The only movie that really characterizes Chan's excellence, not to mention the fact that he started his status as a kung-fu talisman that hits and crushes the bones, just as his cinematographic career was this, the History of the Police, the first in a series of successful police films, located in mainland China, today in Hong Kong. <br /> <br /> I have seen many of your efforts, such as Rush Hour, Rumble in the Bronx, The Medalian and The Tuxedo to name and, frankly, many of them pale to become insignificant compared to Police Story. In those films, we saw a less 'dumb' version of Jackie, who did not have the opportunity to use her fighting skills to the fullest, not to mention that the fight sequences were not as good as those in the efforts as Drunken Master, Police Story to name. <br /> <br /> The acrobatics in this movie are extraordinary and are the best in any action movie. The shopping center scene is literally one of a kind and you have to see it to believe it: the flying glass fragments, Chan, which hangs out of the bus just for his cane while a madman drives frantically through the streets of the city . and Chan successfully uses all kinds of inanimate objects and support devices as weapons to fight the bad guys. <br /> <br /> Given that he is known to be injured and break all the bones in his body and put himself in danger, Jackie's persistence in showing her versatility as a double for not trusting one, is a kind of testimony of his reputation as an expert in kung fu. Especially because he has the bruises to prove it. Therefore, he has shown that he is not a pony of a single trick when it comes to devising and proposing several intelligent-looking moves. <br /> <br /> As far as history is concerned, there is not much to discuss, but it is. it lacks narrative, it is compensated with its action from beginning to end and the sequences of struggle. As for the dialogue, well, it's not a really huge aspect of the film, so most fans of martial arts movies and Jackie are more interested in the action, unlike the story. <br /> <br /> Unlike what The Matrix says, there are no cables or CGI, or any kind of computer cheating involved. What you see is what you get, and what you get with Police Story is a great epic of Jackie Chan, full of action and vibrant tricks. It's much better than Rumble In The Bronx, Rush Hour and all your other American efforts. <Br /> <br /> Police Story is an excellent movie and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is a rookie Jackie Chan fan, but who is not sure which one to see first.
