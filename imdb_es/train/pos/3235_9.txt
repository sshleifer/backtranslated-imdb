['Excellent film, a realistic image of the contemporary, moving and profound Finland. One of the best Finnish films ever made. Beautifully captures everyday life in a small town in central Finland, the desires and weaknesses of people, joys and sorrows. The bright early autumn sun creates a fresh atmosphere for this lucid examination of people in a welfare society. Lampela is in fact one of the most promising Finnish filmmakers. It shows that it is possible to make exciting movies without machine guns or bloodshed. It&#39;s also worth watching his next movie, Eila, although the story of cleaning women who fight for their jobs is not as universally attractive as the destinations in Joki.']
