If you liked the "Repulsion" of Roman Polanski, you should probably check "The tenant", since it is a similar concept, only with Polanski entering and playing the schizophrenic nut. This is actually one of my favorites from his films, secondly, after "Rosemary's Baby", of course, and it's a direct journey towards the mental collapse of a man who moves into the old apartment of a suicidal victim . The rest of the residents of the building are scaly and fanatical to keep the noise level low, even the smallest 'titter' becomes a big problem and Polanski, who stars, becomes increasingly paranoid and succumbs to his crazy hallucinations more and more as the movie progresses. in. You get to the point where you're dressing and acting like the old tenant, and you realize it's only a matter of time before you decide to run your somersault through the window again ... The movie is a bit slow and time-consuming for while, but if you have ever seen a Roman Polanski movie, you should know that it will end with an explosion and this movie will not disappoint. It is also better if you do not question the complexities of the premise and simply take it as a descent into madness, because sometimes it is quite surreal. Polanski is very good as the shy and crazy resident who, in some way, attracts the always illustrious Isabelle Adjani. We can also see it running adrift, which is disturbing and hilarious at the same time! Damn, he makes for an ugly girl! Then, the Polanski fans, who can see beyond their thirty-year-old pedophile charges, should enjoy "The Tenant" as an entertaining psychological journey of the head ...
