['Father and son communicate very little. In fact they speak different languages. When the son leads his father 3000 miles for his pilgrimage to Mecca, the talks finally take place. They are difficult and growth is necessary on both sides. <br /><br /> This film takes us to the hearts of these two travelers, and in fact it is a great trip for the audience, as well as for the two directors. The images throughout are impressive, especially the final scenes in Mecca. Underline to me, once again, how different the world can be, but also, at the same time, how similar. The same thing happened with the father and son in this movie. <br /><br /> Watch this movie Tell your friends to see it. You&#39;ll be glad you did it.']
