Yes, it's a movie for girls and it moves a little slow, but in reality it's pretty good, and I consider myself a manly man. You must love Judy Davis, no matter where she is, and the girl who plays her daughter offers natural and convincing performance. <br /> <br /> The landscape of the small coastal summer place is beautiful and plays well with the main theme of the film. Unknown actors and actresses (at least unknown to me) lend a realism to the movie that attracts you and keeps your attention. In general, I give it an 8/10. Go see it.
