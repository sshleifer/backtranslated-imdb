Stumble upon. I must say that at the beginning I was a little disappointed in the first episodes, but trusting in the spectacle and in the unquestionable talent of Abe Forsythe, I continued watching. I can safely say that I am happy now that I have done it. The story developed quite well, and all the characters have a solid base, and most do not lack information. <br /> <br /> The only thing I can criticize in this production is the somewhat annoying voice and pronunciation. owned by the character Lizzie. <br /> <br /> Some good acting, along with a stellar plot, makes this show come to the line. Here we have to wait for another season!
