Illudere (to deceive) comes from the Latin verb 'ludere' (to play), so he is warned about the 'spy game' as a cruel, but elaborate and intelligent (!) Activity coming from a complex and as it may seem Absurd and vain personal history, whatever it may be; and yet, I am fascinated by the mechanism of betrayal and loyalty, the raw material of any relationship, from the personal to the social; Then, many years ago, I was able to finish the book, it was a revelation! At first I was bored so much if it were not for the amazing style of writing (I really started to LOVE Le Carre after that novel). The main character is not at all hesitant: he has chosen to redeem his weakness following the path of faith towards friendship and love, or is he not? After this novel, you can clearly understand the darker version of "Our Man in Havana" by Green, written by LeCarre with "The Tailor of Panama"; there is no game, there it ends in tragedy or in a comical and grotesque way, or both. There are no Smiley here to maintain decent human qualities in 'the service', or at least it does not make sense to present you in this case. The BBC has done an excellent job with these series of LeCarre novels: the actors are excellent, as are the locations and the scenarios; Of course, the script here is brilliantly adapted. However, be careful, even if someone finds it ridiculous, the after taste is bitter.
