One of the best rock and roll films in history. And it's not just mindless fun. There were really many clever jokes in him. Of course I love ramones. But with all the "anarchy" and the themes of "I hate high school", the film does not take itself too seriously, which is what I like the most. <br /> <br /> The first time I saw the movie in the spring of 1980, and I saw it again recently. Since I went to high school in the late 1970s, I felt a bit nostalgic. <br /> <br /> As I said, this movie does not take that seriously and it's not as pretentious as so many other teenage foods from the seventies, eighties and nineties. And to talk about that, it's not really dirty or disgusting either. Only PG rated. That's weird for a movie in this category. A great cult classic and a truly incredible time capsule.
