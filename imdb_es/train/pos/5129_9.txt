I can see why this movie was nominated for an Oscar for Best Live Action Short, as it was built with mastery. Even if you do not especially like the Blues (although for me, this sounded a lot more like jazz), you can easily appreciate this movie. It's just very well done, but for my life, I do not see why director Gjon Mili only managed to direct a film, this one. In other words, the film is nominated and, nevertheless, the director did not get any kind of momentum in his career. As for the black artists, I could understand that this does not cause their careers to change at great speed, since, unfortunately, the majority of white society has indifference (or worse) for blacks or "that kind of music". <br /> <br /> If you watch this movie, if you are not particularly enjoying the previous part, go directly to the 5:50 mark, where it increases considerably. When the lady stopped singing and the performers began to improvise, the rhythm improved a lot.
