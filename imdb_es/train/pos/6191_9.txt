It seems that Hal Hartley's films are quite successful for most audiences. This movie will not be an exception to that rule. Fay Grim acts as a sequel to Hartley's 'Henry Foole' since 1998. This time it focuses on Henry's ex-wife (played to perfection by the always welcome Parker Posey), who is being harassed by CIA thugs on the Henry's unpublished book about all his dark deals. In the meantime, Fay ends up in an odyssey, dealing with international spies, etc. The movie gets stuck a bit in the second half. If you have been a fan of Hal Hartley in the past, this is one that should not be missed. For the Hartley beginner who has only heard about his film making technique, you may want to watch his previous films before starting with this one (especially if he has not yet seen 'Henry'). I admired the work of the camera, which sometimes reminded me of some early photographs of Man Ray.
