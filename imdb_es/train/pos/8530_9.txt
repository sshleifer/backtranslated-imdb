I'm not sure why it does not play in Peoria, apparently, but this is a very funny and intelligent British comedy. It is established at the end of the "swings of the sixties". Peter Sellars is fantastic as the rich, forty-something womanizer in series. The perfectly delicious Goldie Hawn, who plays a 19-year-old American in London, is, initially, Sellars' "catch of the day." But the gastronomic critic of the urban television can not avoid falling before the American blond vertigo. <br /> <br /> Humor, pathos, great script, strong performances by the leaders and the caste of support. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie, and the best joke is the last line. <br /> <br /> Try it, you'll like it.
