Wow, praise IMDb and Google, because I've been trying to remember the name of this amazing movie for more than 15 years. High massacre, man! Hells yeah! <br /> <br /> I'm not going to bore you with a summary of the plot, and actors, and yadda yadda yadda, because you all know what's going on. That's why you're here anyway. However, what I will do is explain the good memory I have of this D-Movie matrix joint par excellence of the 80s. <br /> <br /> In 1987, when I was around 7 years old, my father used to rent everything . these horror movies Would you mind if your children were watching them with him? No. Then, at that early age I saw Slaughter High. What I saw in that movie stayed with me in a big way. I have not seen it since then, but to this day I remember most of the ridiculous deaths in the movie. For example, the post-sex scene (why is there a metal bed in a school?) Is electrocuted. Or, the boy is drowning in a cess pool. Come on! My personal favorite, however ... the bursting of the stomach of the contaminated beer. Amazing! How can you honestly hate in a movie where one of the characters finds a beer in an abandoned school, like, 10 or 15 years later and thinks it would be a good idea to take it? Then your stomach explodes? What!? And that great line: Let's take my car ... it always starts. Classic shit until the end. <br /> <br /> I mean, now I look back, almost 20 years later, and I laugh about it. But when I was 7 years old, I was scared. That jester hat (or was it a mask?) That the killer rocked at all times scared me at f * ck out! <br /> <br /> In general, yes, a fucking movie. But for reasons of nostalgia and humor, this movie gets 9 out of 10 of me. Stay up late every night and expect to see this in the same Late Late Play movie program, or look for a copy on VHS and dust off your VCR.
