I saw this movie once and I could see it again, but although Jamie Foxx is good at the movie, I think they could have used a "less fun" character like Alvin Sanders. The scenes of Foxx, for example, in prison when he faces Edgar Clenteen (David Morse) are too funny. David Morse is again a wonderful photographer of a policeman. Its hard but mostly silent features are perfect for your role. Once again, Morse meets Doug Hutchinson (Bristol) at the theater. Morse ends up falling hard on Hutchinson. Both are perfect for this scenario in each movie. Personally, I love that quality in a movie, where the actors end up in the same situation as in a previous movie, as they did in The Green Mile. In general, it was a pretty good movie.
