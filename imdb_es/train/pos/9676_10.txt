The movie was very sweet and comforting! I cry almost every time I watch the movie. I would recommend this movie for everyone. The movie was very inspiring for me. The actors did a great acting job, and the movie was very well performed and done. The film was about a little girl who owned a parrot named Paulie. Paulie had been separated from her by her parents because they thought it would be best for her. <br /> <br /> After Paulie had experienced so many people, he ended up in a cage alone in a basement. Finally, this Russian man who had got a job in a place as a janitor. He had found Paulie in the basement and Paulie started talking to him, telling him the story of his life. In the end, the man helped Paulie to meet Marie (the girl who raised Paulie). Love overcame all obstacles.
