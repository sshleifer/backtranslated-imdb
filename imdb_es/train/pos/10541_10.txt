I thought this was an awesome movie. The subject of the theme is sweet! :) Anyway, the only thing that bothered me a little was at the beginning, when everything should have been normal. It was very strange and unrealistic. The great cable company is mainly what I'm talking about. Apart from that, the movie was very creative. I think the whole performance was well done, the actors perfectly represented the personalities of their characters. Everything fits well. It really is a pity that it is not a soundtrack. That would have been great! Because this is a Canadian film and because it's one of my favorites, I give this movie 10 out of 10!
