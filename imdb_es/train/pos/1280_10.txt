I was lucky to have seen this on a whim during a film festival and they hit me so hard with what I saw that I came back the following night for its second of the three screenings. A fun, savage, sharp-toothed attack on all aspects of conventional entertainment passively swallowed without testing by the target audience the lowest common denominator made by a lone avenging journalist who gradually receives members of his guerrilla war on predictability. It is about the film, and it is executed in such an unpredictable and refreshing way that you stay after the credits are renewed with renewed hope and excited that original films can still be made. Anyone frustrated with unfulfilled expectations that something illuminates their imagination would do well to hunt (and I mean to hunt) this item just seen down. For fans of Fight Club and any Charlie Kaufman movie, it is required to be seen by all those who avoid multiplexed like a rabid dog.
