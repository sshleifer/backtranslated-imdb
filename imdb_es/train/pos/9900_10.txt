It's movies like these that make you wish you never picked the nerd who grew up in school. If you liked this movie, then I suggest you see Valentine. I just found out today that the guy who played Marty (Simon) committed suicide shortly after the movie was released, which is a shame because he did a good job. I wonder if it's because of the role he played in the movie. It starts when Carol tricks him into going to the girls' bathroom and acting like they're about to do it. When it was changing in the showers, Carol's popular friends sneaked into the bathroom and had everything ready, camera, electric shock, pole. When Marty opened the curtain, naked, he realized he had been tricked. He tries to cover the shower, but the children open it, grab Marty and start being mean to him while the camera is rolling. They lifted him up, buried his head in the toilet while he was blushing, and electrocuted him (slightly). When the children are detained, delivered by the coach, two of the children give Marty a joint that will make him vomit. Skip breaks one of the glass windows of the gym using a brick for the teacher to excuse him. While Marty is vomiting in the bathroom, Skip sneaks into the Science Lab and mixes some things that look like cocaine but he's not sure what it was. The laboratory exploits badly disfiguring it. 5 years later, the children who tormented him that day received invitations to a 5-year school meeting at the old school that burned that day when it exploded. One by one people are killed. I do not understand how the girl who drowned really drowned. she could have got back up after Marty left. She almost came out the first time.
