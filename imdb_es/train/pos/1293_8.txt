This is an excellent little movie about the loneliness of the single man. Phillipe Harel as Notre Heros is a bit like an amalgam of Robert de Niro in Taxi Driver, Inspector Clouseau (in his stoicism) and Chauncey Gardiner in Being There (also Peter Sellers). He is single, but still has no idea how to attract the opposite sex. In fact, it really does not make any effort! <br /> <br /> He has a stoicism and a fatalism that defies any hope of achieving the couple. - his friend José García as Tisserand is in the same situation but at least makes a brave effort to transcend his extended virginity (he is 28 years old and admits that he has never had sexual relations). <br /> <br /> Very good outdoor shots of Paris and Rouen, where the two software people travel on business. They try several nightclubs and places, but all in vain. My theory is that they are trying the wrong places: they go to more or less nightclubs for young people; They should try the type that older people have, more than their age. <br /> <br /> Harel is becoming increasingly isolated and makes a small effort of Niro, as in Taxi Driver, urging his friend / colleague to go and stab some guy who has thrown a pretty girl in the nightclub. <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing.
