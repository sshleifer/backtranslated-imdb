GOJOE takes a while to get used to the principle, but the final result is very satisfactory. The story, about a murderous samurai who seeks to redeem himself by opposing an effeminate but dangerous samurai, is worth more than a watch. There is a lot at stake here, from physical survival to soulful salvation. The film may seem a bit similar to another Samurai movie inspired by the anime at first, but eventually it enters a more mature / adult territory soon after. <br /> <br /> You can not miss it. GOJOE is one of the best samurai movies that come after Kurosawa. <br /> <br /> 8 of 10 <br /> <br /> (visit www.nixflix.com for a more detailed review of the film and reviews of other foreign films)
