Once again, demonstrating his incredible versatility, John Turturro plays with the introspective genius of Russian chess preparing for a comeback tournament, and forges an unlikely relationship with an artillery resident (Emily Watson) at an Italian hotel in 1920. They fall in love, before the horror of their mountaineering socialist mother (Geraldine James). A wonderful love story, whose glossing of chess can make it look cerebral. But despite its origins in a Nabakov story, it certainly is not. The romantic elements and the sense of time and place overcome psychological analysis. John Turturro, who appeared in "Barton Fink", "Oh brother, where are you?" "The Big Lebowski" proves that he does not depend on Coen Bros films to assert his stature.
