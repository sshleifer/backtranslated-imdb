Rating E <br /> <br /> I never actually had a Nintendo 64, but I've played one many times. In my opinion, along with Conkers Bad Fur Day, Super Mario 64 is one of the best video games for the Nintendo 64 system. I have played this game many times and it is always good. If you have an N64 and do not have this game, you should try to find it. The original Super Mario Bros games were side-scrolling video games, but Super Mario 64 has a 3D Mario in a nice 3D environment. The game is a bit strange, but there are many things you can do in the game. You play as Super Mario and once again you must rescue Princess and the 120 stars of Bowzer power. I can do it in a 3D environment. Super Mario 64 is a very funny and good N64 game, and I recommend it. <br /> <br /> 10/10
