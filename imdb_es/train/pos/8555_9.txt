* In the first place, although many say that it is the worst of the series, I do not believe that it is true, since it ideally reflects the adolescent mentality of the 21st century. It offers perfect opportunities to make you laugh and remember the good teenager. Sometimes you would have liked to have fun as much as the characters. <br /> <br /> * I agree with the fact that it is a movie for teenagers, but comedy movies nowadays are not supposed to be for teenagers. ... the cinemas are mostly the place for teenagers to go out; Also, watching a movie of this kind during a slumber party or something like that is very good to have a great time. <br /> <br /> * Many comment on the amount of nudity in this movie. Well ... let's face it ... does not that reflect the thoughts of teenage boys like the ones in the movie? What would you like to see ... smart books, romantic things? that's not at all what would be in the minds of those teenagers ... <br /> <br /> * To conclude, I think that if you are a teenager, you should absolutely watch the movie, and even if you are a man or A really grown woman, you should see him if he still has a teenage mind or if he often thinks about what it was like to be a teenager, or things like that. Thank you for reading!
