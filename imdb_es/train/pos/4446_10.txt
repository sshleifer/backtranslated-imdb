Yes, I call this a perfect movie. There is not a boring second, a fantastic cast of mostly unknown actresses and actors, a great variety of characters that are well defined and all have understandable motives that they could sympathize with, perfect lighting, crisp black and white photographs, an adequate soundtrack. an intelligent and harmonious set and a story that is attractive and works. It is one of those images of first quality in which all the pride of Hollywood must rest, the mark that all must strive to achieve. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwyck is simply awesome. There was nothing this actress could not do, and it was always easy on the melodramatic side. No hysterical outbursts with this lady: I ​​always thought I was a better actress than the goddesses on the screen like Bette Davis or Joan Crawford, and this movie confirmed my opinion. Always as hard as the nails and at the same time transmitting the true feelings. It is fair to add that he also obtained many good roles during his long career, and this is by far the least interesting. <br /> <br /> The title fits very well with this movie. It's about desires, human desires that I think everyone can understand. Actually, nobody seems to be plotting in this movie, all the characters act on impulse, everyone wants to be happy without hurting anyone. The sad fact that this often leads to complications makes the dramatic content to which I will not go here. <br /> <br /> I liked what this film has to say about youth, about maturation and about need. engage. The film that I most associate with this is Shadow of a Doubt by Alfred Hitchcock, creates a similar atmosphere of Small Town in America, idealized and at the same time caricatured. The story bears some resemblance to Fritz Lang's much more severe film, Clash by Night, made one year earlier, where Stanywck stars in a similar part. I can also recommend it.
