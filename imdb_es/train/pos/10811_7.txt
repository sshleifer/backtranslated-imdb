This film takes you to another moment in which there was a different rhythm to that of everyday life. We have an idea of ​​how families had to deal with war and how quickly we sent young people to fight. A very moving look at the past and a reminder that the victims of war do not happen at the front. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, many of us have never had to go through what our great-grandparents, grandparents or parents went through a war. This movie, I think, is a small thank you. Peter Outerbridge looks amazingly like a young Peter O'Toole and Russell Crowe is absolutely charming and as Australian as he can be. Definitely worth listening to recite "High flight" and makes me wonder what could be achieved with Shakespeare.
