I used this movie in a religion class I was teaching. The golden fish is swimming happily in its bowl in an apartment on the top floor. A boy and his mother are far from home. The child has received money to buy milk. On the way home, he stops at the carnival to play a game. Next to him is a man in a black suit who looks a little scared. The child drops the bottle of milk. Breaks. The man in the black suit gives him money to replace the milk. This scene alternates with what is happening at home. A black cat climbs the fire escape and enters the apartment. He (?) Discover the fish tank and observe it. The fish swims energetically and leaves the bowl. At this point, a group of teenagers in my class and I fell in love with the fish. The cat takes the fish in its mouth and we all hold our breath. The cat drops the fish in the bowl. The double story line includes the suspect man in black and the suspicious black cat. Both inspire prejudices. Both are innocent. It was a great topic of discussion in my class.
