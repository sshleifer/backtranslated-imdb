According to John Ford's movie, fictional biopic of the life of Abraham Lincoln, his biggest flaws may have been a clumsiness with the woman and an ability to dance "in the worst way". Ford's camera has only praised points of view to reveal Mr. Lincoln's early life. But as far as the film lacks complexities of character it makes up for in beauty and depth of vision. Strangely beautiful compositions of the old movie, what could have been a series of beautiful frames, Ford has a unique eye to tell a story. The movie sings about the life of a hopeful young man. Henry Fonda plays the contemplative and spontaneously intelligent Lincoln, one of his best roles. <br /> <br /> The film is about two young men, brothers, in trial for a murder that both claim to have committed. In the classic style of the angry mafia, the city decides to take charge of justice and lynch them both, until Abe, honest, gets into the fray. They love it with their humor, telling them not to steal their first big case and that they are as good lynched with him as the children's lawyer. What follows seems to become the outline of all the dramas, murders and subsequent courtroom, when Abe astutely interrogates the witnesses of the delight and humor of the judge, the jury and the city before finding the missing links. <br /> <br /> The film unfolds like many John Ford films do: a spoonful of Americana, a hint of moderate predictability, a hint of sarcasm that he is not sure to include in the recipe or if Ford himself did. Despite the openly "Hollywood" feel of the film, and the overly patriotic jokes that allude to Lincoln's future presidency, the film is completely enjoyable and pleasantly well constructed, if you can take your drama with a little salt.
