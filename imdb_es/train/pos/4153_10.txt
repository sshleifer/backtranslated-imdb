This was a fantastic episode. I saw a clip on YouTube, and I promised myself that if it appeared on TV, I would stick to the set to watch it. I ended up seeing him with a friend of mine, who is gay, and we both cried at the end. This was a truly well-written and sincere episode of forbidden love between two policemen who, I felt, were really (in Coop's words) "the lucky ones". It is episodes like this that really make Cold Case one of the most captivating and beloved works of television magic on the CBS network. I look forward to more episodes and a repeat of "Forever Blue" because I will always see it again and again.
