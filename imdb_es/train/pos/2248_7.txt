An amazing rental at a local video store, I was pleased to find a media satire valuable enough to challenge Oliver Stone's "Natural Born Killers". And almost so disturbing. I think it was good to see him at the end of 2004 watching Republican Machine doing its magic in the majority of viewers in the United States. The question "Are we really such manipulators?" <br /> <br /> My eyesight definitely went wide. It also provoked a broader theological question: the story of Christ. Could word of mouth and the overwhelming dependence on something exploitative like television produce a messiah? Could the story of Christ have been exaggerated? Could it have been completely manufactured? It is something that the film puts in an extremely perceptive light.
