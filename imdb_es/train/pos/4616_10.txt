The title of this movie is taken from a party game called "Seven minutes in the sky". The game was popular with my husband's friends when he was in high school in Brooklyn, New York, and he describes it as something like "Spin-the-Bottle", "Lifesaver Relay" and other pre-teen kissing games. According to the rules, the name of a child and that of a girl will be drawn, and the elect will be ordered to enter together in a dark closet and remain there for seven minutes. Meanwhile, there would be speculation among the guests at the party as to whether the two had the courage to hold hands, hug and / or kiss in the privacy of the closet. After seven minutes, the game leader would say: "Time is up" or knock on the closet door, and the couple would emerge from the closet. After being questioned by the other guests, the couple would have to admit what they had done during their "Seven Minutes in Heaven". Then, other couples would be chosen to enter the closet until all the guests had participated. The winners of the game would be the winners of the game. <br /> <br /> These games have served as social "icebreakers" for children and teenagers, but they can be embarrassing and intimidating for shy individuals. . The film received this title because it deals with the first experiences of teenagers with love and romantic love.
