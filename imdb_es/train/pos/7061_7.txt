Of course, the original is better, but this is not as bad as everyone says! Yes, it consists of 3 stories, but hey, so what? I thought it was good enough to be honest. I really liked how Anastasia changed a bit when she fell in love, shows what love can do. The stories were not so bad either. <br /> <br /> I also liked Cinderella's voice better. I have nothing against his voice in the original, but I think it sounds better, more pleasant here. I also liked his personality in this, he had more than one spine, but he was still kind. <br /> <br /> So, I'll give Cinderella II: Dreams Come True a 7/10.
