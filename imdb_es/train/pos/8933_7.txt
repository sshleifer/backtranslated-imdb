Claire Denis has repeatedly shown that the film does not need to tell a story, which is enough to create an experience that allows the viewer to take the ingredients and make them what they want. <br /> <br /> Apparently the idea In the framework of a more non-linear film is the older man who lives on the French-Swiss border, a man dedicated to his dogs, who still has a lover, but whose heart condition He threatens his life more and more. He has a son with a small family who meets with him infrequently, but when he discovers that he needs a heart transplant, he chooses to go to Tahiti via Japan to get a heart transplant on the black market and rekindle a lost relationship. with a son who had formed a Tahitian woman years ago. <br /> <br /> What Denis does with this sketch of a story is to use his camera to explore the loneliness of the soul, the immensity of nature, the interaction of man with people. vs animals, etc. Most of the time the "movie" does not make sense, but that is because we try very hard to connect all the points that appear before us in beautiful photos. Life is something like this: we look, we see, we observe, we integrate, we process and we make it what we want. <br /> <br /> By using this way of making movies (as she did in the strangely beautiful 'Beau Travail') Claire Denis has developed a signature technique. The fact that the viewer finds or does not reward the final product has much to do with our individual methods of processing visual and conceptual information. This is an interesting and visually captivating film, but many viewers will find that it is too long a discourse about too little. Maybe watching again will change that. Harp grady
