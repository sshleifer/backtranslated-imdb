"Jared Diamond pointed out in the first episode that other peoples of the world had no animals to domesticate, but Europeans did, and that explains why we could make steel and invent complex machines." --- It is obvious that the person who wrote this comment has not understood the reasoning behind this documentary or the original book. Please, do not ruin this great piece with your simple mind. The reasons are much more complex than the only thing you mentioned. Please read the book, as it is a great source of information. I enjoyed it a lot. This book is even a textbook taught in some universities.
