What do you get if you cross The Matrix with The Truman Show? <br /> <br /> I'm sure you've already seen The Matrix. The creators of The Matrix say that it is inspired by anime. Just to see the trailer of this classic, you can see where they got the plot. <br /> <br /> The film is set in the 1980s in Japan, and it really shows. The costumes, the music and the words (in the recent English version of AD Vision) are as if they had been taken directly from the era. I think it was also done at that time, but due to certain points in the plot, this does not date to the movie! <br /> <br /> As you probably guessed from my reference to The Matrix, the world is not real. It's not really the 1980s. In fact, it's more like the 2480's. After a nuclear war, the ecosystem of the Earth (or "Biosphere Prime") was destroyed. The survivors force us to escape into space, where the conflict continued. Once all the planets (or "Biospheres") were abandoned, people began to live in Megazones, cities within spaceships, where, through the techniques of hypnotism and the illusion of the Truman Show, they were made to believe that we are back on Earth. at the calmest moment of recent memory ... The 1980s. When the young Shogo gets a mysterious motorcycle of advanced appearance, it leads him to discover more than he is supposed to know ... The Garland (a bicycle which becomes a mech), a weapon of the 2400, helps Shogo escape the pursuit. military. As more and more is discovered about the MegaZone, the war is closer to home and, due to the conflicts between the army and the computer, the war also comes to the MegaZone ... I apologize if those points are seen as spoilers, but the plot is basically described that way in the synopsis. <br /> <br /> Emotions are higher in this movie, more than in The Matrix. You really believe that the war is in progress, and Shogo really is quite marked by what he is discovering. What begins as a super happy movie of the 80s becomes a tragic story of war and unreality. These characters are real people, not the cardboard cutouts that we saw circling in the bullet in The Matrix. There really is a sense of suffering that people can go through after being caught in a conspiracy and a war. It may just strangle you towards the end ... I know I did it with me. <br /> <br /> The animation is quite impressive for your day, and the image quality on the ADVision DVD is amazing for your age. The style of the works of art is beautiful and recalls the traditional anime, very cultural. Get ready for a lot of violence and blood, there is also a scene of erotic sex. <br /> <br /> The ending can be seen as a 'there can be no end', similar to Matrix, or, presumably, I can follow the sequel, which I have not yet had the pleasure of seeing. <br /> <br /> I have to say that this is one of the best animes I've seen, in fact, one of the best movies I've seen, and considered by many as one of the best animes of all time. <br /> <br /> I must recommend the ADVision DVD, since its English version is incredible, and the movie Justice, and it can be purchased with an art box to make the two sequels when they are published, which will have the same vocal cast. <br /> <br /> In general, MegaZone 23 is an incredible movie, and deserves to be highly celebrated, and it should be an essential element in the collection of any anime fan. Heck, even my mother enjoyed it.
