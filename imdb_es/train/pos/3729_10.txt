Although I suppose this movie could have rap as Anti-Vietnam, while I watched it I did not feel that was the case, but the film was simply an honest look at the perspective of young people trained for a war. that the public did not support him ... he showed his fear, his desperation, his impulse ... everything, out in the open, naked. As a soldier, many of the issues seemed true to me in my experience in the army, especially in the training camp. In general, this film, although filmed with a very small budget, looks very good, is very well organized and presents an excellent performance and direction. I recommend this movie to anyone looking for another excellent Colin Farrell movie. 10/10
