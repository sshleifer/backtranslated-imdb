A very interesting documentary about the Scottish artist Andy Goldsworthy, whose work consists mainly of ephemeral sculptures made of elements of nature. His work is made of rocks, leaves, grass, ice, etc., that vanish when the tide reaches the beach or the wind blows in the field. Therefore, most of Goldsworthy's works do not really last, except as photos or movies of what they were. Now, one can argue that Goldsworthy's works are a reflection of mortality, or words to that effect, but it is not easier to say that what he does is just beautiful art. And at a time when the stereotype about artists is that they are mostly bitter, pretentious, often mentally unstable people living in decrepit urban environments, Goldsworthy seems to be the opposite: a stable, unpretentious, family-oriented person who loves nature and lives in a small town in Scotland (of course, I'm sure those are the same reasons why some people in the art world have rejected it and find their works fluffy or superficial).
