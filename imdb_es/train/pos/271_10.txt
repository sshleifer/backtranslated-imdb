It's about Mitzi. I loved her in this. And did not it look fantastic ?! I love these Sunday popcorn movies for life. This is like one of those punctures in which they always go on sale at the most annoying moments. Richard's character was completely creepy. I've dated guys like that. Well, not quite like lol. I wish Zack had not been killed. He was a pretty girl and very easy on the eyes. I love these harassing type stories. It always makes me get up and make sure my doors are closed. My husband usually does not like this kind of movies, but he actually sat with me and I enjoyed it. I can not wait to see what Mitzi does next!
