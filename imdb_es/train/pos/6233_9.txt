['Musically, Irving Berlin gave Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers another perfect musical after Top Hat, if that was possible. Although in this case like Jerome Kern made Roberta with which they were, Follow the Fleet retained Randolph Scott with another singer, this time Harriet Hilliard. <br /><br /> Randolph Scott is a CPO of the Navy and Fred Astaire is a former vaudevilian who enlisted in the Navy to forget Ginger Rogers, his former partner. But now the two are on the ground they are leaving. Fred and Ginger take the place right where they left it, and Randy accidentally finds Ginger&#39;s sister Harriet, who becomes a real beauty. But Randy is a typical love of them and leaves them sailors. <br /><br /> Once again, Irving Berlin wrote a score full of successes with him closely supervising the production. Ginger manages to make a really exceptional vocalization with Let Yourself Go, in which she and Fred then dance. But the real success of the series is Let&#39;s Face the Music and Dance, which is a number made in a Navy program. Sung for the first time by Astaire and then danced by the couple, Let&#39;s Face the Music and Dance is one of the great romantic numbers ever written for the screen. His dancing in this is absolute magic. <br /><br /> I&#39;m sure that when I mention Harriet Hilliard, some younger people might ask who it was. But they will know immediately when I mention her with her famous husband Ozzie Nelson. This is Ozzie and Harriet. It&#39;s a mystery to me why Harriet stopped singing when she became the mother of David and Ricky on television. Then again she did not even keep her own name. <br /><br /> Neither Ozzie nor Harriet sang on television. Ozzie was a pale imitation of Rudy Vallee as a singer, but Harriet could really carry a melody. She sings &quot;Get Thee Behind Me&quot; Satan and &quot;The moon and I are here&quot;, but where are you, both with real feeling and class? I recommend you to see Follow the Fleet, just for the fact of listening to a dimension of Harriet Hilliard that is incredibly forgotten today.']
