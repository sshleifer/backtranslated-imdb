['John Waters has made the small personal film more effusively effervescent, sincere, obscure, I think I&#39;ve ever seen (well, maybe Fast Food Fast Women appears in second place) The vision of the directors is relentless ... the narrative is capricious , the characters are personal and strange reflections of the family and their own inner life ... the tone never forced or stylistically on the bow. <br /><br /> There is no pretentious shooting design, ennui or magazine ranking ... Martha Plimpton is amazing as the sister ... Eddie furlong is inspired by the casting. A grandmother with a talking Mary, tea bags, recycled clothes, yesterday&#39;s trash becomes the art of today, and the lesson of the film is that the most important thing we can value is the family ... and a life humble.']
