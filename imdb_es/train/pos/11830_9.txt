This is an amazing looking film with everything done in just six or seven colors. When it came out more than 15 years ago, it surprised audiences with its color scheme, being so different from anything else that has been filmed. These colors, at least for me, make this an absolutely fascinating movie to watch. There are literally thousands of scenes that I want you to freeze and turn them in some way into a painting to study for your work of art. <br /> <br /> The characters and the story do not coincide with the greatness of the photography, but they are all exaggerated, especially the villains. The famous actors who played them here should have a lot of fun on the set playing "Flatop", "Pruneface", "Lips", "Mumbles", etc. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Warren Beatty and Gleanne Hedley are good as Dick Tracey and his girlfriend Tess Truehart, and she is as sweet and soft as her name. Another good addition is Charlie Korsmo as the young offender Dick and Tess take under their wing. The other colorful characters are played by Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, William Forysthe, Paul Sorvino, Mandy Patinkin, Madonna and other names he knows, but they are too numerous to list here. Check the full credits on the main page and you will be surprised. <br /> <br /> The only negative thing I found was Pacino's voice that bothers you after a while, Madonna's out-of-tune singing voice and the fact that the movie has been cut better by about 10 minutes. These "faults" are all minor because in general, this is a funny movie ... a cartoon strip coming to life in an incredibly colorful way ... like nothing you've ever seen.
