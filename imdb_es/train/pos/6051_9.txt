This is a great British movie. A cleverly observed script with many citable lines, which perfectly captures what magical mushrooms can do to a man during a weekend. As usual, Phil Daniels is excellent, along with the less qualified actor of the British actors Geoff Bell. Peter Bowles, with a joint that hangs from his mouth, is a blow of mastery of cast and Gary Stretch with his melancholy looks brings something strangely atmospheric to the piece. Although it seems to be considered a biker movie, I think you will find an audience outside of this, simply because of the premise that many people have been there and made the shirt. Also a great original soundtrack with a dazzling version of Freebird. This could really be a 21st century heir to the famous Ealing comedies. Like the weeds in the Welsh fields: he is a cultivator!
