['This movie is good It&#39;s not the best of the great CG Kung Fu movies, but it&#39;s pretty good. First things first, the story is really good. The whole idea of the gods in front of the fallen gods is related to the superpowers is pretty cool. My problem is that there are too many characters! He got very confused when they changed the scene! The special effects were INCREDIBLE! The fight scenes were very fast and complex. This movie is practically all computer generated. The performance is excellent, as always expected from high profile players. Ekin Cheng is an excellent protagonist, lonely character. Zhang Ziyi did nothing for me in this movie. I thought she would have a bigger part but she made a fight scene and a lot of barking. The bad boy, the whole army of skulls and the whole cloud of blood is very scary. The music is also excellent. For me, this story deserves at least one miniseries and not just ONE movie. There is too much history to put in 2 hours. Maybe if there was a book or something, I could be up to date with all the characters and details. This film sacrifices the integrity of the story by action. I recommend Storm Riders on this any day.']
