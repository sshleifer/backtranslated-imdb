I thought it was quite interesting. My social studies / language arts teacher was the police chief who was holding the microphone in the part of the water barrel. D I was excited that my teacher was in some commercials. I was in a gas / coffee / phone / play. the commercial station is nice to see on TV, it was also in everybody hates Chris, except that he always gets the small part of it, why do we have to correct 10 lines? That is so stupid. I think I'm done, it does not matter, I'm still there. it is not done, what is this a joke? Why do we have to go all the way to line ten ... really what is the point of this? I'm just going to hit random words for now. Maple's story is fun. I love my friends.
