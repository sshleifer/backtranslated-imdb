This movie contains more action before the opening credits than in all Hollywood movies of this type. This film is produced by Tsui Hark and starring Jet Li. This team has brought many productions worthy of cinema in Hong Kong, including the series Once Upon A Time in China. The action was fast and furious with an incredible work with cables. I only saw the cables in two shots. Apart from the action, the story itself was strong and not only used as a filler. To find any other action movie that competes with this, you should look for a Hong Kong movie outing in your area. It's really worth checking out and generally they never disappoint.
