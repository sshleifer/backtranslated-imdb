The Last of the Blond Bombshells is a bit of an entertaining fluff. Judy Dench plays Elizabeth, a newly widowed woman who walks loose. She has spent most of her life being obedient wife and mother, but she has never been really happy. <br /> <br /> Shortly after her husband's funeral, Elizabeth is having her usual date to have lunch with her cane in the mud. Children when you see a street artist. This awakens memories of when she was a member of a girl swing band in London during World War II. Soon we realized that the band was not exactly a girl, since the drummer was a man who dressed like a woman from Some Like It Hot. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth takes out her sax (she has been practicing secretly during her marriage)) and joins forces with the street musician who plays the guitar. Elizabeth is much more talented than the guitarist, and the money starts to flow. He does not take any money because he is rich and does not need it. Its interpretation is strictly for artistic realization. <br /> <br /> One day, Elizabeth is seen by Patrick (Ian Holm), who was the drummer who was dragging the band. It seems that Patrick was, and still is, quite the man of the ladies, and Elizabeth, who was only fifteen at the time, was the only member of the band who did not experience Patrick's "talents" other than playing drums. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth is inspired by her granddaughter to reunite the old group once again to play at the granddaughter's school dance. Thus begins a charming journey along the path of memory combined with aspects of a road trip humorous film, all topped with a very good swing and blues. <br /> <br /> I guess I'm at the age when I really enjoy older actresses doing their things, and this movie is a treasure, as it is not only starring Judi Dench, but it has the support of Olympia Dukakis, Leslie Caron and a lot of British character actresses. All this is topped by the extraordinary voice of Cleo Laine. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's a fluff, but a totally charming and extremely entertaining fluff.
