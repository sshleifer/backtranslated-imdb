I agree with the previous comment when naming the content of the movie "Everyday Madness", but I would like to specify that: "Dog Days" is about how women are treated in a (male) society. The episodes that we see here show some variations in the daily discrimination of women, mostly categorized by age group. There is an older man who makes his new partner look and act like his late wife did, treating her like a doll that will act "worthy of dressing" the first one's dress. There is a middle-aged couple in whose relationship she is almost a slave and he a teacher (violent). In addition, we find a somewhat younger man who does not communicate with his friend / wife and, instead of feeling really jealous of his affairs, he even makes friends with his competitor (s). A young adult makes it clear to his friend, a girl who is really worried about being pretty enough for him, that he has to be the jeweler by his side and follow his strict rules of etiquette. Finally, there is a man in his fifties who calculates his own advantage by offering a woman hitchhiking to a furious customer who, taking her for having scratched her car, Natural gives her a beating. To complete the examples, we find the man's friend in the "master-slave", who, after abusing her collectively, threatens and humiliates the former "for his own good", since she will get rid of her partner and become his new wife "to dominate". During all this, the inhabitants of the neighborhood of recent construction in which the action takes place rest in the hot summer sun, absolutely motionless (sic!). Unfortunately, I have not seen the last minutes of this impressive and authentic portrait of the archaic structures that still reign in the relationship between women and men, but what I have seen has convincingly analyzed the repertoire of discrimination. It is probably a useful tool to teach less sensitive viewers what goes wrong, due to good visualization.
