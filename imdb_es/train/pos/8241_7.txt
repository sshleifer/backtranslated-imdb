['Fido is a very strange movie. And in many ways, a very good one. <br /><br /> My first thought after seeing it, how the hell are you going to market this? If Shaun of the Dead is a romantic comedy with zombies, Fido is a boy and his canine story mixes with the comedy of the nostalgia of the fifties with zombies. Exactly. <br /><br /> Fido has little of Shaun&#39;s butchery, gore and belly laughs. It is a completely different beast (forgive the play on words). <br /><br /> Fido begins with a film of black and white information that explains the background story: humans have won a war against zombies by developing a control collar that subjects meat eaters to mute servants. <br /><br /> At first I thought we were going to live a paranoia of the cold war of the fifties parody the Matin√©e, but soon we launched into a world of bright primary colors and fifty nostalgia of the middle class. <br /><br /> The young Timmy Robinon is a lonely child who does not fit in school. His mother is a possible social climber, and his father is nervous and distant. <br /><br /> Looking to keep up with the Joneses, mom (Carry-Anne Moss) has acquired a zombie. Jimmy is disinterested at first, but &#39;Fido&#39; (Billy Conelley) soon proves to be a great friend to Jimmy. Until your necklace does not blink ... <br /><br /> Fido is NOT a horror movie, but my problem with the movie is to find out exactly what it is. <br /><br /> Much of the humor is of the light family, and sometimes the line of the plot depends too much on the moment of the child and his dog / family. <br /><br /> However, the film is surrounded by wonderfully dark and truly amusing moments, which, while welcome, will ensure an R rating for what is, for long periods, a family comedy. <br /><br /> The film looks beautiful and is wonderfully played by everyone involved. <br /><br /> Despite its difficult tonal problems, I hope this film finds a niche, since it is a little gem in this year&#39;s film trash avalanche.']
