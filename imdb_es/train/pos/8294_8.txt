['This movie has great fighting scenes. Now it is true that the performance is a bit harsh. But if I wanted to see a movie based on acting skills, I would see a Cheesy movie like American Beauty. But if you want to see a movie with real martial arts in it and with amazing tricks WITHOUT the use of cables and flight, it launches the air like so many movies now that are about killing the matrix. Then look at this. Now it is true that the two main stars in the show where the child shows the Power Rangers and another member of the cast of that show has a small part in this movie. But hey, the fight scenes are enough to make Jet Li put on his pants. And the acrobatics are valuable enough for Jackie Chan to sit and admire them.']
