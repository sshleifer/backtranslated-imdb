From the beginning of the show Carmen was there. She was one of the best characters. Why did they get rid of her? The show is not the same as before. It's much worse. <br /> <br /> The best episodes were with Carmen in them. You can not replace someone from the beginning! That's like South Park without Kyle or Child's Play without Chucky! Not well! The niece who replaced her is just, ugh! Horrible. She does not fit the story at all. She was one of the main characters, and the niece can not replace her. She was an incredible actress. Much better than the niece. Recover it, or lose a ton of spectators.
