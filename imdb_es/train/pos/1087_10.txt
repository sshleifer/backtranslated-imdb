There is much to love in this little comedy dear. Anyone who has built or bought a house, or simply has not had enough space, will discover that there is more than a grain of truth in the situation of the deranged Mr. Blanding. Melvyn Douglas, with a great comic touch, both narrates and acts as the lawyer of the Blandings and as the voice of reason. In addition, Myrna Loy is at her best as a rather clueless but extremely patient wife. But the best performance is Grant's. He is the American man, especially relevant at the time of the release of this film, when the nation was in the grip of a housing shortage after the end of the war. The themes are universal, the lack of money, work stress, fear of infidelity. Yes, it closes terribly, but you must bear in mind that this was a time when the world was recovering from a terrible war and wanted a happy ending. It's still relevant today, and I must attribute the bad reviews I see to a current preference for crazed comedies. The look of the film is elegant, and there are some great comedy snippets that are fine, particularly towards the beginning. Although it may have lost some of its social relevance, almost sixty years after its launch, it remains a gem.
