2054. Paris is a drawing of Escher with people and vehicles running on multiple levels in an obvious tribute to the Metropolis of Fritz Lang. Paris is both ultramodern and crumbling. And in the flicker of surveillance sweeps, a young woman and medical researcher is kidnapped right after leaving her sister in a seedy nightclub. A tough police captain investigates. They are shown in black and white, with dark corridors, shady alleys and the lighting of a single source characteristic of the hardest of the film noir, the comparisons with Sin City are inevitable. But the story is due more to Masamune Shirow and William Gibson than to Frank Miller, since high-tech surveillance, hidden suits almost invisible and large ruthless corporations are as much a part of the landscape as weapons and automobiles. The film never quite generates the fatal-charged atmosphere of Gibson's cyberpunk vision, with its high-tech marginal characters colliding with industrial types of corporations that seem to have their own Ministry of Fear, but the viewer definitely has the feeling that the future Paris is No utopia and future science is less than benevolent. And as the plotline of the police procedure unfolds, we enter the darkest corners of individual ambition beneath the shiny veneer of the public relations image of the Avalon corporation. The motion capture process used here produces an appearance somewhere between the black and white comics and the next generation of rotoscoping, and is captivating or intrusive, depending on your tastes. However, here a great visual sense is shown, and the future Paris is filled up with the small details that give the image a unique aspect that in turn is both Spartan and Baroque. Worth a look.
