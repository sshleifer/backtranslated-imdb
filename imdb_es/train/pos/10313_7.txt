['China O&#39;Brien (1990) was an attempt to turn Cynthia Rothrock into a star in the United States. This Golden Harvet production was directed by veteran director Robert Clouse. Unfortunately, he was lucky with Enter the Dragon or lost his touch because he is not a great director. The only reason to watch this movie is to see the fighting skills of Mrs. Rothrock and Richard Norton. If this film was directed by Corey Yuen or Hoi Meng, it could have been an action classic instead of a direct action cheesy movie video. <br /><br /> China O&#39;Brien returns home to help his father. He has problems with the local mafia and needs his help. So go home and restore order (with the help of two unlikely people). But will they be enough to knock down Mister Big and his evil cronies? <br /><br /> If you are a big fan of Cynthia Rothrock, then this movie is aimed at you. I just enjoyed the fight scenes, everything else is trash. Why did not Raymond Chow pay a few cents and hire a top-level action director? <br /><br /> Recommended.']
