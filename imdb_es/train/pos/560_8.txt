Another very good Mann movie thanks to the father / son combination of Walter Brennan and Jimmy Stewart. Brennan (Ben Tatum) is often the comedic conscience of Stewart or Wayne (Red River / Rio Bravo). He is there to see that the younger man strolls or bends. "You're wrong Mr. Dunston." Jeff Webster (Stewart) gives the impression that he only cares about himself, but clearly he can not abandon Brennan. John McIntire is excellent as the law of Skagway with due respect for the traps of justice over the reality of it. Another key issue is to help people and, in turn, receive help from people. The loner can not do anything and suffers for it. <br /> <br /> The previous legend plays with Tatum's claim that he can not live without his coffee. This addiction to nicotine is fatal. Probably the first and last time on the screen. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie and now I own the DVD.
