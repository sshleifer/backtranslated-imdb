['This is one of my favorite movies of all time, and while it may move too slowly for some, it&#39;s worth seeing. A corporate lawyer (Richard Chamberlain) is dragged into a case involving aboriginals &quot;from the city,&quot; and this is not a common case. Okay, a man has died, but it was not exactly a normal murder. There has also been a greater than average amount of rain lately, and the atmosphere of most of the movie is somewhat claustrophobic and oppressive. The aborigines are hiding a secret and refuse to spill the beans. This has a lot to do with the white men who make assumptions about the &quot;aborigines&quot; of the &quot;City&quot; versus the &quot;tribals&quot;, and of course that no Abo in the big city would practice tribal forms. UH Huh. Chamberlain is having strange dreams and is somehow the key to what is happening, although no matter how many times I have seen this, I can not understand the exact connection. This is a very spooky and spooky movie, and it is a good example of Peter Weir&#39;s ability to create tension out of nothing. The ending is a bit ambiguous, but I take it literally, it&#39;s the easiest way out and the most terrifying. 10 out of 10 and highly recommended.']
