I read the book in the fifth grade and now, a few years later, I saw the movie. There are some differences: <br /> <br /> 1. Billy was originally supposed to eat 15 worms in 15 days, not 10 worms in a day at 7:00 p.m. <br /> <br /> 2.Billy It is supposed to get 30 dollars after having eaten all the worms. In the movie after Billy eats all the worms, Joe has to go to school with worms in his pants. <br /> <br /> 3. Joe is supposed to pretend some of the worms, but in the movie he does not do it at all. <br /> <br /> Although there are changes, this film is still one that children will enjoy.
