I've been watching this every night on VH1 last week. This is an excellent revealing portrait of the drug epidemic and how drugs were exhibited in the media in the late 1960s and into the 1970s. Woodstock, Easy Rider, The Beatles, The Death of Morrison, Hendrix, Joplin are here. Vh1 has designed a complete and complex portrait of life and times during the "years of the drug". From the Sanfrancisco Bay area to Studio 54, this documentary shows the evolution and progress of the drug and death business and the new life that inspired the culture of the United States. From marijuana to LSD to cocaine, this documentary shows the ways in which drugs arrived in the country. the hippie movement, the conservative resistance and how drugs affected the arts (music, movies, etc.) with fascinating interviews and news sequences. <br /> <br /> Drug Films: The Trip Easy Rider Up In Smoke Reefer Madness Blow Boogie Nights
