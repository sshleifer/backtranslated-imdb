The line, of course, is from the Lord's Prayer: "Thy Will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven." Sweden, especially its northern end, is not my idea of ​​heaven. For me, winter temperatures of 30 degrees C are a bit low, but the good people who live there certainly think they are in God's own country. <br /> <br /> The story here is familiar. The acclaimed international musician Daniel suffers a health crisis in the middle of his career, goes back to the small village in the north of Sweden where he was born. Convinced by the local pastor to help with the church choir, he turns some unlikely talent into a class act, and enter a contest held in Innsbruck, Austria. There are echoes (sorry) of the players of the band "Brassed Off", the models of "Calendar Girls" and the dancers of "The Full Monty". But, of course, it causes many emotional upheavals when some of the most oppressed villagers realize their worth and rebel against their oppressors. He faces hostile husbands and an increasingly doubtful pastor, but nothing but death will stop him. <br /> <br /> Despite the somewhat corny story, we know and like many of the characters, who appear as people. Instead of cartoons, even though many of them are recognizable "types." I wonder if the wife's puncher has not been punished for so long. Sweden is a country in the world where such violence is discouraged (it was also a bit young to be one of the thugs of Daniel's youth) and the puritan pastor with a secret passion for girls' magazines was a little stereotyped, but Niklas Falk did it wonderfully. <br /> <br /> Michael Nyqvist is simply wonderful as Daniel. the musician is fragile but motivated, and there is also good music. I was rooted for the entire two hours. I think the end is what you make of it, but it does not spoil it to say that Daniel accomplishes what he set out to do. .
