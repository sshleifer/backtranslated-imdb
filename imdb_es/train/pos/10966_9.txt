['Gray Gardens is a world in itself. Edith and Little Edie live almost in total isolation, eating ice cream and liver pate in an improvised kitchen in their (apparently) shared room. Cats sleep while Mother Edith insults her daughter&#39;s elocution. This is a work by Tennessee Williams that comes to life and should inspire writers and playwrights, since the strange and superimposed dialogue is 100% real. <br /><br /> The situation in the house reminds me exactly how my grandmother and her 50-year-old daughter lived for a decade (apart from being poor and clean). They would argue all day, the grandmother spoke of her gloriously perfect past, while her daughter continually blamed her for missed opportunities with men, work and self-expression. <br /><br /> This film is a must for anyone who writes a mother / daughter relationship of this type. It&#39;s sad and voyeuristic, but the filmmakers did an incredible job of making the Edies comfortable enough to expose themselves so recklessly. It is rare to see real life in this way and what is more special considering the context: the remains of a powerful family that vanish into nothingness in the skeleton of their own mansion.']
