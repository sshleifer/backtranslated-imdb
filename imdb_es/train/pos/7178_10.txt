['PUT THE CAMERA ON ME is a deceptively cute movie. Actually, it is a complex view of the psychology of children and offers interesting information about the development of adults and an artist. Superficially, this is a nostalgic look at some home movies made in the 80s by a group of upper class neighborhood kids. One of the directors of the film, Darren Stein, had access to a video camera and quickly became the artistic leader of all the films. Sure, these are just cute kids having fun. But, this is also much more. This is a look at some moments in time when children deal with a series of confusing problems that all of us face in life: fear, sexual awakening, unrequited love, loneliness and just trying to make sense of the adult world that seems explode around us. As we get older, we tend to forget how exaggerated the realities of life were when we were little. <br /><br /> What makes this film even more valid is to see a young Darren Stein become a small general of a filmmaker. It is clear that Darren directs this program and these little films are his vision, but they are all informed by their friends, their problems, the interpersonal dynamics and the general confusion about the horrors of adult life. Many children make home movies, but I have never heard or seen children create &quot;small&quot; movies about the holocaust, homosexuality, nuclear war and the inability to fit in and make friends. These children are facing and dealing with heavy things! <br /><br /> The power of this film is the way in which Stein and Shell reunite several scenes with such firmness in the interviews with the children, now all adults and all still friends. This adds a new angle to the movie. How many of us have kept in touch with our childhood friends? These guys have And, many of the problems they were dealing with still come between them two decades later. <br /><br /> Between conflicts, a confession of falling in love reveals a heart still broken, a very normal sexual experience in childhood is still a &quot;sticky&quot; issue between two of the men, some continuing resentments about the dynamics of relationships and there is still a member This team that stays very in charge and in the center of the stage! Which makes a lot of sense when one sees the progress of these home movies over the course of a couple of years. Darren Stein is a director. No doubt about that. <br /><br /> Stein and Shell take turns talking from time to time and one can not help but imagine the discomfort of allowing us to take a look at the young lives of these people. This is particularly true for Stein, who has had great success in the entertainment industry as a producer, writer and film director. From the first moment of PUTTING THE CAMERA IN ME, we can see the appearance of a gay boy who tries to solve everything. We also see aspects of the mind and artistic personality that are not always &quot;pleasant&quot; or &quot;loving&quot;, and this is a bold move for any artist to share with an audience. <br /><br /> There are many revealing moments, but the most disturbing and complex moments involve a film in which we see a victim of a Jewish concentration camp being tortured and murdered by a Nazi. We discovered through interviews and narrations that the Nazi is played by a Jewish child and the victim&#39;s part is played by a Gentile child. It is a painful and disturbing moment that glimpses the darker side of fear and the way in which children overcome the horrors of the adult world that are beyond adult comprehension and much less than that of a child. <br /><br /> This is much more than some home movies. This documentary captures the pain, beauty, joy and sadness of growing up. Powerful things --- and well worth seeing! <br /><br /> :']
