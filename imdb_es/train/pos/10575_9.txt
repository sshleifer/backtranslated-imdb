Fast-paced, fun, sexy and spectacular. Cagney is always phenomenal. Blondel loves you with her wit and energy. It is obvious that this is a pre-censorship film because of the insinuation in the script, the costumes and the way they play each other. And the bikinis before there were bikinis! This is not a forbidden amusement for all. Although I do not understand the problem of John Garfield. Does it matter if he is in this movie or not? If it is, its screen is so short that it is basically a pillar. You need to see it frame by frame to even find it if it is there. I'm a big fan of Cagney, but I've never seen this before. I found it in Turner Classics. I found it because of a wonderful accident. Sit and enjoy the ride!
