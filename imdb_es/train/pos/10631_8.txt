This movie was seen by my wife and me when it came out in 1978. It was a revelation for us. In fact, we thought that we were the only gay and lesbian couple who had married and had children. Obviously we are wrong. Love can come from where you do not expect it and maybe you do not want it. But we both choose that love anyway. <br /> <br /> And no, it never changed our sexual orientation. That kind of thing is for the Christian crackpots. <br /> <br /> When we were young, we both had sex, but never with the opposite sex. As we get older, we stop having extramarital affairs. <br /> <br /> This story is not far-fetched. However, the suggestion that they became heterosexual seems to me quite unrealistic. My wife and I have been sleeping together for the last 40 years. We are still homosexual. End of story.
