['Each child experiences a trauma as they grow up and each child&#39;s active imagination has achieved the best of them, but for Jake (Anthony De Marco - from the upcoming Clint Eastwood film CHANGING - who looks like Henry Thomas in 1982) the combination can prove deadly <br /><br /> A lonely six-year-old whose imagination starts up when he feels depressed when he finds out that his parents are fighting, Peter (Sean Bridgers, afternoon of &quot;DEADWOOD&quot;) and Jules (Brooke Bloom, &quot;CBS: Miami&quot;) decide to divorce Suddenly, leaving him to his own devices and unleashing a new tenant: a zombie in his closet. <br /><br /> Actually, Jake manages to sow this seed while playing with his neighborhood friend Dillon (Matthew Josten), who provides a hard copy of the Internet with frequently asked questions about zombies. Jake is so convinced that one is trying to catch him, and his family, begins to design an action plan to protect them before it is too late. <br /><br /> Independent newcomer Shelli Ryan - who wrote and directed - combines domestic drama with horror subordinates, but the first (intelligent) surpasses the second, with a decent story driven by good acting (De Marco is the rare actor race child in which he is a CHILD and not &#39;acting&#39;, all its nuances are very evident of the clumsy, shy and introverted child with whom many can relate (I certainly can) Bridgers makes his cheating husband be understanding in the realization of He really loves his son while Bloom has more The difficult work of creating sympathy is the rather indifferent mother who rushes to emotions over rationality.It does not help when Dillon&#39;s mother, Ruth (Monette Magrath, who it seems to Laura Dern) constantly feeds it with implicit information that forms a wedge between Jake and his father.Magrath also has a difficult task to make his character manipulator It is relatively nice, but in a revealing scene it shows that I will not go into details, but it shows why it is the way it is (and more important). As she has also affected her own son). <br /><br /> The filler&#39;s subjective chamber is also well used (many angles are shown from Jake&#39;s point of view at waist level or somewhat skewed - that is, Peter&#39;s upside down shot carrying his son in the same position while having fun in the backyard), and the editing is relatively impeccable. <br /><br /> Ryan based the script on personal experiences as he grew up and also witnessed the first-hand account of a friend who is going through the same situation and how the effects of adult relationships can be harmful if they inflict their fears, anger and stress on their children. Here the film is very successful to convey its theme. <br /><br /> However, the basics of horror are a bit disconnected, to say the least, but the homage to the zombie movies of George A. Romero is shown affectionately by Ryan (Jake&#39;s mother is asleep in front of the TV as NIGHT OF THE LIVING DAD unspools, causing his own belief in The Undead to be at home). The metaphor of a monster that acts as a substitute for domestic abuse can be a bit clumsy, but again, a child&#39;s fear of something under his bed is universal.']
