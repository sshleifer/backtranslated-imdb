I really enjoyed this movie because I have a tremendous interest in American history ... in the Antebellum years and particularly in the Civil War. I bought it recently in a shelf of videos previously seen for sale in the supermarket and I was very happy to add this to my collection of history videos. Although it is not of the caliber of films of the Civil War like "Glory" or "Gettysburg", it offers much history on the brotherhood before the Civil War between the cadets of West Point. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's gray uniforms, youth, or military discipline, but I'm fascinated by the history of the Cadet Corps from around 1830 to the edge of the War. I imagine what it must have been like to sit in a classroom with other young people, learning how to wage war, and then put the lessons to use against your own classmates! <br /> <br /> Actually, there were two classes. He graduated in 1861: one class in May and the other in June. the film makes no real mention of this, except mentioning Henry A. DuPont, first graduate of the May class; and George Custer, last graduate of the June class. the reason of the two classes was not so much about the war, but because of the change to a four-year course of study, after some years of experimentation with a five-year course (I think the first class had attended five years, the another for four). As the film portrays, the cadets were like brothers and often had nicknames for each other ... George "Fanny" or "Autie" Custer; Alonzo "Lon" Cushing; James "Beauty" Stuart (for JEB Stuart, class of 1854), etc. <br /> <br /> I say that this movie is "Santa Fe Trail" as it should have been because the 1940 film, although nice, is really false. history. Cadets of several different classes are graduating together. JEB Stuart and George Custer are portrayed as best friends and are side by side to stop John Brown's insurrection in 1859 at Harper's Ferry. In fact, Stuart and Custer were never friends, but enemies during the War. They clashed (for the first time, I think) at Gettysburg in 1863 (Stuart was in the assault on Harper's ferry, but Custer was still a cadet at the time it took place). <br /> <br /> "Fanny" Custer plays a role in "Class of '61", although her classmates, Dev O'Neill and Shelby Peyton are fictitious. I think they are based respectively on Partick Henry O'Rorke and John Pelham, two people you can consult. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I really enjoy this movie or any movie that offers a window towards the middle of the 19th century. America.
