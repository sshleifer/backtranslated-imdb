This show began with great episodes of mystery. I think everyone is in the first 15 or 16 episodes. After that, the show started playing short episodes with Shaggy, Scooby Doo and Scrappy Doo. <br /> <br /> I think Hanna Barbera Productions had to change the 20 minute episodes in short episodes. Some of the voice actors stopped being available. After 15 or 16 episodes, Frank Welker (who played Fred) was not available. I think Velma's voice changes after the first 12 episodes, because the first voice actress who played Velma was not available. <br /> <br /> And the network ordered the studio Hanna Barbera to do more shorts with Shaggy, Scooby doo and Scrappy doo, because the ratings were high. So they had to make shorter ones. I wish they were mysteries like 15 episodes. It is still a good show.
