I was a setter in an old theater in northern California when this movie came out. As good as it is on DVD, it is even more spooky and frightening on the big screen. Although it's been about 9 years since I've seen it, it's still one of my favorites of all time. At the risk of sounding trite, "They do not make them like that anymore!" If Sixth Sense scared you, this movie is definitely for you. Great story, incredible cast of characters, sinister setting; even the soundtrack has a disturbing quality. I recommend you not look at it alone. What a Brownstone apartment was renting only in 1977 will leave you breathless (today it would be at least 10 times that price).
