It is a very beautiful film and I would definitely recommend it to everyone. but there are 2 negative points: - the level of the stories has a large spectrum. Some of the scenes are very good and others are simply boring. - many stories are not self-contained (compared to coffee and cigarettes, where each story has a point, a message, a punchline or whatever you want to call it), but most stories are very good, some are great and in general it is one of the best movies of this year! <br /> <br /> annoying, I have to fill at least 10 lines, I have nothing more to say and I do not want to start analyzing the individual sequences ... <br /> <br /> well, I think that's it!
