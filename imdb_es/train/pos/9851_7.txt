Shrek, someone? Well, imagine Shrek in the ice age. Do you remember the end of Shrek? For the cause you do. Now, imagine, that Shrek becomes a human, and so does the princess. Get it? Nice animation, in reality, much more than a work of art that the images of Pixar and Disney, which try to get as close as possible to reality in their drawings. Strong of a single line, some social comments that the children do not understand, the good ones win. One more thing: Scrat. By the way, how does everyone know that his name is Scrat? 7/10
