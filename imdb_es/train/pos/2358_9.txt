['Pushing Daisies is just a charming fairy tale, with nuances of the aesthetics and romance of &quot;Amelie&quot;. She has a beautiful palette, her shots are well thought out and detailed, her names and dialogues are capricious and too cute to be real, her imagination is great and her romance deep. <br /><br /> Look at how blue is seen in the sky, since blue can not be found in the rest of the sets or shots (with few exceptions). <br /><br /> See how a strangely natural and totally satisfying song comes out of the scene. <br /><br /> Her score is magnificent, her cast is extremely nice, there is good music and the two main romantic stars can not touch each other or she will die. How much more sexual tension do you need? (Actually, I would have liked them to find a way to avoid this, but c&#39;est la vie). <br /><br /> It is simply a show with which it is a pleasure to spend an hour, and I highly recommend it. There has not been another television like this, and I would like to see more. It helped me get through the flu a horrible week, since it is a good company. <br /><br /> Bring him back!']
