I rented this movie last weekend, made the surround sound system and got a great sound of special effects. This movie is a great movie rental, the special effects were enough to scare my fiance, but I noticed that some seemed surprisingly computer generated. I did not go to the movies and I saw this, but it's a scary night that does not feel like leaving the movie. I would recommend it!
