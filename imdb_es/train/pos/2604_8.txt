"Amazing Grace" has a languid feeling, as it tells a contemporary story of several lives in an apartment building. The language spoken is Hebrew, but the drama could take place in any modern city. Observe family values, romantic relationships and the characteristics of age groups with equal aplomb. He does not judge the characters, he only presents them directly, as they strive to solve their individual problems in this modern world. The quality of the acting is very good, and the observations made about the characters are clever and sharp. I really appreciate this movie that flows.
