Perfect movies are rare. Even my favorite movies tend to have shortcomings: Rear Window looks a little stagged sometimes, Chris Elliot's character in Groundhog Day does not work, the music in Best Years of Our Lives is too corny, the start of Nights of Cabiria is a too slow, but this movie is perfectly executed from start to finish. <br /> <br /> The script is brilliant, the performance is magnificent everywhere (although Reese Witherspoon and Sam Waterston are amazing, the whole cast shines), the direction and photography are inspired, and the music is moving without be intrusive (like some Miramax scores that are too manipulative). Every sad moment is really touching, every moment of light makes me smile. This is really one of the best movies I've seen and I wish there were more movies like that. <br /> <br /> I'm glad that Reese Witherspoon has reached stardom after this movie, but I'm sorry to see that his recent films are much more escapist and silly than this movie would be about real people. Real feelings and real problems. Sparkly! You must see it.
