I thought that this movie was marvelously drawn, it confused me and my cousin saw it with me. To tell the truth, I think that the young Kevin Dillon was fashionable. Hahahaha ... but I also thought that the girl was stupid. the police and that was wrong what he said before his death "I was inside you". I think that's what she gets for doing what she did with him and how he's going to tell her that she's too young when she never cared. How old were the other girls? Now I do not think I could trust a policeman like that myself. But to tell the truth, it was quite obvious that it was him, even if he wanted to become a policeman, he would still suspect. either way. And that was funny when she sprayed it in the eye of the store. Hahaha. I was still stupid to enter the warehouse alone and also the police who died HELLO! it's called backup. Sometimes, these movies drive me crazy when people act stupidly and do stupid things. But that's what I think about the movie.
