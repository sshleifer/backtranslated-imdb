['Pushing Daisies was a wonderful show. Like Dead Like Me and Wonderfalls, it can be said that it was created by Bryan Fuller. I can understand how people who do not have a lot of love for theater, movies, musicals and the like would get angry. This is not a typical television show and the fantastic is too much for some. These people seem to need a slightly more linear and muted tone to keep them happy. This program explodes with colors, winks at scenes from old movies, buzzes with amazing music and talented performances. There is nothing random about the choices made from the costume to the leitmotif. The story takes many twists and turns but they are all very accessible because the conversations are about love, honesty, courage, loss and many other things that we face every day. The only unfortunate aspect was the end of the program and that was rushed because Pushing Daisies was canceled. Do not approach this like a typical television show. Think of it as an evening in the theater, then sit back and enjoy!']
