I thought that this movie was excellent, due to the fact that Corrine and Sean are newcomers to the business. It was full of action and a bit of romance, but there were some points where Corrine did not speak very clearly (when she threatened Sean with the gun) and clenched her teeth ... maybe she was supposed to? I think the roles of Joseph and Sonny were interpreted very well, and there was an obvious contrast. Also, because I saw the next action star, I'm sure that Corrine and Sean did their own stunts, which performed very well. I look forward to another movie of the couple, as they form a great team, or perhaps a sequel to bet your life, possibly called 'triumph in the big apple', this time it could be about Carmen ... Bet your life is EXCELLENT!
