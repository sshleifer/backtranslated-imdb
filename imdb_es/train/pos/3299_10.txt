A great movie that requires an acquired taste. If you get into action, Bam's movies and you hate serious love stories are not for you. Otherwise, if you like to sit in front of a good intelligent movie from time to time, I recommend it highly. Easily the best film produced in Bollywood this century. <br /> <br /> The only other Indian film that would give 10/10 is Dil Wale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge. Even then it is second to this masterpiece.
