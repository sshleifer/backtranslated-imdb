This second film is as interesting as the previous one, except that there is no suspense. We know what you are going to do and what is going to happen before it is indicated on the screen. Then, the pleasure comes only from the way in which the various tricks and the succession of them occur. We know there will be dynamite in the car, that he will lose a wheel, that the car will have a crash, just to talk about the car. And that's what happens. Now the details and details are for you to discover in the movie. The fact that a foolish woman catches him is obvious and has to come, but we know that he has already seen her and that he knows that he is being dragged into a trap. Now, how is it going to come out of that? That is what you must discover for yourself. And do not worry, you will get to the main dealer, but how is another story? A speed boat is no match for our busy beaver in the river. We also know when he will be injured. They did not know what bulletproof jackets they were in those days. It is true that recently it was discovered that some GIs did not have that kind of equipment in Iraq. But what is the meaning of such a movie? This insistence on hunting the traffickers and this blindness that does not see what the prohibition is that creates the problem. But the film is a constant and perfect illustration that there is no value that can stand in the way of this moralistic crusade against the forces of evil. Why not simply legalize these assets so that they can be observed properly and under surveillance? When something is not illegal or out of place, it is less fun to use it, to do it. The forbidden or the restricted is the attractive. <br /> <br /> Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU, Paris Dauphine University, Paris 1 Sorbonne University and Versailles Saint Quentin University in Yvelines
