After his classic tribute to Chinese cinema, Chinatown, Roman Polanski, returned to the themes that had given him his best hits in the 60s with this creepy psychological horror that, like Repulsion and Rosemary's Baby, is about the generated paranoia and claustrophobia for life in apartment. <Br /> <br /> The claustrophobic environments are those that Polanski best creates, and this has to be the most suffocating and confined image that he has created. The emphasis on the side walls and distant vanishing points is greater than ever, and even in the small number of exterior scenes, the sky is rarely seen. But The Tenant is not only spatially limited, but also in the intensity with which it focuses on its protagonist. Trelkovsky, played by Polanski himself, is not only found in all scenes, but in almost every shot. When it is not on the screen most of the time, the camera becomes Trelkovsky's point of view. And, of course, almost everywhere you look, you see your own reflection looking at it in a mirror. <br /> <br /> I can not think of any film that refers more to the interiorization and loneliness of a character. Some psychological thrillers, like M or Peeping Tom, manipulate us to feel sorry for the mentally ill protagonist. Others, like Psycho, try a deep scientific analysis of their mental condition. The tenant does not fit into any of these categories? he simply immerses us completely into the Trelkovsky experience without demanding that we really understand or appreciate what goes on inside his head. We feel his paranoia and obsession despite the fact that it is constantly revealed to us that they are irrational. <br /> <br /> Polanski was also a master of the slowly developing horror film. Often, in its horrors, there is an ambiguity as to whether something sinister is actually happening, but they are among the most effective in frightening audiences. Why? Precisely because they develop so slowly and invest so much time in carefully configuring the situations that submerge the viewer in paranoia. Later, Polanski's horror, The Ninth Gate is a bit complicated, but at least he still manages to reach that sense of fear. <br /> <br /> This is a rare opportunity to see Polanski himself in an important role. His talent in front of the camera was as good as behind him, and he is absolutely perfect like the tame Trelkovsky. Another outstanding performance is that of Shelley Winters, often overlooked, as the janitor. Actually, it's more of a star cast, although many of the familiar faces are out of place in this strange European Gothic film. Also, unfortunately, many of the French actors in supporting roles are dumbly bent in the English version. <br /> <br /> The tenant is more refined and less pretentious than repulsion, but lacks the suspense and character that makes Rosemary's baby so absorbing and entertaining. The tenant is good, without major defects, and Polanski was really in top form as a director, but not among his most exciting jobs.
