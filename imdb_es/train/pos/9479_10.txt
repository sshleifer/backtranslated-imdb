The new version of Tian is not good at all. I just click on his new documentary to see Wei Wei, the original actress of the classic 1948 movie, say a few words to the crew. We will meet Wei Wei this Sunday (3/28/2010) after the presentation of Xiao Cheng Zhi Chun at the Hong Kong Film Archiev. Wei Wei is almost 90 years old in silver hair, his appearance in Hong Kong movies is always a surprise for his fans. At the Hong Kong Film Festival this year, a special program is dedicated to Fei Mu, director of this epic film, and Wei Wei, filmed in the film, is being seen throughout Hong Kong. My son, who turns 21 this year, is surprised that Wei Wei was so beautiful then.
