Louise Brooks offers a wonderful performance in this well-made French melodrama. She plays a typist named Lucienne who, despite being in love with a man named Andre, dreams of overcoming her position in life. She sees the opportunity in a beauty contest for Miss Europe, but Andre is furious when he discovers that she has entered and then demands that he retire. Try to recover your ticket only to discover that you have already been chosen as Miss France and now you will go to the main contest. <br /> <br /> This is a story of love, loss and decision developed so far. Passionate end. The film is filmed with great energy by the director Augusto Genina and the movie temples Rudolf Mate and Louis Nee. The filming style is more like modern movies than the Hollywood films of the 30s, and shows the different style used by Europeans. There are many quick cuts and travel shots, mostly with great skill and enthusiasm. The high energy of the first third of the film decreases slightly in the middle, but it recovers in the last 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> The performances were very good for all the directors, but Louise Brooks' is especially memorable. . Louise relies heavily on her silent screen skills even though it is a talkie, but because her silent style had a surprisingly contemporary and unobtrusive feel, it makes the transition to talkies very well. The long early scene at the fair was especially poignant when Louise used her remarkably expressive eyes to express her growing feeling of misery and alienation, of being trapped in a life she no longer wants. I doubt it has ever been done better. <br /> <br /> The film unfolds to a magnificent finale, ingeniously filmed, powerful and elegant. This is really one of the best things of the first days of the movie. And the tragic plot only underscores the great tragedy that this is the final leading role of Louise Brooks. She was not just a great beauty who looked fantastic in a swimsuit, she really was a great acting talent who basically threw it all away. We are all poorer for that. <br /> <br /> This film is less known than its German films with G.W. First of all, but I think it's better. I think this team is better at storytelling than Pabst, and while Prix de Beaute may lack the deep moral complexity of Pabst's films, it is much easier to follow and, in general, it is a more agile and focused work. And it does not hurt that Louise's singing parts are also in charge of Edith Piaf. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, this is a classic Louise Brooks movie that's worth looking for.
