This is a spooky movie. More creepy than anything else, David Lynch, and that shows what a great director, Polanski, is, since this is not his usual type of work, and it's BRILLIANT. <br /> <br /> It all starts when Trelkovski moves to a block of flats in Paris. He soon learns that the previous tenant, a young woman, committed suicide and believes that the rest of the people living there forced her to do so. He also believes that they are trying to do the same with him. The result is an amazing and terrifying look at paranoia. <br /> <br /> The whole production has a classic horror written everywhere: from the images to the music, the viewer can feel the terror of poor Trelkovski accumulating. <br /> <br /> Are they all killing him? Or maybe just drive him crazy? There is a difference? Discover for yourself. 10/10
