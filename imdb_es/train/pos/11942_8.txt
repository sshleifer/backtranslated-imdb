At the funeral of the famous British journalist Joe Strombel (Ian McShane), his colleagues and friends remember how stubborn he was while searching for a scoop. Meanwhile, the late Joe reveals the identity of the serial killer of the London tarot card. He cheats the reaper and appears to the American journalism student Sondra Pransky (Scarlett Johansson), who is on stage in the middle of a magic show by wizard Sidney Waterman (Woody Allen) in London, and tells him that the killer is The aristocrat Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman). Sondra drags Sid into his investigation, looking for evidence that Peter is the killer. However, he falls in love with him and asks if Joe Strombel is right in his scoop. <br /> <br /> "Scoop" is another great comedy by Woody Allen on the outskirts of Manhattan, actually again in London. His ironic and witty lines are simply fantastic, and I laughed a lot with his hero destiny in a country where people drive "on the wrong side". Sid Waterman is extremely funny and Woody Allen is in excellent shape as a comedian. However, his current muse Scarlett Johansson, of which I am a big fan, has an excess of action and is annoying in many moments, including changing his accent to a histrionic pronunciation. His character is absolutely silly and promiscuous, and I was quite disappointed with his performance (probably for the first time in his filmography). But this supernatural comedy is still a hilarious and worthwhile entertainment. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Scoop ?? O Grande Furo" ("Scoop ?? The Big Scoop")
