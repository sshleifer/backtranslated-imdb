And that goes especially for lawyers and police. Puerto Rico, which boasts of a small but powerful film production company, presents this history of multiple layers of corruption, due to the current drug cartel that begins in South America, makes a stop in the community of the island and then heads towards North to North America. Steven Bauer, the most recognizable face on the screen here, leads a group of top-level actors, in a story of "can you see the only respectable face in the crowd?" Ricardo Méndez Matta happens to direct mainly the adventure of action for the American television, in a script written by Matta, along with Poli Marichal. The rest of the cast (Elpidia Carrillo, Magda Rivera, José Herredia, Luz Maria Randon, to mention a few) become good roles, in a movie that will make you think "is there a respectable character here?". Spoken in Spanish with English subtitles. Rated as 'R' by the MPAA, this film contains outbursts of vulgar language, brief flashes of nudity, adult content and violence, some of which are quite scary.
