This is one of those Westerners who, well, is practically alone in the irrelevant quality of their dialogue. Very few can resist it in the long term. That said, the rest is pretty bad. However, I give it an eight because there is no other western with such a consistent dialogue and perhaps with the exception of The Wild Bunch, Junior Bonner and maybe some more. <br /> <br /> He is full of weaknesses, John Drew Barrimore is the most flagrant. However, it has a truly memorable scene. Nothing like it. It's right after Kid Wichita kills the sheriff and goes to the place of Jack Elams trying to incite him to fight. Wonderful things Right with the best in any western.
