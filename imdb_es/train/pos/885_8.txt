['I must admit that I had my doubts about this movie before I saw it. The main reason for this is because it was compared to a Hitchcock movie. I have seen several films that are said to have been inspired by Hitchcock or that could have been made by the &quot;Master of suspense&quot; itself, but until now I have not seen any of these films that can pass the time test. In my opinion, Hitchcock has become a familiar name that is used too easily to promote some thrillers (cheap), but, on the other hand, I must admit that I was intrigued because it is a European film. Normally, it&#39;s the big Hollywood studios who like to abuse Hitchcock&#39;s name if that can increase their income. But this film was made in one of the most chauvinistic European countries of all time and I am sure that most French people would rather die than admit that their films have been inspired by an Englishman. That&#39;s why I decided to give this film a chance and I must say that I&#39;m glad I did it. <br /><br /> &quot;Sur mes l√®vres&quot; or &quot;Read my Lips&quot;, as it is called in English, tells the story of a young secretary named Carla. She is a loyal and hardworking employee, but has never been much appreciated by her colleagues. That has a lot to do with the fact that he suffers from a hearing impairment, which has denied him climbing the hierarchical scale of the company. But when you are allowed to hire an apprentice who can work for her, all this is about to change. Paul Angeli is a 25 year old ex-convict and has no skills. The man is a thief, but Carla gives him a chance and covers him when he needs it. She hopes to teach him how a normal life should be, but at the same time he drags her with him in his previous life ... <br /><br /> Since I still believe that the name Hitchcock is used too often to describe a very good thriller, which is definitely this film, I will not make any comparison between the direction of Hitchcock and Jacques Audiard. The fact is that man has done a very good job with this movie. I had not heard of him before, but it is true that he knows how to create suspense and how to keep you interested from the beginning to the end. That also has a lot to do with the very good and original story, of course. I doubt there&#39;s anyone in Hollywood who came up with the idea of using a disabled woman in a powerful role, instead of making her the helpless subject of an abusive husband (you know, the typical story of a television movie) . <br /><br /> Also worth noting is the acting in this movie. Vincent Cassel is quite famous, but Emmanuelle Devos was a complete mystery to me. There is absolutely nothing glamorous in their roles, but both did an excellent job with their characters, making them feel very believable and realistic. Paul could have been the average hard guy out of jail and Carla, the typically helpless woman, but thanks to his performances, he really believes that these are two strong people who have had some bad luck in life but will do their best . of it together. <br /><br /> In short, this is a powerful film with a very fine script and an excellent performance. Even though I had my doubts about it, I soon became one of his biggest admirers. I give this movie an 8/10. Do not hesitate to try it.']
