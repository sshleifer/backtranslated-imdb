This is a film about life, the triumph over adversity and the wonders of the human spirit. I challenge anyone not to shed a tear at the end of the movie. This is more than a simple pull of tears, it is a captivating drama that invites reflection, with excellent performances by all actors, especially Derek Luke and Denzel Washington. 7 years later, I'm surprised that Luke is still a virtual stranger and Washington has only directed another film. However, apart from a slow buildup, the history of the trials and tribulations of this foster child and how this still affects him in adulthood is the kind of film that stays with you long after you've seen it. Like many of the fox searchlight images, this was rather a dormant success and did not receive the massive critical acclaim it deserves. The scene in which Antwone finally meets his mother summed up the film for me, there were many ways in which it could have been done and it could have been a mess or it could have been unrealistic, but Washington gave exactly the right tone, its Mother never said a word and could only shed a tear, while Antowne simply asked why. His overwhelming guilt prevented him from saying anything, what could he say to defend himself? One of the most moving cinematographic scenes I've seen.
