Undoubtedly as a total joke, "Full Moon High" represents the 1950s teenager Tony Walker (Adam Arkin) who accompanies his father (Ed McMahon) on a trip to Romania. Sure enough, Tony is bitten, and hair and fangs grow when the moon is full. A particularly interesting aspect of this film is that it can not grow old while it has the curse of the werewolf, and that it has to fulfill a destiny, even if it takes twenty years. <br /> <br /> But for the rest, the movie is just funny once it gets going. The character of Ed McMahon is a right-wing yahoo too patriotic (he thinks everyone should have listened to Joe McCarthy), the trainer / director of Kenneth Mars is a tense dweeb, and then there's more. One of the most revealing cast members is Demond Wilson, better remembered as Lamont in "Sanford and Son," as a bus driver who gets a big surprise. But probably the most fun scene is the change of presidents; Then the joke with Gerald Ford really summed it up! Anyway, it's a real pleasure. Considering that Alan Arkin, who plays a crazy psychiatrist, just won an Oscar on Sunday night and thanked his children, I wonder if he remembers or not having co-starred with two of them in this movie (apart from Adam, his son Anthony also has a small role). Quite funny. Also starring Elizabeth Hartman. <br /> <br /> PS: director Larry Cohen is probably best known for the killer baby movie "It's Alive."
