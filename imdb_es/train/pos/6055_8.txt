['I did not expect much from this movie, but I was pleasantly surprised, as it is light, fun and very well observed. The central trio of incomprehensible motorcycle riders was surprisingly pleasant, as they staggered and fought their way through their drug-focused trip to Wales. The humor was soft and subtle, like the three characters (witness the comprehensive treatment that gives the merchant of the old woman). The atmosphere of rural Wales was perfectly captured, and the soundtrack was very well chosen. Written in an intelligent and careful way, with great attention to detail. I had never seen such a realistic portrait of alternative culture. I felt that I was there with them. Very light in contact and full of fun, it is not what you would expect from a movie about cyclists and drugs. A delight on all fronts, and difficult to criticize, although I thought the last two scenes were a bit boring: the movie should have ended when they left Wales. But in general, an unexpected treasure of a movie.']
