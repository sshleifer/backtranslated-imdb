The film version of Alice Walker's enormously emotive and influential novel of 1983 (written largely as letters to the central character Celie to God) was a huge Oscar success, and rightly so. <br /> <br /> In the role of the abused and Awakened Celie, Whoopi Goldberg gave her best screen performance for miles. Not far behind her was Oprah Winfrey as Sofia, the fiery woman tamed by fate. Others in the cast gave body to the characters that Walker had introduced so clearly on the page: Danny Glover as Albert, Celie's abusive husband; Margaret Avery as Shug, a force of change for good; Willard Pugh and Rae Dawn Chong as Harpo and Squeak; Susan Beaubian as Corrine, the wife of the preacher; and the much missed Carl Anderson (also known as Judas in the 1973 film Jesus Christ Superstar) as the preacher Samuel. <br /> <br /> With a beautiful rhythm and sensitivity, 'The Color Purple' does justice to its source while opening the story to engage the viewers of a feature film drama.
