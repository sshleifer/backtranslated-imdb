I'm glad it's available on DVD now. This film is an excellent example of the triumph of content and style over blinking empty head lights and constant loud noises. <br /> <br /> Essentially, if you have a short attention span or lack the wit and imagination to participate. Literary narrative that you will not like this movie. The reasons for this are quite simple, but unfortunately they are rarely achieved: Matthew Jacobs has done a fantastic job successfully transposing the story of Catherine Storr's novel 'Marianne Dreams' into a script. An unenviable task, like anyone who has seen a movie in a book, will undoubtedly know. <br /> <br /> The casting is excellent, allowing director Bernard Rose to use the actors in a way that is rarely seen now; They indulge in the art of acting! I know, I know, the actors who do their work and act instead of resorting to unfairly assaulting the lens of the camera, while a kaleidoscope of car chases, explosions and fire fighting unleashing around them is a treatment Really weird, but it actually happens in this movie. <br /> <br /> This brings me to the last reason why this is a movie for the imaginative thinker and not for the spoon-fed tabloid reader. Apart from a solid script, direction and performance, it is based on the atmosphere, suspense and implicit horror. If it is classified as horror, then the presentation of 'Paper House' is more in line with Sophocles than with Tobe Hooper. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, if you like many loud noises, explosions, constants. It would be better to see 'Transformers', but if you like a story of suspense that develops through a skillful and evocative use of narrative without insulting your intelligence by the force that feeds you senseless and meaningless, this could be your thing.
