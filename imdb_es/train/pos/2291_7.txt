Probably the two main meanings of "Elmer's pet rabbit" are that the crazy leporid that appears in "A wild hare" now has a name, and that it pronounces its famous "Of course you realize that this means war!" for the first time. For the most part, the Termite Terrace crowd was still trying to figure out exactly what to do with this long-eared rogue. Without a doubt, it is a must for fans of this genre, but it is likely that others have little reason to be interested. <br /> <br /> But make no mistake, it's pretty hilarious what Bugs Bunny does to the eternally gullible Elmer Fudd. The light tones of things to come abound throughout the caricature. I recommend it.
