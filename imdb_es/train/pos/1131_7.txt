This is a very funny movie. One of those can sit and watch without thinking while the plot twists more and more; More and more funny. Sally Field, Teri Hatcher (in its heyday), Kevin Klein, Elisabeth Shue, Robert Downey, Jr ... They are all these well-known and quality actors who act as if they were stars / producers of telenovelas. If you've ever seen a soap opera and thought, "How the hell did you come up with this idea?", You'll LOVE this movie. I've seen it several times; and every time I see it, the more I appreciate the humor, the more I realize how well-behaved it is. Do not expect the quality of the Oscar. This is a fun movie to entertain, not an artistic attempt to find the "inner man of man", etc. Sit, relax and laugh.
