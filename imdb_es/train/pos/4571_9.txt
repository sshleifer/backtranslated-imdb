The most important of this film is the brilliant performance of Daniel Day-Lewis and Hugh O'Conor as Christy Brown, artist and fighter guineas who, despite his physical condition, exceeded all odds. As a person who worked with patients with cerebral palsy, I can assure you that their performance was surprisingly convincing. The enormous support that Christy obtained from her family, the low income and the working class of Dublin, encouraged her to do the impossible and this image shows this support brilliantly, she has not read the book, but the dialogues were written with prudence to capture the ingenious arrogant personality of Christy Brown. . I recommend this movie to everyone, especially to classic movie lovers.
