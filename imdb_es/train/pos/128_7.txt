['Von Trier once explained how he created such a strong participation of the viewer with his films by placing his cinematic world at the center of the real world and the imagined world. So, as spectators, we think we see a &quot;true&quot; story, while in fact we are very manipulated, often to the point that the film works as disturbing (Dancer in the Dark) or painful (The Idiots / Idioterne). Of course, the Dogme films acted only as a vehicle for this theory (in addition to creating something of welcome in Von Trier). <br /><br /> The story is typical of von Trier: our hero is idealistic, seems to balance his relationships with everyone else, but soon becomes a victim of the problems that others have created in the past for themselves. The idealist inevitably has to reject society to remain idealistic and become the terrorist. Humanity is spoiled and purity only leads to (self) destruction. (These elements were also very ubiquitous in Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark). The film is also full of cynical (even humorous) nuances about the role of Germans and Americans in post-war Germany. <br /><br /> As a technical achievement, the film is wonderfully designed: changing and discolored colors, screen superimpositions, action in different overlays (with the filming of the future mayor as the most interesting). In this film we can see how well Von Trier handles the film as a technical medium. In his last works, it seems that he moves away from this (as if he were no longer interested in technical achievements because they become readily available).']
