All Dogs Go to Heaven is, in my opinion, the best animated film ever made. I'm not really a big fan of animated movies, but there's something in this that makes it better than any other animated movie I've seen. The music is wonderful, as are the performances of Burt Reynolds, Dom Deluise and especially Ken Page as King Gator. "Let's Make Music Together" is perhaps one of my favorite songs from any musical movie I've seen. This is definitely a must for people of all ages.
