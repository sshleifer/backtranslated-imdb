My Take: A fun version of THE LION KING, which is presented as a sequel. Surprisingly funny <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, "Lion King 1 1/2" is actually another fun direct to the video, which is worth a theatrical treatment. I do not see why Disney released this directly to the video, and he released shitty movies like "Chicken Little" and "Return to Neverland" theatrically. Those movies are best seen in video stores (in the "new releases" area), instead of seeing their theatrical posters outside the theaters. <br /> <br /> This is just a parody of the first movie (although the events in "Simba's Pride" have not yet taken place), in Timon (voiced by Nathan Lane) and Pumba's point of view (with the voice of Ernie Sabella). We can see them making fun of the events in the first movie. Original voices from the first film, such as Matthew Broderick, Woopie Goldberg, Cheeche Martin and Robert Guillaume, return to their voice roles from the first film, while Julie Kavner and Jerry Stiller provide a hilarious comedy relief as Timon's mother and the grumpy uncle. <Br /> <br /> So this does not sound fun. Maybe not now, but go see it for yourself. The fact that he is not so serious in his plot makes it more pleasant. It's something like MST3000 with Timon and Pumba. <br /> <br /> Rating of the video film: *** 1/2 out of 5.
