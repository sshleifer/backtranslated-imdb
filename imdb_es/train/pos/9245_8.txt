['Jean Harlow and Clark Gable were a great team on screen and this may be their best film together. <br /><br /> Yes, Hold Your Man can be cheesy and predictable, but that&#39;s not what I love about the movie. I love seeing Harlow and Gable together and in this movie they are simply wonderful. It&#39;s obvious that they really enjoyed working together and that&#39;s part of what makes this film so wonderful. <br /><br /> The ingenious dialogue, the great script and the attention to detail are other things that make this a good movie. I loved this movie the first time I saw it and in every subsequent visualization I always observe at least one new detail. For me, that is a mark of a great movie. <br /><br /> The dialogue and the script are better than most films of this period (early 30&#39;s). I love classic movies, but I admit that most of them are simply average and sometimes I&#39;m not interested. Hold Your Man is one of the exceptions. <br /><br /> This has a lot to do with the fact that Hold Your Man is a &#39;precoded&#39; movie. (The Hays code was not applied until one year after Hold Your Man.) This movie could not have been made under the code. Well, it could have been done, but it would have been a completely different story. Thank God, the code was not applied until 1934. Otherwise, we would have missed this gem.']
