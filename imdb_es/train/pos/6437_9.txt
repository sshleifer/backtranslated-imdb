A famous driver decides, after a heart attack, to return to the village where he was born to live a quiet life. There, he comes in Dutch with the choir of the local church, which will change his life. <br /> <br /> I had no expectations when I saw this movie for the first time yesterday; I like to see foreign films that are not in English, and I've already seen a couple of Swedish movies in my life, but this was the best one so far. <br /> <br /> Where to start? In my opinion, this movie is a gem, thanks to many things, of which one is the outstanding performance. Michael Nyqvist is perfect as the intelligent, shy and devoted director Daniel Daréus. The beautiful Frida Hallgren is charming with her beautiful smile and subtle acting. The choir members are all well-developed and interesting characters with their own story each. <br /> <br /> This film tells a story, a beautiful story, about music, love, pain, memories, death, about a man who dedicated his life to music, and who tries to create a peaceful existence in the town where he was born, while trying to make peace with the past and with the way his life has been until then. Kay Pollack shows us that Swedes are prominent movie makers. Go see Så som i himmelen, it's a movie that makes you think about life and love, and that's also comforting, in a way.
