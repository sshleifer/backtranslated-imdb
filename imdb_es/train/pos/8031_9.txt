This is a military drama that I like very much! Tom Berenger playing military assassin Thomas Beckett. This Marine does not make sense, in his face, and does not ask the kind of person who does the work. There you have Billy Zane ("The Phantom" and others) who plays Richard Miller, an old SWAT D.C. form, works for the government and takes orders from them alone. Who needs a bureaucrat? I do not! When these two are paired, the sparks must be flying. And how. However, Beckett teaches the young bureaucrat how it works. When the other sniper hits, he is witty against witty, cat against mouse, gunman against gunman. And when the experienced sniper is captured, it is up to Miller to put politics aside and save him. Who needs the policy when you are a professional like Beckett, did not receive orders from anyone other than himself, complies with the rules and not the book, and mutual respect is manifested despite the policy. The movie was a direct success. Look at it. Rating 4 out of 5 stars.
