Life Stinks (1991) was one step below other Mel Brooks productions. He stars as a rich man who makes a crazy bet with his "friends". Brooks says he can live like a bum for a month. Your surprised and funny friends accept this unusual bet. During his "stay" in the Bowery, he meets a group of homeless people, one of them catches his fantasy (Lesley-Ann Warren). They become friends while she teaches him the many tricks he learned while living on the street. Can Mr. Brooks survive alone without the luxuries of being immensely rich? Will this unorthodox bet win? Who are your true friends? Discover it when you look at LIFE STINKS to discover it! <br /> <br /> This movie has been unfairly removed. Of course it's not a classic like his previous films, but it's still nice. I liked the way Mel Brooks pays homage to Charles Chaplin in this movie. If you've seen Chaplin's previous silent films, you'll also get the humor. <br /> <br /> Recommended for Mel Brooks fans.
