['Mardi Gras: Made in China provides a wonderful and intricate connection between popular culture, nudity and globalization through the manufacture and launching of accounts. I watched this film at the Boston International Film Festival and expected a dry introduction to globalization, but what I got was a fascinating visual display of striking images from both China and the United States. The revealing film is humorous, profound, serious, not condescending, and leaves you wanting more as the role of credits. It is worth comparing it with Murderball, it is simply well done. The young workers in China have several points of view, and the owner is surprisingly open about the discipline. The revelers during the Carnival are the highlights, but only because this excellent film provides a deep context within the factory in China without narration. I congratulate the filmmaker for entering and finishing the film! I would never have thought of the connection between the accounts, China and New Orleans; Now I think of the human connection between almost all objects, but also in the role of globalization, inequality and fun. More importantly, I can make these connections without feeling guilty after seeing this movie, unlike other movies about globalization that I have seen.']
