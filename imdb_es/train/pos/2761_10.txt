I saw this movie for the first time on my way home from Paris to Newark on board Air France in August of 1996. I think the film itself is a masterpiece. It's the kind of movie that people should be doing. I still think that Daniel Auteuil is one of the sexiest actors. In this French film, he plays a divorced father and a businessman who has lost his enthusiasm for life until he meets a man with Down syndrome who lives in an institution with other patients with Down syndrome. The actors, including the actor who really has Down Syndrome, create a credible friendship and relationship between these two unlikely men. The life of Daniel and ours change forever with the man with Down syndrome. He realizes that life is not just work and not play, but to live and love, and that is what life is about. The ending is a bit silly, but I still think it's one of my favorite movies. It is enough to bring a tear to your eye.
