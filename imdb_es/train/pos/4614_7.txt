This movie is ridiculous! That's exactly what I like about this piece of "Pleasure Pleasure". It's easy to condemn this movie for not including Pat Priest and Butch Patrick, the original Marilyn and Eddie. But look at the year and do the calculations. Pat Priest and Butch Patrick had already exceeded their parts! Time does that to young stars. Yvonne De Carlo, who again appreciated her role as Lili, was pushing Big 6-0 (although she still looked good and was still the perfect "Lili"). <br /> <br /> It's a shame that Yvonne De Carlo did not receive a larger part. However, it was good to see Fred Gwynne and Al Lewis in the roles that made them so famous. During the 2 seasons when THE MUNSTERS was on prime time, it was the chemistry of Gwynne / Lewis that made the series a success. The rest of the cast supported the cast members, not to say they were not necessary. They were! The television series would not have survived as much as it did without them. Given the choice between Butch Patrick or Happy Derman (the original "Eddie"), the choice was too easy. Yvonne De Carlo was also the best choice over Joan Marshall. <br /> <br /> Although this film is not up to the original TV series, it is still well measured and is one of the best "reunuin" TV specials that plagued the air tube during the late 70's and early 80's. <br /> <br /> '
