This movie is another anthology of terror. It's pretty good, but I could have used a little more. I compare it with "The House of Horrors of the Doctor Terror", although in this it fits the title. It has four floors, all connected in some way by a house. The first story is about a writer and his wife who move. Create a killer for your latest novel and then start watching the murderer wandering around your house. This is somewhat predictable, but in the end throws some turns. The following story is a little more unpredictable, and you really do not know where the hell it goes. This account with Peter Cushing and probably was my favorite of the group. This guy buys the house, but it is not the house that occupies the central place, but a rather strange wax museum. The third story starts quite well and introduces Christopher Lee. This one has him as a rather strange father who seems terribly protective with his daughter. The problem is that once you know what is happening in the story it does not end soon enough. It creeps a bit leading to a very predictable conclusion. Then, the final story refers to an actor who buys a coat from a small and strange shop. The actor really gets what he paid. Then there is a little story about an officer that is seen throughout the attempt to find out what happened to this actor and then an explanation of why these things happened. Although I was not very satisfied with the explanation, since I do not think it really explained the history of Cushing much. I think they needed a little more history for that. In summary, it is an interesting set of stories.
