I thank CÃ©sar Montano and his team for reviving the sordid feature film of Visayan, moribund. "Panaghoy" is, with luck, the precursor of a resurgence in this vernacular language (which claims more speakers than Tagalog). The details of the dialect and lifestyle accurately recall this region of the Philippines. Disadvantage: the cheesy and forced action of the American antagonist. The other element that I did not appreciate was the lack of authenticity in the disguise of "epoch" of the same character and, above all, his brilliant red kit car that I suppose had to go through a roadster of the thirties. Without those small but dazzling details, "Panaghoy" would have been at least a 9 out of 10 in my rating: Salatag daghang, Manoy Cesar! Annex: this film surpasses "Oro, Plata, Mata" by Peque Gallaga, which provided a different vision of the Visayas during the Second World War. In addition, there are some parts where the cinematography goes back to "The Color Purple" by Spielberg and the story begins to remember "Noli Me Tangere".
