While the story is sweet, and the dancing and singing in the main part of the film are a joy, the uniqueness of the film (and what makes it a masterpiece) is the dream sequence. It presents the combination of the highest form of truly American music (Gershwin), the attractive beauty of French Impressionist art, the fascinating choreography of Kelly (which includes her "pas de deux d'amour", actually a separate genre), with the more magnificent Palette of colors never devised for the set. Combining the emerging music and the visual explosion with those dances was a true work of a creative genius and a great artist.
