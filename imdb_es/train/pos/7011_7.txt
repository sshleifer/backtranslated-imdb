First, I liked this movie. All acted well. <br /> <br /> However, I do not understand the comments I hear from people about a surprise ending. I did not know anything about this movie, except for a few "I have to see" recommendations, but I knew where the plot was going in less than ten minutes. (I will not mention what they told me not to spoil a good movie for others). Even so, even though it seems obvious, I kept looking. It was nice to see how everything developed, completing the details and motivations of the characters in later scenes. <br /> <br /> I do not hate it when I think the ending at the beginning of a movie. I only hate when the road to resolution is full of boring landscapes. <br /> <br /> The personality of Will Smith's screen is simply nice, even when he is playing such a problematic character. He is energetic and credible in everything I have seen him do. Seven Pounds is another good performance. <br /> <br /> Rosario Dawson has a good performance, and has a peculiar character and quite optimistic despite a terminal heart condition. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and with Rosario, if you do not find her beautiful, you should think about replacing your eyes. <br /> <br /> It was nice to see Woody Harrelson again on the screen. I have not seen him much lately, but it could be just me. Woody did not have a tremendous amount of screen time, but he sold his cheerful blind character and pianist for all that it was worth. Excellent. <br /> <br /> A little research on the box jellyfish tells me that its venom is cardiotoxic, neurotoxic and dermatonecrotic. I think this makes it a questionable choice for both the pet and the plot. <br /> <br /> In general, I have to recommend this film not for conspiracy, but for some very good performances, and for the fact that it tends. to evoke some of the tragic emotions that we generally try to avoid.
