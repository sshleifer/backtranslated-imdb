Another comedy about a small brave country that crosses the jungle of the modern global world (for the forties) with only native wit and the ability to guide them, this is a good entry into the Ealing canyon. Terry-Thomas shines as usual in leadership, as a man of irresponsible ministry on the verge of disaster when a nation he is supposedly in charge of begins to attract the world's interest, Ian Bannen is a great romantic leader, Peter Sellers puts One of his quieter performances as a corrupt politician and the super-soft John Le Mesurier plays against the guy as a resilient revolutionary leader. Everyone has a lot of fun, especially the viewer; Maybe not on the top echelon of the Ealing classics, but quite high.
