I've seen this movie a dozen times and it's amazing. But the only thing with this was that at the beginning, there was a lot of talk about who goes out with whom. I think it would be interesting to do a remake of it. But on the official site, they said they will not make a new version because many people were saved to see it. What has happened to Patty Dunning now? She is a pretty good actress. She has made several other films in the 70s and 80s, but we have not heard from her since. I'm sure that Thom Rachford, who plays Jerry, works for Accounting at RD Films. But in general, I have to say that the series itself is like Left Behind go old old school.
