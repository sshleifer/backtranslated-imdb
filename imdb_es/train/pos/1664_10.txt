I thought that this movie was amazing, with outstanding performances by Valentina Cervi (Artemisia Gentileschi). <br /> <br /> Cervi portrays Artemisia in such a beautiful way, with tentative but confident manners, her hands tracing an idea before moving her models to place. The passion that Artemisia gives to her art is simply spectacular to see. <br /> <br /> Although not all the characters were openly beautiful, this made the film more realistic, since the hair and the clothes of the face were perfect for that moment. . <br /> <br /> In general I thought that this movie was fantastic.
