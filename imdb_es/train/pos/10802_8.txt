I am at the opposite end of the previous comment. <br /> <br /> First of all, I do not think this was a direct continuation of "The Jerk". I mean, it's not called "The Jerk 2" ... it's "The Jerk, Too", which leads me to believe that, although many of the characters' names are the same, they actually revolve around a person completely different. <Br /> <br /> Think about it: there's virtually no connection to the previous movie, except the names of the characters; a totally different story; different cast and the fact that it is a partial musical. <br /> <br /> I say that I give some credit to this movie. He has a lot of laughs ... Mark Blankfield at his best.
