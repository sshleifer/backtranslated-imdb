You know, this movie is not that good, but, I mean, come on, it's about angels helping a baseball team. It seems to me that the plot is hilarious anyway, the father of this child says that he will recover it if the angels win the pennant (because he knows they will not do it). The child prays to his false god to help the angels win, God helps all the time (through the angel Christopher Lloyd, RIP) And in the end, his father does not take him back and he goes on his motorcycle right in the face of children. It's funny until Danny Glover adopts him and he's a friend. <br /> <br /> I guess the good thing is that the old lady is left alone to die with her sewing projects and her stories. The real winner here, however, is God. Because later he got a job as a writer for numerous joke shows. <br /> <br /> Like a movie for children, you get a 7. Like a movie about the mysteries of blind, stupid faith and the nature of "god," you put a 10.
