When this film premiered in 1976, the legend says that it was received with massive mockery and contempt, and was widely considered a failure. I vividly remember that Ebert gave him a star and was supposedly booed in Cannes. <br /> <br /> Apparently, these people did not understand the film, which is not so hard to understand since it is very esoteric, dark and layered. In ways that still amaze me. As I read many of the reviews here, I find (even after approximately 7-8 visits over the years) many elements of the film that I had previously overlooked. But even without understanding the psychological fundamentals of the story, it's still a cracking suspender ... even if you take the paranoia and the pursuit that seize Polanski like a tsunami wave over the course of two consecutive hours. Br /> <br /> Examining the source material --- an excellent novel by the underestimated novelist Roland Topor --- discovers more interesting layers. Trelavsky of Polanski is a milquetoast of the highest order. Even though, at first, he seems to be another soft soul every day, one gradually realizes that he is one of those people who seems to wander aimlessly through life, letting him direct it. He seems to have few strong feelings about his likes and dislikes. He finds himself pushed gently in this way, but he never seems to be too out of shape in spite of everything. This vague type of foolishness is more noticeable in the novel than in the film, but there are also indications of this at the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> Doing a play for a woman's apartment, a Mademouiselle Choule, who is in the hospital recovering from a recent suicide attempt, seems to be the most daring she has ever tried (even effectively haggling the deposit price in the agreement). However, he soon discovers that he is paying for his "good thing" in more ways than he cares, since he is at the center of the vortex created by a building full of neurotics, control freaks who are hypersensitive even to the most minimum sign. of human life, like a step in the night or a knock at the door. <br /> <br /> However, instead of taking a stand, Trelkovsky is increasingly alienated by the situation, and is overcome by paranoia and a sense of persecution. . He becomes obsessed with Choule, imagining himself as her, dressing like her, etc. as his own personality begins to be quickly erased by his own madness. <br /> <br /> If anyone has ever doubted Polanski's bravery as an artist, they would be well advised to watch this movie. His characteristic black humor is prominent (and, sometimes, shamefully) on display here and, God bless him, he becomes the target of all this. It is a Tour de Force performance in one of the richest, riskiest and gothic horror films ever made. That more people have not seen it is a real crime.
