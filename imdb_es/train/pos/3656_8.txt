['If you have trouble suspending disbelief, then this is not for you. Consider: A woman who is already in middle age finds a newborn baby in a cabbage patch and raises it as if it were his. Think about it; makes no attempt to locate the mother, who may be a confused adolescent in need of medical treatment and, apparently, no one from the Italian equivalent of Social Services makes any attempt to put the baby under &quot;care&quot; (there are no services Social? KNOW that it is a fantasy). Before you know it, the young Toto is about ten years old and his adoptive mother dies and leaves him in the orphanage where a HAPPY man emerges who loves everyone. Not at all flat, not only has he given his suitcase to the man who stole it, but he also organized the homeless people in the area in Shantytown residents in good faith, and for a moment he leads them in a struggle against capitalism in the form of the entrepreneur who buys the land. where the shantytown is located when oil is discovered. This he wants to swallow without the subsequent &quot;miracles&quot; starting with the death of Toto&#39;s mother (the old woman who raised him instead of the biological one) and giving him a dove that doubles as a magic wand that allows him to grant modest wishes and a final in which the hobos fly to a better place probably located somewhere over the rainbow. <br /><br /> On the other hand, the film is up to Charm and it&#39;s easy to give up. In balance a small masterpiece.']
