['&quot;Hitler, the rise of evil&quot; is clearly produced by people emotionally burdened by the horrors of World War II, which makes observation a refreshing experience. <br /><br /> I think its greatest value lies in its clear revelation of the Nazi mechanism. Of the totally corrupt forms that Hitler used to reach the top. Having arrived there, this movie ends. <br /><br /> When he was at the top, the &#39;FÃ¼hrer&#39; (= German for &#39;leader&#39;) took his Germany to the biggest and most devastating war in the history of mankind. Finishing six years later in the absolute defeat of Germany. As a result, Germany lost its eastern provinces (= about 35% of its pre-war land), and was forced to accept a 44-year division of its remaining territory. Both West and East Germany had to be rebuilt from scrap, their reputation was badly damaged by the many Nazi atrocities inspired by racism. <br /><br /> As I said, &quot;Hitler, the rise of evil&quot; is a good watch. Established in an acceptable environment of the thirties, with (more than) competent acting. In particular, the role of Peter O&#39;Toole as the elderly President von Hindenburg highlights, even adds an additional dimension. <br /><br /> My copy of &quot;Hitler, the rise of Evil&quot; also offers a second DVD with two good documentary films. One deals with the personality of Hitler, the second deals with the falsification of Hitler&#39;s diaries. In 1983, this falsification caused a hilarious scandal in England and Germany, damaging the reputation of several historians and journalists.']
