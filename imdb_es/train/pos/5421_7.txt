"Now, in the sunny climate of India, where I use my time as a soldier in the service of His Majesty the Queen ..." says the famous poem written by Rudyard Kipling. This is the literal basis upon which the film "Gunga Din" is based. If you are lucky enough to see this legendary classic, you will enjoy the movies as you use them to make them; for pure pleasure. Taken from the script of the established novelist and poet, this is a story of a humble Indian native named Gunga Din (Sam Jaffe) who works as 'a beast of the regiment' during the British occupation of India during the eighteenth century. His greatest desire is to become a soldier. The water boy is part of a contingent of British Calvary threatened with death by a notorious cult of the blood of Kali called "Thuggee". Three soldiers in particular stand out in this company who are known for their courage and camaraderie. First he is handsome and elegant, Cary Grant playing the Sergeant. Archibald Cutter. Next up is Victor McLaglen as a brave Sergeant. MacChesney and finally there is the extravagant Douglas Fairbanks Jr. as Sergeant. Thomas Ballantine. The three and their fellow soldiers are surrounded by a horde of mountain stranglers led by their fanatical leader called "Guru" (Eduardo Ciannelli). In the midst of the chaos of war, there is the brave water boy who hopes to earn a place in the army playing a bugle he found. A solid story for an old black and white film that needs little fanfare for anyone looking to enjoy a classic. ****
