I captured this movie on my local movie channel, and I really enjoyed watching the movie. It has all the elements of a good movie for teenagers, and more: this film, in addition to dealing with relationships between boys and girls and sex, also deals with the issue of steroid use by young people. <br /> <br /> The film has that real-life feel, without loud music, without special effects and without outrageous scenes, which, for this movie, was the right thing to do. That feeling makes it easy to relate to the characters in the movie, some of whom probably know where we live. <br /> <br /> In general, a good movie, fun to watch. <br /> <br /> 8/10
