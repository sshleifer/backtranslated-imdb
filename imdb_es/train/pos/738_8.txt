And this is a great rock'n'roll movie in itself. No matter how it evolved (being a film on disk), it ended up being one of the best movies in which children want to rock, but the director stands in his way. Remember the rock and roll movies of the 50s where the day is saved when Alan Freed comes to the city with Chuck Berry to show that Rock & Roll Music is really great and safe for children, and Tuesday Weld receives a new Sweater for the dance. Going back to 1979, repeat the same plot, but add DA RAMONES, who nobody realized that would become one of the most influential bands of the next quarter century (and then, for the mandatory release of the DJ, "The Real "Don Steele". Include, also, all the elements of a comedy exploitation film produced by Roger Corman, with the exception of the two-day filming program, some of Corman's repertoire players known as Clint Howard, Mary Wournow and Dick Miller (there from "Bucket of Blood"), and you have one of the best stupid movies of the day. One of the few movies that uses deliberate cheeses and gets away with it. I showed the new DVD to a friend who could only remember seeing parts of him through a fog induced by the lack of sound on the drive-in, and he agreed that this is one of the great movies to watch drunks, not only for the lovely ladies highlighted and the great film of Ramones.
