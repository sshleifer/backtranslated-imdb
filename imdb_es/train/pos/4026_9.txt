Pinjar is truly a masterpiece .... It is a movie that makes you think and that makes you think and makes you question our culture. It is without a doubt the best Hindi movie I have seen to date. This film should have been shown at film festivals around the world and I think it would have been a serious contender in Cannes. All the characters were chosen perfectly and Urmila Matkondar and Manoj Bhajpai were obsessed in their roles. <br /> <br /> The story that the film tells about the partition is a very important story and one that should never be forgotten. <Br /> <br /> He has no prejudices or prejudices and has given the partition a human history. Here, no country is represented as good or bad. There are evil Indians, evil Pakistanis and good Indians and Pakistanis. The cinematography is excellent and the music is melodious, meaningful and disturbing. Everything about the movie was incredible ... and the performance left me breathless. They were all perfectly fused.
