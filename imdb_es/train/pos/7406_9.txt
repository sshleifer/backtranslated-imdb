Very different topic dealt with in this movie. A direct and simple description of Chinese local customs, observing the daily functioning of a public bath, administered by the old owner and his late son, when the eldest son returns home, mistakenly believing that his father died. How every man in the city makes his daily visit to chat, play, discuss personal matters and get honest advice, in addition to the usual spa therapies. When the old man dies, strong and loyal family ties cause the eldest son to take over, so the operation of public restrooms is not interrupted. And, finally, the arrival of modernization to end this way of spending relaxed hours and getting along. The public bath must be demolished, leading to the construction of a commercial complex.
