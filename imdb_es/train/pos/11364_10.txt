Rea, Sutherland, DeMunn and von Sydow (in a small role) are brilliant in their performances. Sutherland is particularly adept at this type of paper, where he must represent a character whose morality is, at first, uncertain for the public. As is often the case with the Sutherland characters, we must ask "is he a villain [in this case, a minor] or a hero?" <br /> <br /> This is a disturbing story, told intelligently about incompetence and the fearsome bureaucracy in the former Soviet Union that impeded the efforts of extremely competent people. As the character of Sutherland ironically points out, "the measure of a bureaucracy is its ability to make no special exceptions." The "committee meeting" (between the characters of Rea and Sutherland) after the perestroika is imposed, with its revelations, has a huge emotional impact. You can feel the suffering of the dedicated people who worked in that system. <br /> <br /> The handful of dramatic scenes portraying the relatives of the victims adds an emotional resonance to the impact of the story. Rarely is it a feature of a movie with this sickly theme, but it effectively reminds us that the victims had lives and were loved. <br /> <br /> This is a sad movie, but very important, that deserves its presentation. on television in the history of Canada.
