An investigation of Murder returns to the stage while The Vanities, in its opening night, appears before an unknown public. A strange combination of musical mystery and murder is worth it for its cast, its production numbers and the pure novelty of the film. <br /> <br /> Gertrude Michael has the eye-catching role of a malicious actress trying to stop the marriage between the stars of the show, Kitty Carlisle and Carl Brisson, as well as starring in the infamous number "Sweet Marijuana" (which was also in an album by Bette Midler of the 70s). So while the chorus girls are walking behind the scenes, the clumsy detective Victor McLaglen talks to them while trying to solve the murder in the backstage of an unknown woman. <br /> <br /> We quickly learn that the maid (Dorothy Stickney) loves Brisson from afar, the costume lady (Jessie Ralph) is Brisson's mother, and the stage director (Jack Oakie) gets involved in everything . A lot of frames of turns between the musical numbers. The best known song of the program is "Cocktails for Two". Kitty Carlisle also sings the disturbing "Where do they come from?" And there's a strange rhapsody that comes up in a Harlem specialty number with Duke Ellington! All the cast <br /> <br /> Some great performances here, especially Gertrude Michael and Dorothy Stickney. Kitty Carlisle is also pretty good. However, Brisson is a total zero. <br /> <br /> Charles Middleton plays Homer, Toby Wing plays Nancy, Donald Meek plays the doctor and also sees if you can find Ann Sheridan and Lucille Ball among the girls on the show.
