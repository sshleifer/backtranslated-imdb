I have seen this movie several times and for my life, I can not understand why some people compare this with BABE. This movie is not about the secret life of ALL animals that can talk in secret. Instead, it is a parrot that learns to speak to help its owner, a girl with a serious stutter, to overcome his impediment to speak only to separate from her in a heartbreaking scene from the beginning. Then the great journey begins. Paulie, the parrot, tries to find his great friend, Marie. <br /> <br /> On the way, meet several wonderful people and numerous unpleasant people. He falls in love with a parrot and loses it. He is deceived into a life of crime and then he is captured by a bad scientist who wants to exploit him. <br /> <br /> Tell your story to a friendly janitor in the lab who agrees to help him escape and find his beloved. Marie. <br /> <br /> Tony Shaloub shines like the friendly concierge who has an open mind and a big heart and decides to help little Paulie despite the risks. Jay Mohr plays the voice of the parrot And one of the sordid characters he meets. <br /> <br /> There is a bit of suggestive language, but this movie is appropriate for most children and even more so if parents join the fun and watch too. It's an ingenious, intelligent, epic story of animal adventures and, ultimately, a great love story about a Bird and her little girl. The search for Marie ends with an unexpected surprise for most people who do not know much about parrots. <br /> <br /> Children who have seen the wild green parrot tribes in Los Angeles and Pasadena will especially benefit from watching this film and understanding that birds, especially parrots, are not disposable pets. All children around the world will see that pets form deep attachments and that the love and loyalty of a dog or parrot is a gift to be treasured. <br /> <br /> So there's no BABE here, more of an amazing trip with a spin. <br /> <br /> Enjoy and try not to break during the sad parts.
