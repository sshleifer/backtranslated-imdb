['My brother brought this movie home from the rental store and I remember hoping it would be so boring. I think the title took away my desire. I can not remember starting a movie with such low expectations and having been so completely convinced. I watched the movie twice before letting my brother take her to the store. It is very rare that a film speaks to me in this way. She was completely caught up in Ruby&#39;s situation as she tried to make her way in her life. The bad thing about this movie is that it seems to end so fast. I could have kept watching for hours. Another drawback is that I have not been satisfied with everything Ashley Judd has done since then. She is so perfect in this movie. This movie is easily in my ten favorites of all time.']
