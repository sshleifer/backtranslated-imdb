People forget that there have been several King Kong scams: Congo, King Kong vs. Godzilla, King Kong (1976), all cheat each other, but YETI stands on its own. Just take an element of King Kong and that is the attraction of the animal with a female. <br /> <br /> The myth of YETI is based on Bigfoot (not like King Kong) and archeologists have fascinated it, at a given time It existed, but there is no scientific data to prove it. <br /> <br /> This movie is hard to find, but it's worth watching. The first time I saw him was in "Elvira's Master of Dark Spectacles" in the early 80's. He sent shivers down my spine when I was a child, especially when the YETI got angry. I saw it again, around 1:00 am on ABC about 2 to 3 years ago. Seeing it again made me appreciate it more, it has some good general effects (for its time) and the story involves a mute boy and his dog, and an evil business person who wants to kill the YETI for their own purposes. Also the music is pretty good, it's very like YETI. :-) <br /> <br /> Gianfranco Parolini and the Yetians create a great monster atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Vote 7 and half of every 10.
