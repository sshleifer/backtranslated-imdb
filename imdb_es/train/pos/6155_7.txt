"Bedknobs and Broomsticks" is a magical adventure movie with a certain charm, despite not being one of the best works of Disney. In general, it has a good story, good songs, great characters, good actors, magical and charming special effects, good scenery and lovely landscapes of England. <br /> <br /> It also combines live action and animation very well. The animation itself is, of course, quite good. The animation is very similar to the animated film of 1973 "Robin Hood" and the same can be said of the animated characters: there are many wild animals such as bears, elephants, hippos, lions, crocodiles and others as in "Robin Hood" . In addition, the King (a lion) seems to be a mixture of Prince John and King Richard, not to mention that the bear resembles Little John. <br /> <br /> This movie is often compared to "Mary Poppins" with a reason Both combine live action and animation with a similar work of art. Both have similar configurations in London. Both have their own magic and a magical woman. The children (Carrie, Charlie and the cute little Paul) are a bit like the children of Banks. Both films were directed by Robert Stevenson and both chose David Tomlinson. However, instead of a very serious man like George Banks, David Tomlinson plays a more cheerful and magical man: Professor Emelius Browne. With its magic, this film also has some slight but significant similarities with the Harry Potter stories. <br /> <br /> Most of the songs are good. "The Age of Not Believing" and "The Beautiful Briny Sea" are the best. "Portobello Road" is also nice. <br /> <br /> Once again, David Tomlinson is great in this movie. Angela Lansbury is great as Miss Price and the 3 child actors are also fine: Cindy O'Callaghan as Carrie, Ian Weighill as Charlie (a child in "the age of not believing") and Roy Snart as the younger brother Paul. br /> <br /> I like the black cat. It's great. It looks a little like Salem, the black cat in the television series "Sabrina, the teenage witch". I think it's cute when one of the characters in the film turns into a white rabbit. Rabbits are very cute, fluffy and adorable animals. I love! Even more fun is when Professor Emelius Browne transforms himself into a white rabbit because, when he transforms himself again into a human, he shakes his nose like a rabbit. It is very funny, combined with his comic figure and that mustache. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a good movie, but its ending is pretty bad. The first few minutes of the movie are nothing special, but then it improves a lot. The end, however, is weak. That's my biggest criticism about it, in large part because the animated knights thing is too much for me and also because of the feeling of war.
