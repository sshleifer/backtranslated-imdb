This is a strange movie for me, because after I reviewed a good movie by a new filmmaker (FAR OUT by Phil Mucci), another writer / director, Ryan Jafri, contacted me and asked me to watch and review his film, THE CURE Normally I do not check the movies in this way, but what the heck, I love shorts and I could not wait to see another one. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, although it turned out that I liked THE CURE, I was not excited about that and I let Jafri know. To his credit, he encouraged me to review it anyway, giving him my honest evaluation. <br /> <br /> The movie has a tremendous style and, in Jafri's direction, it is exceptional, especially for such an inexperienced film. Creator (it's his first movie). The combination of exceptional color, rhythm and music options that adapt well to the film created a great sense of the environment. You're really into the movie and that's a merit for the movie. However, what he did not love was part of the writing. While the basic idea was great, the ending was too easy to foresee. I would have really loved the ending if it had been more of a surprise or there had been an unexpected turn. However, considering that this film is from someone who should not be able to make such a professional film given their experience, it augurs well for their future. Good job.
