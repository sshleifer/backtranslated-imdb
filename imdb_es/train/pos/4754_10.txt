One of my favorite episodes of Twilight Zone. And the next day we were in the supermarket on Hollywood Blvd. and La Brea, my father and I, and guess who was coming to us in the hall! Barney Phillips, but without a hat. At least, I do not think he's wearing a hat. <br /> <br /> We asked him about his third eye and said something like he left it at home. and everyone he met that day asked him about it. <br /> <br /> A friendly guy. We used to see all kinds of character actors in Los Angeles in those days. <br /> <br /> By the way, I was a teenager and it took me a long time to overcome the "three hands" of the other alien. <br /> <br /> Robyn Frisch O'Neill <br /> <br /> Native and Hollywood resident from 1947 to 1963.
