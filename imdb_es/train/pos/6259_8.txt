In fact, I was annoyed by the comment I read that said this movie was "boring" and that the beautiful landscape was marred by black and white images. It was done in 1925 !!!! I think it's absolutely amazing for your time! <br /> <br /> The trip that these people had to go through is absolutely extraordinary. It took them a week to cross a river. The women carried their children in heavy wooden cradles on their backs, climbing a solid layer of rock, sometimes barefoot on the snow. I would like to see someone do that now! <br /> <br /> I thought it was a wonderful movie with some really amazing shots and an incredible story.
