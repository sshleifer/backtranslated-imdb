One of the best movies I've seen in the last five years! The cast is universally spectacular in a young love story and bravado on the Lower East Side of New York City with the two protagonists being budding superstars. Fun, charming, sad and inspiring, this is a totally refreshing take on urban youth that puts the crap out of Larry Clark, who is often nauseating, in the gutter where he belongs ... although I must admit that Bully was way over from its normal price. Raising Victor Vargas is a movie that you will kick yourself for getting lost ... so do not miss it!
