I had a bad day? Dog bit the postman? Would not the car start? Did people get on your nerves? Then, relax with a lovely experience. <br /> <br /> Two women decide to pool their resources in response to a one-month rental notice for a villa in Italy. Due to economic circumstances, two other women join them. Two have married lives; one is an old woman who prefers to live in the past; the fourth is a rich and beautiful woman, completely weary of life. <br /> <br /> As the spell of the villa permeates their spirits, each one grows in their own way and rises in their perspective. This also changes the people in their lives who have visited them. As they leave, they will know that the magic of the village will remain with them ... and they will find that their perspective will be altered, for the better. A deliciously uplifting movie!
