['The snobs and the pseudo experts consider that he is &quot;very far from being the best of De Sica&quot;. Those who suffer a serious lack of innocence will find a problem to connect to this masterpiece. De Sica spoke in a very direct way. His Italian character does not have the intricate self-examination of modern Italian filmmakers, or the bitter self-nomination of Pietro Germi, the bittersweet bittersweetness of Mario Monicelli, the solemnity of Visconti or the cold observation of Antonioni. De Sica told us stories like a father sitting on the edge of his children&#39;s bed before they went to sleep. There is no attempt to intellectualize. Miracolo A Milano and, to a lesser degree, Il Giudizio Universale are realistic fairy tales, or what we now call magical realism. The movie is a gem from beginning to end and Toto is the kind of character you accept with an open heart, but who naturally requires you to have a heart. The cinema in its purest form. Magnificent.']
