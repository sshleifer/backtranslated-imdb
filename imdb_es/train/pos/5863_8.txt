Even 15 years after the end of the Vietnam War, "Jacknife" did not arrive too late or was even superfluous. He is one of the few who try to deal with the second sad side of the war: the time after. Unlike films like "Taxi driver" or "Rambo", which often present their main characters as broken heroes in a bad environment after the war, this film allows the public to face a different vision of Vietnam veterans . Its development is shown very precisely before and especially after the war. The problems are obvious, but in all this tragic there is always the feeling of some hope on the basis of love and friendship. "Jacknife" could be the quietest film in Vietnam, but after almost 15 years, this is really plausible and therefore justified. In addition, it can make us believe that the war is not over yet; at least for some of us. <br /> <br /> The three main characters are incredible. De Niro has done one of his best works, but Ed Harris is the protagonist of this film. Possibly, this was his best performance.
