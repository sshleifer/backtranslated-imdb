I have not read the other comments about the film, but judging by the average rating, I see that they are unlikely to be very complementary. <br /> <br /> I saw it for the second time with my children. They loved him absolutely. It is true that he did not have the adults hanging around the floor, but the sound of the children's enjoyment made him look like that. <br /> <br /> It's a real farce by Mel Brooks, with a lot of moral content, how sad it is. is to be loved for our money, not for who we are and for how inconstant our friends and associates are. There are many other films on a similar subject, without a doubt, many of which will have a greater comic or emotional impact on adults. However, for me it is difficult to imagine such an impact on the younger members of the family. <br /> <br /> Therefore, for children, a 9/10 from me.
