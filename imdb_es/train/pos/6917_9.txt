This is a story from the Winchester rifle model of 1873 "The weapon that won the west" For the cowboy, the outlaw, the peace officer or the soldier, the Winchester 73 was a treasured possession. An Indian would sell his soul to own a ... <br /> <br /> Winchester 73 is the first collaboration between director Anthony Mann and actor James Stewart, a duo that will create a streak of superior Westerners that added A new depth Psychological of the genre. The story sees Stewart as Lin McAdam chasing the man who killed his father. Riding in Dodge City with his trusted friend, Johnny Williams (Millard Mitchell), Lin meets Dutchman Henry Brown (Stephen McNally), the man he wants. But with Wyatt Earp {Will Geer} having taken all the weapons of those who enter the city, both men can not have the shooting they are ready for. Instead, the men square off in a contest to win a Winchester 73 rifle, a competition that ultimately wins Lin. But before he can leave the city with the magnificent prize, Dutch ambushes him, steals the rifle and jumps into the city quickly. When Lin begins the hate-filled search of both the man and the rifle, the rifle will change hands several times, and each time it will add another dimension as the day of reckoning for all approaches. <br /> <br /> Much point of reference for what became known as the so-called "psychological western", Winchester 73 is basically the story of a decent man driven to the borderline madness by an event in his past. Although it was filmed in black and white (the only one of the western duos that it was) the landscapes are still an impressive feast for the eyes. The tone is set with the opening scene as Lin and Johnny on horseback, and in silhouette, they roam a hill as they head to Dodge City. It's just the starting point that would see Mann use his views as a way to run simultaneously with the emotional states of his characters. <br /> <br /> Stewart offers one of his best and most intense performances as McAdam, proving once and for all that he was one of the best and most versatile actors in America. The distribution of support is not so bad either. Shelley Winters is excellent as the only woman among the machismo, while Mitchell, McNally, Geer and the always brilliant Dan Duryea add more class to the procedures. There are even small parts for Tony Curtis and Rock Hudson here, although the latter playing a brave Indian is too much. <br /> <br /> Originally, the film was a project for Fritz Lang, who even had the script ready. run. But Lang got away from that, which turned out to be a blessing for Western fans. For a director as big as Lang, with Mann directing (and with a new script by Borden Chase and Robert Richards in hand) he set the wheels in motion to alter the course of the genre. Not only with the additional efforts that Mann & Stewart produced, but also with whom they influenced. Characters such as Budd Boetticher, Nicholas Ray and Sam Fuller took notes, and cheerfully for the Western purists, followed their example and took the psychological torch even further. <br /> <br /> A big hit at the box office back At its launch, Winchester 73 is a magnificent movie that still has a great impact in the modern era. 9.5 / 10
