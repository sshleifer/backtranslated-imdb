Most of the complaints I've heard about this movie really come down to one thing: it's not Versus. Yes, the cast and crew are basically the same. Yes, Kitamura repeats some shots in the fight scenes that appear in the second half of the film, but that's where the similarities end. Versus takes place essentially on the outside, showing Kitamura's ability to create an interesting B movie in natural settings. For Alive, almost everything happens inside. In small and small spaces. Here the artistic design is in your face, and WHAT artistic design it is! We are treated to several very intricate and interesting spaces, and our characters are, for the most part, confined to those spaces. Also a key difference is that we do not have much action here until the end of the movie. Versus was all about the action and the good, here you put much more emphasis on the characters and the situation, and they mess with your mind. Because of this, Alive is a much more interesting film than Versus. You may not introduce it and go to a random scene to see five or ten minutes of fresh bloodshed zombies, but you will stay stuck to the screen for almost two hours watching the interaction of some really interesting characters. <br /> <br /> I am now ecstatic that I ordered the DVD despite some negative comments. You also should! But be sure to realize that this is an animal different from Versus: it is often slow and requires a little thought to get the most out of it. I hope the Media Blasters will select it for the release of the subtitled DVD of the R1!
