TIGERLAND / (2000) *** 1/2 (out of four) <br /> <br /> By Blake French: <br /> <br /> Over the years, the public has seen and understood movies of war with all possible points of view, and somehow producers and writers always come up with new and innovative methods of portraying various soldiers on the battlefield. Joel Schumacher ("8MM", "A Time to Kill"), easily one of the riskiest directors currently working, has found similarity with "The Thin Red Line" in the way his new drama "Tigerland" gets into the shoes of an individual soldier. This film, written by Ross Klavan and Michael McGuther, has more guts and irony than "The Thin Red Line" or even "Saving Private Ryan". Although the dramatic impact of the film has been reduced a little due to the perversity of the material present, it certainly enlightens us in a new perspective of young people training for war. <br /> <br /> I would like to know Joel Schumacher's experiences with the army. Are men really so shameless and brutal? I'm sure some of them are, but the film sees their intransigent world through the eyes of a young man named Roland Bozz (Colin Farrell), who rebels against the ideas of war. His personality instantly counteracts several other characters, one who becomes his best friend, Paxton (Matthew Davis), and another, Wilson (Russell Richardson), whose fiery temper often exasperates Bozz's tension with the idea of ​​going to war. The war represented in this production is not found in a battlefield, but in the training camps of a field of instruction based in Louisiana between the conceptions and the fears of the soldiers in training. This film is specifically about preparing for war, nothing more and nothing less. It ends when the soldiers finally go to war, something disappointing since the fact of having witnessed the characters in action would have served as a great reward. <br /> <br /> Shot on location in approximately 28 days with a stock of 16 mm and a minuscule budget, Joel Schumacher accurately shows a rough, perverse, cruel and ruthless environment with hand-held cinematography, unique lighting techniques and direct sound. Schumacher's grainy and burned images make the film look like a documentary feature. This unusual style of filmmaking only contributes to the realism of the film's hard core, quite graphic in its use of coarse language, perhaps a bit too disturbing. Waves of four-letter words strike the audience, some in shock for what they are hearing. Even the extreme amount of vulgarity does not prevent dialogue from prevailing as heartbreaking, true and emotional. <br /> <br /> In any case, "Tigerland" gives us a small appreciation of how much our soldiers pass through our country in the early stages of combat. Such courage must be taken to enlist in the army in times of war, knowing the difficulties and risks that are being taken. Such ideas that provoke reflection are possible thanks to the harrowing performances of young aspiring actors who portray the various apprentices. This film is not for all audiences, but one that young people should take a look at before enlisting in the military ... and adult audiences should look to appreciate the value needed to do so. <br /> <br />
