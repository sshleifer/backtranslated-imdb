Although I was originally reluctant to get on the bandwagon of seeing "Lost", I accidentally caught an episode at the beginning of Season 1, the polar bear, and since then I've had my full attention. The show, that's it. Not the polar bear. So take me with me while I cast so many compliments, semi-coherent praises that I can muster. <br /> <br /> "Lost" takes a simple idea of ​​a passenger flight full of people crashing in a desert. Island, and gradually adds an extraordinary depth to its premise by exploring each character in a deep and unshakeable way. What drives them, who are they? Where do they come from? It soon becomes clear that the island they are stranded on acts as a common denominator for many things in their lives, whether they are running away from something (Sawyer and Kate, among others) or in contact with spirituality (Locke, Claire ). . But "Lost" also comes close to the island and the mysterious horrors it harbors ... and they all seem to be connected in a strange way. <br /> <br /> Although the actors of the television are not known precisely for their subtlety or dazzling performance skills, the majority of the cast of "Lost" are, in truth, spectacular actors for their respective parts, projecting heart and humor in their performances. There are also a multitude of attractions, but not generally the Hollywood type of plastic like most television programs. All the characters feel very real and are extremely attractive to watch. Their interactions rarely fall prey to predictable sappiness, petty arguments or corny melodrama (although they are annoying in secret)? These people are, first of all, trying to survive and any relationship that appears is treated secondary to the action. The realism of these characters facilitates a well-sculpted plot. <br /> <br /> About this plot ... Imagine a tree as the plot of the template, then the branches as subplots (in this case, one branch for each character). Well, Lost adds twigs to each branch and then tiny twigs to those twigs like other story lines. If you are the brother / sister of one of the main characters in the flashbacks, you will get your own story. If you are a DOG, you will have your own story. Unless the writers manage to weave them together in a glorious culmination at the end, they are preparing. I am more than a little concerned that there is a bit of disappointment in this show, as I am sure that most people are. <br /> <br /> But assuming the writers succeed, "Lost" is possibly the best television show of all time. <br /> <br /> 9/10
