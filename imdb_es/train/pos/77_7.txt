['The film begins with Vincent Price about to begin his performance as a magician. However, halfway through the successful program, the police come and turn it off. It seems that his former boss had tricked him into the tricks Price had created, even those he did in his own time at home. As a result, Price justifiably kills the evil man. The problem is that while the viewer understood why Price killed and probably thought that this was something GOOD, because Price was a little angry, he just could not stop at one (something like eating Lay&#39;s chips). <br /><br /> The film was full of very creative and spectacular magic tricks (including a huge circular saw and a crematorium for the shows), great twists in the plot and an exciting action. One thing you can not say about this movie is that it&#39;s boring. Although it is also far from subtle, it is fun at all times and it is worth checking out. <br /><br /> If I had never seen Vincent Price&#39;s House of WAX version, I probably would have liked THE THE MAGMA MAGICAN better and got a score of 8 or 9. That&#39;s because, while THE MAD MAGICIAN is a wonderful movie, it reminds me a lot to the movie that preceded (CASA DE LA CERA). The conclusion is that, since CASA DE LA CERA was so successful, the formula was included in the follow-up film. Both were made in 3-D, both have a plot where Price has all the justifications to kill, but can not stop once the first has been compromised and both are very fun to watch. The biggest differences, and there are few, are that HOUSE OF WAX was in color and it was more of a horror movie and THE MAD MAGICIAN was definitely more of a mystery. <br /><br /> My advice is that you see this movie AND THE HOUSE OF WAX (only Price&#39;s version). Both are terrible horror films of the fifties.']
