Yes, it is true, it is. I firmly believe that the N64 and the strange looking controller were designed so that this game can be made. It was amazing the first time I saw it, with its huge environments and colorful characters, and its incredible now. The control of the game is perfect, the graphics are beautiful, and it has that Nintendo charm that is always so intangible but undeniably there. A must have for any owner of N64, and a reason to obtain an N64 for all others.
