Origins of the care bears and their cousins. If you saw the original movie you will notice a discrepancy. Cousins ​​are raised with care bears, instead of meeting with them later. However, I have no problems with that, I prefer to treat the films as separate interpretations. Babies are adorable and it's fun to watch them play and grow. My favorite is Swift Heart Rabbit. The villain is a deliciously threatening shapeshifter. I could empathize with the three children since I was never good at sports either. Cree Summer is excellent as Christy. The songs are sweet and memorable. If you have an open heart, you love toys or you enjoyed the original, you can not miss it. 9/10
