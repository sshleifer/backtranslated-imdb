At 35, Groove Tube looks a lot like the current TV! Specialized niche networks (nude sports), a television show about drug dealers called The Dealers (wing Weeds and even before Cheech & Chong Up In Smoke 1978), strange beer ads (Butz Beer, no less strange than Bud Bowls ), dirty The cranky children's clown Koko (Pee Wee Herman tones), including Chevy Chase doing slapstick humor (a violent vocal duo of barbershop) a year before his 1975 debut on Saturday Night Live. And thanks to the famous opening sequence that earned Groove Tube an initial X rating, I still can not hear Curtis Mayfield's "Move On Up" without thinking about dancing naked hip-hop hopscotch. For movies similar to sketch-style, see TunnelVision. , Kentucky Fried Movie, Amazon Women on the Mood, Monty Python's Beyond the Fringe, Dynamite Chicken and Firesign Theater: Everything you know is wrong.
