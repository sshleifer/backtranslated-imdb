Scripted script, good direction, excellent performances, strong cast, effective use of locations ... <br /> <br /> Paul McGann offers a detailed and subtle performance as the man at the center of a new murder investigation that may have committed a similar murder previously. <br /> <br /> An interesting moral and emotional journey is taking place with his character (Ben Turner) and he comes across the journey undertaken by Amanda Burton. Inevitably they cross ... Who has done what? <br /> <br /> The WHY examination, both in the past and in the present, and not in WHO, could have produced a more interesting Dostoevsky story, but hey, who complains? <br /> <br />
