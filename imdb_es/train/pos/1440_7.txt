I liked the silence of the first part, the performance of Pacino and Cusak, especially their scenes together. The mood of the environment and the juxtaposition of the old idealist politics and youth were affecting. I wish Bridget Fonda had more scenes in the film; She was a serious and attractive character. The movie got out of the way when the mayor's assistant began sniffing around the mobster to get to the bottom of something that his boss clearly did not want him to meddle with. Nobody in their right mind would meet a mobster on an abandoned dock in a junkyard. Here the story became implausible. Something I do not understand: why did the policeman and Vito have a shootout if the latter was delivering information that could bring down the corrupt judge?
