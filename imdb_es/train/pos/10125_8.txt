['This film is the first of the trilogy of the society of the triad of Miikes, and the trilogy begins with a great start. The films in the trilogy are only connected thematically, and these themes are really apparent in all of your films, if you look close enough. Shinjuku Triad Society is a policeman who tries to prevent his younger brother from becoming too involved with a gang of rather extreme outsiders, struggling to reach the top of Tokyos yakuza. The younger brother is a lawyer, and the gang of the triad is increasingly in need of one as the movie progresses. The film takes place in a very harsh environment and, therefore, it is quite violent and hard. Miike has done worse things, but since this is a serious movie, it hits you very hard. As usual, there are also many perverted sexual relationships, mostly homosexuals. The film is, in many ways, a typical gangster movie, but with a great drive and real malice. If you&#39;ve only seen Miikes&#39; distant films (Ichi the killer, Fudoh, etc.), it&#39;s worth taking a look, as it&#39;s a kind of compromise between his aggressive over-the-top style shown in those movies and his side more serious. , as seen in the other films of the trilogy. And as always with Miike, there are at least two scenes in this that you will NEVER forget (see and discover which ones for you). <br /><br /> 8/10']
