A great movie! Slow: yes. <br /> <br /> ... but original, deeply atmospheric, dark and horrifying, perfectly SURREAL (it feels like a nightmare). <br /> <br /> I would compare it to David Lynch The style (Eraserhead, Inland Empire, Blue Velvet) can be combined with a bit of Barton Fink and Naked Lunch (Insects!). Also a bit of Jodorowsky (Fando and Lis) ... <br /> <br /> Add a little Night on Earth, Angel Heart and a little Spawn, Pi, (would it be wrong to mention Tetsuo?) The Ladder of Jacob, The Forbidden and Salome by Barker, which should at least conform to the concept of a dark night ... NUIT NOIRE. <br /> <br /> If you go to avantegardista and / or surrealist movies (as I am) you will like this If you are waiting for something more like an action-packed film with a normal plot, try your luck with something else. <br /> <br /> Final words: the plot is very, very strange and unusual and probably the # 1 reason why most people who do not appreciate this movie hate it.
