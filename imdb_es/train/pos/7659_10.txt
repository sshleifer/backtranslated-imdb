I just finished watching this movie, which has bothered me a lot. I've also been to South Africa twice, about the time this movie is set. <br /> <br /> It is certainly shocking, and the opening scenes tend to "set the scene". The slow but steady increase of the rhythm hardly allows a rest, and certainly there are few moments of light. <br /> <br /> You can never see Nigel Hawthorne again in the same way. He introduced himself as a very twisted individual, and I found myself disgusting him every time he appeared. <br /> <br /> Strongly agree with Steve-thomp's articulated and well-thought comments.
