What a lovely movie ... <br /> <br /> Accompanied by the exuberant, emotional and dreamy music of the Oscar-winning composer RACHEL PORTMAN, this film is still a delight worth seeing more than once a year. <br /> <Br /> incredible casting ... <br /> <br /> Gwyneth Paltrow was perfect for Emma's role. Toni Collette was great as Harriett Smith. <br /> <br /> The character that stole the movie was MISS BATES! It was fascinating to look at, one is on the edge of the seat, just hanging on it every word and laughing hysterically WITH it. One of the most endearing characters I've known in a long time. From one of the first scenes in which he thanked Mr. Woodhouse for sending "that adorable pork pig room ... CLOSE, MOTHER !!!" she screams at her mother, with a clear and inanimate mother, Mrs. Bates (played by Emma Thompson's mother, Phyllida Law) who seems desolate and lost. <br /> <br /> The comedic way in which Emma would avoid the criticisms that Ms. Bates builds prepared for a truly heartbreaking scene at the picnic when Emma insults Miss Bates, who brings her cruel zeal to the heart. Then we see poor Miss Bates stammering and on the verge of tears and so crushed that one can not help but feel the heart torn by her in his name. It's a classic scene, one to rewind and play over and over again ... <br /> <br /> The finale is up to "Sense & Sensibility" and provides one of the best lessons of life on how to must marry. The best friend of one ... <br /> <br /> I hope that this film delights all as much as myself. <br /> <br /> I've adored him!
