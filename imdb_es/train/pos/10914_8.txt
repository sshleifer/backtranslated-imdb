I have seen the Thin Man series: Powell and Loy are definitely great, but there is something tremendously sweet about the chemistry of Powell and Arthur in this movie. Jean Arthur shines when he looks at Powell. There is an unmistakable underground hum between them. It is possible that this film does not have the genius of the Thin Man series, but without a doubt it compensates with charm. As I looked at him, I was sure that Powell was having an off-screen adventure with Arthur. My friends thought the same. This is a movie in which I wish I could go back in time (to mock and lock my lips with Powell!) It seems that their adorable and playful smiles have no end! Powell's character, Lawrence Bradford, is probably closest to the "perfect man." Okay, this sounds too exuberant, but I can not help it.
