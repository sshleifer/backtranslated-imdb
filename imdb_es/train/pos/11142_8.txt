['It&#39;s a joke. <br /><br /> In search of greener pastures in a hurry in New York City, Jon Voight is the young optimist Cowboy (almost like Forest Gump) Joe Buck of Texas. It does not take long for the Big Apple to swallow it without mercy and its ambitions in its entirety, and very soon, Joe is the target of both the coldness of New Yorkers and the scammers. Given his pure heart, he feels sorry for one of these thugs, Ratso Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman) and later moves in with him to ruin the apartment and the two literally struggle to survive. <br /><br /> Although Midnight Comedy is labeled as a drama, in my opinion it is best described as a tragic comedy or as a comic tragedy. It is above all a beautiful film with style to capture the contemporary hippie style of the late 1960s with its dizzying cinematography of Warhol&#39;s party and juxtapose it with the ultra-urban city of New York. The movie crammed Cowboy Joe Buck somewhere in between, emphasizing his misplaced position. We feel for their struggle to fit in, but also simply to get enough money to feed Ratso Rizzo. <br /><br /> Midnight Cowboy brought tears to my eyes as he is also rich in substance and projects a lot of heart. I imagine that this film must have inspired both Forest Gump with its main character of pure heart and out of place and, to some extent, the Crocodile Dundee films, since it deals with almost the same kind of humor, a contrast between countries Cowboys and polished cosmopolitans of New York. Very convincing and sensationally creative film that I recommend highly. <br /><br /> 8.5 / 10']
