Excellent movie that reveals how people are connected to the common accounts that are exchanged during Mardi Gras. The film is much more than a commentary on globalization. In fact, it humanizes the workers in China, the owner of the factory, the account dealer in New Orleans and even the revelers in New Orleans. What stands out most is the director's ability to tell a complicated story with complicated details in such a simple and seductive way. His incredible access to the factory is another intriguing aspect and I would just like to know how he entered. It is a beautiful story without sentimentality or guilt associated with it, and the conclusion provides hope without people feeling alienated.
