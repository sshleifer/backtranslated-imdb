This, "Prodigal Son" and "Eastern Condors" are my favorite films of Sammo Hung. The Fat Dragon is fatter in this output than in "Condors", but it is no less sure as a director or actor. He is, in fact, at the top of his form and offers a devastating and brutal activist who has half a dozen incredible sequences and manages to tell a sweet and compassionate love story. Love and romance are not the director's priorities here, but they serve as curious additions to the action and ensure that viewers do not push the fast-forward button between physical shocks. <br /> <br /> The opening scene, which features a fun light saber duel, sets a solid but deceptive tone. A sequence in which the Sammo pedicab is chased by a car is beautifully prepared and sweetened with a sharp, comical tone. The fast and furious fight between Sammo and Lau Kar Leung is a model of dazzling choreography and sharp, excellent direction, and easily one of the best of its kind. The violence of the film slowly increases until, finally, when the climate confrontation arrives, we are subjected to some of the most brutal altercations that have been seen in a production of Sammo. The assault of the director / actor Billy Chow and a house full of angry and threatening opponents is a delight of fissure and physical punishment. <br /> <br /> Great on all levels and one of the best martial arts movies ever made. <br /> <br /> Great score, too.
