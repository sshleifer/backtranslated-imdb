"October Sky" is a movie that will steal your heart, fill your mind with vivid images and elevate your spirit. The story of Homer Hickham and his dream of creating a rocket seem very simple at first, especially when the film takes place in a mining town, where the future is as clear as the pieces of coal in the mine. But Homer can not follow in his father's footsteps. With the encouragement of Miss Riley, (a friendly teacher), staff members of his father and his friends, Homer tries to make his dream come true. <br /> <br /> However, as in any life story, there are many stops along the way. Director Joe Johnston gets us into the coal mines, where we witness the chilling situation of the miners bent under a rock roof. With illuminated helmets and a folded posture, they looked more like alien insectoids than humans in the dark. The miners' coughs and blackened faces were a constant reminder of the danger miners faced in their work. <br /> <br /> Contrasting the lugubrious charge of the mine shaft are the images of the rocket launches of Homer and his friend. Under the blue bowl of the sky, the rockets are placed on a platform and thrown into the stratosphere ... And nothing can equal the scene when Homer sees Sputnik for the first time. <br /> <br /> However, what makes the film so endearing is the relationship between the characters. Homer's father is a hardened classic man ... but he also has a soft side. We see that he loves his son, despite his many arguments. The love and support of Miss Riley is also evident. Best of all, the movie is uncomfortable. It does not tie everything in a beautiful tie. It tears you, it lifts you. It maintains an air of reality, which is important in a movie like this. <br /> <br /> This movie can be considered a complete work. At first, I was disappointed that the film did not continue with Homer's life. I did not want it to end. Then I realized ... what a good movie does to a person. If you have done your job, you will not want it to end. And "October Sky" achieves just that.
