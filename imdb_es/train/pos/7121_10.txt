['I had not seen this movie in probably 35 years, so when I realized recently that I was going to be on TV (cable) again for the first time in a long time (it&#39;s not available in the video), I made sure not to I missed. And unlike many other films that seem to lose their luster when they are finally seen again, I found that the visual images of the &quot;Pride of the Marines&quot; were as vivid and effective as I remembered for the first time. What makes this movie so special, anyway? <br /><br /> All. Based on the true story of Al Schmid and his companion to the machine gun of the marine machine gun at the battle of the Tenaru River in Guadalcanal in November 1942, the script remains true to the book on which it relied 95%, &quot;Al Schmid, Marine &quot;by Roger Butterfield, varying only enough to meet the time limits of a motion picture. This is not a typical &quot;war movie&quot; in which the action is central, and in fact the scene of the war is approximately 10 minutes in the middle of the film. But it is a memorable 10 minutes, filmed in the lowest light possible to represent a night battle, and lacks the false heroism or falsehood that usually plagues the genre. In a way, probably before his time, the natural drama of what happened there was more than enough to convey to the audience the raw, ugly and brutal nature of the battle, and probably surprised the audience when it was seen right after the war . This movie is not about &quot;glorifying&quot; war; I can not imagine anyone watching that battle scene and WISHING to recruit me in the service. Not immediately, anyway. <br /><br /> What really worries this movie is the consequences of the battle, and how damaged men can learn to reclaim their lives. There is an excellent hospital scene where a dozen men discuss this, and I think that is another reason why the film was so well received, it was exceptionally well written. There is a sequence of &quot;dream&quot; made inverse (negative film) that seems almost experimental, and the performance is also strong, directed by John Garfield. Garfield was perfect for the role because his natural temperament and Schmid&#39;s were almost the same, and Garfield met Schmid and even lived with him for a while to learn as much as he could about the man and his role. The actors do not do much anymore, but added to the equation, it&#39;s just another reason why this film tells such a difficult and unattractive story.']
