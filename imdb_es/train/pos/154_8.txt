"El Mar", directed by the Catalan director Agusti Villarona, and based on the novel by Blai Bonet, offers a glimpse of Spanish history seen by a Balearic author that traces the viewer back to the days of the civil war in that country. The film focuses on three friends, and follows them from those early days during the beginning of the war in Mallorca, until a few years later, when two of those friends meet again when they are in a sanatorium, lost in the field. <Br /> <br /> First we meet three children who play happily. Not everything is what it seems. The tragic death of one of them points to the cruelty of the one who commits the bad action. The boys have excluded a girl, about her age, from participating in her games. <br /> <br /> When we meet the adult Ramallo again, he is on his way to a sanitarium. It seems he suffers from tuberculosis. To her surprise, Manuel Tur, one of her childhood friends is also being treated, and the girl who was not welcome to participate in her games is now one of the nuns who oversees her medical care. It is obvious that Tur looks at Ramallo in a way that only means that he is in love with the aggressive bully. Your relationship will have devastating consequences. <br /> <br /> Roger Casamajor does a good job of portraying old Ramallo. Bruno Bergonzino impresses as Tur, vulnerable youth. Antonia Torrens plays Sister Francisca with conviction. Angela Molina makes an appearance as Carmen, the caretaker's wife of the institution. Simon Andreu is perfect as Alcantara. <br /> <br /> "El Mar" is a dark film that clearly shows the talents of Agusti Villarona to make the novel come alive for the viewer.
