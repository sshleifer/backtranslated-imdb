This is actually a small and great movie, made with absolutely no budget, with a shot in the video crinkliness. It takes a while to warm up. The acting is so bad that soon it acquires a Zen charm. After some scenes, stop noticing the uncomfortable lines or the rehearsed sound of some deliveries. All the characters develop a peculiar charm, especially "Richard". Forget about Anthony Hopkins, Maidens is the guy he'd hire to play a delusional psychopath. It seems that he enjoys it very much! Combined with the crazy gore scenes and the infestation of zombies, there are some visually effective shots of the title character, "The Midnight Skater" who moves around the campus wearing a black sweatshirt, looking for everyone as a cross between Grim Reaper. and, for example, The Silver Surfer. These shots make the sometimes ridiculous things that the characters say about the Skater seem almost ominous. The soundtrack includes some very funny Garage-Punk melodies and the hoarse and choppy meanness of it adapts well to the mood of the film. Thumb up, I say.
