I have no idea why this movie is getting so bad reputation from so many IMDb users (some say it's their 'worst movie'.) Has not any of you seen Cradle 2 The Grave?) My favorite criticism is that the plot is totally stupid, and just an excuse to hang all the action sequences. Duh! What the fuck did you expect from a movie by Jet Li? Did you honestly believe that someone invented the story and then loaded it with action? Of course, no! Black Mask is an incredible action, from wall to wall during almost all its execution time. It is also deliciously frightening, and we have many severed limbs, decapitations, and creative ways of seeing how they kill the bad guys (and also some innocent people!). Most of Li's other martial arts movies are daycare compared to Black Mask; You can not stop gratuitous violence, bloodshed or action sequences at all! And that made me a happy camper. Again: if you enter a movie by Jet Li expecting a magnificent dialogue and an intriguing plot, you go for the wrong reasons. Black Mask is probably my favorite of his films (however, beware of the horrible dubbing).
