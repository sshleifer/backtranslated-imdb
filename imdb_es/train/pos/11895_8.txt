Tea Leoni plays Nora Wilde, a serious photographer, who is going through a bad divorce. She wants her freedom but it has a cost. She wants to legitimize photography, but is hired to work for the tabloids as a paparazzi. His boss is played by the wonderful and divine Holland Taylor. The show was well written most of the time. Nora, from TE, was starting to become a memorable character, but the network was not compatible with comedy and they still do not. Even when they brought George Wendt from Cheers, they made unnecessary changes in the cast and the characters. The program was good at first and the audience was getting used to it, but then the network destroyed it like bad plastic surgery.
