['This movie definitely gets a thumbs up of me. They are witty jokes and even their occasional stereotyped and derogatory views about the people of Eastern Europe had me stitching through most of the movie. Its plot is intelligent and 100% original and will make you guess throughout the entire film. The person who impressed me most in this movie was Hilary Duff. It is clear and simple to see that she has taken a leap of faith away from the &#39;chick-flick&#39; genre to which she was accustomed. His accent is excellent and his acting performance was surprisingly clear and well executed. It&#39;s the best performance I&#39;ve seen of Hilary, and I&#39;ve seen most of her films. Her character, Yonica Babyyeah is described as &quot;The Britney Spears of Eastern Europe&quot; and this is seen in some of her manners and in the song, &quot;I want to make you explode ... ... ... up&quot;. You also feel sorry for her, since her performance really catches you, Yonica is a very complex and confusing character. Joan Cusack made me laugh throughout the movie with her sometimes slapstick humor, but also her facial expressions and so on. John Cusack&#39;s witty dialogue will probably make you chuckle. I recommend this movie.']
