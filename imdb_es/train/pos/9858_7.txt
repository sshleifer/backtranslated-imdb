I would not go so far as not to recommend this film, since the only problems I have with it are due to overexposure to the plot devices used in the film, the kind of things common to all children's films that have been made . That does not make it bad, just that it would not go far. <br /> <br /> It's a bit of saccharine, so I could say that for the most part anyone looking for something with a little more wit could be disappointed with a movie obviously for kids like this. <br /> <br /> However, all that goes out the window when that squirrel (that of all the trailers) appears on the screen. His time is limited, but it seems evident that the decision makers had the good sense to tell these guys "hey, could you put in a little more squirrel?" Each time it is becoming intolerably boring. That does not save the movie, but you can stop saying "at least there was one aspect where I could not stop laughing". <br /> <br /> And, of course, visually you will not be disappointed, but that's it. almost a dice with the Pixar movies. Of all your things, I would put this in the bottom ... but that is not bad in itself.
