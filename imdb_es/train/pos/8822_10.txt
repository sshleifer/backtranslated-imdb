Splendid film that in only eight minutes shows a mixture of unusual genre: mystery, suspense, musical. Briefly, we are allowed to tell the story: a girl enters a European café and then ... The smooth transition from meaningless mystery to narrative logic. At no time, any place in which Vigalondo managed to delight in B / W by means of imagination and, despite (thanks to) the tightest budgets. <br /> <br /> Due to the time-space unit that reaches the film The intensity of a short poem (almost a haiku). Spain, land of fast poetry in B / W (remember the old Buñuel?). <br /> <br /> A must-see to reassure our belief in young cinema outside the United States.
