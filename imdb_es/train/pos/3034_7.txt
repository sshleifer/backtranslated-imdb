['An underestimated addition to Graham Greene&#39;s cinematic canon: his perceived failures can now be seen as virtues. The theatrical director Shumlin, frames his action with oppressive rigidity appropriate for the material, and seemingly inept compositions suggest convincingly uneasy. Both in a dark thriller and in a story of moral regeneration (for the female character! In a thriller of the 40s!), The film has a vertical hero who goes crazy and murderer (and possibly pedophile), contributes brilliantly the distant ideologies of the Spanish Civil War. in shaking the dangerous reality, it has a horrible murder, an amazing vision of class and capitalism, witty theatrical metaphors, a rare approximation of Greene&#39;s God and an ending that is only happy if you do not know anything about history.']
