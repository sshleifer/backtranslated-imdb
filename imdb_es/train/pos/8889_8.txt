['I lived during those times and I think the program became the heart of the era. I think I should have tried the African American problem more but I think it covers a lot in the program. He was afraid to sit and watch the riots on television in the hope that they would not go as far as their families at home and that they would not burn. I thought that Jerry O&#39;Connell did a great job of portraying a veterinarian returning from the war. I went to school with guys who came back. Some had changed more than others and others had not. It bothers me when someone says that a problem was not covered enough or that it was not entertaining enough. Live it and then make comments. I thought the movie was great and that everyone in it did an extraordinary job. Thanks for a trip (sad and good) through the memory lane.']
