As we all know, the subgenre of sexual comedies is quite full. Simply being excessively lewd is no longer enough. I have seen and heard so many jokes and disgusting actions that a sex comedy really needs to have other positive points that appeal to me these days. <br /> <br /> Upon arriving at the 40-year-old Virgin, she basically knew what to do. wait; I saw the ads after all; "Is it true that if you do not use it, you lose it?" What I did not expect to find is a sincere and sincere attempt to develop character. There are still the strange characters "out of the wall" that we see so much in Adam Sandler's films and there is still enough inappropriate language to sink Noah's Ark, but somehow the film has a worthwhile love story and yes , even a message. <br /> <br /> The main character Andy is (unfortunately for me) a person with whom I can relate. In the first shot, I see that he even shares my love for Mystery Science Theater 3000 (he has a poster for the film on his wall) and throughout the film we can see his really neat collection of antiques. Andy also has many video games and a practical knowledge of film and technology. Andy does not want to buy a car because he prefers his bicycle. The most important of all; Andy is a good person, he does not swear and respects women so much that he stays away from them. Combine all these factors and everyone begins to think that he is a serial killer. It's like the story of my life. <br /> <br /> Each of the other characters has funny little stories to accompany their slightly exaggerated personalities and they all work on a certain level but not in the way that Andy does. I felt that somehow it was a distraction, since Andy and his girlfriend Trish are really the only truly human characters in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> I suppose that, as I mentioned a flaw, I could also bring the remarkable Other to light. The story is intelligent but too predictable and in regards to romances; It's quite simple It's about Andy's relationship with Trish for a long time and we all know what will happen in the end. Surely your final detour is a bit different than we can expect, but you know what will happen at the end, and I assure you it will. These are definitely small spots in the movie, but there are so many good things here that I can easily ignore their few flaws. <br /> <br /> When I say "good" I mean "bad", of course. This is a sexual comedy and wants to be bad. For the most part I think he succeeded. There are so many funny scenes, like Andy, who tries to get rid of an erection after refusing to have sex with Trish. Or the scene in which Andy goes with Trish's daughter to a sex education class where she ends up asking more questions than anyone else. Oh, and we must not forget the sequence of hair removal that will soon be classic "Ooh! What's your name!" A small interesting note about that scene; Actor Steve Carell really tightened his belly and the pain shown is real. Of course, they only took one shot, but it was still something very brave to do on their part. <br /> <br /> Actually, since we are talking about Steve Carell, I would like to say that it has now increased. On my list of respected comedians, it's kind of weird since I did not even know who I was before watching this movie. I was so impressed by his writing, acting and timing that now I really want to be aware of his future roles. This man has talent. The 40 Year Old Virgin proves that. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I had doubts about this movie, but the first word was positive and I knew it was something I was finally going to see. I'm glad I did, as it's probably one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time and it doubles up as something worth seeing. It is not simply a series of grouped sexual gags, but a series of sexual gags intertwined with a worthwhile character and a truly moving romance. Now excuse me while I'm going to throw up my bowels; I can not believe I just wrote that ... <br /> <br /> My review of Frider Waves: http://friderwaves.com/index.php?page=virgin
