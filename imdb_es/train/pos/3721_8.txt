This was one of the best war movies I've seen because it focuses on the characters rather than the real war. All the cast members do an excellent job and because most of them are relative strangers, it makes everything look more believable. The images on the camera are great, as well as the rhythm and editing. This movie will really affect you and make the audience worry about the characters.
