Michael Stearns plays Mike, a sexually frustrated individual with an interesting moral attitude towards sexuality. He has no problem eating naked dancers, but when women start having sex with men, it is when he loses it. He believes that when women really have sex it is when they lose any sense of "innocence" and / or "beauty". So he walks around couples who make love to Hollywood Hills from a distance, and ultimately shoots men with a high-powered rifle with a range. <br /> <br /> The main apparent reason for the existence of this movie is to enjoy sexuality. Activity again and again. "History" is presented as more than a late occurrence. This will make many happily heterosexual men feel quite pleased, since we are treated with enough prolonged scenes of nudity (ladies look great without clothes) and sex to serve as a significant dose of excitement. Of course, seeing a good deal through a range greatly increases the chill factor and illustrates the compulsion to voyeurism. (On the one hand, Mike looks at the couples through the scope for minutes at a time before finally pulling the trigger). All this is underlined by a music tremendously intrusive but somewhat atmospheric in the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Those with a penchant for rugged garbage are destined to enjoy this to one degree or another. It even includes a lesbian date that confuses Mike and leaves him unsure * how * to react. It develops at a very slow pace, but is wrapped with a more fun ironic touch. It's a twisted and twisted oddity that if nothing else is going to keep some viewers glued to the screen. <br /> <br /> 7/10
