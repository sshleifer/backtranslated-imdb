I saw this movie in a very strange way: I had included it in my Netflix list and I could not remember why (apart from that, I knew that Philip Seymour Hoffman was in it). Since the movie does not have opening credits, I could not even remember who directed it. <br /> <br /> When my wife and I saw her, I addressed her for about 45 minutes and said, "You know, I still want to decide that I hate this movie, but something about it just does not stop me from seeing it. " Then there is a stretch of half a dozen scenes in the middle of the film that are truly electrifying in the actors' performances. <br /> <br /> It was only when the final credits rolled that I realized it was a Sidney Lumet. movie. And I thought - wow. I'm surprised that Lumet has taken on what was really a dirty and mean little story about really bad and broken people. But it is a testimony of his talent that surprised me so much that I did not even realize it was him. <br /> <br /> Philip Seymour Hoffman is really good at this movie. Like good fear. Put this against Capote and I would say that the Oscar should have been for this movie. <br /> <br /> I also recommend the special narrative feature with Lumet, Hawke and Hoffman talking about making the film, it's entertaining and educational, with Hawke playing the student wanting to learn at the teacher's feet. Lumet definitely teaches you the first rule of working with actors: kiss their asses constantly! <br /> <br /> There are many violent and melodramatic movies out there that are empty figures when everything is said and done. And there is an element of that in this movie: that the actors fill the air with sulphurous explosions of emotion, and when the smoke clears, nothing remains. Nothing resonates on a deeper level. <br /> <br /> But Lumet has given us Network and Twelve Angry Men, films that, each in their own way, have risen to the highest levels of cinema. <br /> <br /> This movie is not at that level. But there is something that persists. And maybe it's enough. <br /> <br /> My last comment is on the comments, if you look at the amount of comments on this little movie here on IMDb, and on the depth and intelligence of the comments, pro and con: it's a good indication that something special is happening with this movie.
