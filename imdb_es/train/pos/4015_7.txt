['Johnny Yuma, one of the most satisfying Western allies, has the freshness of many WAI created during the heyday of the genre and is highly recommended for fans of the genre or unconventional intelligent cinema. <br /><br /> Johnny Yuma is not, in most aspects, terribly original, but this does not count against him. The success of a genre film depends on how well it meets the expectations of the audience and the surprising variations in these expected elements. Previously, pleasant experiences are recreated but with a subtle (or important) turn that provides a continuous interest. The quality of execution is obviously also important. A tired retread will have less success than a sincere attempt to entertain or move the audience. <br /><br /> Taking these criteria into account, Johnny Yuma succeeds. There are numerous repetitions of elements from previous films. The setting is the brutal and twisted semi-real twilight world shared by many of the best westerns of the &quot;Gothic family&quot; made in 1964-1968, such as Tempo di massacre (1966). The plot is a combination of the basic plot of Fistful of Dollars (1964) and the films of Ringo, a fact that is not surprising since the screenwriter Fendiando di Leo was involved in both. Di Leo was one of the best screenwriters of popular cinema who came out of Cinecitta in the sixties and seventies and his work helped to provide much of the thematic continuities and coherence of the genre (along with a couple of other personalities in some different circles) of actors, directors and scriptwriters). In the plot of FOD, the protagonist arrives in the city, provokes a tense situation, then suffers a near death followed by a resurrection (in some films, such as Quella sporca storia nel west (1968) is, literally, a crucifixion). The Catholic nuance of narrative and symbolism is intriguing, especially given the implicit populist / explicit socialist inclinations of filmmakers and their films. The plot of Ringo, developed more completely by screenwriter Ernesto Gastaldi in a series of films starring Guliano Gemma, a selfish protagonist chooses a community&#39;s interest over itself through a relationship with a member of that community (with a healthy script, ironic, uncertainty). <br /><br /> The relationship between Carradine and Johnny is clearly based on that of Manco / Mortimer of a Fistful of Dollar (1965). The scene of two exchanges of the weapon straps provides an intelligent dialogue and understanding between the two. Numerous films, including Da uomo a uomo (1968) or even El Chuncho, who knows? (1967), use this relationship between an older man and a minor (father / son, elder / younger brother, anglo advisor / adversary and peasant revolutionary) as a central dynamic of the plot. <br /><br /> In addition, there is a focus on deception and misdirection, labyrinths and mirrors, which are repeated throughout the best early WAI. The canons and towns of Almeria become literal labyrinths through which the protagonist and the antagonist play games of cat and mouse. <br /><br /> What distinguishes Johnny Yuma from other WAI is the quality of the use of visual / psychological space by director Romolo Guerriri, along with the intelligent mechanisms of the script to send the plot. The dialogue was never very important to the WAI and, often, absurdly unintelligible (although there are exceptions, such as the cynical comments in Django (1966) or Faccia a faccia (1967). <br /><br /> The psychological depth of character is almost entirely created through iconic images, juxtapositions and is a description of the general narrative situation. See how the presence of the mortal Samantha feels during the scene of the beating, watching from the ceiling or from the bottom of the action. Or how Johnny deprives Samantha and Pedro of their security and confidence in their power through their stealthy invasions of their ranch, hotel and even dormitory (this, again, is a FOD issue). Finally, notice how it focuses on the search for information. Like many other elements, this is taken from FOD, which was ultimately based on the Hard Mystery novel Red Harvest. It is through incidental contacts, wanted posters, listened conversations, looks through the windows, looks left in the dust, or erroneous identities and movements through the waves created by the actions of Pedro and Samantha in this surreal and absurd reality that the narrative advances. to its conclusion. <br /><br /> The film was notable at the time for what was perceived as excesses in violence. Of course, these films were no more violent than many American westerns. What was different was the psychological intensity of the violence and the causes to which it was attributed, that is, it was not the violence, but the meaning that had changed. Johnny Yuma is different and interesting in its use and representation of violence and this is another interesting aspect of the film. <br /><br /> What personally interests me the most in this genre is the link it provides to anonymous and nameless audiences in Italy and Spain, to whom these recurring narratives had some importance and interest. The artifact may have no intrinsic value in itself (some flint fragments from a prehistoric site, a fragment of cruse pottery, or a piece of rusty leather and metal), but it is a reference to a nameless presence, lives, which They were significant. simply because they existed. While Johnny Yuma has intrinsic value, much of his interest for me stems from this connection and mystery. <br /><br /> Top spaghetti western list http://imdb.com/mymovies/list?l=21849907 <br /><br /> Average SWs http://imdb.com/mymovies/list?l=21849889 <br /><br /> Only for fans (bottom of the canyon) http://imdb.com/mymovies/list?l=21849890']
