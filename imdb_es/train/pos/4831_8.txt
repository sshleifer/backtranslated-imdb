I entered into this hoping not to like it; I thought it would be terribly dignified and serious, and quite heavy and boring. <br /> <br /> It's actually much better than that, and it really was enjoying me. I do not know much about Queen Victoria beyond what most know: married to Albert, who died young, and she cried forever. Seeing the circumstances in which he grew up was fascinating; In fact, I found myself wishing I had seen more of the story, and I imagine we can see a sequel at some point. <br /> <br /> Visually, the movie is awesome. The sets and costumes are incredibly luxurious without being too flashy and exaggerated. The performance is top-notch of all involved. <br /> <br /> In a word, it was great!
