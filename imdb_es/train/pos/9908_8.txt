['God bless the slasher movies of the 80s. This is a fun and funny movie. This is what Slasher films are about. Now I&#39;m not saying horror movies, just slasher movies. It&#39;s like this: all these foolish athletes and cheerleaders choose a nerd from high school, and then one of their jokes goes terribly wrong. Disfigured and back for revenge, wearing a Joker / Jester mask (quite spooky looking, I may add), Marty begins to kill those teenagers one by one many years later, after he manages to make them believe that his old abandoned high school is having a meeting. Is that basically the plot? What is wrong with that? That&#39;s the beauty of 80&#39;s slasher movies, most of them, I&#39;d say. Many things can be so ridiculous, but they keep attracting you more as they pass. Especially this movie. <br /><br /> It presents some extravagant murders, and some are also quite creative. (Poisoning a beer can, acid bath, I do not remember that a javelin was ever used in any other Slasher movie). It&#39;s really a funny movie. That&#39;s all it is. It does not matter the fact that the characters are complete idiots, it does not matter their stupidity and it does not matter the extravagant and random things that happen in this movie. Since the lights can be controlled by the killer (when you&#39;re not even changing any buttons, you&#39;ll see) and the toilets can cough up blood, the toilets can make acid come out of them, just use that as part of your entertainment! Because that&#39;s what really makes it entertaining. <br /><br /> Movies like this represent the slashers of the 80s. Never again could movies like this be made, do you know why? It&#39;s not the 80&#39;s anymore. That&#39;s why you should simply appreciate them for what they are, have fun! I recommend this movie if you&#39;re a fan of the Slahsers like Friday the 13th. <br /><br /> One last note of this film also had a villain, Marty Rantzen. A disfigured nerd, who kills all his old enemies with a spooky jester mask. A good villain makes a good slasher. Simon Scuddamore, who played Marty, apparently committed suicide shortly after Slaughter High was released. That alone adds something spooky to the movie, and it goes on with that and it even makes you feel more sorry for Marty&#39;s character, I suppose. In general, a great fun of the 80&#39;s slashers! It is a pity that it will never be the same again ...']
