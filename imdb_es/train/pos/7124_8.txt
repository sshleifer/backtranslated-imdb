A very moving little film and not only for children. John Thaw is brilliant as always (with no hint of the Morse Inspector on him). The boy who plays William also did a good job, although I did not find him convincing in all the scenes. I loved the feeling of the small village and the slower pace of life in those times. I also felt the scenes in London where historically they were accurate, from what I could see. <br /> <br /> It reminded me a lot of a Scandinavian film I saw a couple of years ago called Mother of Mine. That film featured a boy who was evacuated from Finland to Sweden during World War II. The wife of the family that received him asked for a girl because (as a result) she lost her daughter. Getting a child instead of her completely ignoring him The fact that the child speaks Finnish complicates things even more. I recommend this movie to anyone who has enjoyed Goodnight Mr. Tom, he has the same feeling.
