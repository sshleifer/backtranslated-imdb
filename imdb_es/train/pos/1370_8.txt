I remember seeing this years ago when it first came out and I was surprised by Parker Posey's performance. And the movie was pretty good too. For anyone who has spent too much time in the nightclub scene / after hours, this movie will have a special charm for you. Not very serious, mostly fun, and Parker Posey definitely burns with his talent through this indie gem. <br /> <br /> I especially liked Diaz's character (he reminded me of all DJs with problems I've known). And many other films could follow the example of this film on how to preach the virtue of responsibility without being bored and bored about it. <br /> <br /> Babaganoosh!
