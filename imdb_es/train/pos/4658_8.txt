Talk about a cast of dreams, just two of the most wonderful actors that have appeared in the world, Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith, together in "Hot Millions", a funny and peculiar comedy that also stars Karl Malden, Robert Morley and Bob Newhart . Ustinov is an ex-convict embezzler who obtains the curriculum of a talented computer programmer (Morley) and positions himself in a Malden company, with the aim of embezzlement. It is not a smooth navigation; He attracted the attention of his competitor in the company, played by Newhart, and his neighbor, Maggie Smith (who knows him in his place of residence under another name), becomes his secretary for a brief period. She can not keep a job and is seen throughout the film in a variety of jobs, and everything ends when she gets fired. When Newhart makes progress, she invites Ustinov to her apartment to serve curry, but the two soon decide they are made for each other. Of course, she does not know that Ustinov is a con man. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie, you can not help but love Ustinov and Smith and be fascinated by Ustinov's machinations, his genius and the ways in which he slips out of trouble. But there is a turning point that will show you who really has the brain. Do not miss this movie, set in the 60's of London. It's worth it if only to hear Maggie Smith complain: "I've been fired."
