"The life of an insect" is like a favorite chocolate bar: it is full of small pieces that add to something really tasty. <br /> <br /> The story could not have been better; It is intelligent, it has "heart" (emotion), and each character has a nice "bow" (a growth or change). In comparison, the only characters in "Toy Story" who have a "bow" are Buzz, who learns to love being a toy, and Woody, who overcomes his resentment for Buzz. There are tons of laughs and beautiful moments in "A Bug's Life". All the actors become a great voice work, and the animation, both the movement and the details, is excellent. <br /> <br /> This serious movie aficionado does not apply lightly to "10", but this movie certainly deserves the "10" I gave him.
