I saw this movie a few times in the 90s and I almost broke out laughing every time. I love Eddie Murphy as an actor, but this position is something else. He is very funny. Even P.C. Brigade would find this hilarious. You have to see it, and even better if you have the boys or girls in a drink. The takeoff of Michael Jackson is very similar to him, if you close your eyes, you think it is he who sings. The things he describes are true to life and you should seriously have a bypass of humor if you thought this was not funny. My local video stores no longer store this video, but I would love to have a copy in my hands to show my husband and my children when they are old enough to appreciate the humor. Anyway, highly recommended, I hope you like it.
