Most of Kong Kong's martial arts films (70 and 80) barely function as movies; Usually, there are some well-planned fight sequences, but the plot is scraped enough to fill the gaps between those nodes, like porn movies, really. <br /> <br /> But this one does several things well. More openly, there is the direction and the choreography, which confine each fighter to a "style"; It's really based on Chinese circus acrobatics and comedic theater, but the effect works. <br /> <br /> Secondly, there is the language of the camera, which uses some impressive techniques (even according to today's measurement), changes the real-time projection speeds in slow motion, and views without filter to filtered to represent the direction of the history towards the past or towards the future. <br /> <br /> Less obvious, but more powerful and unexpected, is construction. The winner of this contest is determined by who "develops" the story. The teacher (the writer) creates a game in which the main character does not know who he is looking for, which is the same situation in which we find the spectators. One by one, discover who is who, at the same pace we found. who is who. Everything follows a tragedy / black bow. The ending tends towards irony, to "The Sting". Things much smarter than we usually get out of this genre. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the "five poisons" is the template for Tarantino's "mortal viper killers" from the "Kill Bill" volumes.
