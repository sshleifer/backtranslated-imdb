['Full House is a great family show. However, after watching some episodes over and over again, I&#39;ve noticed that they are incredibly bored and that they seem to protect themselves a lot from the outside world. Yes, there&#39;s a lot of comedy, but there are times when it&#39;s incredibly cheesy. It&#39;s not like I hated it, but do not look at it again and again because they grow old fast. Probably the best season is the first. <br /><br /> Full House is about the widower Danny Tanner (Bob Saget) and his three daughters DJ (Candace Cameron) Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin) and Michelle (Mary-Kate and Ashley). When Danny&#39;s wife dies, he needs help. Then, his best friend Joey (Dave Coulier) and Uncle Jesse (John Stamos) of the girls move in with them. Once they live there together, they discover that they can not live without each other. <br /><br /> Full House reminds you of how important family is and that you can always go home.']
