Read all the comments are very exciting. but someone can tell me the name of the real artist who painted the photos for the good times transmitted. I realize that everyone refers to j.j. As the artist in the family, but there was a real family that has the real artist, and has not yet received any credit in this regard. So, if you do not mind if someone can say the name of the real artist, I would also like to say "work well done". I know that this view is for good times, but would not you agree that he has touched the hearts of all of us too? I would like to know if he is still painting or if he is still alive. I would like to have a little of your work in my house.
