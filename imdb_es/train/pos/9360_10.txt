Let me begin by saying that at the young age of 34 I was suddenly a widower. He was devastated because he was NOT sick, he died unexpectedly of basically a coronary, his carotids went out, he died behind our house. There was a lot of speculation on the part of the police, because he fell on something and hit his head. He was suspected of murder until the autopsy returned. <br /> <br /> My children were as traumatized as I was, so in love with a good father figure like him. I had three small children, without education, without financial support. I took it very, very hard. <br /> <br /> Within two years, my in-laws attacked me verbally, physically, emotionally and spiritually, demanding that I not cry in front of the children, put on masks and show people what they wanted to see, not show my pain during The holidays ... Nobody defended me and I decided to stay out on a holiday, except of course, the pain therapist I was seeing and who had advised me to follow my heart and my soul. My in-laws did not understand it! It changed FOREVER my relationship with them, and I have never returned for a vacation. This is just an example of how my grief was not respected! My own (new) husband has seen me fall apart talking about the trauma when I shared from my soul. I collapsed, I can not breathe, I hyperventilate and, in general, I'm inactive for a few days, even if I try to convey the hidden pain. <br /> <br /> Now about this movie ... <br /> <br /> Today, my soul was moved, my heart broke. My fears and pains resurfaced from the real demons that this film presents; how one laments in comparison to how others wait for us and also the demons that are inside. Adam Sandler perfectly portrayed the horrendous agony you face, overcome and, above all, work in your own time! This movie brought out all the pain that I have tried for years to deal with. You see, when something damages your soul so deeply, so deep that words are everything that comes out of your mouth in moments of thought, you can not deal with that without wanting to be dead and walking through life, in a dead state. <br /> <br /> The Bible has a scripture, Romans 8:26, to which I cling, that when my mouth and my soul do not know why to pray, that the Holy Spirit of God carries that agony to the feet of God. - I do not need to talk. Sandler portrayed that perfectly! <br /> <br /> There is a scene in which they have taken him to a judicial hearing, with the purpose of committing himself to mental health, and he goes back to face his in-laws --- (which are familiar to me) - - and tells you the amazing truths that you have possessed, per Se, that you can not overcome it. It is a profoundly powerful and powerful performance. I started crying and it was difficult after the rooms got up to leave the theater feeling that my legs were too weak to do so. My son was with me and he saw it firsthand, my precise movements when trying to keep everything together; a lesson for him, my youngest son who barely remembers his dad. It's been 13 years for me, but this film gave me back the moment I lost my in-laws forever when they demanded a mask in my emotions and my surrender to their wishes, instead of respecting mine. <br /> <br /> I write this, so if you're an enthusiast, you're ready for this movie, but I highly recommend it on the 1000-star performance that Sandler gave. <br /> <br /> If you are not yet an enthusiast, take a lesson from your film and just listen and accept the decisions of the people in their pain, allowing them to find peace in their own time! Sometimes, the soul can not pronounce the words to express our pain. <br /> <br /> Go see this movie with handkerchiefs and not without preparing to take it ... to your soul!
