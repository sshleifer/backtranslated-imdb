Although generally I do not like remakes believing that remakes are a waste of time; This movie is an exception. Until now, until the moment of reading the previous comment, I did not know that it was a remake, so my opinion refers exclusively to the film and not to a comparison. <br /> <br /> The story and the way it is written is There is no doubt: it is cloak. There is no need for more words. <br /> <br /> The game of Anthony Edwards and Eric Roberts is excellent. I've seen some movies with them, each one in one or the other. I was sure they are good actors and, in the case of Eric, I always wondered why his sister is the famous star number 1 and not his brother. This time this certainty rises to the fact, there is no doubt. His work, like the work of Mr. Edwards, is clearly the most important of his profession. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to be in its 50 best movies to watch and store on its DVD shelves.
