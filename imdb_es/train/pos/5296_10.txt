Absolutely hilarious The tribute of John Waters to the people he loves most (Baltimoreans) is a small, twisted thing with a lot to look at and laugh about. It's like being loose in a kitsch museum! I have not laughed so much in a theater since Serial Mom. I loved seeing old friends from Dreamland days, Sharon Nisep and Susan Lowe, back in front of Waters' camera. The cast is simply wonderful (especially Edward Furlong and Martha Plimpton). It uses the best elements of Waters past atrocities (especially underestimated Polyester) and many new surprises. I got sick, in a wonderful way. Thanks john
