Tommy JO and Matt Dillon take pride in the world of gambling. The different movements with the dolls had to be learned, since throwing dice is a skill in itself. <br /> <br /> There are some surprises. Despite how cynical we are today, I expected the "good girl" to cry for her grave, instead of her friend. Especially with her comments about "going to her best friend's funeral," when she meets Matt for the first time. And then, of course, you expect Matt to kill the guy who threw battery acid in Mr. Allen's face, blinding him (interesting role of Bruce Dern). WRRROOONNNNGGG !!! Some of the other Hollywood endings happen, but the writing is excellent, the acting is so careful that you do not realize it. <br /> <br /> And the music is OUT OF THIS WORLD. Going back to the 50s, when our "native passions" were triggered by the music of Ray Charles and Bo Diddley. Even a bit of racism that worries in its ugly head in Chicago, but in a club called, wonderfully, 'Biloxi' with a confederate flag backing the racist comments. I'll be watching it again, just to listen to the music. Luckily I have the FACTOTUM sound track, so I can hear that in the car. Look at them together and you'll see how Matt has matured ... playing the bar characters in both. Now that you have a bar at the Paramount HOtel in New York, you probably have a great opportunity to do your studies. Great actor, just arrived at his. It shows finely nuanced performances ... the good and the bad in their characters. His 'young boy off the farm' is a great studio, especially touching because of his dachshund eyes. He makes love, convincingly too. As he was in several movies with Diane Lane when he was a teenager, I wonder how ... to make love with an actress you grew up with. Add conviction, I will say that.
