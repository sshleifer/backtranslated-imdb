Once you can pass the title of the movie, "Pecker" is a great movie, perhaps one of the best of John Waters. A wonderful cast, led by strong performances by Edward Furlong and Christina Ricci, makes the story very funny and real. There are some shocking scenes that are definitely not suitable for young children, but they are there with a purpose. Unfortunately, this film was not mass produced, and most of the audience will be denied the opportunity to see it. If the opportunity touches, go see this movie.
