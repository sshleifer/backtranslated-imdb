It is a story of Siberian settlers from the early twentieth century until the 60s. It is about passion and feelings, the Russian soul, and very romantic. This movie is NOT full of action, it flows slowly. In the second part one can find great songs - Russian romances. It's much better than Dr. Zhivago. The director of this movie moved to the United States and, for example, made Runaway Train.
