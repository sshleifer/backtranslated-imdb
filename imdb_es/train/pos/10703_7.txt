This movie is definitely a strange love story. Although this movie may not be much to scream, Nicole Kidman takes the film on its own, the rest of the cast could easily be forgotten, although Ben Chaplin does a good job of Hertfordshire Life with photos of St Albans and Hemel Hempstead City Center which represents the true essence of the area. What begins to look like a regular episode of the popular British television series "Heartbeat" soon becomes an action movie of gangster escapades. Nothing really memorable happens in this simple little movie and, therefore, it ends up as a pretty decent weekend entertainment. A good one to see, and if you like it, the hero John is alone in something. You can find something to identify with in your character.
