Diego Armando Maradona was, and is still the best soccer player that offers the game. Not just an athlete, but an artist. This documetary if the 1986 World Cup will live forever in the memories of every football fan around the world. Due to his tremendous and incredible goal, he scored against my own country (England). There is absolutely no reason to diminish this star. Although I do not understand Spanish, I can appreciate the Argentine narrator. Actually, he cries with happiness and can barely express his emotion ... Everything I wrote can be absurd and difficult to understand, but readers ... have to look at this to know what I mean.
