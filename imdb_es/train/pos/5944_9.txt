I'm going to say this to begin with: ... Why, oh, why, can not WB do what these short film directors do? Sandy is obviously an incredible director, and deserves some credit from WB and DC. But I guess they get a little nervous when a man with a budget of $ 12,000 can make a superhero fan drool. The World's Finest is one of the best short films I've seen, Trailer or not. <br /> <br /> I think choosing a Bodybuilder (Mike O'Hearn) to play Superman was a great choice. Let's face it, Superman is not a super model. He may be handsome, but he is not a GQ Stud. And I do not know what that guy was, some comments above me, but Superman is actually quite corpulent (Have you ever read a Superman comic book?). I guess the fact just shifts me ... It seems like such an obvious choice to get someone with real muscle mass to play like a Superhero, instead of a pretty face. The same for Batman, Bartram is in an incredible way, and an excellent Batman ... I do not know guys ... If you give them a bigger budget, and their own movie ... I think Bale and Bartram would be Neck and Neck. In a nutshell, this is one of the few Superhero movies with actors that really LOOK at the part. <br /> <br /> The acting is also pretty good. I do not know what he's talking about, O'Hearn is not that bad. He's damn convincing like Superman and Bartram ... Well, he's Batman. I mean, come on, folks, this movie had a budget of $ 12,000 dollars, what did you expect? Everyone else is great too, except that Two-Face seems a little crazier than usual ... But hey, we only have Tommy-Lee Jones as a reference. Oh, Lois is also very hot. <br /> <br /> The SFX is also very sweet. I mean, see Superman lifting the car ... MAN! How cool that is. Facing the scene of the "Tank" in Grayson, you may have to put this on top of that, since Mike seems to be flying, and easily. The Flying sequences left something to be desired, but once again, with a bigger budget ... Oh, and even used a Batmobile! (He was probably a Model, but he looked damn convincing.) <br /> <br /> In general, the only disadvantage of this trailer was the lack of a serious budget. And WB refuses to admit that Collora is a credible Director, and he NEEDS to be a separate type of Project ... But no, they (like most Marvel projects) will continue to receive these pirate directors who show almost no respect for the fans and what they care, and keep producing these betting movies. Thank God, Superman Returns was a success, or it would have been the end. World's Finest is excellent, and in my book, it counts as a superhero movie.
