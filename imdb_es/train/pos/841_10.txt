I thought it was a very funny dark comedy. Brosnan is a genius; As anyone will testify now, he should not be pigeonholed in the role of link. Kinnear was as charismatic and as funny as anyone could have been in the role. I do not know if I've laughed so much during a movie! What unexpected pleasure! My favorite line would be "I feel like a prostitute from Bangkok one Sunday after the navy left the city." Brosnan delivered this very un-bond line with such unexpected comical delicacy. I was also very impressed by the performance of Hope Davis. It seems that everyone in this film branched out from his previous work to such an extent that comedy really improved. If you liked the dark and funny "The Weather Man", you will definitely like this. <br /> <br /> I have voted 10.
