Hopefully the score has changed for now because of my brilliant and impressive review that persuades everyone to go see the movie, creating an instant chorus of "8", the true score of this film. <br /> <br /> As mentioned before Chris Rock is king! Before going to see this movie, I was not so excited about it, but now I'm knocking on the doors of the Chris Rock website and I beg you to take me as your protégé. This movie is really funny. If you do not find this movie funny, you REALLY need therapy and it is humor that focuses on all areas of society, including race (predictably), class division, love, wealth, employment, dreams, the comedy. . the list goes on <br /> <br /> However, there was a small disappointment for me. This was that when I entered this movie I did not realize that it was actually a new version of "Heaven Can Wait", another pretty good movie made in 1971 with Warren Beatty. As such, I was quite surprised when I saw this movie and, suddenly, the plot began to fall apart to be clearly similar to an older movie I had seen on TV a few weeks ago ... Even though this movie is, in My opinion, the best version of the movie. two of them simply because of the different areas it covers and the fact that Chris Rock is more fun than Warren Beatty at any second of any day of any week of any year of any year ... you get the picture. <br /> <br /> Good to the real plot of the movie. <br /> <br /> Do not ruin the experience for yourself! Do not read the plot! Just go and watch a movie because so far there have been two criticisms in IMDb that have gone crazy, go see it because it is the funniest thing you would have seen in a long time, go see it because it is a cinematic experience. That does not leave you complaining about the price of movie tickets. Go see it because it's a good movie!
