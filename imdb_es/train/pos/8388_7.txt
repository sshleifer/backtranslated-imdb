Maria Braun is an extraordinary woman who presents herself fully and very credibly, despite being so obtuse as to limit the implausibility. She will do everything possible to make her marriage work, including blatant opportunism and sexual manipulation. And so, under the outside of vice, it reveals a fairly sweet value system. The film suffers from an abrupt and unexpected ending that then feels completely inadequate, with the family convenience of finishing the school's creative writing exercise with 'and then I woke up'. It's also finished in a book on the other end with the most eccentric sequence of titles I've seen in my life, but do not let any of that discourage you.
