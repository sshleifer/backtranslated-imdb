Possible SPOILERS: I'm not sure <br /> <br /> While watching The Lion King 1 1/2, I could not help but feel mixed feelings about the whole movie. It is definitely a good way to spend an hour and 15 minutes. But there is nothing about it that gives you the same kind of feeling that the Lion King had. The story, for those who have not read the other reviews, is about how Timon and Pumba are, and how they affect the events in the original Lion King. <br /> <br /> Actually, there are some very funny jokes in the movie. My favorite part is when they show the couple raising Simba. However, for me, the worst parts have to be when they show that Timon and Pumbaa directly interfere with the events of the original. I can never watch the sequences of "Circle of Life" or "Can You Feel the Love Tonight" in the same way again (I agree with the sequence of "I can not wait to be the king"). <br /> <br /> The voices are excellent. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella do a wonderful job, as does Matthew Broderick, the guy who makes Rafiki and the hyenas. Even the actor who plays young Simba sounded like Jonathon Taylor Thomas to me. But why did they even include a voice actor for Zazu? I literally had only 2 lines, and none was very necessary. The additions of Julie Kavner and Jerry Stiller only increase the talent, although you still can not hear the voice of Timon's mom and not think about Marge Simpson. <br /> <br /> There are some scenes that seem not to fit with the original, the one that comes to mind is when they are stones of pride at the end. How did you have time to fit into the initial struggle with the hyenas? <br /> <br /> As for the DVD itself, you can not help feeling that for a set of 2 discs, special features are especially rare. They could easily have embedded a comment or other aspect ratio on the first disc. I enjoyed the game "Who wants to be the king of the jungle", even if it is the most shameful example of cross-promotion I have seen. Some of the questions are really difficult. <br /> <br /> In general, a good movie, although not as good as TLK or even TLK2.
