Also known as "Water Lilies", this film tells the story of two girls who make their way in the world of love and sex. This story is told at a slow pace and that works very well. It gives you a lot of time and space to get to know the different characters and to adhere a little to them. <br /> <br /> The use of a small mold exerts additional pressure on people who play, as they all have more screen time. Normal, but the people who play in this movie handle it well. Everyone is completely credible. The visual configuration is excellent, especially the underwater shots in the pool add a nice effect. <br /> <br /> Many films have been made on the same subject and this one does not really stand out above any. He extracts some "standard" pressure methods from the top hat and works on them. Not bad at all, but it's not great either, and I think I could have done better if I had taken some of the less explored angles. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10 synchronous swimmers
