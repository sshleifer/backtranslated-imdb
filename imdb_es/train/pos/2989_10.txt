First of all, I would like to say that I am a big fan of Bette Midler. Stella is a very good movie with a wonderful cast (Bette Midler, John Goodman, Trini Alvarado, Stephen Collins, Marsha Mason) This is one of my favorite movies of all time. It is a mother who raises a child on her own, she goes through many things that are out of their way to raise her daughter Jenny played beautifully by Trini Alvarado. This movie is very good and I suggest you take a copy to see it. Roger Ebert gave 3 1/2 stars! And he deserved 4! WONDERFUL! I give 4 of 4!
