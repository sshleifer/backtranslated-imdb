I have to admit that during the first half hour of this movie, basically, I was lost. There was some slightly amused humor, but at best a barebones plot and a general sense of worthlessness that was about to make me think I was wasting my time. Then, for no apparent reason, I suddenly realized that I was enjoying this. There was no blinding moment of realization and suddenly no dramatic scene that caught me. In fact, nothing very exciting happens in the whole movie. It was as if I suddenly realized that the film was destined to be largely meaningless, and that in its uselessness it was its charm. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman played a nameless actor who finds a "small project" to boost his career, he will play as a supermarket manager, and spend the day at a neighborhood supermarket to investigate the While he is there, he meets Scarlet (played by Paz Vega), a cashier who wants more from life, helping her prepare for a job interview as if she were auditioning for a role, while presenting him It's really fun to see "him" (because that's how the character identifies in the credits) he feels overwhelmed by a visit to the local Target store. <br /> <br /> Freeman and Vega were Very well together, with a strange but completely credible type of romantic chemistry combined but father-daughter.If you feel lost at the beginning, stick with this.In the end, it turns out to be a delightfully delightful movie.
