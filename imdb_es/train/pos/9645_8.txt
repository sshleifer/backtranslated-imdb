'Presque rien' is a story of two young people who fall in love during their summer stay by the sea. I do not want to tell the plot, because it's not the most important part of this movie (but you can be sure it's interesting and original). The best part of this film is cinematography. The visual side of 'Presque rien' is so surprising that it deserves the highest note. It leaves you enchanted with its beauty. <br /> <br /> As for the plot, it is shown in an uneven and quite complicated way. There is no simple chronology or answers to all the questions the film brings. But this is what makes 'Presque rien' even more interesting. I recommend this movie to all the people for whom the artistic side of the films is very important and they will not be disappointed.
