Most horror movies are, in fact, horrible movies. They become the same ol'-el same ol '. The same pack of every minute with a little cheap emotion (usually 'splash') and nowadays can pack every second with eye-catching special effects. One of the goals of a good horror movie is to suspend the audience's sense of disbelief. For example, I saw the two recent films of Mummy and I almost got dizzy when I saw ridiculous special effects every second. It probably costs a million dollars per second to make those films and my disbelief was never suspended, its roots grew. <br /> <br /> The subtlety can be more frightening. Less is more. <br /> <br /> The first time I saw 'The Woman in Black' on the A & E channel. After flipping through the usual 987 very bad TV channels, I stopped to watch it. This movie almost has the feeling of a production of 'Masterpiece Theater'. That was good for me, anyway, I've always preferred television and British films. <br /> <br /> Most viewers will find that this is too slow. But the slow pace helps to give credibility to the story. There are few special effects that make the viewer think that this movie is set in the real world, which makes us feel a little more uncomfortable. The makeup and costumes for the ghost remain simple and credible. Hollywood would have made her look like a demon from hell with bright eyes, fangs, claws, etc. Hollywood would have made an exaggeration and would have turned this idea into a mediocrity. <br /> <br /> The woman only made about five appearances. in the film. Most of them are where she appears in the distance and even that creates a good scare. If she appeared too often, it could have cheapened the mood that is established. However, this film is so well made that through much of the film we are led to feel that it is there all the time but it is not visible. The scene in which he "visits" Arthur Kidd late at night and we see him too close is a masterpiece of horror. <br /> <br /> This is just an extraordinary movie that I think should be considered the best horror movies ever made. I have a copy of 'The Haunting', 'The Changling' and a trillion more. I still have not seen anything that surpasses "The Woman in Black", although I keep looking. This movie is so well made that it gives the most hardened skeptics (like me) a moment when I almost had doubts about the absence of ghosts. I tease people that occasionally I have brief fears that she may appear standing in the middle of the road or that I see her look out my window, etc. Maybe I could be in a crowd at the mall looking at me furiously. hateful look This is what a great horror movie should look like. Like a LaFanu novel, The Woman in Black pushes you slowly and wraps around your neck and before you know it, it's squeezing your life and then it's too late. <br /> <br /> The closest One of the criticisms is that this was done for the small screen ... and it is a real shame that it has run out. I just paid more than $ 40 for my second copy of this movie. It's a great prize in my collection. Now I am on a quest to find an even better horror film that not only gives chills but also qualifies a sound drama.
