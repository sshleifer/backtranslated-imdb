Two films in a row that dealt with Indian prisoners of war; Veer Zaara and Deewaar. Even though Veer Zara was a love story of a boy who gives his all for someone, Deewaar focuses on the main theme. It is not hidden that many Indian prisoners of war are rotting in Pakistani prisons for years, for whom neither the Indian government. He has time or sympathy or the other side. I'm sure some of the Pakistani prisoners of war are also in India, but let's concentrate on the film. Full of actors. Some were theater actors such as Raghubir Yadav, Rajendra Gupta, etc. Amitabh Bachchan, who plays the role of a Major, acted well. Akshaye Khanna did her part well. Amrita Rao had nothing to do but a few giggles and a couple of songs. I think the role of Sanjay Dutt was more solid, although it was not too long. He performed very well here and his delivery of dialogue was also impressive. If you compare it with LOC, which was nothing more than a day-long film with a story in all directions (if it had a story), Deewaar is a well-directed film that maintains a good pace and does justice to all the actors. 7.5 / 10
