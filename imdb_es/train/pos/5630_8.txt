Marjorie (a splendid and fascinating performance by Farrah Fawcett) almost avoids being attacked in her car by the cruel serial rapist Joe (played in an extraordinary way with an alarming conviction and intensity by James Russo). However, Joe steals his wallet and discovers where Marjorie lives. He pays him a fateful day. After subjecting Marjorie to a great deal of degradation and psychological abuse, Marjorie manages to turn the tables on Joe and lock him in the fireplace. What will Marjorie do with Joe? Director Robert M. Young and screenwriter William Mastrosimone compile a grim, harsh and often disturbing account of morality that is craftily born of the brutal cruelty and painful degradation of rape, while showing how anyone when taken to the extremes is capable of provoking acts of violence and inhumanity. Joe perceives women strictly as objects, while Marjorie only sees Joe as an "animal." However, this film, in its admirable credit, refuses to make Joe simply a villain of one dimension. instead, it is a terribly real human monster and, ultimately, unfortunate with a wife and child (Joe's climactic confession, in particular, is genuinely touching). Fawcett and Russo are outstanding in the leadership; they receive excellent support from Diana Scarwid as the passive Terry, Alfre Woodard as the sensible Patricia and Sandy Martin as the compassionate officer officer Sudow. Both the agile cinematography of Curtis Clark and that of J.A.C. The shudder of Redford, the skin crawling score, greatly improves the considerable claustrophobic tension. A true power.
