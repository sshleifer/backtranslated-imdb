I saw an advanced screening for this movie tonight. Absolutely loved it. The movie kept me on the edge of my seat all night. Cillian Murphy is extremely spooky as the villain. For those of you who have seen Batman Begins, your character was much more terrifying in this movie. He played his character very well. The most frightening "bad guy" I've seen in a long time. Rachel McAdams was great. Everyone in the audience laughed, gasped and shouted at the same time, as if we were at the right time. The suspense is maintained throughout the film. The surprising part is that the end was not anti-climatic. I was not disappointed in the end. I felt satisfied. The trailer does not do justice to the movie. The movie is much better than the indicated trailer. Do not wait for this movie to appear on video. Go see it. Even though I did not have to pay to see this movie, I would have gladly given 10.75 to watch it. Enjoy!
