Seniors show ???? I am 15 years old and have been watching the program since I was 12 years old, recording it in my Sky + box every day from Hallmark and BBC 1. I really wish it had not been canceled, they have not even said goodbye. But what an adventure, all those episodes, I think I've seen them all, and it does not come to my mind that I did not like and enjoyed them. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that the BBC continues to exchange between the diagnoses. Murder and 'Murder She Wrote': I never saw it and I do not intend to do it. Anyway, the Diagnoses Murder characters are so deep, and the chemistry between the actors is incredible. It really was a sad day when they canceled this show ........
