It should be against the law not to experience this extremely funny show with Eddie Murphy. I've never seen anything like that. <br /> <br /> Murphy speaks for almost 70 minutes about cocks, bums, boobs and insults to so many famous people, including his own "family". Among the people who receive it by murphy are: Elvis, Mr. T, Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder, Mick Jagger, Luther Vandross and James Brown. Seriously I never laughed so much at all in my whole life. I mean, when a person does not know who Mr. T is, but he still laughs at both Murphy and Mr. T, there's something about it. By the time I saw the program, I could not remember who Mr. T. was, but I was still laughing. Now I know who he is and that makes it much more fun. Because that's what Eddie does: he can make those impressions so good that no matter who the hell he's trying to make, it's still very funny. And besides that, we learn that Murphy is really a very good singer. Please, watch it ..
