Does anyone know what the 2 sports cars are? I think Robert Stack could have been a Masseratti character. Rock Hudson told his father he was taking a job in Iraq, is not that right? I have had Dorthy Malone on my scouring bench most of my life, maybe this was the movie that impressed me. Loren Bacall had some skills in this film and probably outperformed Malone, but the Malones part had a more sensational impact so the Oscar had the best supporting role. Was Loren considered a leading role? The character of old Hadley was probably a fairly common image of the magnates of his day when he was a normal guy who triumphed in an emerging industry but in the construction of an entire city he had forgotten his sons to have his wife bring them . In time, he was widowed and realized that they were all those who really had and were mistreated, looking for attention, so instead of trying to relate to their children, it exploded. Your head out. An old morality tale. But seriously, what were those sports cars?
