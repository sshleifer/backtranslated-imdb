First of all, no adaptation is as good as the book, especially when it comes to a master writer like Tolkien. This ADAPTATION beautifully synthesizes Tolkien's universe with the psychedelia, aesthetics and liberal culture of the 70s. Yes, animation and background painting are sometimes a little "rough" in their technical execution, but nevertheless, they are beautiful and very evocative in terms of giving a unique "sense of place" to each of the scenes. Beyond the absolute singularity in images, there is absolutely exceptional voice acting, a performance that is VERY superior to acting in the new live action movies. And while cellular animation may not be the most "technically competent" animation, it captures the expressive body and facial gestures of the performance magnificently and, at the same time, does not forget to be subtle and nuanced. Background paintings vary from the traditional motif of "fantasy" to absolute abstraction, but the transition to abstract environments is always motivated by narrative and contributes greatly to the themes of the film. If you are a person who must have a broad representation of a computer in a movie so that everything is visualized for you, then I can see that you do not like this movie, but if you enjoy a superior performance, transcendental images and JRR Tolkien, this movie is A must see
