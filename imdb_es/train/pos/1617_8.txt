'Moonstruck' is a love story. There is not a single romance, there are at least three, but they all have to do with the same family. The family of Loretta. Loretta (Cher) is about to marry Johnny Cammareri (Danny Aiello). She does not love him, but he is a sweet and good man. When she goes to visit her dying mother in Italy, Loretta meets Johnny's brother, Ronny (Nicolas Cage). He and Johnny have not spoken in five years and Loretta wants to invite him to the wedding. Of course, they fall instantly in love with each other. <br /> <br /> The way in which this story unfolds and the love stories of Loretta's parents, uncle and aunt is something he simply has to see for himself. Everything you see is a pleasure to see, with Cher as the bright star in the middle of everything. She won and really deserved the Oscar that year. Cage is pretty good, and ridiculous too, and Olympia Dukakis as Loretta's mother and Vincent Gardenia as his father are great. This movie is fun, charming and therefore very enjoyable.
