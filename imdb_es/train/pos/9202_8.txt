Admittedly, Dev has an eye for beauty and talent. He gave a break to Zeenat Aman, a successful model, and also a former winner of the beauty pageant title, by choosing it on paper, which was tailor made for her debut. Her gaze with glasses, stoned, and her balancing of hypnotizing music, made her a favorite of the spectators. This film is a delight for the eyes, with picturesque places, ethnic people, Buddha temples and mischievous and naughty Mumtaz, who looks quite attractive, with their ethnic dress and their dancing skills. Dev is, of course, adorable, and this is one of her commercially successful performances. Hare Rama manages to maintain interest, with his carefully written writing, editing and captivating music. Like Des Pardes, his other film, Anand has handled the subject of young people who acquire the habit of drug addiction, and the theory that they come from troubled families and from a problematic childhood, is quite plausible. A good animator, this film retains its freshness to date!
