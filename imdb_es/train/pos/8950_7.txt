For those of you who are not familiar with Jimmy Stewart, this is one of his "minor" films later in his career. And, while it's not a great movie compared to many of its other images, it's not bad and it's a decent time pin, but not much more. <br /> <br /> Kim Novak is a witch in New York City and for some inexplicable reason, she decides to cast a spell on poor Jimmy to fall in love with her. Over time, the cold and distant Mrs. Novak also begins to fall in love with Stewart, and apparently in the witch rules book, this is a NO, NOT definitive! <br /> <br /> The movie is strange in its sensitivity to witches. They are neither the sacrifice of the baby nor the almighty variety. Most of his magic is quite limited and useless (like Jack Lemmon uses his powers to turn off the streetlights). And, very strangely, all the witches seem to be bohemians who meet in trendy bars where you can find people with berets and listening to shitty jazz. Considering what I think of jazz, it really must stink to be a witch in the world of this movie! <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie is quite romantic and slightly comical, but it's not something I'd rush to see. The performance is quite good, but the script does not offer enough benefits to make this an exceptional movie, in fact, I almost scored the movie with a 6, it was really united.
