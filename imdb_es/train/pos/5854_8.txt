This game is fun and has a plot that you could really expect to see in the comics. Spider-man has been framed by a mysterious impostor. The city is being invaded by a strange gas, and symbiotes like those of Venom and Carnage are appearing throughout the city. Who is behind these crimes? Could it be Doc Ock? Well, it looks like he has delivered a new sheet. Venom does not seem to be involved either, since he is simply angry that Spider-man has apparently cost him a good photo. Well, cameos from other heroes and many villains later, Spidey will unravel the mystery. The fight is basic, it is not difficult to learn, the fights with the bosses are quite funny. You have the opportunity to collect comics, you run out of web and it's fun to tour the city. However, that is also a weak point. The swing is not as good as all you do is wander through the city while Spider-man seems to attach his canvases to heaven. Neither does it have much maneuverability on the web, especially compared to a Spider-man 2 video game. Still, it makes up for the rather bad swing with the other elements, especially the story. So get ready to see Scorpion, Rhino, Venom, Mysterio, Doctor Octopus and Carnage for a trip full of wild action.
