Eugene Levy, one of the funniest of John, is also great in this case. I wish the studio would realize that this has to be on a DVD, I have it on a videotape, but I think this movie deserves a DVD (and the extras would be great) the Kung Fu Uuniversity sketch (Kung Fu U ) is very funny, as is the whole movie, also the scenes he has with his girlfriend and his family are great, this movie never seems to be on television, but loses most When it is edited for television broadcast, if it finds the video, I suggest you buy it (eBay is a good place to find a copy) I will keep my VHS until one day we can see it on DVD. There are so many great movies out there that have not yet been released to DVD, and this is one of them.
