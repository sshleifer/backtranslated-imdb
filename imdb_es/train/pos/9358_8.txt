['Reign Over Me is a success due to the powerful work of Adam Sandler and Don Cheadle. While dramatic comedy actors have been seen as a distraction, Sandler is no stranger to playing more serious roles. Most of the characters he plays have an unstable temperament and a vulnerability that can explode at any moment. It could even be typecast for characters with such hidden problems of anger. However, this performance has a considerable dramatic weight, unlike his roles in the less comical fare such as Punch-Drunk Love and Spanglish. <br /><br /> In the movie, Alan Johnson (Cheadle) meets his former roommate at the university, Charlie Finerman (Sandler), whom he has not seen in several years. Five years earlier, Charlie suffered the overwhelming loss of his wife and three daughters in a plane crash. Charlie hardly recognizes the character of Cheadle due to the repression of his memories and the consequent childhood lifestyle and lonely since the accident. It is not until Alan persists in having a conversation with him when Charlie remembers who he is. The renewed relationship that follows will allow Finerman to have a friend who does not talk about his loss, which will eventually allow him to confront the thoughts and feelings he has repressed on his own terms. <br /><br /> Although screenwriter and director Mike Binder does not show much sense of an individual style and some of his shots and transitions are a little uncomfortable, he has the ability to be decent to the great performances of his actors while he is a talented and fun writer. He shot this film with a digital camera, as more and more filmmakers do, which allows the team to shoot night scenes in low light. This kept the colorful backgrounds of New York City in focus, but resulted in the creation of frequent digital grain, which resembles scattered blue spots and moving on the screen. <br /><br /> Almost all the main characters of Reign Over Me give me a great performance. Jada-Pinkett Smith and especially Liv Tyler are memorable in their respective roles as frustrated wife of Cheadle&#39;s character and psychiatrist. However, it is Sandler and Cheadle who give some of their best work to date. They completely owned this movie. Sandler actually plays a character who does not look anything like or act like himself, partially credited to his Bob Dylan-esquire wig. Although the character of Cheadle has more time on screen than Sandler, both should be considered leading roles, as they also support and help each other throughout the film. <br /><br /> Music also plays an important role in this film, especially the title song &quot;Reign Over Me&quot;, or &quot;Love, Reign O&#39;er Me&quot; by The Who, and then covered by Pearl Jam. In one of the most powerful moments of the film, Binder shows Sandler using music to hide his feelings and memories, but this particular song provokes such an intense emotion that, instead of diminishing his anger, he incites his emotions. All in all, Reign Over Me is a fun, sad and, at the same time, funny movie, driven by its incredible outstanding performances.']
