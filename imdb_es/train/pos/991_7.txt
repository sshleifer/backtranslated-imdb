I'm really surprised to see the amount of criticism that criticizes this movie. This movie was not intended to be a "deep thought" movie, which is what the vast majority of critics seem to think it should be. In fact, it seems that if ANY movie does not produce a life-changing perception, and an amazing, deep and twisted plot, it would be rated 1 or 2. Do not destroy a movie because you do not like the genre, the people. <br /> <br /> This movie was an action / comedy movie, and that's all it pretended to be. And for an action / comedy, it was very well done. I was really surprised that I enjoyed it as much as I did, I had never really been a Jamie Foxx fan and had the overused argument that it has. <br /> <br /> The plot was not anything spectacular, using the typical criminal gets out of jail, and is thrown into a bad man plot while trying to clean up his act (see Blue Streak, Hudson Hawk, 48 hours, etc., etc.) but it warmed up with a bit of a technological twist. Now the "bad guys" are actually the "good guys" and the "bad boy" REAL is a super geek. <br /> <br /> Jamie Foxx actually plays a convincing, at the same time quite intelligent and serious leading character, and I did not try to exaggerate the humorous side of the film. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a deep underlying plot like "The Matrix" or a drama like "Of Mice and Men" then this movie is not for you. But if you enjoy pure action, excellent fast-paced filmmaking and an occasional touch of humor, this film will not disappoint you. Normally I would have rated it with an 8 (on the same level as the Die Hard Trilogy), but instead I gave it a 10 to try to take the score to what it MUST be. <br /> <br />
