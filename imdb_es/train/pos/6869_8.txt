This movie may seem dated today, but remember it was made in 1974, before Saturday Night Live, before Howard Stern, when George Carlin had just moved beyond the Hippie Dippie Weatherman and satirical humor. This movie is the grandmother of them all. Enjoy it for its historical importance, as well as for its strong entertainment value.
