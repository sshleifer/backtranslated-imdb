This could have been the best cinema of all time, if Columbia Studios had not cut so much from the Orson Welles original. What we have left is a flawed but brilliant film that shows the overwhelming talent of Welles as an actor / director and Rita Hayworth as a serious dramatic talent. <br /> <br /> 'The Lady From Shanghai' is the film noir at the moment it is more sizzling and confusing. Welles, with an uneven accent, plays Michael O'Hara, an Irish businessman, who, after a fateful encounter with the seductive and dangerous Elsa Bannister (Hayworth, in a BIG performance) is practically forced to accept a job as a crew member she and her disabled husband's yacht (Everett Sloane). Elsa, or "Rosalie", as he likes to call Michael, plays the innocent and defenseless doll very well, catching O'Hara on his website. While the lovers conduct a not-so-secret adventure at sea, Arthur Bannister's partner in his law firm, George Grisby (Glenn Anders) gets on board. He is a strange and untrustworthy figure who offers Michael a unique proposal: he will receive $ 5000 to help Grisby in the falsification of Grisby's death, for what looks like murder. The plan is for Michael to get out of a technicality and go out in the sun with Elsa. But things do not go according to plan. <br /> <br /> Hayworth gives us one of the best fatal women of all time in a very ambiguous representation. Sometimes, she seems genuinely vulnerable and like a child, to others brutal, tired of the world and hard. She is always brilliantly beautiful, whether the situation demands that she get wet in a swimsuit or turn black, brandishing a weapon. Hayworth is beautifully photographed here, and she is very far from her famous role "Gilda". Her then husband, Orson Welles, cut off the auburn colored locks for a dyed blonde crop (infuriating Columbia boss Harry Cohn). It was a great marketing strategy, and he adapts wonderfully to his change of attitude. She is not the sympathetic fatal woman who is 'Gilda', here, instead, she is a predatory, black-hearted lady who sees murder as a very useful option. <br /> <br /> The couple from Welles and Hayworth came at a time when the couple was having extreme difficulties in their marriage. They would divorce after the movie was made, so this is also a curiosity to provide a view of the complicated relationship. They are hateful, not romantic, lovers of this, so it is difficult to assess whether or not they had real chemistry on the screen. Certainly, all encounters are powerful and full of raw sexuality, with Welles as the "boy of the fall" (he even admits it himself in the movie!) And Rita as the double-crossing girl. <br /> <br /> The character of Welles is The typical black "drifter" with little sense. As Welles' voice-over demonstrates its use, O'Hara does not really use his brain very much "he hopes to be thinking about her (Elsa)". Welles usually played with intelligent and charismatic people, so his turn here as the fool Michael is unusual and very interesting. In fact, Welles was a very talented actor and he does it well. <br /> <br /> Everett Sloane is suitably viscous as Hayworth's crippled husband. One wonders why he hires Michael. It is obvious that his wife is interested in him romantically, so why does he invite a "threat" on board? One interpretation might be that Michael provides the "service" to his wife that Bannister can not in his paralyzed state. There is definitely something in that theory, with many implications for Elsa's behavior before she met her husband (was she a prostitute?) And Grisby's knowledge of Bannister's most intimate secrets that are mentioned in various scenes. <br /> <br /> This is a confusing and complicated movie with a plot that is finally flawed. We are more interested in the love triangle than in the plot of the murder, as in most noirs. Welles provides us with many of his usual brilliant cinematic touches, including the climax of the famous "Hall of Mirrors." It's a fantastic scene, an ending that can almost erase the flaws of the film and elevate it to greatness. This funny scene of the house is visually impressive, with a feeling of Dal√≠ style in the painted sets (apparently Orson painted them himself). The subtle visual images used throughout the Welles film enhance the plot and make this a thought-provoking experience. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is searing and confusing, offered excellently by Rita's low, choked voice, helpless and sharp. Little girl's voice Hayworth demonstrates his acting abilities in this case, and shows that SHE is the best fatal woman of the 'noir'. It's a shame (just a slight one, since Rita was a brilliant dancer) that she made many lovely musicals but at the same time sparkling and often forgettable for Columbia in the 40s instead of dark-themed noir like this one. She was a brilliant actress when she was given the opportunity to show her talent. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
