Robert Taylor as the crazy buffalo hunter Charlie Gilson is the main character in this movie. At first, I was thinking that Charlie would end up redeeming himself as John Wayne in The Searchers or James Stewart in The Naked Spur. But as the movie progresses, Gilson continues to do more atrocities until you realize there is no hope for him. Stewart Granger is Sandy McKenzie, who wants to stop hunting because he realizes that the buffalo will soon be gone and will be upset about the fact of killing. Gilson is a natural killer who does not make distinctions between animals or humans. Debra Paget as the Indian girl is a surprising character considering the self-censorship imposed at that time. She sleeps with Gilson in total resignation, even though she hates it. The last scene of a frozen Gilson, is unforgettable.
