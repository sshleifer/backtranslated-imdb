Red Rock West is one of those rare movies that keeps you guessing all the time about what will happen next. Nicolas Cage is confused with a hit man when he enters a small town trying to find a job. Dennis Hopper is the bad guy and nobody plays them better. Look for a short appearance by country singer Dwight Yoakam. This is a serious drama most of the time, but there are some lighter moments. What matters is that you will enjoy this effort of low budget but of high quality.
