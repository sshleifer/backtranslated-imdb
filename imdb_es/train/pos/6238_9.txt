An uncompromising look at a suburb in the 21st century in Vienna that mixes the stories of six groups of characters of the former documentary maker U.Seidl is a provocative, minimalist and intense observation cinema. <br /> <br /> After World Broadcasting From Big Brother's reality shows, Hundstage takes modern voyeurism to a disturbing and deep level. A difficult but not worthy piece of European art-cinema may seem cruel and sordid, but it manages to convey the nihilistic alienated feeling of modern society in a praiseworthy way. <br /> <br /> A must for lovers of world cinema.
