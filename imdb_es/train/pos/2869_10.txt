First of all, I want to say: "Thank you, Disney, for finally releasing the movie" Cinderella "on DVD! Now you have all Disney animated films on DVD (including Limited Editions of 1999)! What are you going to do? Then you'll go to Disney World! "Well, technically (I mean, look at the castle !!!!!) <br /> <br /> Anyway, Disney is still magical in his classic 1950 animated movie "Cinderella", the movie that put fairytale movies on the map. We are all familiar with the story of Cinderella, her stepsisters, her date, the glass slipper, the pumpkin that turns into a carriage just for saying "Bippity-boppity-boo!", And of course, we're trying to return to house before midnight! <br /> <br /> What I like about this movie: It's a great fairy tale that kids like, now in the form of a movie (and also on DVD) !!!!! <br /> <br /> "Cinderella" - Thanks, Disney! 10 stars
