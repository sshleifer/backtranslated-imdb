Vince Cassel is not Tom Cruise and Emmanuelle Devos is not Penelope Cruz either, but these two are fantastic actors, and this is a tense and compelling thriller that begins slowly with the construction of an intelligent character and then begins to put tension on the tension to a wonderful climax. Others have written about the plot, so I will not say more that everyone in this film plays their role perfectly, the director, the actors, even the cameraman, and everything seems so real, it's not a stupid weapon game, the fight When it happens that it is so believable, the expressions, the emotions, it is almost like you are there as a spectator.
