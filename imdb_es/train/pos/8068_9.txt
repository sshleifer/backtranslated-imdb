Watching this movie from beginning to end without bursting into laughter at some point requires almost an act of faith, since one has to say to oneself: "it's old", "it's a classic", "being nice", not because the The movie is so bad, but because at its best it is so good. This is a dated movie. It is also a classic, although tarnished. Anyway, I'm not inclined to laugh at people, on principle, and I get irritated more than a little when others do. In my opinion, making fun of The Informer is like laughing at an idiot who jumps his orange juice all over the tablecloth. Yes, one says to himself, he is an idiot and yet, when he is at the top of his game, he is also a true sage. The same is true for The Informer, which is sometimes very scary, and yet has a splendid picture, some good acting, a wonderful score and a simple and decent story. In the end, which I will not reveal, politics, religion and psychology come together, in a church, in such a way that the scene seems corny and exaggerated, and yet, that's life sometimes. People without simple faith education behave differently than modern people (presumably brilliant), and the scene is not so incredible (I buy it, but I know the Irish) as shameful. However, people behave that way, they say things like that. Not all are modern, and it may not even be desirable for everyone to be modern. Are people today so superior to those of seventy or eighty years ago? And how? I do not think so. We're different. Now go see the movie.
