In Stand By Me, Vern and Teddy argue who was harder, Superman or Mighty Mouse. My friends and I often argued who would win a fight too. Sometimes we become absurd and compare types like MacGyver and The Terminator or Rambo and Matrix. But now it seems we're talking about guys like Jackie Chan, Bruce Lee and Jet Li. It's a pointless comparison since Lee is dead, but it's fun. And if you look at what we have seen of Jet Li in Lethal 4 and Black Mask, you have to say at least that it will coincide well with Chan. In this film he appears as a god of martial arts. <br /> <br /> Black Mask is about a man who was created along with many other men, to be supreme combat machines. Its sole purpose is to win wars that other people lose. They are invincible in some way. That's the premise of the movie, but what it does is set up all the incredibly choreographed fight scenes. <br /> <br /> Jet Li is a wonder. He can do things with and for his body that no human being should be able to do. And that's what makes seeing it so fun. <br /> <br /> In addition to the martial arts in the film, Black Mask has a lot of humor and that's due to the chemistry that Jet has with his co-star, the police. official. They are very good together. But honestly. If someone is reading this review, they will want to know if the movie is great in the action department. And the answer to that is a resounding YES! Lots and lots of bloody action without meaning. You will love this movie.
