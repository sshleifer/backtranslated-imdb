This episode of Columbo is probably most notorious for the director, Steven Spielberg, as one of his first films. The role of Jack Cassidy should be considered as the killer who kills his partner in writing to maintain his lifestyle. Jack Cassidy would appear in a later Columbo. After all, Columbo meets his partner in the character of Jack Cassidy. He is a mysterious writer who plans to perform the perfect murder. After his first murder, his next victim would be the annoying widow and owner of a general store that would blackmail him for money. Instead of losing more money, he kills her. It is very entertaining to see Cassidy and Falk as always. Falk's familiarity with Columbo makes him visible after seeing this episode repeatedly over the years. What television forgets about the success of the years is that people will want to watch the programs again and again if they like the characters. It's not about who does it, how and why, it's Columbo's familiarity and sympathy, which has high scores among viewers like me.
