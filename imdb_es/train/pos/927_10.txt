"Father of the Pride" was another of those good shows that unfortunately do not have a very long life. And that's pretty sad, especially if you consider that almost all the time the worst programs are still in the air (think of "The simple life") I admit there are many similarities with this program and "The Simpsons", but despite the similarities. , the show has its own merits. The animation is adequate, not amazing, but it's good. The best are the characters. All the animals are very nice and funny, and even Sigfried and Roy had their moments. The music was good, I liked many of the songs. <br /> <br /> Even if the program is not very original, I think this had great potential. Like "Mission Hill", a program that is not very famous but I really liked it, this did not have the appreciation it deserved. What a pity .
