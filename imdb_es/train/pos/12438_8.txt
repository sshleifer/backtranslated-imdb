The film was a long-awaited premiere, which was a bit disappointing due to the expectations it had created. When I look at it again, I must say that it is actually quite good. First of all, it is very true to the original story (of course not completely) and, as such, is only done to maintain the right for the film. The story of modesty as a child is shown and is very faithful to the original. Maybe the performance is not the best and the plot is a bit thin, but when you compare it with the 1966 Vitti film it is much better just because it does not try to be a musical. In general, I would only recommend it to Modesty Blaise fans or someone who catches it on TV.
