The best performance of Harvey Keital so far in the new century. Very well photographed, a beautiful snapshot of pre-Castro Cuba. The story revolves around the nephew of a local petty crime boss who develops a friendship with an American with Hollywood connections. It really is about the moment when a child realizes the fact that the small circle of people he really knows lives in a much larger and more complex world that he does not yet understand. The script is strong and full of humor, the direction is crispy Above all, a truly professional work that fits well with the tradition of Latin American cinema. The only weakness is the decision to film in synchronized English instead of Spanish, probably to improve sales in the US. UU Unfortunately, this only makes the movie a bit less convincing. But if you can see beyond this, you will find a sincere trip to another world. Recommended.
