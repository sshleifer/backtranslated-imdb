This is a tough Warner Brothers movie starring a very young Barbara Stanwyck. Stanwyck plays Lily Powers, the daughter of a homeowner who speaks in a suffocating steel town in a suffocating teacher in the interpretation of Machiavelli, a technique perfected eleven years later in Billy Wilder in "Double Indemnity." She has become cynical and numb from the years of being offered as a sexual favor to her father's clients. Once his father dies in a distillery explosion, he takes a freight train to New York and literally sleeps on the corporate ladder of a bank. <br /> <br /> This would be ridiculous if it were not for Stanwyck's flames. Work here. With his dead-eyed gaze and his methods of amoral seduction, it is easy to see why men become addicted to their aggressive carnality. One of the young people who seduces on the road is a John Wayne with a new face, an accountant named Jimmy McCoy. The melodrama becomes heavy towards the last third of the film with a murder-suicide, a secret job in Paris to keep Lily silent and the new bank president who is so addicted to Lily that he embezzles the company's funds to keep her luxury. A stuck end is somewhat disappointing, but not before Stanwyck looks at the screen. The film has curious touches like Lily's friendship with an African-American woman named Chico and the German immigrant who teaches Lily about Nietzsche's philosophy about the importance of avoiding sentimentality.
