The film was shot on Movie Flats, just off Route 395, near Lone Pine, California, north of the road to Whitney Portals. You can still find cement splashes and iron beams stuck on the rocks where the games were built. And you will recognize the area of ​​any Randolph Scott movie. <br /> <br /> I will not bother with the plot, since I am sure it is covered elsewhere. The film stars three Fairbanks athletes, who must have learned a lot from their father - Grant, an acrobat in his youth - and MacLaughlin, a professional boxer from South Africa. Your physical abilities are on display. <br /> <br /> You should not take this film seriously for a moment. This is Thugees, a sect in India, where our English word "thug" comes from. I can not go through all the congratulations of this movie, but I should probably point out that the director, George Stevens, was a great lawyer with a background in the Laurel and Hardy films (see his choreography of the fight scenes) and continued. to the infinitely long dissolution of Shane and The Diary of Anne Frank. The dynasties rose and fell. Geological times came and went, while Liz Taylor and Monty Clift were kissing in "A Place in the Sun". Here, in its comic way, it stands out. <br /> <br /> This is a story of male bonding and it would be easy, too easy, to read homoeroticism in it, as many people do with Howard Hawks. Or the hatred of women. But it is not that at all. Sometimes, the things represented on the screen do not deserve too much in terms of heuristic attention. Men will form bonds by working together in a way that women do not. (Women share secrets.) Read Deborah Tannen, nobody's idea of ​​an anti-feminist. Well, when you think about it, that's what evolution should have produced. For most of human history, about nine tenths, hominids have been hunter-gatherers, and men tend to hunt and women to gather. Hunting is more effective as a team company. The men who were not very good at the union were Darwinianed, leaving the men who have a lot of team spirit. And Grant, Fairbanks and MacLaughlin made it. <br /> <br /> Sorry to digress about evolution, but I am an anthropologist and it is an occupational disease. Did I ever tell you about the horse in Vaitongi, Samoa, that slipped on the concrete and fell into the bathtub with me? You have to see the helmets. <br /> <br /> Joan Fontaine is really adorable. I only met her in her last years and I wondered why she was in so many movies. I lived in Saratoga, California, where her sister, Olivia DeHavilland, grew up and went to a convent school. Nice place. <br /> <br /> If you miss this animated and farraginosa chronicle of the British Empahh in its heyday, you should never forgive yourself. He is so famous that he is parodied in the Peter Sellers movie, "The Party." Yes, the colonel has to know.
