I drove from Sacramento to San Francisco (and vice versa) to see this movie premiere, and I'm glad I did. As a big fan of movies and Northern California, I was surprised by the number of Oscar-winning films that have been made in the Bay Area. As a fashion designer who really wants to stay in the Bay Area instead of going to Los Angeles, George Lucas' comments about persistence, community and having a vision really impressed me. <br /> <br /> Hey, if he and all the other filmmakers can do it in SF, other artists can do it too. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie
