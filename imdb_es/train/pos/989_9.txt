Both my friend and I thought that this movie was well made. We expected a happy comedy, but we got an action movie with the comics. We both think that this movie might not have done so well at the box office, since the previews led us to believe that it was a comedy. I was impressed by the supporting actors and, of course, Dave Morse always does an excellent job as an actor. The majority of the supporting cast are veterans, not first timers and they were solid. We both felt that the writing and the direction were first class and we made comments about the purchase of this film. If you do not buy it, you rent it for a long time.
