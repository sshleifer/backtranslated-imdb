A very close and sharp description of the bubbling and dynamic emotional world of a young man of 18 years, who makes his first experiences in his gay love to another boy, during a vacation with a part of his family. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie because of its extremely clear and replaced narration, with all these "Close-up sounds" and quiet moments that had been full of intensive moods. <br /> <br />
