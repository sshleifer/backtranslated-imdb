This PM Entertainment production is tied with enough bullets for John Woo to say "Enough is enough!" Of course, it's not as beautiful as Woo can deliver, but it does the exploiter work in 90 minutes. Eric Phillips (Don Wilson) is an undercover police officer in the near future. When his wife is framed for assassinating the Governor by a team that uses a similar cyborg, it is up to Eric to clear his name. Wilson has an obligation to fulfill the duty of Van Damme while playing the heroic advantage and his evil cyborg doppelganger. Why the Academy did not realize is beyond me. Being a PM production, there are tons of car chases, car explosions (4 in the first 5 minutes!) And shots. I particularly liked the truck that rotates in the air before it even comes close to touching an exploding truck. My other favorite part was that a girl from the neighborhood came to perfect her karate in Don's simulator. It is simply an opportunity to show off some cheap effects of LAWNMOWER MAN around 1995.
