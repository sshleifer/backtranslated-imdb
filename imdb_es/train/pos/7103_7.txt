I was quite surprised with this movie. Even though his budget was obviously missing, he still has to be impressed that this movie took 7 years to make and it was still good. The performance was quite impressive and the story really captivated me. My only complaint would be that the end really was a bit too abrupt for my liking. But hey, if your audience is left wanting more, then this movie has been successful. <br /> <br /> I would really recommend to anyone in Hollywood to look for Antonella Rios, who is an excellent Spanish talent (something hard to find now, every day). The bad novel about acting. Antonella RÃ­os is truly a rising star.
