Eddie Murphy Delirious is, without a doubt, the funniest thing I've ever seen in my life. When I saw it for the first time about 2 years ago, I was in stitches for weeks afterwards. To date I have seen it 17 times more and I still laugh all the time. For those who do not know, Eddie Murphy was a brilliant comedian before being a Hollywood superstar. There is not a single boring point in this piece of genius, unlike Eddie Murphy Raw, which was launched in 1987 and stretches in between. If you're not the kind of person who can not stand swearing, then I would not advise you to see it, since you'll probably hear oaths in some way every 5-10 seconds. I gave this one 10 out of 10 because it shows the best comedic genius of them all at their best.
