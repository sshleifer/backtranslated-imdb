** Warning: this post may contain spoilers ** <br /> <br /> I only got one Gamecube in September 2005, and the first two games I bought were James Bond games, the decent agent Under Fire and the boring Goldeneye Rogue Agent. The next game I planned was All or Nothing, because my friend told me it was better than the two games I already had. I have to say that he was right. <br /> <br /> I bought this for a price at HMV, and when I got home, I crashed it into my Cube and played it for hours and hours. It was much better than my other two games, and there was a much better and more interesting story. The graphics were some of the best I've seen (but now that the XBOX 360 came out, Farcry Instincts Predator has some of the best graphics known to man). The plot was intelligent; The crazy man (Willem Dafoe, named as Nikolai Diavolo) and the beautiful woman of confidence (Heidi Klum, called Katya Nadanova), try to destroy the world with small nanobots, that at the beginning of the game, you, James Bond, you have to destroy. a train. The trouble is that one of them is hidden in Katya's tits. Then you must frustrate your plans and save the world. <br /> <br /> The good thing about this game is that it actually has actors that express the characters, like Cleese who expresses Q. There are 27 levels, some of them short and some of them quite long and complicated. <br /> <br /> Game Mode - 10/10 Graphics - 9/10 Sound - 9/10 Play Value - 7/10 Multiplayer - 8/10 <br /> <br /> I give this game a grand total of 90%.
