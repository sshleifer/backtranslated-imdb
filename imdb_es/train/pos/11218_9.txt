This anime is a must for fans of Evangelion. It is an earlier work by Anno Hideaki, but his unbridled and dramatic style is in place. Also, those who did not like Evangelion might find that this release is a bit more acceptable. Gunbuster is quite exclusive to science fiction anime, as it is actually based on real science. In fact, the program has several interludes of "Science lessons" that explain the physics behind some of the film's events. One of the great dramatic points in the film is the relative passage of time at speeds close to that of light. The series does a wonderful job of dealing with the traumatically imaginable experience of leaving Earth on a six-month mission traveling near the speed of light and returning to an Earth where ten years have passed. The main character is still age 17 or 18 throughout the series, while almost all other characters age considerably. Be careful, this show is heavy on the sap sometimes. He also has a couple of the most undeserved breast injections I've ever seen. I found it easy enough to ignore the plain uniforms and the boring scenes, because the series is very good, but the spectators with a low tolerance to the sap may want to stay away from it. On an interesting note, Gainax, as always, managed to run out of money in the last couple of episodes. However, they managed to use black and white films and action sketches to produce a good resolution anyway. The end is a bit silly, but it left me feeling so good in my gut that I could not help but love it. Gunbuster is, in my opinion, one of the best pieces of Anime.
