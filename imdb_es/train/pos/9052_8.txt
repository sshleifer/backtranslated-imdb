This is a good drama and a good change of pace from the most hectic and noisy movies of today. It is another solid store based on a true one, which still means that a large part of it could be made for dramatic purposes. Frankly, I do not know, but I liked the story. <br /> <br /> The story is about a young man in the fifties who is interested in rocketry and wants to enter that field instead of working in coal mines. Like everyone else, including his father, they do it in this city of West Virginia. The big problem is the conflict between the child and his father, which I think was exaggerated. I would like to have a little less tension between the two. <br /> <br /> The young man, still a child, is played by Jake Gyllenhaal, one of his first star jobs, I think. It's nice, just like your schoolmates here. It's good to see nice kids in a movie nowadays. The other two key players in the film are Chris Cooper (the father) and Laura Dern (the child's teacher who encourages him all the time). <br /> <br /> The cinematography is decent. The soundtrack of the 1950s is fun to listen to. Once again: I wish there were more of these types of movies made today.
