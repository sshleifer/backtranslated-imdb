This is one of the best classic Edgar Wallace movies of the German series. It presents all the basic elements for a very nice Wallace movie film from the 60s: Although your Majesty, Mr. Kinski, is missing, you still have the young Joachim 'Blacky. 'Fuchsberger, starring once again as the clever' womanizer 'typical of the United States, has the young Eddi Arendt at his best (and so typical role) - the brilliant and sophisticated British butler - and already has (not so young) Lowitz like the melancholic but very "dry" ironic (and therefore: highly entertaining) police investigator. In addition, you will be offered a weird and very flamboyant "bad boy" behind a frog mask (hence the title of the movie!), You will get a crazy crazed soundtrack, classic b-movie action scenes, partially filmed from the wildest Perspectives (please remember the time of its origin!), shouting queens, and so on ... All those ingredients are stirred well in a sweet-tasting cocktail of pure German campyness Edgar Wallace: highly recommended!
