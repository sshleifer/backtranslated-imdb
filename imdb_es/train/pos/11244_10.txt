One of my best movies, maybe because I liked the punk scene in the late '70s and I attended many of the hazelnut concerts, but the movie was a good story and very good performance by Hazel and a promising Phil Daniels not sure about Your latest Eastenders project !! excellent performance by many unknown actors who, if you keep your eyes wide open, will see them in many of the soaps in the UK today: Carver out of the bill, the more I see it, the more I see it, well, if you have not seen them yet have a night with the video, do not forget to unearth the safety pin for your nose and the heavy black eye makeup and shave your head in the Mochanian style ... Enjoy
