In my humble opinion, this film did not receive the recognition it deserved. Robert Redford lives near me here in Provo, Utah, at Sundance. I enjoy most of his work, and this was my favorite. I feel that more people have not appreciated it. My grandmother was an avid reader and read the book years before it came out on the big screen. He gave it to me to read after having watched the movie together. The film and the book touched an emotional point inside my heart, and I was crying for several days after watching the movie. Sometimes love is not enough to keep our loved ones from hurting themselves. We see this in our own family relationships, but our love and our families and their stories endure through generations of time. The cinematography was perfect and impressive. I was impressed by her beauty and how well she gave life to the words of the author of the book, Norman Maclean: "But when I am alone in the gloom of the canyon, everything seems to exist, to vanish into a being with my soul and memories. of the Big Black Foot River, and a four-beat rhythm, and the hope that a fish will grow ... Eventually, all things melt into one and a river runs through it.The river was cut by the great flood of the world and runs over rocks in the basement of time, in some of the rocks there are eternal raindrops, under the rocks are the words, and some of the words are theirs.The waters chase me ... "These words, taken from the book and spoken at the end of the film (by Robert Redford who narrates as Norman Maclean), are basically scriptures, in my opinion. Any possible defect that the film may have is eclipsed by the beauty and grace of history and cinematography. It was beautiful!
