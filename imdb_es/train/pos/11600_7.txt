William Hurt may no longer be an American morning idol, but he still has quite good taste in B series film projects. Here, he plays a hazardous waste cleaner with a tragic past that tracks a perennial loser in career, played by the beautiful former child Weller, who has been contaminated with a deadly poison. The current pretty boy Hardy Kruger Jr, possibly more handsome than his father, appears as Weller's arrogant boss in a horrible sequence in a chemical production plant that sets the story in motion. Natasha McElhone is a somewhat extravagant government agent investigating the incident and providing an inevitable love interest and great brazenness for the wounded hero. Michael Brandon appears to play a slobbering guy who does not need prisoners and you can not wait. The Coca-Cola company wins the prize for the placement of products for the year 2000 since the soda appears throughout the production, filmed with much love in a picture of a winter postcard from Hungary.
