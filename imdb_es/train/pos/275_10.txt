This film begins with a family that went in different directions and their teenage daughter Martha MacIssac (Olivia Dunne) was very much in love with Joe MacLeod, (Zack). The mother is played by Mitzi Kapture, (Jill Dunne), who suddenly approaches her daughter and Zack kissing and then all kinds of problems seem to arise. Jill Dunne has a husband who always travels or moves away from home quite often. There are also major problems that occur when the family decides to go on a camping trip that their daughter Olivia does not like and simply can not adapt to sleeping outdoors and requires that a tent be kept for all insects. In many ways, Olivia has an outstanding performance since the teenager and Nick Mancuso (Richard Grant) give her a great support role as a hotel owner. This movie will keep you guessing how it will end and you will enjoy a movie full of horror and terror. Enjoy
