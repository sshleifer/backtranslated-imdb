I had seen this movie by Ralph Bakshi (Wizards, Hey Good Lookin '), one night ago on www.afrovideo.org, and I did not see anything racial (I'm not stupid), I admit that the character designs are a bit rude and unacceptable today, but I think it's a very, very urban satire and retelling of Uncle Remus's old stories that American black culture created up to the main characters and the glaring salute to "The Tar Baby" and "The Briar Patch". These are not intolerant stories, of course, but cultural icons created by American blacks, and I, being a white woman, read and love those stories. And I also found an interesting insight into black culture in Harlem, New York in the 70s. <br /> <br /> Well, to get to the heart of this movie's story: This movie is a live concert. action / animated film, which starts in live action with a partner named Sampson (Barry White) and Preacher (Charles Gordone) rush to help his friend, Randy (Philip Michael Thomas) escape from prison, but are arrested for an obstacle and End in a shootout with the police. As he waits for them, Randy reluctantly listens to his escaped companion Pappy (Scatman Crothers) as he begins to tell Randy the lively story of Brother Rabbit, a young man who has just arrived in the big city who quickly rises from the dark to rule everything. Harlem; You know, for me Rabbit, Bear and Fox are animal versions of Randy, Sampson and the Preacher. An abstract juxtaposition of stylized animation and live action sequences, the film is a graphic and condemning satire of prevalent stereotypes in the 70s? racial, ethnic and other <br /> <br /> So anyway, it's another GOOD Bakshi movie; And should we sweep movies like this under the carpet? pretend that they never exist? Hmmm ... I think it would be a shame; I think we should watch these films interact, and learn about what happens back then, to what extent we have arrived since then.
