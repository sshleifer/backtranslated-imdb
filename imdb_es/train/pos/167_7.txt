"Dance, Fools, Dance" is one of Crawford-Gable's first vehicles since 1931. Crawford plays Bonnie Jordan, a wealthy young woman whose life consists of parties, alcoholic beverages and taking off her clothes to jump off a yacht and go swimming. All this ends when her father dies and leaves her and her brother (William Blakewell) penniless. Bonnie gets a job in a newspaper with the name of Mary Smith; his brother goes to work for the smugglers. The boss is Jake Luva, played by Clark Gable while playing another thief. Later, of course, he would become a romantic hero, but in the early 1930s, MGM used him as a bad guy. Unaware that her brother is involved in illegal activities, Bonnie is caught before Luva. <br /> <br /> Gable and Crawford formed a great team. His facial expressions are a bit wild, but that, along with his dancing, is one of the things that makes the movie fun. Look for Cliff Edwards, the voice of Jiminy Cricket, like Bert. <br /> <br /> It's always interesting to watch pre-coded movies, and "Dance, Fools, Dance" is no exception.
