Most of the comments have been positive, but I would like to add that viewers should also focus on sets. The stage designer used a lot of beautiful art deco treatments along with beautiful buildings, stairs, doors, furniture, etc. It is worth paying attention to The film is directed by characterization and symbolism that is very rich. All the gangster actors were chosen - it was like seeing old friends and it was a delight. The dialogue was fun at times, but sometimes it was forced and I guess it was meant to be like that. This is a movie of a movie buff. It was made by people, for people who love the environment. Do not miss it.
