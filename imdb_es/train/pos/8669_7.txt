Yes, unlike some of the commentators here, you are not organizing a class war and you do not mind seeing the lives of other people who are quite successful, extroverted, bohemian (open-mouthed) and not very English at a party and get into everything As a result, this is not a bad movie, it is closer to European cinema than an imitation of the usual crap of the United States ... I think that the minimum sound design and the cheap camera is a conscious decision in place of bad filming. I defended this, the film is not worse as a result, and puts the focus on the cast, some of which are really good (Kate Hardie, I think that's her name, since the sarcastic drunk is spot on). One exception is David Baddiel, who should never be allowed to appear on serious things! It's light, and we're not looking for this kind of anatomizing shit about the relationship in this country, but if you do not have real friends to go to a party, then you could do worse than sit and watch. is.
