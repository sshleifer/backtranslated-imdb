Ok, basically this is a popcorn science fiction movie, but from the beginning it's obvious that it's been directed very intelligently. You can count on the 10 clich√©s that the film is building, but it only offers about three of them, and a couple of them have a twist that lets you know once again that the director has not assumed you are an idiot. The performance of Kurt Russell is truly excellent and provides a depth of character that is surprising and rewarding. Recommended if you just saw something really stupid and want to rebuild your faith.
