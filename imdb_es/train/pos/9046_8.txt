The first time I saw Jake Gyllenhaal in Jarhead (2005) was a while ago and, since then, I have been watching each of his films that reach my radar screen. Like Clive Owen, it has an intensity (and even looks a bit like Owen) that oozes from the screen. I'm sure that, if he gets some carnivorous papers, one day he'll win an Oscar ... <br /> <br /> That's not to denigrate this movie at all. <br /> <br /> It's a good story, with very credible people (well, it's based on the author's early scams with rockets), a great cast? Chris Cooper is always good, and Laura Dern is always on my watch list? with the right mix of humor, poignancy, emotion ... and the great soundtrack with so many old rock n roll for the feet to touch. <br /> <br /> But, this movie had a very special meaning for me: in 1957, I was the same age as Homer Hickham; like him, I watched the stars of the night to see Sputnik as he slipped through the darkness; Like Homer, I also experimented with rockets in my yard and used exactly the same chemicals for fuel; And like Homer, I also had most of my attempts to end up in an explosive disaster! What fun it was ... <br /> <br /> Although I did not achieve its great heights (metaphorical and physical). But, that's what you discover when you watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Sure, it's a basic family movie, but it seems to be a dying race these days. Take the time to see it, with the children: everyone will have a lot of laughs.
