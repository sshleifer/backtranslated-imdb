This was generally the advice of producer Alexander Korda in many of his subordinates; The film is credited with three directors, but in truth Alex, Zoltan Korda and William Cameron Menzies helped, pushing six. <br /> <br /> For John Kobal's 1987 book, "The 100 Best Movies," his studio of 81 film critics saw the Baghdad thief reach 55th place. Closer examination reveals that only Jose Luis Guarner, John Russell Taylor and Kobal himself voted in favor of the image, but their high places were enough to take her near the middle of the road. <br /> <br /> The outbreak of the In the Second World War, the production of the film changed in England and the United States, and finally it was completed in 1940 and won three technical prizes. Like Citizen Kane, it is somehow a movie that you could admire instead of love. <br /> <br /> Special effects, outstanding for the time being, are still reasonable and, in fact, delay you if you squint. But it is not so much its effectiveness as the audacity of inventions. Among them is a funny horse, built from a kit model that, when a key is inserted in its back, begins to fly. There is also a killer toy of the goddess Kali with six arms (perhaps a single woman with two women sitting behind her) and a giant spider looking quite horrible. It also impresses the climax with its wonderful flying carpet. But the most memorable thing has to be Rex Ingram, who appears as, in a magnificent moment of cinematographic presumption, a genius almost a thousand feet tall! Ingram interprets the genius as a rather threatening creature, and adds an element of danger to the proceedings. And look at the moment when you have been tricked into going back to your bottle! <br /> <br /> John Justin does well as the Arab king who, for some strange reason, has an English accent and a rigid upper lip. Sabu, the amazingly muscular 15-year-old, is almost a namesake of Abu, a very cocky thief. After crossing with the evil Jaffer (Conrad Veidt), Justin finds himself blind and Abu becomes a dog. When it seems that the rest of the film will be told in a flashback through the perspective of the blind Ahmed (Justin), we find that in the middle of the film we catch up and the adventure continues. In truth, the second half is, somehow, better, full of larger incidents and more fantastic in nature. <br /> <br /> Three small songs dot the piece, although as the film lasts 100 minutes, it seems softer. flavoring instead of a real ingredient; I would not classify this as a musical. Everything is very funny; Justin and June Duprez are the love interest for moms and dads, Veidt is the villain of boos and Abu is the youthful and irrepressible thief. It may take a while to get into the somewhat old-fashioned mentality and exaggerated melodrama of the English movies of the 1940s, but once you've sat down for the first half hour or so, this movie really appeals to you. Highly recommended
