['I do not think I have to tell you the story. Because that&#39;s how it&#39;s been told for years and years. So I will only share my feelings. The first time I saw Cinderella was when I was five years old. From then on I was a Disney kid in a good way. The animation now seems childish and outdated, but that&#39;s part of its charm now. Now, in the era of High School Musical and computer generated images, it seems that people have forgotten the genius and magical essence of early Disney movies. Luckily I was born before that, so I was introduced to this classic. And it seems that no matter how old I am, I go back to see that five-year-old child who is watching VHS. What is Disney&#39;s true magic?']
