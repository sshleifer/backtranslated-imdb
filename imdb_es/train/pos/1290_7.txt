Yes, I remember this one! Many years since I saw it really. The story was totally surreal, but nevertheless great! What anyone who qualifies and reviews the films should keep in mind is what the respective film points to. It is the same with "First Kid", which follows a similar pattern. Certain movies, like this one here, only point to simple and funny nonsense. Such films can not be qualified from the point of view of a hypercritical critic. Of course, these films lack quality, lack a sophisticated plot, very often they lack first class acting, but if they fulfill their main premise, that's fine. I do not have this movie here on my all-time favorite list, but I still found it funny, I had some very nice sequences and I made a good story. Brian Bonsall is a smart actor anyway.
