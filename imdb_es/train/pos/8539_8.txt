Touching and sad movie. It portrays the trials and tribulations of a writer trying to come to terms with the paralysis caused by a cycling accident. The film focuses on his relationship with his married lover, who is often very hostile, and his interactions with other accident victims, particularly a black cyclist and a white supremacist. The film is often humorous, often sad and always believable. Get out of the Kleenex box and see this on a nice Sunday afternoon with your partner.
