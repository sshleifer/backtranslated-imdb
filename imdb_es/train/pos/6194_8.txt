Henry Fool surprised me. I did not expect him to entertain and entertain as well or as strongly as he did. Fay Grim continues to be surprised because it provides a solid continuation of a story that does not seem to need it. However, once the viewer sees the first 20 minutes of the film, he becomes blindingly aware that this is one of the BEST sequels of a brilliant independent film. At least as good as Ginger Snaps Back, if not better. <br /> <br /> I am a little disappointed that Jeff Goldblum's part is so small, but I am happy that it is part of this short journey. He is convincing and charming as Agent Fulbright. Also a delight is Liam Aiken, who portrays very well Ned Grim, the son of Fay and Henry. <br /> <br /> This movie is a pleasure for many reasons. I am pleased, for example, to discover that Henry is not really the loser he seems (for Fool's end), and discover that he is, in fact, a genius ... well, that's really charming. stroke of the pen <br /> <br /> I hope you do a third ... like the end of the trilogy. It seems that it is missing. They should give right to Ned Fool Grim and it should be Liam looking for his father, to validate the amazing change in his mother and the sense of almost genius that he feels that flows into him. Assuming, of course, that Fay continues to conceal many of the most important facts from his son, in relation to his father. It seems that you have to do it. I would buy it. <br /> <br /> Even with more action, this is not yet an action movie. It's more drama and intrigue ... a mystery, more or less. I will see him often. <br /> <br /> Rate an 8.3 / 10 of ... <br /> <br /> the Devil :.
