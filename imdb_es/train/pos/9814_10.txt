This Peabody Award-winning episode is one of the highlights of the first season in which a holodeck malfunction catches Captain Picard, Beverly, Data and a Starfleet historian named Waylan on the San Francisco stage in 1930. This episode is a tribute to the "Halcon Maltese" by Raymond Chandler, where Patrick Stewart takes on the role of Humphrey Bogart, complete with fedora and raincoat. The office itself is almost an exact replica of the one that appears in Bogey's "Halcon Maltese". <br /> <br /> This episode also briefly introduces us to a mysterious race of insects called Jarada that communicates mainly with a high-pitched buzzing sound. Communication with this alien race is difficult, and it is up to Picard to communicate with this race in their native language so that negotiations and diplomacy can finally begin. The best part of this episode, however, is the appearance of the famous Hollywood actor B Lawrence Tierney in the role of mobster Cyrus Redblock. He was such a handsome man in the 1940s. Oh well ...
