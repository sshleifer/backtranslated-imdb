As a movie, this hardly qualifies as a 4, but for movie fans of the 1940s, it's almost a must-see and scores a 9 as a variety show. I was surprised to see the presence of Richard (Captain Midnight) Webb, who plays the Colonel in charge of the event. What surprised me was the impressive performance of Doris Day. Outside of 'Calamity Jane', I've never seen her put a better song here. Randolph Scott is also memorable, even if he does not see much time on screen. It's been a while since I saw the movie, but I was almost certain that Humphrey Bogart appeared. With so many familiar faces, it's hard to keep track of him. If you ever appear on a TV station near you, be sure to watch the Doris Day sequence, at least! <br /> <br />
