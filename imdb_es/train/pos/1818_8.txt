I saw this movie when I was about 8 years old and I liked it, but it was not until I saw it again at the age of 13 that I really understood it for what it is; a caricature about a criminal dog with a true heart of gold "adopts" a girl to exploit her for her talent to talk to animals. The star dog, Charlie B. Barkin, is killed by his formal business partner, Carface, (which is absolutely diabolical by the way). His soul then goes to another place other than Heaven only to find a gold watch that is really the time of his life, that Charlie, being the cunning but adorable cad that steals and rewinds, sends him back to Earth . Once back on Earth, Charlie seeks revenge on the evil Carface. This is how he meets young Anne-Marie, the lonely little orphan who can talk to the animals to whom Charlie plans to cheat for his talents to return to his enemy Carface. But the scoundrel Charlie really cares about the young Anne-Marie and his plans, since he must decide to do what is right after Anne-Marie discovers what his "best friend" Charlie has been using her to win money for a new and better casino for dogs. Now he must rescue her from the dreaded Carface. I still love this movie even at 22 years old. The idea and the plot really are quite different and original from that of many other animated films. I especially like the idea that a dog plays the role of villain for once. Carface was even better than him in the sequel to All Dogs go to Heaven. In that photo he appeared quite doubtful of his villain role.
