This movie was nice but for the wrong reasons. The coordination of the action sequences is laughable and makes the movie have some fun moments. Robert Ginty and Fred Williamson have a memorable scene together near the end, where Williamson says to Ginty: "Surely you move, friend!". I enjoyed this movie only for Ginty and Williamson, but not for the plot that must have been written on the back of a napkin in four lines and the rest is very likely. A film with more than 30 parts only has a list of credits of approximately 10. It seems strange that nobody else has credit in the movie, maybe they had some idea of ​​what the finished product would look like. The only thing that has this movie is that it is quite violent, so it tripled with Fred Williamson and Robert Ginty for a movie that is worth seeing.
