I give this movie 7 out of 10 because the villains were interesting in their roles and the unknown batwoman creates an interesting "guess who" game. The movie, however, needs Robin more in it. He appeared in the film at the beginning and sporadically throughout the rest. I always thought that the new animated series did not do justice to the new character of Robin, let alone Knightwing. This movie simply continues that bad tradition. The film devotes too much time to Bruce Wayne and his romance, which would not be so bad in a movie if the romance was not so incredible. It's still a good movie if you're a Batman fan and I recommend you see it.
