The Booth takes a totally new twist on its typical J-horror movie. This film puts you in the skin of the protagonist of the story. The director wants you to see what the protagonist sees and thinks. <br /> <br /> The story is about the perception of the people who work, live and love our protagonist, and how he perceives the people around him. An outdated DJ booth radio station. The story takes off the layers of the main character like an onion in flash-backs as the film runs its course, and from it we learned that things are not always what they seem. The film was developed mainly in a small and old-fashioned studio of a radio station with a very bad history, where the main character was forced to broadcast his talk show because the radio station was in the process of relocation. It is from this confined space that this film thrives and makes you feel very claustrophobic and very paranoid. At the moment that our protagonist can not determine the strange events in the old studio were caused by ghosts or some conspiracy of his co-workers or everything was in his mind. What I like about this film is that the filmmakers make you see through the eyes of the main character and make you as paranoid as the protagonist did. This movie is a very smart, rather short, 76-minute movie.
