I saw this movie at the Toronto International Film Festival. It is not as salacious as it sounds, this is a documentary in three parts (each episode is 50 minutes) with the Slavic Slovenian philosopher / psychoanalyst Slavoj Zizek. Zizek takes us on a journey through many classic films, exploring themes of sexuality, fantasy, morality and mortality. It was directed by Sophie Fiennes, of the multi-talented clan Fiennes (she is sister of the actors Ralph and Joseph). <br /> <br /> I enjoyed it a lot, although I think it will be even more enjoyable on DVD, since there are so many ideas to be digested. The Freudian and Lacanian analysis can be quite heavy and seeing the entire series at once became somewhat disorienting at the end of two and a half hours. It did not help that a badly advised coffee and the possession of a bladder caused me some discomfort during the last hour. <br /> <br /> My only real problem is that Zizek chose films that were quite obviously full of Freudian themes. He spends a lot of time in the films of Hitchcock and David Lynch, not exactly masters of subtlety. I would have liked to see him try to support his theories using a wider range of movies, although in reality I just say that I would like to see parts four and five and six. <br /> <br /> Zizek is very funny, and part of the humor was watching him present what amounted to a lecture while inserting himself into the real scenes of some of the films he is discussing. So, for example, we see him in a motorboat on his way to Bodega Bay (from The Birds of Hitchcock) or sitting in the basement of the Bates motel (from Psycho). Which does not mean that his theories are not provocative. Even when I found myself at odds with him, it definitely made me think a little more deeply about the movies. Which is exactly what he is trying to achieve.
