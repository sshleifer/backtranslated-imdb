Felix Unger (Jack Lemmon) has just been abandoned by his wife, because she is one of the most annoying and neurotic people in the world. Suicide is his way out, but it seems he can not make it work, so he goes to his friends' house. Oscar Madison (Walther Matthau) also recently divorced and lives in the singles heaven. Smoking, gambling, hitting the girls, eating out and never cleaning is a paradise for him. Well, with the suicide attempts, Oscar decides to let Felix move. At the beginning, it is a match made in heaven. Felix cooks and cleans and helps Oscar pay his pension on time, but soon Oscar faces the women and Felix (who in today's world would probably be gay) is not ready to move on. They invite a couple of British birds and find Felix so tender that soon they and Felix are crying and chatting about their family life, leaving Oscar denied. That's right, it explodes and throws it out, but Felix is ​​not as helpless as he seems, and will soon have the advantage. My favorite quote "You leave me little notes on my pillow, I told you 158 times that I can not stand little notes on my pillow." We have run out of cereals. F.U. "It took me three hours to discover that F.U. was Felix Ungar!" Based on a work by Neil Simon (who also wrote the script), he has a certain theater feel. Set and the deal and it looks like a game (for better or for worse). Lemmon and Mathau have excellent comic chemistry and have appeared in the films Grumpier Old Men and Out to Sea, repeating the same meticulous / sluggish roles, but with different names (to avoid royalty problems, I'm sure). <br /> <br /> This movie is like strawberries dipped in chocolate. The chocolate is soft, sweet and rich, the strawberry is sour, juicy and bright red (unless you have those unpleasant greenish tones). They are almost polar opposites, but together, the contrasts stand out from each other and make a wonderful dessert. 7/10 <br /> <br /> http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies
