Dennis Hopper and JT Walsh stole the show here. Cage and Boyle are fine, but what gives this neo-noir its juice is the creepy and violent character of Hopper and the cunning of JT Walsh. <br /> <br /> A vagabond is confused with a hit man and tries to do a little. He pulled out the dough, but it went through his head. <br /> <br /> I found a strange parallel in the opening scene of this movie, when Cage enters a trailer in Wyoming to do drilling work, with the help of his friend ... and the opening scene in Brokeback Mountain, when the character does the same! But that is another story. <br /> <br /> Dennis Hopper is at his best here ... arrogant, one-step villain, furious and explosively violent. JT Walsh (RIP) is also great as the man with a dark past, who tries to live legitimately (well, almost). <br /> <br /> Here there are only 4 real characters, except for the hard one. Deputy in the city of Red Rock, Wyoming. The first turn impacts from the beginning, and from there it's a nice neo-noir adventure in a small sleepy city. Satisfactory. 8 pts.
