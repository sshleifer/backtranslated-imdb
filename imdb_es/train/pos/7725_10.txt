The first time I saw this movie was when it originally came out. I was about 9 years old. old and I found this film highly entertaining and very scary, and unlike any other movie I had seen so far. <br /> <br /> BASIC PLOT: An expedition is sent from Earth to the fourth planet of Altair, a great star of the main sequence in the Aquilae constellation to find out what happened to a settler colony that landed twenty years before and had not received news since then. <br /> <br /> THEME: An inferior civilization (namely, ours) comes into contact with the remnants of a very advanced extraterrestrial civilization, the Krell, 200,000 years old. The "seed" of the destruction of one civilization is transmitted to another, without knowing it at the beginning. The theme of this movie is very good against evil. <br /> <br /> The first time I saw this movie with my brother was when it originally came out. I was just a kid and the tiger scenes really scared me like the battle scenes with the force of the invisible creature. I was also surprised at how the real things looked in the movie. <br /> <br /> What really captures my adult attention is the truth of the "forbidden knowledge" of the film and how relevant this will be when we do it. (if ever) come into contact with an advanced civilization (alien) much more developed than ourselves today. Advanced technology and responsibility seem to go hand in hand. We must do the work by ourselves to acquire the knowledge along with the wisdom of how to use advanced technology. This is, in my opinion, the great moral of the film. <br /> <br /> I learned in graduate school that "knowledge is power" at best, in fact, it's not right! Knowledge is a "potential" power depending on how it is applied (... if applied, at all). [It's not what you know, but how you use what you know!] <br /> <br /> The general The impact of this film may well be made at some point in Mankind's future. That knowledge in itself is not enough, we must, we MUST have the wisdom on which knowledge depends to really control our own destiny Or we will end up like the Krell in the film, simply missing. <br /> <br /> Many thanks to those who responded to the previous versions of this article with comments and corrections, they are all very appreciated! I hope you are as entertained with this story as I have been for the last 40 years ... <br /> <br /> Rating: 10 out of 10 stars
