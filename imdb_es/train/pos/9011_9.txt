I found this movie by accident, but I'm happy I did it. The performance of Kenneth Branagh was close to stealing this movie from Helena Bonham Carter, but his strong chemistry together contributed to a much more enjoyable film. This movie brought to mind the excellent films that Branagh made with Emma Thompson. The change of Carter's star here as a disabled young woman looking to complete herself was as good a performance as I've seen of a female protagonist in a long time. It is difficult to portray a disabled person, but basically with only his eyes to show his pain for his situation in life, he made it so believable. If this film had come out after the current wave of movies with beautiful women who "harass" themselves for roles (Charlize Theron, Halle Berry), I'm sure Carter would have had a strong regard for an Oscar. If you run into this cable movie late at night like I did, trust me, it's worth losing sleep.
