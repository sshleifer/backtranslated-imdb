This is widely seen in Australia as one of the best police dramas ever produced here ... and for my money, anywhere. It is raw, gritty, the characters are real, the situations are credible and do not stray from the darkest side of life that policemen and criminals face every day, victims, lawyers and other people in their different orbits. <Br /> <br /> This program lasted 2 seasons and was suspended because the program did not sell well abroad. We all regret their loss: however, like Fawlty Towers, we can respect this as a limited series of uniform quality.
