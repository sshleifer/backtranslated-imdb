It all starts with a series of robberies of seemingly unrelated objects in a student shelter on Hickory Road, London. Concerned about her sister, who is the housekeeper there, Miss Lemon asks Hercule Poirot to investigate the matter. He agrees, but soon the stakes increase when a girl, who had admitted that she was responsible for most (not all) of the robberies, was found murdered. <br /> <br /> "Hickory Dickory Dock" is a solid brain exercise, without being as desensitized as "One, Two, Buckle My Shoe". The murder, the theft and the smuggling of diamonds are the crimes involved, and the final turn that unites all is revealed only in the last 2 minutes! The characters are interesting, particularly the psychology student Colin McNabb and the mysterious American girl Sally Finch, the inspector Japp has his funny moments (maybe the closest thing to this "bathroom mood"), and Miss Lemon has one more part integral The history of the usual.
