Very interesting. The big turn was not as big a shock as maybe they had expected it and it was very outdated, but it made my mind work. It really made me think of a world without vegetation or livestock and it made me appreciate the world in which I live much more. Charlton Heston does a good job, like all the supporting characters, and it was a very realistic movie that surprised. Sometimes it lacked direction and many of the adjustments and the background needed more explanation, but it was still a surprisingly good and intelligent movie. The main flaw I could find was that I did not want the movie to end when it did, I would have liked to see what happened next. <br /> <br /> 7/10
