He ran from 1959-1973. It's more than its longevity that says a lot for this series. It is also that he survived the changes in fashion and taste of the 50s, the psychedelic 60s and remained popular in the 70s. <br /> <br /> I remember repetitions of this series. It was a successful combination of all its elements of stories, cast and productions that made it exceptional. Lorne Green had her iconic defining character in this series. Its appeal was through generations. All the members of the family could enjoy this. Morale is balanced with violence, humor with seriousness A series of cartoons was made as a result of its impact. The shame is that this series is no longer repeated and many will not know its meaning.
