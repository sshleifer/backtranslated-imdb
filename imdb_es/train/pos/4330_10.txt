<br /> <br /> "Bleak House" is unquestionably the best adaptation of a Charles Dickens novel that has been put on screen. Always one of my favorite novels, I was extremely satisfied with this Mini TV Series. The late and great Denholm Elliot was chosen as the noble John Jardyce and Diana Rigg was pure perfection as the condemned Ladty's Dtylock. The film captures the essence of the Dickens era and is extremely faithful to the book, since it only makes minor cuts in the plot that do not affect the story. Especially a brilliant, moving and atmospheric film.
