This movie has several things in its favor. It's a "feel good" story. The characters and actors are friendly, realistic and present excellent performances. The most important thing, I think, is that Dennis Quaid knows how to hold on and throw a baseball. Robert Redford looked good when pitching and hitting a bat in "The Natural," and so did Kevin Costner in "For Love of the Game" and "Bull Durham." In "Major League," Tom Berenger and Charlie Sheen seemed to know what They were doing it, but many others did not, and that image was pure nonsense, and not very funny. <br /> <br /> So many previous baseball movies, even where the stories can be interesting, present such a lack of skill. of baseball on the part of leaders, they were ridiculous in this regard.In "The Stratton Story" and "Strategic Air Command," Jimmy Stewart looked as credible as a professional baseball player, as his overweight, not athletic, old uncle in the softball game in the family reunion Other virile and physically robust stars (for example, Gary Cooper as Lou Gehrig, Robald Reagan as Grover Cleveland Alexander and Dan Dailey as Dizzy Dean) also exhibited a baseball skill rating that would put them in the final rounds while "choosing" for a game at Sunday's picnic (even if it's mixed, and even if your uncle was involved). <br /> <br /> The scenes of the Quaid high school team he coached, those in which he attends his Devil Rays test and those with him playing in two minor leagues and in the American League, all They seem to be true. The participants are credible and capable. In addition, he is an attractive actor who always offers a suitable and talented characterization (except, to a certain extent, some of his "exaggerated" scenes and his forced accent, in his interpretation of Jerry Lee Lewis). But it is definitely targeted here, and this movie is a "9", as good or better, as any other of this genre, except "The Natural".
