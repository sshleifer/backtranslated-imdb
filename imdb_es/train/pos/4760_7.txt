Well, I gave this movie a 7. It was better than "Thirdspace" but not as good as "In the Beginning" when it comes to B5 movies. I really think that the television series did a much better job in general with special effects and character representation. Hopefully the producers and the cast will bring the next "Crusade" series to the B5 standards.
