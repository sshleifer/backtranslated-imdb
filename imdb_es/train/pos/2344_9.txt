I am one of those people who usually watch programs and keep my feelings about a program private. However, Pushing Daisies is my exception. I was curious about the program of the commercials that were broadcast, which gave an idea of ​​the premise of the show. At first I was skeptical about it, especially after the end of Six Feet Under was still in my head. Here we go again, I thought. I saw the first, second, third and all the other episodes. Woohoo! In the first place, I thought that it took the subject of death and that it presented itself in an acceptable way to be morbid. The characters were attractive and I like the idea that Ned, the main character, could not literally touch the love of his life, Chuck without the consequences of his death. <br /> <br /> Most characters crave things they can not have. In addition to Ned and Chuck, Olive yearns for Ned. Lily and Vivian long for their niece Chuck and Emerson always longs for the monetary rewards of the mysterious deaths they solve. I think the characters are perfect and credible. I like how Emerson, who is black, moves away from the rest of the characters since he was African-American; I like the subtle cultural humor that sometimes comes from him. <br /> <br /> In short, this visual fairy tale is one of the most valuable pieces of entertainment I've seen in the 2007 season. I think the show has enough romance for the romantics and enough "who did it" for lovers of mystery I only wish that the writers return to work, so that the program can continue to evolve.
