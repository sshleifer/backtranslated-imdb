Dinner could be, in my opinion, the best adult film production of all time. It is produced in such an exquisite way and the actors represent their roles in an excellent way. The kitchen scene starring Yvonne and Juli Ashton is magnificent. The use of butter and milk really makes the scene. Also, the medical office scene is well done. The campfire scene is full of pleasant action, although the choice of actors in this scene is questionable. Asia Carrera's performance at the junkyard scene is incredible, but who would expect anything less from it. The final scene is a bit more used in adult films, but it is classic. I would recommend this film to all fans of adult movies and casual viewers. Run to your video store and pick it up today.
