['I like the battle of good and evil. I liked Eddie in this movie better than any movie he made. He was not the intelligent, self-important, he knows everything he usually plays. Shows heart and a more humble humor. The fact that it shows that there are more strange things in heaven and on earth than we can think of gives me hope.']
