Raggedy Ann & Andy is the first movie I saw in theaters. My dad took my sister and me, and the funny thing is that when we got home, they asked us "what do you want to do now?" And we said we want to see Raggedy Ann & Andy again! hahaha, and my dad really took us back to the theater to see it again, at least I remember that. I was five years old at that time. <br /> <br /> This movie was pretty scary for a five-year-old child. The scene with the giant ocean of sweets and the scene of the hypnotic camel ... I do not remember much of this movie, of course, the beginning was magical, and some scenes: I wish I could find it again, and I will probably look for it now. <br /> <br /> I remember that I loved Raggedy Ann and Andy.
