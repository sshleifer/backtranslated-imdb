The first time I saw this movie was when it was released in the USA. UU In 1984. I have seen it many, many times since then. What impresses me about the film is the incorporation of essay art into the lives of the characters and vice versa. Throughout the film, the two intertwine and, at times, one is never quite sure if one is seeing the life of the characters or a scene from an essay. This continues until the climax of the movie. All these years later, my friends and I still love to debate if "Carmen" is really stabbed at the end. From the reactions of the other characters, to stylized murder, it is open to debate. The passion of dance, the quality of the performance, the love for art and the brilliance of the performances combine to create an excellent film that, once again, combines and twists the line between life and art.
