I thought The Sentinel was going to be a mediocre movie. When I finally saw her, I was surprised. The movie is not very good, but it is very funny and the action scenes are very well done. This movie reminded me of television. series like 24 or Alias. It's very similar to that series and it also reminded me of Wolfgang Petersen's thriller In the Line of Fire. If you're going to expect one of the most original and one of the best thrillers in the world. History of the movies, you will be disappointed. But if you go with low expectations, you will enjoy The Sentinel. <br /> <br /> Rating: 7
