After crawling it for half a year, I finally found a copy and it was not disappointing. <br /> <br /> Not disappointing because I'm one of those SMAP fans who need to see all their jobs and I finally got to see Goro's so-called hot movie. But I could not believe that Goro was forced to make a film as such. In his respectable personality now, I am sure he is thrilled to have made this film. However, they found the perfect person to be embarrassed, uncomfortable and half depressed most of the time. <br /> <br /> Man, I still can not believe that I made this movie ... I had to cover my eyes in many parts that do not think I really made a movie like this ... hahahaha ... <br /> <br /> But I'm glad I saw it. Thank God it has grown ...
