I think this show is definitely the best show. Jessica Alba does a great job on it. Michael Weatherly also does an amazing job, as well as the rest of the cast. The show is very interesting and they have wonderful stories and their tricks are incredible. It's like watching a 1-hour movie. Definitely worth seeing.
