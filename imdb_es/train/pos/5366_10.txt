I'm sitting here in November of 2006 and I still can not stop talking about this movie. The best films of Arnold arrived in a span of 4 to 5 years. Running Man, Predator, and Total Recall (1990). The 3 are incredible. Arnold's cheese line in this movie will make you laugh on more than one occasion. I think the acting in this movie is surprisingly good, as was the case with Predator and Totall Recall. They did a great job of trying to make the futuristic scenes, as they are expected to take place in 2017, but you can not help but laugh at the 80's style haircuts on the men and women of the crowd and the television monitors. The Running Man study, which we all know here in 2006, is in the process of coming out with the appearance of the flat screen and the high definition televisions. Also, the computer graphics of the game presentation "The Running Man" would not look like this in 2017. However, the story is absolutely fantastic. Not once during this movie did I want to get up and not worry about the end, which is something I often do with today's movies. I really believe that Arnold's performance is much better than he is credited with. Now I would not have elected him governor, but that's California for you. Buzzsaw, Dynamo, Fireball, SubZero are also fantastic "stalkers" and I think the producers do not try to exaggerate the fight scenes. When the stalker is dead ... he is dead. It does not last 20 minutes each. The scenes of the harasser are fast and entertaining, but they do not try to exaggerate. I give this movie a 10/10 and it comes from someone who does not enjoy many movies these days. If you get the right actors and the right story, the futuristic graphic screens you would see in 2006 are not important or necessary.
