I do not know why people always want a deeper meaning in movies or consider them useless. <br /> <br /> What about the simple act of entertainment? Something in which Morgan Freeman stands out. He has the opportunity to show a little. Paz Vega, his co-star, gets a boost in his career and Brad Silberling gets a name to attract people to watch his movie. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a good movie. A little humor, a bit of pathos, something bittersweet but nothing above. I got a special service from Jim Parsons as a receptionist at a construction company. When she looks at Freeman with adoration and says: "You make me want to be a woman." He is simply hilarious. The scene of the fight between Mrs. Vega, her ex-husband and her girlfriend is also wonderful. <br /> <br /> In short, it's a cute and charming movie that will make you smile. You could do much, much worse.
