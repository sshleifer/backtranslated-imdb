Now I've seen this movie three times, and every time I see it, it becomes more personal and more emotional to watch. <br /> <br /> The performance is incredible, which is not hard to believe since it's Daniel's Day. Lewis, who is an incredible actor. However, Brenda Fricker is the surprise surprise. Capture your heart as the mother of a physically disabled child, who can not walk or talk until he is in his teens. <br /> <br /> I can not say enough about the movie. but I will stop here. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys movies based on real events or who simply enjoy good dramas in general.
