This is one of my favorites, along with Mariette Hartley and Robert Lansing "Sandy" and the episodes of Agnes Moorhead-and-the-the-spacemen. <br /> <br /> It's an important shot, since mid-1961. in the long Cold War in which EE. UU she was involved. The scene of the battered city, the sparse dialogue of the almost hungry characters, their tattered uniforms and minimal action "says" everything: the absurdity of an ongoing conflict that threatens to destroy human life, modern civilization and everything that is sweet and redemptive about it. <br /> <br /> It is a "fable" because it was made at a time when events took place. in a different way, such as the second Berlin Crisis (spring of 1961) and the subsequent Cuban Missile Crisis (October 1962), it would actually have been a reasonable representation of one of the major cities in the United States, ruined and replete with few miserable survivors. I also see it as a "fable" because it is not only a preventive tale, but because it is the most redeeming of all our popular myths: it is a love story, set in an impossible situation and involving two highly misguided lovers.
