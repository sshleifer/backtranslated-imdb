It is difficult to see this movie without thinking about the television program it would become, especially if, like me, you like the television program more. But there is a lot to be said about the source. <br /> <br /> Oscar Madison (Walter Matthau) is a leading sports editor from New York City who lives alone in an eight-room apartment, a victim of divorce and his own. The obstinately neglected mentality. Enter your friend Felix Ungar (Jack Lemmon), who needs a place to live after his wife cast him out for his obstinately neatnik mentality. The result is a train crash and one of the most beloved film adaptations of a play by Neil Simon. <br /> <br /> First things first: I love that apartment! Poker table, novelty dart board, crooked photos of baseball players, empty drinks and beer containers, even a couple of Roman columns. It is a place where men can be children. Simon and director Gene Saks do a great job opening the set of the play, Oscar's living room, moving the action to the bedrooms and kitchen and giving more tension to the corners of Oscar and Felix to bounce. <br /> <br /> The family score of Neal Hefti was heard on the television program, but never as well orchestrated as here, in several different arrangements that make the action on the screen shoot up every time it is played. The real-time location work and the Manhattan night shots give the film a common energy to films filmed in that place and time ("Buddwing", "The World Of Henry Orient", "Midnight Cowboy", "Manchurian Candidate" , "Rosemary's Baby" etc.) <br /> <br /> Are Lemmon and Matthau too heavy compared to Tony Randall and Jack Klugman? To be fair, the film is meant to be a more serious issue, dealing with the rare condition of middle-aged divorce and the inherent frustration of not being able to make a relationship work. Simon has more in mind than entering Felix and Oscar in a game of "Password" or a battle of wit with Howard Cosell. But I do not know ... <br /> <br /> Both Lemmon and Matthau were excellent comedians that I enjoy watching especially in the middle of this movie as I often do in their separate films, but I never understood why they were. Considered as a great comedy team. Here, in their best-considered association, they seem to act in two different films; Lemmon in a comedy-drama and Matthau in a farce. Matthau is great at first, we love his teddy bear attitude around the poker table, but almost at the end of the film takes a turn like Jack Torrance in "The Shining", in reaction to Felix cleaning his apartment and serving tasty food for his friends in a way that totally alters the delicate balance of guilt. <br /> <br /> While the ending bothers me, the part that many see as the most discordant, the beginning, works well as I see it. Seeing Felix stumbling trying to commit suicide is not a great comedy, no, but it is a good way to get into a great comedy, to prepare ourselves with some real life pain before bringing warmth and laughter. (In addition, it has some great images of the most sown parts of the city). In the middle of the movie, this scene would have been a miscalculation, but it works as a way to establish Felix's torment and a feeling of great relief when he arrives we see Oscar and his poker friends fighting and fighting. <br /> <br /> That's where Simon's lines are so great. They are the underlying force of the movie. He gets the jokes exactly right and real, and still makes it fun. "I do not care if you talk, Felix, you have things to say, what scares me is that I'm starting to listen." The television show showed how wrong it is to assume that the movie is always better, in fact, the television show once made a good comment about "taking on" something, but the movie is a solid foundation and a joy in itself. . .
