I've always liked this great baseball movie! He has a good cast that includes two tremendous actors and two of my favorites, Danny Glover and Christopher Lloyd! Also in this film are Ben Johnson, Brenda Fricker, Big Tony Longo, Tony Dance and Matthew McConaughey! Also Jay O. Sanders and Dermot Mulroney! The film has great special effects and the acting of all the actors in the movie! The baseball scenes are all realistic! The music of the composer Randy Edelman is very good and fits very well to the film. Some of the actors that reminded me of the real personalities of baseball. The character of Ray Mitchell of Stoney Jackson reminded me of Royce Clayton, the character of McConaughey reminded me of Steve Finley and the commentator of Jay O. Sanders in My opinion resembled the look of Al Hrabosky today. This is a fantastic movie for non-baseball fans and I recommend this movie!
