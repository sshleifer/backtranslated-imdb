['This movie needs to be put on DVD. It was very fun and I loved it. Really, very cute and fun. It is not realistic, but it is not supposed to be. The only thing I did not like was that the girl trusted the boy too much. However, it represents the thinking of the time period. I have tried to get this movie for so long and it has not been available for the EE format. UU Only in the United Kingdom and will not be played on US DVD players. UU Sadly, it&#39;s a classic film that is overlooked! Believe it or not, but this movie could easily become a cult favorite, for all ages. Pity, we do not legalize certain things that could really save small countries or ours. Lindy is unsinkable, a positive character who makes lemonade with lemons. She is funny and charming. She stole the show!']
