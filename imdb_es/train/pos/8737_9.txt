Critically, people say that Antz is better. Antz is a good movie, but I enjoyed Bug's Life a little more. I can not remember a Pixar animation, apart from the two Toy Story movies, of which I was laughing so hard. The animation is clean, the story is original and does not preach. The voice-overs are what make this movie. Dave Foley is a serious ant that gets into many problems. Hopper is an excellent characterization of the always wonderful Kevin Spacey, just like Haydn Panettiere as Dot. There is also excellent support from Dennis Leary, David Hyde Pierce and Madeline Kahn, and I could go on and on. The script is fantastic, so funny and even sometimes moving. It lacks the social messages of Antz, but what we have is a solid entertainment like a rock. 9/10. Bethany Cox
