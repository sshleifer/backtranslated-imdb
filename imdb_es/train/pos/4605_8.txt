This is not only one of Jackie Chan's best films, but also one of the best kung fu movies of all time. <br /> <br /> We have come to expect follies and fast and creative action in Chan movies, and this sets the benchmark for others to follow. It's two hours of pure entertainment, which impresses throughout the process. <br /> <br /> In addition to the excellent action, we have a viable history and credible characters, with Chan taking what seems to be a more western approach to writing, mixing the eastern resolution methods (ie, kicking asses). <br /> <br /> In general, it is fun, serious, entertaining and novel. A must for any fan of kung-fu, while at the same time remains accessible to the wider reaches of the film community.
