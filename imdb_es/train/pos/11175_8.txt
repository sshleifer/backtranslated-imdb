Very often, with the adaptations of Stephen King, you only get a collection of characters reciting dialogues from the books. This really captures the heart of the book. Maybe because they do NOT use large pieces of text directly from the book, but it's a bit more like an improvement on the events in the story. A big part of his success is Miko Hughes as Baby Gage. Dale Midkiff and Denise "Tasha Yar" Crosby really act like their parents. There is a scene in which Louis is hugging Gage, and they are very natural together. Fred Gwynne is wonderful. Perfectly nails the Maine accent without falling into parody, and is wise and warm just like Jud should be. (8 out of 10)
