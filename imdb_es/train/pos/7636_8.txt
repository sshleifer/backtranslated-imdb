It's been a few years since I saw this, but remember it and I'd like to see it again. For me, it became a "therapy" with a personal experience of its own. <br /> <br /> A thirty-five-year-old man complains about a high school baseball game in which he "lost the ball" and his team lost. He thinks about it 20 years later, "if only he had hit that ball" and how his life would be better thanks to that. Then, he has the opportunity to find out ... and he gets a little more than he expected. <br /> <br /> It reminds me a lot when I was in high school, twice I tried on our training / dance team and they did not make it. This team was the closest thing to a sisterhood of women in my school. If you were in that, you were "all that." I did not try until my last two years of HS and after the second time, I took it very hard. I hit and bruised my leg shortly before the tests and used socks to cover the bruise, and that made me not succeed. That was in 1987. <br /> <br /> Over the years, even now sometimes, I think: "If only I had not hit my leg, I would never have used those stupid socks". Now I do not feel and I think my life would be better or even different if I had done it, but when I saw this movie I realized that we would never know how different things can be by changing a small thing in the past. Who knows, I could have changed the course of events to the point that I had not met my son's father. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone who has that moment in the past that they want. They could change Â¡Be careful what you want !!!
