This was a hit at the South By Southwest (SXSW) film festival in Austin last year, and features an excellent cast led by Gloria Reuben of E.R., and John Glover, who chews on landscapes. Although filmed with a small budget in New York City, the film looks and sounds fabulous, and it takes us back and forth through the rehearsal and montage of what the actors call "The Scottish Play," as a reference to the word "Macbeth". Thought to provoke the ancient curse of the work. The acting company exhibits all the emotions of the work itself, lust, jealousy, anger, suspicion and also a bit of fun. The games begin when a consummate actor is replaced (in the lead role) by a well-known "pretty face" of the telenovela scene to attract large crowds. The green-eyed monster takes over from there, and the drama unfolds very well. Good soundtrack and good performances everywhere. The DVD includes comments from the director and some deleted scenes as well.
