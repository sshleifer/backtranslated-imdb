I will begin by saying that I am very satisfied with this climax of the Bourne trilogy. Please, oh, please, do not screw it up by doing a sequel right now or a prequel. Just leave him alone. Right ... keep moving. As talented and versatile as Matt Damon is ... it seems he was only meant to play Jason Bourne. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of the first two Bourne films, you will not be disappointed with the third installment. Adhere to what works and add a little more. I was very pleased to see how all the information we get in 'Identity' and 'Supremacy' are combined in 'Ultimatum' to finally paint the full picture of Jason Bourne's problematic past. The action sequences are fast and keep you on the edge of your seat. The fights between Bourne and the assassins are always fun to watch. I've always been a fan of the films that surround the CIA agents and how the CIA brings their Intel together and this movie is right on that street, so it's even more exciting for me. <br /> <br /> Ultimatum without seeing the 2 previous installments ... you will still enjoy the movie a lot, but I would recommend that you see them first. This would allow him to fully understand the character Jason Bourne and join and be part of their world. This allows you to appreciate and enjoy the movie even more. I'm not sure which is the best of the first 2, but personally I think that 'Ultimatum' could, simply COULD, have an advantage when comparing the trilogy.
