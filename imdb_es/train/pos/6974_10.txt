Recently I saw Caprica again and I thought I could also write a review. I saw it for the first time right after watching the end of the Battlestar Galactica series (being a big fan of the show left me clinging to everything I could of the universe of shows), so I did not know what to expect ... but it came out a smile, although I must admit that ... <br /> <br /> The story begins dramatically on the planet of Caprica and we are presented with a variety of interesting characters ... I will not give too much. away, but there is a dramatic event that dictates the course of history, but I suggest you see this. <br /> <br /> I must say ... Esai Morales is a hell of an actor who played as a young Joseph Adama. .. (father of the Admiral in Battlestar Galactica) I found his place of action and could believe that he is the father of William Adama of BSG ... <br /> <br /> Also Eric Stoltz fits exactly into his role. ..! Special note: it was good to see Polly Walker out of Rome. Do not sit down and see Caprica with the expectation that it is like Battlestar Galactica because the story is quite simple and anyone can see it ... without having to see BSG! <br /> <br /> This show is a well-written drama for those who like drama with a bit of science fiction.
