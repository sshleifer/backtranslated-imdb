I know that sometimes it's really cheesy ... But the acting is amazing and Melissa Joan Hart is as cute as a button. I love this program and I'm very embarrassed that I do it because the program has a reputation. For being really cheesy, but it makes me feel good. My only problem is that sometimes it can be a pretty low budget - sometimes the actors change and you just have to deal with that ... As Sabrina's father is 2 different types throughout the movie ... I mean, they could not? You say he was an uncle or something? Still, I can not stop loving this show. Harvey and Sabrina make a very nice couple and Salem is absolutely hilarious. I definitely recommend it if you're looking for light and fun entertainment ... My favorite episode is "Pancake Madness" ... an HILARIO episode. The best season is probably 3 ... I'm really not a fan of some of the twists of the seventh season ... Once you get to college, Morgan joins the group and their dialogue is painful and very badly acted ... Also, she's ugly, so the jokes about how she just survives with her good looks got lost in me ... But I think I was set to have a very good eighth season and I felt very sad to see that one of my Favorite shows was canceled!
