['In my opinion, this is still one of the best performances of Superman on television, as well as one of the most faithful to a period of comics in particular. <br /><br /> This series paid homage to the Superman movies of the 70/80 and the Superman comics series &quot;reboot&quot; from 1986 onwards (&quot;Man of Steel&quot;, &quot;Superman Vol 2&quot;, &quot;Action Comics&quot;, &quot;Adventures of Superman, &quot;etc). The initial score and titles were touching, based on John Williams&#39; score for the films, updated for an action series on Saturday morning. Marv Wolfman, one of the main contributors to the reinitiation of comics (writer of &quot;Adventures of Superman&quot;) was a perfect choice to participate in this animated series. In general, the series had a more mature feel and remained very child-friendly. <br /><br /> Superman was presented as credible, strong and iconic. His recurring nemesis was Lex Luthor in his megalomaniac incarnation / CEO. Daily Planet characters, Lois, Jimmy and Perry, were well represented. One of my favorite appearances was of Wonder Woman, and the story revolved around her island of origin, Themyscira (&quot;Paradise Island&quot;). Both his design and that of his mother, Hippolyte, were in line with the series of comics Wonder Woman with similar reboot of the time, and it seemed that an equally well-made animated series could have been developed for her if handled in the same way . <br /><br /> What is hard to believe is that it has not been released on DVD / Blu-ray. It deserves to be.']
