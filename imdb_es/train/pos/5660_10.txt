I MAY have seen an episode or 2 when the program was originally broadcast, but when I saw an episode on netflix I was also hooked. I saw the whole series in like 2 days. :) I really liked the character of Gary Cole. First it is completely reprehensible and then you start liking the character ("These things have a thousand uses")! His folky Andy Griffith meets Charles Manson and Satan is great. Charming, charismatic, elegant, and uh kind of dangerous and by "kind of" I mean "really". I want to be like Him when I grow up. Lucas Black is also great. The accents are also great. Anyway, I thought this was one of the best TV shows and you owe it to yourself to watch it.
