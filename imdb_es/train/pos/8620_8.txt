I just finished watching the 139-minute version (widescreen) with some friends and we were impressed. I will not bother repeating what others have said. What the filmmakers do with the concept is unexpected and fun. The huge battle is exhausting. Afterwards, we were astonished to discover that we still had almost 30 minutes left, but that did not stop us from being completely involved and entertained. <br /> <br /> There's one thing that almost ruined her and that was the horrible one. music / songs Blues, Country / Folk and Rock Ballads do not belong here and every time they are used we all laugh. It's horrible You've been warned, but the story and the narrative keep you grounded. <br /> <br /> There are several outstanding moments that make you appreciate the talent behind the camera. There are many uses of both silence and slow-motion photography that work perfectly. I really wish I could erase the music, but unfortunately. <br /> <br /> Look for this. It's fun, it's different and it takes you to places you would not expect and that's very refreshing.
