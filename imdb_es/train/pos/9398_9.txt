['This is an excellent modern film today ... &quot;excellent&quot; in the sense that it is interesting, from start to finish. There are some holes here and some silly parts that make you shake your head in disbelief ... but I have not found anyone who has not been caught in this story. The movie has the right amount of action, suspense, plot twists and interesting characters. In addition, it has some nice colors and cinematography, in addition to a good soundtrack based on the guitar. <br /><br /> I labeled this crime movie as a &quot;black movie&quot; because it&#39;s rough and all the characters are not good. Even the only supposedly good guy, played by Nicholas Cage, gets into trouble lying and has a quick affair that he should not have had. He also does something in the end that is not right, but I will not spoil it by saying. Suffice it to say, however, that the rest of the characters are so bad that they make Cage look good! <br /><br /> Speaking of &quot;bad guys&quot;, does anyone do it better than Dennis Hopper? Not many At least in the &quot;upset&quot; category, it is difficult to overcome. Lara Flynn Boyle is fun to watch for several reasons. JT Walsh gives another great support performance, too. <br /><br /> This is one of those movies that never had much publicity, but I should have done it. You will have fun watching this. By the way, try saying the name of this movie aloud three times fast without spoiling it!']
