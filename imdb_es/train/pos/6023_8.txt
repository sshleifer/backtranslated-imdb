['I must admit that it has always been difficult for me to see an Antonioni film from start to finish on the first try, and even in this case, I ended up seeing it in three parts repeatedly. In the end, I realized that maybe it was better that way, because it forced me to stop thinking about the usual terms of the plot and just enjoy the scenes one by one. <br /><br /> The first part seems much more fragmentary, which is not a bad thing, it only requires more effort to continue. When it comes to the desert scenes, all efforts are paid in full. The impressive cinematography is just a part of it, what really makes everything unforgettable is how the landscape becomes an overwhelming presence, the silence and the immensity of it, the feeling of sadness and freedom, the way it is merges and contrasts with the two. young characters The desert is dead, but at the same time it feels less distant and strange than the urban scenes in the first part. The dance between the plane flying over and the girl&#39;s car makes a series of excellent shots. The scenes of love in the desert are simply beautiful, it is difficult to imagine this kind of approach from a movie of our time. Of course, there is something very elegant and studied about them, but at the same time they manage to express a natural and spontaneous sense of innocence that is very rare these days. Everything feels loose and without scripts (thanks also to the discreet performance), but that is the result of a manic attention to detail and form, which reaches its climax in the series of explosions at the end, a truly fascinating show. It just leaves you in awe. <br /><br /> I do not really care about some of the usual objections: boring, well, yes, it is, if you want all the films to follow a classic plot development and be full of action twists, but if all the movies were like that, that would be truly boring and sad; pretentious - maybe, but when that kind of ambition is combined with real skills, depth and style, pretentious is a compliment. The &quot;political&quot; criticisms have less sense for me, I do not see the point of approaching a film like this with ideological blinkers or, what is worse, with patriotic requirements. It simply defeats the purpose. It may be true that, as one previous commentator commented, Antonioni saw these young &#39;hippies&#39; and the policy of protests and riots with the police with the fascination of a foreigner, but I think that adds something instead of detracting from the movie. It is not true that hippies did not exist in Italy at that time (think of the &#39;68 protests, as in France), although they were obviously different from the US counterpart and, in a way, even more militant. But his interest in this movie was not strictly political. The events seem more like a pretext for a movie whose appeal has a universal and timeless quality. <br /><br /> A special mention for the fantastic soundtrack. Among other things, this film, along with Easy Rider, is probably one of the first precursors of the contemporary &quot;artistic&quot; music video, as well as the concept of a film soundtrack that would stand on its own, but unlike the previous one , uses music in a much more subtle way, combining it with the landscape instead of the action. <br /><br /> If you want a traditional narrative in a movie, then do not bother. If you want to be dazed, be patient and you will not regret it.']
