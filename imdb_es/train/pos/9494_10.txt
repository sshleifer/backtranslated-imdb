WHITE FIRE was recommended to me by a guy who owns it on two separate DVD releases and on VHS. He stated that he is one of the most fun and great low budget users that have been created. I usually do not watch movies because I know they're going to be bad, but I made an exception for this one ... and I was very happy to have done it. <br /> <br /> It's filled to the brim with action (much of it surprisingly, graphically bloody), sleaze (isolated to nudity with a key female character, but there's so much of it in a scene that it becomes hilarious) and an uncomfortably strange dialogue, all of which adds to the laughter Induction of the tone of the movie. <br /> <br /> Ginty, the unusual-looking star of THE EXTERMINATOR (and countless other low-budget action turds) is fun to head, offering the best performance he could muster. Williamson is better than usual, clearly imposes it with an incomparable joy (and does not reach half). The rest of the cast is also fun to watch, especially the villains, one of whom is a sexpot sadist who speaks with an accent that seems to be a mix of Spanish and Italian. She has no price. <br /> <br /> Once again, I can not emphasize enough how bloody it was. It is not so bloody that it is nauseating, but it is extraordinarily violent in some places with some fleshy buns in the shootings and has a string of exhausting torture that no man will soon forget. Also, when Ginty is being attacked by a group of bad guys, he conveniently gets a chainsaw and the splash moments that follow will have all the fans of the action cheering and spilling their beers. <br /> <br /> Don Do not miss the white fire. It is a classic of action, albeit foolish, although it is stupid.
