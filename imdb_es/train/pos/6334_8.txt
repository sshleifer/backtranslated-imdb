This movie has some things that are quite amazing. First, it is supposed to be based on a true story. That, in itself, is surprising that multiple tornadoes would hit the same city at night in the Nebraska fall. I wonder if the name of the real city was near "Blainsworth" (which is the name of the city in the movie). There is an Ainsworth, Nebraska, but there is also a city that starts with Blains-something. <br /> <br /> Shows the tornadoes with slower movements registered in the place where the children are in the house. On the other hand, the scene in which the television becomes blurred is in fact based. Before Doppler radar and weather radio, we were taught that if you switched your television to a particular channel (not cable) and tuned the brightness in the right way, you could tell if a tornado was occurring. The problem was that by then you could hear it. <br /> <br /> Since I know something about the Midwestern tornadoes, it made this movie fun for me. I enjoy it more than Twister. I mean, give me a break, there's no way you can get out and F5 chaining you to a pipe in a well house.
