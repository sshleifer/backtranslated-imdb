I saw this movie when I was 13 and I really liked Dana Plato, who then starred in different styles like Kimberly Drummond. I do not think it's garbage. Nor was it meant to be a sequel to the documentary. it's just a movie of cute kids about 3 kids chasing men trying to find the creepy boggy monster. Men get hurt and children rescue them with the help of the creature. The hunting shots of the swamp and the Arkansas landscape were clean. This is a good movie for children, there is no real violence, only some minor scars, but very fun for young children.
