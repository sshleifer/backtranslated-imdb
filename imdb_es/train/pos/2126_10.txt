['You can learn a lot about love and life by observing people in THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER. <br /><br /> Ernst Lubitsch had another silent triumph that added to his credit with this beautiful film. With a sparkling dialogue (courtesy of his longtime collaborator, Samson Raphaelson) and wonderful performances by a cast of talented artists, he created a truly memorable film. Always believing in competing with the intelligence of its spectators, and favoring sophistication over the slap, the director invented a dazzling cinematic meal seasoned with that elusive and enigmatic quality known as the &#39;Lubitsch touch&#39;. <br /><br /> Although the story is set in Budapest (and there is a mixture of accents between the players), this does not matter. The beautiful simplicity of the plot is that any large American city or small city could easily be the place of action. <br /><br /> Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullavan are wonderful as employees in love with romance and then with each other, without knowing it. Their dialogue, so skillfully managed as to seem completely natural, perfectly conveys their silent confusion and despair as they search for twin souls. His is one of the classic love stories of cinema. <br /><br /> The cherub Frank Morgan has a more serious role than usual, that of a man whose passing importance in his little world is broken when he finds himself as a cuckold. A skillful thief of scenes, does not allow any emotion to escape without ventilation. In addition, Morgan gives the film its happiest moments, almost at the end, when it determines that the newest employee of his shop, an impoverished young man, enjoys a memorable Christmas Eve. <br /><br /> Joseph Schildkraut adds another vivid representation to his list of on-screen representations, this time that of a sycophantic and flattering Lotario who deserves the punishment that was eventually imposed on him. The gentle Felix Bressart has his best cinematographic role as a family man who really can not afford to get involved in the intrigues of the stores, however, he remains a firm friend of Stewart. <br /><br /> Sara Haden takes on the small role of a sales employee. William Tracy is hilarious as the ambitious errand boy who takes advantage of unforeseen developments to take advantage of the sales force. <br /><br /> In small roles, Charles Halton plays a sensible detective and Edwin Maxwell appears as a pompous doctor. The film&#39;s experts will recognize Mary Carr and Mabel Colcord, both uncredited, in their only scene as Miss Sullavan&#39;s grandmother and aunt.']
