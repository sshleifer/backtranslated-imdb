I personally loved this movie, and I was particularly moved. The two main actors are giving us such good performances, that in the end, it is really heartbreaking to know what finally happened to their characters. <br /> <br /> The alchemy between Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson is wonderful, and The songs are just great as they are. <br /> <br /> That's why I was not surprised when I learned that I had won 5 Golden Globe awards (the most awarded film in the Golden Globes), an Oscar and even a Grammy. This movie is a classic that deserves to be seen by anyone. A great movie, which has often been criticized (perhaps because Streisand dared to get involved in it, probably as a "co-director"). His art is the greatest, and that will surely please you!
