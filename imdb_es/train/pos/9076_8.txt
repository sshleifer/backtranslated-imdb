This would have to be one of the funniest television comedies in the United States since the disappearance of "Everybody Loves Raymond". Warburton is always hilarious, and in this complements perfectly the rest of the set. David Spade continues to tickle my fun bone enormously with his rather unique delivery of his lines. After talking about the British series, "Coupling" I can see from where the creators of "Rules of Engagement" had their original idea, but this does not pretend to be a "brickbat": the absolutely brilliant dialogue and the way to enter. What is transmitted establishes this particular series completely apart. But it takes more than a competent cast to bring success to a new series, particularly in the difficult field of comedy. Having been part of a professional television comedy writing team for most of the 7 years in Australia, I can especially appreciate the role of the director and the perceptive and creative talent of the camera crew. One of the few complaints I have with the series is the "canned" laugh, which is very obvious. Surely a live audience could have been used in the filming of the series.
