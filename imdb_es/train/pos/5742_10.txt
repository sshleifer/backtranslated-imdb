TOM HULCE * presents another performance worthy of an Oscar such as Dominick Luciano, the man with brain damage who is helping to take his brother (Ray Liotta as Eugene) to medical school. <br /> <br /> This is something you should see for all movie lovers and all lovers of life and people! <br /> <br /> ===========> * From the little studder to the eratic dance, to the repeated words "Oh, Jeez" every time Nicky is in a bind, the incredible Tom's performance is so excellent that you will have to concentrate to remember that he is an actor on the screen.
