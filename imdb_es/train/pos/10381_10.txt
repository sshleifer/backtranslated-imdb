['The previous critic has said it exactly. I saw it once, I was delighted, I saw it a second time when it was broadcasted within a week or two of the first broadcast. I still remember some of the scenes. The scenario is the opening of the twentieth century, the war referred to in the title is the First World War. One of the scenes was developed in a section only for women of a public place, which was an interesting historical note. The moment one of the women plays the other one for the first time is one of my best movie moments of all time. I do not think of this as a &quot;gay movie&quot;, it&#39;s an interesting and tender love story, in which the two directors are women. I would love to see this movie again; I would buy this if it ever came out on DVD.']
