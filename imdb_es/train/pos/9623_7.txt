Hmmmm, do you want some romance with your mystery? This has it. I think if the romance had been abandoned, this would have been a better movie. But how could romance be abandoned when the story is taken from something called a Harlequin Romance novel, whatever it is? If the romance had been abandoned, the story could have been too weak. The mystery here was not so bad, very interesting, but nothing at the level of international espionage Mission Impossible. Oh good. I thought Mel Harris was pretty good; her short skirts, I think, added some sex appeal ... but this guy from Rob Stewart could probably have been better chosen, maybe with a better-known movie actor for TV. The address was decent and the writing could have been improved, both could have been a little more nervous, a little darker, more adventurous. One thing that was great about this was the use of European real places. That could have been easily changed, so it could have been filmed in Canada, but they were actually in beautifully beautiful places like Budapest. Possibly an inconvenience was the choice of the director and / or director of photography to frame certain photos of a perfect postcard. Not well. If this had been a more dramatic cinematic image for the big screen, the perfect scenes of a postcard really need to have a background and be just a nice part of the background. However, this was just a television movie, so they had to add some Ummmph to the image and part of that Ummmph came from the stage. In general, it's not really a bad movie. I'll tell you one thing, this was absolutely the best Canadian-Hungarian production I've seen! (and the only thing I know.) I hereby proclaim that this is a mediocre movie made for television, giving it a grade of C-
