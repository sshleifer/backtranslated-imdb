['The first time I saw this movie in my course of plays and dramatists in Tulane. I was surprised at how beautiful and raw this documentary was. It is a sincere look at the unedited reality of a life of loneliness. The family is fascinating and I thought it really showed Little Edie in her essence. ** As an additional note, my teacher even told me that throughout the filming, Little Edie fell in love with one of the men in the camera. ** Beauty, it seems to me, comes from the naturalness of family dysfunction. It is evident in the relationship between mother and daughter that neither of them could work alone in society and one begins to wish for the rehabilitation of Little Edie in society. In general, the film has an aesthetic quality and a portrait of surprising beauty. Two thumbs up!']
