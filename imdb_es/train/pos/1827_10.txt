All dogs go to heaven is one of the best movies I've seen in my life. I saw him for the first time when he was 3 years old. Now I am 12 and I rented it, it makes me think about things and it brings back many memories, those were "the days". I love music, I love it when Charlie gets to heaven, I love the song "Let me be surprised". I love how Charlie looks and his voice, Bert Reynolds could only play this excellent voice of Charlie. I love this movie, the first one is the best because it is very original and great. It really brings back memories that no one can describe, not even me. If only I could go back to those days. I love the characters. If this is the way that memories come back when I'm 12 years old, imagine how I'll feel when I'm 19, I hope I can see this when I grow up. When I saw it for the first time, I never knew that I would really look back and I would feel that way, I hope it is available to see. I am so happy that this film has been made and that my mind and heart have reached an incredible idea. On a scale of 1 to 10, I would give you a perfect 10. It is an incredible movie. It is very difficult to explain the feeling, when I am older and if I have children, I hope you can experience this feeling.
