Okay, I would not normally watch a Farrelly brothers movie. I do not remember ever seeing one. I also do not remember seeing a movie by Jimmy Fallon. All right, I saw the taxi, but I said penance and I forgave myself for that mistake. But, this movie had Drew Barrymore and I think she's the cutest thing. I do not know what it is, but I only smile the entire time I look at it. She simply captivates me in that way. I mean I even saw Adam Sandler just to see her in 50 First dates. How sad is that? This was not the best baseball movie, it was not supposed to be. It was a love story about a sad puppy that clung to the one thing that never disappointed him until he found something that was worth giving up. It had a predictable ending, but there was so much in the way that it made it worthwhile.
