['This is a great movie &quot;Call Me Anna&quot; because it shows how a person has suffered for so long without knowing what was wrong. The fact that Patty Duke appears in public and tells her story is an inspiration for those who suffer from this disease. I have a lot of respect for her as a person. The only thing I do not like is that I can not record it, I&#39;ve tried it but I have not. Does anyone know how to get it?']
