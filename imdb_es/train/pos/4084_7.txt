I suppose this is supposed to be a kind of reworking or updating of "Beauty and the Beast," but I can not say that I've ever seen a movie that started with several minutes of graphic horse sex. Wow. Anyway, it looks like a young woman and she ... aunt? I have traveled to this castle in France, where the woman is going to marry the son of the owner of the castle, who is the man who is responsible for making sure that the horses remove the stones. It seems that there are legends in that area of ​​a beast that was rather, uh, playful, I suppose you could say, with the ladies, or at least, one in particular. There are all kinds of references hidden in that respect, but every time the young bride, who soon blushes, puts her curious little hands in one, the groom's father takes it out of sight. Anyway, the young fiancee climbs the stairs to sleep while the family is waiting for a Cardinal to show up for the wedding (a family member, I suppose) and while he dreams that he dreams of a beast in the forest that has his way with it The effects on this leave much to be desired, and any attempt at eroticism (not that I know much about it) is laughable, especially when certain prominent appendages look as realistic as a bedpost or a baseball bat. This has a rather strange and abrupt end, but twisted, without really any clue or much development, but it was appropriate and definitely not what I expected. I do not know, it's a bit hard to beat, but it has its moments and it's definitely weird. 7 out of 10
