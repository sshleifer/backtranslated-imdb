I really liked that movie! It was so good! This movie is told by the parrot, Paulie's point of view. Paulie is given to the girl Marie, as a gift. Paulie helps Marie to learn to speak and they become best friends. But when Paulie tells Marie to fly, she falls and the bird is kicked out. That's when the adventure begins. Paulie goes through so much to find her way back to Marie. This movie is very sweet, funny, moving, sad and more. When I first saw this movie, it made me cry. The courage of the birds and the urge to go looking for his Marie during all that time, was very moving. I must say that the ending is so sweet and sad, but you will have to see it to know how it goes. In the end, the goalkeeper tries to help him, after hearing his story. Will you find your lost Marie or not? Find out when you see this sweet and comforting movie. It will touch your heart. Score: 10
