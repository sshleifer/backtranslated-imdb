I think James Cameron could be becoming my favorite director because this is my second review of his films. Anyway, everyone remembers the RMS Titanic. It was big, fast and "unsinkable" ... until April 1912. It was in all the news and was one of the greatest tragedies in history. Well, James Cameron decided to make a movie, but he stars two fictional characters to be the center of attention instead of the ship. Well, in the main review, but let me remind you that this is all opinion and fact null, and the only fact that will be present is an event of the movie. <br /> <br /> So our two main characters are Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose (Kate Winslet). They are not too annoying, but look at this and you will find out why they might become annoying (http://tinyurl.com/ojhoyn). The main villain I suppose is bad luck, destiny, the hand of God (no intention of blasphemy), or simply Caledon Hockley (Billy Zane). Combine all of the above and what do you get? Oh yeah! We have a love story on a sinking ship. The supporting characters are the following: My personal favorite, Mr. Andrews (Victor Garber) (although he was very kind), Lovejoy (David Warner), Murdoch (Ewan Stewart), Lightoller (Jonathan Phillips), Captain Smith (Bernard Hill), Molly Brown (Kathy Bates), and many more. We also have the treasure hunter of today, Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton). They add something to the story, something good. The action here is impressive, especially in the second half, the drama is also good. In the end, you can make your eyes drop rain storms or silent tears. The story is simple and it works. A treasure hunter looks for the Heart of the Ocean and instead finds a drawing of a woman wearing the diamond. She calls and tells her story about the RMS Titanic. Two lovers separated by social class and ultimately, the destination of the ship. Everything about the story works and there are very few faults. I give you Titanic, an impressive 86%.
