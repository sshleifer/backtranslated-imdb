I am surprised that nobody has mentioned yet that there are two versions of this same movie. Most of the images in both are identical, but this is where they differ: in one version (the version I've seen most often on television), the group of clerics who guarded the gateway consists of the "Brotherhood of the Protectors ", a splinter group (fictitious) of priests and brothers" excommunicated "by the Church. In the other version, which I have seen only once on television, the clergymen who guard the entrance door are represented as priests of the official Church, that is, the Archdiocese of New York (or perhaps Brooklyn). Also, in the previous version, in most of the relevant scenes, the clerics are referred to as "brothers" (and in some scenes, you can see where the lips say "Father" such and such, but the audio dubbed says " Brother "such and such." In the latest version, I think everyone is known as "Father." <br /> <br /> In any case, it seems that one of these two versions is more or less partial. filming of the other, with all the scenes of "Brotherhood of the Protector" re-filmed as scenes from "Archdiocese", or vice versa. (Reminds me of the scenes of Raymond Burr in "Godzilla"). So no, I'm not imagining this, can anyone shed some more light on the story behind these two versions of the movie?
