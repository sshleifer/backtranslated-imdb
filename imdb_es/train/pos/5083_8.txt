In the hands of less important actors than Claudette Colbert and Robert Ryan, this film could have become silly. But, with these two experienced protagonists at the helm, I found that "Silent Fury" is a very exciting and pleasant little mystery. When your wedding is interrupted by a stranger who says that Colbert is already married and that he was the best man in that wedding, one may feel that there is some kind of plot in his work. When Colbert, Ryan and their lawyer set out to refute the claim of a previous marriage by strangers, they find each step with more evidence that seems to reinforce the claim that she is already married. Although it is not very difficult to find out who is the main "bad guy", it is still very funny as the intensity and rhythm of the story increases. In short, a good and solid mystery film with excellent performances by the two main actors and an excellent cast that includes the often underestimated Paul Kelly.
