Mary Tyler Moore and Valerie Harper can still activate the world with their smiles. The combined talent of these two wonderful stars makes this newstart meeting / movie combination work. Look at it and we hope to reach sixty! Mar√≠a challenges the youth-oriented society with wit and charm. A touch of drama adds 2000 realism. A follow-up to the television series would expand the new characters and give us the opportunity to occasionally see Lou Grant, Phyllis, Sue Ann, Murray and Georgette.
