Hardcastle and McCormick is an excellent television show. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is predictable like The Dukes of Hazzard, Hunter, The A-Team, etc., etc. etc. <br /> <br /> This program is simply a good clean television. The relationship between Hardcastle and McCormick is pretty fun. Shots are often shot at each other several times per episode, which adds a lot of humor to the show. It contains several car chases in almost every episode, but who does not enjoy a good car chase? Especially with the Coyote! <br /> <br /> I wish they made a clean television like this today! I highly recommend it!
