['This comic style movie is fun, has a nice action and a great futuristic style. The writer Steven de Souza, who also wrote Commando, gives Arnie a lot of lines to hand out: &quot;Send me a copy&quot;, after signing a contract and stabbing a pen to the lawyers; &quot;What a pain in the neck,&quot; after strangling the subzero with barbed wire; &quot;He had to separate&quot;, after cutting his body between his legs; and finally, when Killian hits through a billboard with his own face, Arnie concludes: &quot;Now that hit the place.&quot; Interestingly, it has some similarities of total recall, another science fiction movie starring Schwarzenegger.']
