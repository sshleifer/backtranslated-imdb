Anyone with a child in the house who does not watch black and white movies should put this on their television. When the child passes, wondering what the screams and shots are about on the screen, tell him that this is an adult image and that it is not yet big enough to see it. That will keep him there for a few minutes; Director George Stevens and his team will keep it to the end. <br /> <br /> I think my father did that to me anyway, and I'm the best man for it. This classic thread of adventure, set in India during the British occupation, features a trio of army sergeants who find their close union facing dissolution while preparing to marry his girlfriend. The help comes in the form of a vicious revolt by Thuggie against which the soldiers are united. <br /> <br /> "Gunga Din" was one of the great films that came out of the best year of Hollywood, 1939. Even more than most. Great films of that golden year, it is entertaining in a very immediate and accessible way. The theme of music is instantaneous nirvana. While filming in California, the camera work (the only thing in "Gunga Din" that got as much as an Oscar nomination) has a wind-borne greatness that looks a lot like the Raj of a hundred years before. Battle scenes are recorded in a very realistic way, not too violent but very messy, since people fall, shoot and run in every corner of each painting in a way that feels real, not represented as a festival of killings Biblical works by Cecil B. DeMille. br /> <br /> The script not only establishes scenes of action, but also develops the relationship of the three sergeants with big humor dolls. The main focus is on the sergeant. Cutter, chasing tales of golden treasures. It is a rare action for Cary Grant, and its lightness is appropriate for a film that is never taken seriously even though it develops a tense suspense. <br /> <br /> The anchor of the trio is Sgt. MacChesney (Victor McLaglen), who worships his elephant Annie and tries to protect Cutter from his own hare brain schemes. It's just as fun in its own way, leaving the sergeant. Ballantine (Douglas Fairbanks Jr., who shows a good script by Errol Flynnish) as having the love interest and firm enough to know that he needs to shoot his friends and grow. <br /> <br /> If "Gunga Din" was a lifetime movie, it would be Joan Fontaine's efforts to save his man from his two lost friends and his crushing skulls. But since it's a children's movie, the emphasis here is on how the three of them should stay together and save Ballantine from a fate worse than death, not just marriage, but, as Cutter exclaims in indignation several times, also the tea business. <Br /> <br /> The political correctness of the police is hard in this film, not so much because of the gender issue as because of the idea that British soldiers save the poor Indians from the vicious Thuggies. It stinks of colonial apology. Fortunately, this film was made when, and the producers did not feel the need to explain the obvious liberalism in the heart of the film, that these three sergeants, so full of pride and false racial pride, should be saved. with the rest of his army for a humble bhisti that only one of the three had time for when he sought his approval. After all, in spite of all its splendor, the true sacrifice of the film involves the title character, played in such a moving way by Sam Jaffe. <br /> <br /> When this movie was made, the movie mogul Jack Warner had a saying: You want to send a message, use Western Union. Still, it seems that the messages were flying fast and furious in "Gunga Din." I watch the movie now and wonder if the audiences at that time were meant to ask what Gunga Din was up to when he took Cutter to the golden temple. Was he really planning revenge against his British gentlemen? Would it have been justified to do so, especially given MacChesney's cold treatment? When Colonel Weed delivered that eulogy, Rudyard Kipling's poem on which the film is based, it was with a nod to the foolishness of imperialism, to write about someone who proved to be "a better man than me" in the finish? What did they do with the great speech of the Guru, delivered in perfect English cut: "You have sworn as soldiers perhaps to die for a faith, which is your country, England ... Well, I can die for my country and my faith as easily as you ... India, goodbye. " <br /> <br /> Of course, the same character also instructs his brutal followers: "Kill for the sake of killing! Kill for love of Kali! Kill! Kill! Kill!" Which means that we are allowed to hate him and encourage the British, and keep the questions about what it all means for later. <br /> <br /> What "Gunga Din" means to me, above all, is the fastest. , the most exciting 90 minute video trip. Cutter never found his golden temple, but there is one for all of us who see "Gunga Din."
