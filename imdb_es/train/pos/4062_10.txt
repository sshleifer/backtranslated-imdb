I just realized that I have been using IMDb for years and I have never reviewed my favorite movie. By favorite I do not mean something that I like for now, I mean that this movie is so supernaturally perfect that there will never be another lively experience that touches it. This is obvious because I will never be a child again; I watched this movie on ITV in the early nineties. I was 12 years old, which is the age group to which this film is directed, I am also male, the genre to which this film is destined (the vast majority of the protagonists of Miyazaki are women). Consequently, this film indelibly inspired the psychology of my childhood and I am always in debt to Carl Macek (sp?) For producing the English dub of this film, which is far superior to the production of Di $ ney that not even It's funny able to see that one, of course, subtitled is the only way ultimately, however, the Macek version is SO SO good (the voices corresponding almost exactly to the original Japanese actors) that this version is available on the Japanese DVD . It is not available in any distribution in an English-speaking country. Go figure. <br /> <br /> There are hundreds of competent reviews, so I'm going to put some trivia here, it's not the definitive information file for this movie. <br /> <br /> First of all, I would like to agree with the critic who said that you need 20 out of 10 to check Miyazaki's films. They are so in their own league that they make almost the entire IMDb catalog become insignificant. <br /> <br /> The fascinating story of this movie is that Miyazaki based the camp around the Slag Ravine (Pazu city area) in the mining communities of Wales. He visited Wales for a few months in the early 1980s (it could be in the late 1970s) right after one of the big mining strikes. Being an avid supporter of student socialist movements in the sixties, he felt his plight. The struggle between the townspeople and the pirates at the beginning serves to illustrate this empathy with the working man. The field and the clouds, especially in this film, remind me where I grew up, since his film shows a fantastic version of the hills of the British Midwestern Islands. <br /> <br /> The island is, of course, Swift's satirical genius. Novel of the eighteenth century: the story of Swift's book is, deliberately, ridiculous. In Castle in the Sky, Miyazaki weaves myths like Atlantis and the Tower of Babel. I think the architecture is also based on Peruvian ruins, although I'm not sure, someone told me that. <br /> <br /> Anyone who wants to read this review and likes this movie will REALLY want to see Miyazaki Mirai's epic series Shounen Conan - Future Boy Conan - based on the science fiction novel 'The Incredible Tide' by Alexander key ( the novel is available online). Conan is basically a prototype for Pazu and Shita de Laputa. Also, you may not be familiar with your previous work for Masterpiece Theater, part of your keyframe animation. He also made a keyframe for Sherlock Hound, this has some of the best backgrounds I've seen as well. You can also watch the first feature film by Miyazaki and Takahata, Horus Prince of the Sun (1968): incredible by today's standards. What else ... Gauche the Cellist and The Flying Ghost Ship, although they are quite rare. <br /> <br /> This movie is a gift, I do not know what we would do without all that. This other shit of narration, this is like an oasis. Arigatou Miyazaki-sensei!
