I love horses and I admire the hand-drawn animation, so I expected nothing more than amazement at the new animated image of Dreamworks Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron. I guess you could say that I was a little disappointed. You have a wonderful animation and at the beginning what seems like a perfect story. A story about absolutely nothing more than a horse in nature. The animals do not sing beautiful songs or speak, a great advantage. Sadly, the film has an extravagant narrative by Matt Damon; a sappy soundtrack by Bryan Adams; and enough action scenes to compare it with a production by Jerry Bruckheimer. If the filmmakers had stayed with simplicity, here we would have a masterpiece. This is not a great movie, but it is good entertainment for young children. I would recommend this movie to families because it has its heart in the right place and it is the only thing that is right now that is not offensive to young children. It's not bad, but it could have been much better. Very nice images though.
