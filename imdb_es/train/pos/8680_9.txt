Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer is a very lost player in the short cartoon market. This market is essentially dominated by the short Looney Tunes and Merry Melodies, from Warner Bros. But MGM is also able to release hidden gems, such as "To Spring", an amazing story about the most beautiful season of the year. <Br /> <br /> In the environment described here, spring is not caused by natural cycles, but is manufactured. And for whom By small male elves who live underground. Every spring, when the snow begins to melt, they start to work. They start tearing down columns of rainbow rock, then reducing them to rubble and using these debris to turn them into colored fluids, which will move to the ground and with grass, flowers ... In other words, spring! The first half of the cartoon shows the making of spring, but the second part is a little different. Old Man Winter returns and tries to extend the winter by destroying the work of the elves. So from this point, we witnessed a battle between the elves and Old Man Winter. <br /> <br /> The music that is heard here is deliciously wonderful. The melodic parts stick to the head like a dot of ink on a sheet of paper. The melodies of the second part are exciting and fit perfectly with the action. This is just fantastic, Giorgio! The animation sequences are also a delight. The colors are well mixed and every little detail is displayed in a massive and epic environment. The concept itself is brilliant. The elves are attracting characters, just like Old Man Winter, who effectively portrays the cold and ruthless feelings of the white season. <br /> <br /> There is also a strong message included here. The battle seems lost for the elves at the end, until an elf who arrives late enters into action and leads to the victory of the elves over the winter. So the point is: only one person can make a difference. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, "To Spring" is a lost classic from the era of short cartoons. What is even more remarkable is that the director of this caricature made his debut here. And who is the director of "To the spring"? It's one William Hanna ...
