Being a big fan of the romantic comedy genre and, therefore, having seen a lot of these movies, it is rare that one seems totally unique to me. For that matter, it is equally strange that I am left breathless by laughter during several scenes. The love story is a bit thin on the ground, but I'd say it's probably for the best, since this romantic comedy has a strong emphasis on "comedy" and, in any case, extends the limits of credibility just a little more . I like most of the rom com do. The four scientists provided some of the funniest moments not only in this movie, but in any movie I've seen in a long time. I hesitated for a few moments before finally choosing a "10" over a "9" as a rating, since I think too many people use it indiscriminately, and therefore the maximum score loses part of its impact. I'm also a big fan of Meg Ryan, which helps, but this is one of the few movies I've seen where I'd say it's completely eclipsed. She and Tim Robbins are chosen as protagonists, but for me they play a secondary role to the antics of the clumsy intellectuals. An authentic laugh-type movie out loud.
