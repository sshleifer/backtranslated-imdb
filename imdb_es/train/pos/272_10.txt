I loved it, but I still have nightmares about the hotel manager. The film was presented well, with the choice of actors taking their roles to the reality of writing. Many scenes seized the imagination and created a nail biter. The progression of the situations was written intelligently, which made me believe that the story was directed in a way only to find a new twist in what I thought might be obvious. Too bad there must be ads. I have told many friends to watch more screenings and, of course, I will see again. I enjoyed the setting of the film and I felt that this added to the plot and intrigue. The heated arguments between husband and wife (or should I say fights?) Were very realistic. The initial situation is common, but the escalation in the story presented fortunately is not. I want to thank everyone who participated in this great entertainment movie. Thank you! Looking forward to the next films --- when? Whidbey
