This film is really relevant even today, given the threat of bioterrorism and the threats of superbugs, West Nile Virus and SARS. Like a thriller, the tension is quite intense. Richard Widmark and Paul Douglas are more than useful in their roles. The domestic scenes between Widmark and his wife provide a good interlude to the main plot. The actor in this film that most left its mark is Jack Palance. His well-defined features and seemingly calm appearance always wither and reveal the avaricious and cruel man below the surface. The chase scene through the packing plant is impressive even today. Recommended, 7/10.
