I always wait for this movie when it is on television. I have to get the DVD I suppose. The range of different types of people is great. He tells me that anyone can be a dancer if he tries hard enough. My favorite character must be Mr.Aoki. It is so peculiar but so full of emotions. It's a perfect movie with wonderful dances. Unfortunately, we never have the opportunity to see them go to Blackpool. I would do for the perfect sequel if they had. But I guess that leaves his imagination what could have happened. <br /> <br /> A very simple and innocent story. He remains loyal to his wife and daughter. <br /> <br /> I have not seen the Hollywood remake. I'm not sure if I want to. I really do not enjoy Jennifer Lopez. I think Richard Gere agrees more with the original than with Lopez. I have the feeling that the remake is not so simple and innocent.
