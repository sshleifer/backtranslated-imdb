I saw the first part two days ago and today I saw the second part. Of course, the two parts are worlds apart, so I'm a little shaken by everything I just saw. I felt consumed by the knowledge of the inevitability of Che's death; For me, the whole movie got foggy. I guess that's exactly what Soderbergh wanted us to feel, the inevitable evolution of his death. The second part was very low compared to, once again, an inevitability, but in Cuba it was positive and in Bolivia it was so negative. The politics of the movement in Bolivia was only mentioned but rarely confronted didactically. For me, the memorable scenes were all at the end of the film: the confrontation with the jailer and the softer talk with the Bolivian official, where that officer questions Che about the failure of the peasants to support their revolution. He had not considered that national differences had as much role as they did in the Argentinean versus Bolivian conflict. I thought that Soderbergh was dealing admirably with the inevitable problems of supply in a revolutionary struggle; How do you get the food without antagonizing the peasants who do not have enough? I was surprised at how difficult it would be to try something like Che tried. I guess everything is in time; Is there enough anger against the government to start the movement? In Bolivia there was no. Che realized the terrible corundum of the revolutionaries in his letter to Fidel, read at the beginning of the film: If it is not now, when, in 50 years. A very provocative and well made film; Do everything possible to see it.
