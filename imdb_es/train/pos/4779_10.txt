On paper, this movie sounds incredibly boring. The idea that a 75-year-old man who travels in the field on a lawn mower does not have much appeal, but the real power behind the film is its charm and intelligence. Writers will not find a better study of what makes a movie work than "The Straight Story." <br /> <br /> The perfect example of this is a scene where Alvin meets a fugitive teenager. She is pregnant and afraid of what her parents would do if they found out. Alvin tells him a story about his own children, a long time ago. He made each one take a stick and break it, which they could easily do. Then he had them pile up the sticks and try to break them. "That package," he said, "belongs to the family." Many other movies would feel compelled to continue and make sure we knew that a person could break up, but together the members were stronger. "The Straight Story" realizes that we are smart enough to understand this and simply lets us contemplate the thought and draw our own conclusions. <br /> <br /> Alvin's journey through Iowa is filled with a character so refreshing that it's not Hollywood. interactions Each interaction is full of warmth and humor, and Alvin is so cute in his lawn mower that we can not help smiling as he heads to Wisconsin to make peace with his brother, Lyle, who suffered a stroke. And the simplicity of the final scene emphasizes that the real story here is not the destination but the journey. It is a journey in which Alvin shares his life with everyone he meets, for his benefit and ours. It is a slow, simple and relaxing trip destined to remind us of everything we have lost with the urbanization of America. <br /> <br /> "The Straight Story" is the rare live action movie rated "G" that really should not be missed.
