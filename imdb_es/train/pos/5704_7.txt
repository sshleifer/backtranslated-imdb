To be fair, I expected car chases in this movie. There was only one, but apart from that, 'Freeway' was a great movie that I'm pleased to have on DVD. The only really important names in the cast are Richard Belzer, from HOMICIDE, as the radio psychiatrist and the B-Movie villain, Billy Drago, the character of Freeway Killer who quotes Revelation. But the rest of the cast generally gives good performances. I especially liked how Darlanne Fluegel gave his character, Sunny, a bit of guts. It may have been a helpless victim, but it is completely rounded, as it searches for Drago with the help of bounty hunter James Russo. <br /> <br /> Russo, I'm afraid, is presented as something of wood, but then again, the character he plays, Frank, is not very well developed, except for a background story that gave Sunny your former commander in chief. The tone of the threat is magnificently maintained throughout the film and the atmosphere of the lonely Los Angeles freeway at night with the killer loitering its length in its sinister gray sedan is an excellent way to increase tension, and the music used to underline the film is properly composed. I do not know why there are people who hate this movie. Different strokes for different people, I suppose. But I really liked 'Freeway' and I highly recommend it.
