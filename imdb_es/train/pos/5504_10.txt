['I just saw this last night, it aired on the &#39;Passionate Eye&#39; series of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. It has been exhibited recently (September 2003) at the Toronto International Film Festival and many others. It&#39;s a pretty remarkable movie. The filmmakers literally stumbled upon the story, being there to make a documentary about Chavez himself. Instead, they found themselves in the middle of events as the blow developed. They had unprecedented access to events and people and, for the most part, let the story unfold as it happens. Of course, they have their own ideological perspective (which they make evident), but they remain in the background and, instead, try to focus attention on the events, the people and the background and history that led to the coup. As a film, it&#39;s not innovative in a stylistic or aesthetic sense, and I think that&#39;s the way it should be. What we get to see what &quot;integrated&quot; journalism really should be. What we can see is a remarkable story of a country struggling to achieve democracy ... a charismatic leader (Chavez) who really cares about his people ... a story about power and greed as a coalition of corporate interests / military / media combine to lead a coup d&#39;etat of a democratically elected leader ... and unprecedented access to a historic event as it unfolds. <br /><br />']
