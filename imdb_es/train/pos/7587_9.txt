I must say that I was impressed that the cinematography was amazing, the close frames of perfection and the way in which the tension increased around a subject that sounds more like a frightening boredom is beyond the possible. <br /> <br /> The film is about Two narrators, one seen, one invisible. Both try to explain the meaning of a series of paintings that caused a scandal a long time ago. The movie has to do with theories and explanations of points of view, but the conclusion is quite shocking, I must say. Definitely a movie that deserves more than its 171 votes. <br /> <br /> With only 66 minutes to play, your movie still feels like a complete job. Fantastic address! I must say much better than Blood of the Poet, which for some strange reason reminds me a bit. <br /> <br /> I guess you can call it by the word "artistic" slang. It's practically a professional talk about several impressive theories and visual effects, but the team and Ruiz did it. At least for me. An incredible movie
