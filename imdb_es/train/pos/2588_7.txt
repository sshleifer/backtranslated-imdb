Brothers with psychokinetic powers (yes, in reality) not only face the affections of Debra Winger, but a secret from their childhood that left them at odds with their powers. <br /> <br /> There are surreal touches (the fire department will act like a Greek singer chorus), but there is also humor and romance. The soundtrack is very similar to the way the American Werewolf in London used all the great Wolf songs they could get ~ but with fire ~ and I do not think I'll ever forget Dennis Quaid (mmmmm Dennis Quaid), putting his own trailer a rockin 'a' She's a lady '~ priceless;) <br /> <br /> The best line missing in the dating section by the way ~' Once you've had a clown, never come back! '<br /> <br /> I love this movie (I ordered the US DVD) And if the comments written by the kind of people who would be happiest with Legally Blond 3 does not discourage you, give it a try: )
