I was very excited when I saw the movie. How Jonny could maintain such hope and faith was incredible. Many people only care about what they want and worry about all the things they do not have. And they are such small things, like chothes, money a new car. I have seen people cry because of a defect. This movie brings everything back to the basics. love, I hope the beauty of the simple but so important things in life. It makes our everyday problems look so they are small and really unimportant. He observes this child and realizes that he has always been blessed with food, a roof over his head and loved ones around him. You are truly blessed. And the saying of stopping and smelling roses really has a new meaning. And I know Jonny will see this and I want to thank him so much for sharing so much faith, strength and humor with me. Thank you, Jonah, I know that you elevate the heavens and bring much love and laughter to the heavens.
