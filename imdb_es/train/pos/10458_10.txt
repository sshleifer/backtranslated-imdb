This film is about one of the most feared geriatric diseases today. As someone who has encountered several families facing the potential of Alzheimer's disease or who are in the formative stages, I would suggest that each healthcare provider recommend this film to any family facing the trauma of this disease. The film is designed primarily to talk to the patient's family and get to the heart of the fight. The casting is excellent and the dramatic performance is exceptional with a very dominant plot line.
