The telenovela about a married woman from a small town (Kay Francis) who works at the local newspaper kiosk, is presented as the protagonist of his local game house, but dreams of becoming a star on Broadway. When a famous actor who is a ham, a windbag and a womanizer arrives in the city, she visits him in his room with the dreams that he gives her tips to stardom. She pretends that her valet is her "manager" tricking her into believing. She has everything that is needed but the "experience" to become a big star. Her husband finds out and punches the man resulting in the actor's unexpected death, leading to a murder trial and even more unexpected: a sentence of life imprisonment for her husband. The next thing you know is that she joined a traveling Burlesque show hoping to one day get to Broadway and earn enough money to get her man's freedom, as long as her baby sleeps in a trunk! <br /> <br /> This movie has a very interesting plot, well, maybe a bit exaggerated, but very melodramatic (with tons of melodramatic music to make sure you get it): everything * greatly * enhanced by the strong and emotional performance of Kay Francis. This movie is also helping here with the well-done performance of Minna Gombell in her role as "lady close to forty" who works in the burlesque and becomes friends with Kay. It's worth seeing, especially for Kay Francis fans.
