This movie is absolutely hilarious. His cast immediately clicks with the first frame and takes us on a wonderful journey through the fake gangster movies. The conflict between brother and brother appears when Johnny's brother becomes a blessed D.A. However, the best character is Johnny's rival, Moroni too accentuated. As Johnny says: "That man must be arrested for killing the English language." <br /> <br /> Check it in the video. It is worth taking a look.
