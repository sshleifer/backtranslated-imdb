After being forced to sit through some real stinkers (Racing Stripes, Shark Boy and Lava Girl) - I really enjoyed watching "Fried Worms". For once, I did not guess the end! It was fun and entertaining and did not resort to a lot of rude humor, despite the title. My children (6 and 10) also LOVED it - ah, and my 45 year old "boy" had a smile on his face all the time. This is a family movie that is not only tolerable for parents. The relationship with the little brother is very close to real life. "He's not going to stop singing just to annoy me !!" In addition, the way in which the new child tries to make friends and the way in which they really form is the way children behave. Of course, parents have to act a bit silly, but my favorite scenes implied that dad got used to his new job. Have fun!
