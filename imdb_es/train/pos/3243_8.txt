Do you remember the first days of Pay Per View? I do, and I can almost remember the number I had to CALL to rent the movie on their TV. As a child we always wanted to rent playboy, but this meant actually calling someone from PPV and asking to rent it. And then you get the nerve to do it and you're watching four hours of soft core with no shit angle. Well, the reason I mention that is because this movie was also in ppv. And I remember almost all the scenes that were in the add-on. In recent years I've been on a good kick to get all the great movies I use to see when I was a kid and this was one of them. It is one that, when switched on, is difficult to turn off. All the cast of stars trying to make the perfect bank bust, but nothing goes well. There are a lot of false bank capers that are good and this has to fall into that category. He has enough action and laughs to hold it. Take a look if you dare!
