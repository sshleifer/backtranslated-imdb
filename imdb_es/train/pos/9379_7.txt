The more I see Nicholas Cage, the more I appreciate him as an actor. Watching this movie now (in 2005), I can see that it really does not fit the genre of the films that came out in the early 90s. I really do not think it can be considered a black cinema, but sometimes it's quite dark, mainly due to the lighting and the strange personalities of the characters. <br /> <br /> Typical performances of each of the three main Actors, all did a good job with their roles. However, I thought that the characters of Hopper and Boyle were not developed, since sometimes it was difficult to understand what they were doing and why they were doing it. Hopper is to love him or hate him. The plot is really good, and although I found some parts were not realistic, there were parts in which I had to give it to the director (that is, when he saw the sheriff for the first time). All in all, this movie is definitely worth seeing. *** 1/2
