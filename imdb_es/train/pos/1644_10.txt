I saw the last half of this movie about a year ago and I was very happy to find it on DVD. Recently, I saw several reality series on PBS about livestock, etc. None of them came as close to telling the story as this movie. Based on real reality, without jerking, bleak, happy, tragic and enlightening, this is a film that should be shown to students or anyone interested in early life on the border. The good performance of Rip Torn and Conchata Ferrell adds to a well done script. The opening credit indicates that it was made through funds provided through the National Fund for the Humanities. If this is the type of product that could be taxed, I would love to see more. I recommend it a lot and I would recommend people to tell a friend if they have seen and enjoyed the movie.
