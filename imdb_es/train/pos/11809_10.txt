Dick Tracy was not the best for many comics fans, because they wanted something bloody like Batman. Dick Tracy interprets the innocence of just being a comic with villains who have a serious appearance disorder and be fun. Warren Beatty directs and stars the main character who fights crime without even using superpowers. I have liked Dick Tracy since he was a child because of the comical atmosphere of the main colors: red, blue, orange, yellow, green and black. This is the perfect movie for anyone to see with their children. Al Pacino is like Jack Nicholson in Batman and plays with Big Boy Caprice with enthusiasm. Madonna, like the girl who is the second villain in this movie, does not play with the same toy she represents. As I said, there is no blood, obscenities, sexual innuendos or anything that offends anyone.
