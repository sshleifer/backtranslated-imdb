Say what you want about Andy Milligan, but if your family were 10% as upset as this movie, well, then I guess it could have been worse. Unfortunately, the video printing of this film contains insertions of sex scenes originally taken by the distributor to increase the attractiveness of the photo box office. Several times during the film, Milligan's ugly camera work and the silent film music end abruptly, and suddenly the handsome gamblers for Milligan's home actors take over and start playing the psychedelic guitar of the 60s. It's easy enough to move quickly if you're trying to pay attention to Milligan's original movie, which, unfortunately, lacks a lot of action that was cut to make room for the extra sex scenes. What remains, however, remains convincing things. I do not think I've seen a more hateful mother in any movie before.
