"Hollywood Hotel" is a Warners musical comedy that is quickly overlooked, exuberant and wonderfully entertaining. It must be remembered if only for the official theme of Tinseltown: "Hurray for Hollywood!". The score of Richard Whiting and Johnny Mercer has a number of other gems, however, such as the charming "I'm like a fish out of water" and "Silhouetted in the light of the moon." The best musical number is "Let That Be Be A Lesson to You", in which Dick Powell and company detail the misadventures of the people who were "behind the eight ball", a fate that literally happens to Edgar Kennedy in the end number The image celebrates the glamor of Hollywood and punctures everything at once, since it gets a lot of comics from pompous actors and ego maniacs and duplicate studio executives. The cast includes a pack of great character comedians: Allyn Joslyn as an astute press agent, Ted Healy as the possible manager of Dick Powell, Fritz Feld as an excitable restaurant customer, Glenda Farrell as the sarcastic gal Friday of Mona Marshall, Edgar Kennedy as a driver, Mabel Todd as Mona's dumb sister, and Hugh Herbert as his even dumbest father. The "racist" element mentioned in another review here is a ten-second bit in which Herbert appears on the black face during a pseudo sequence of "Gone with the Wind." It has a questionable flavor, but it should not stop you from seeing the other delights of this movie, especially the Benny Goodman Quartet (including Teddy Wilson and Lionel Hampton!) In what I think is the only recording available in this incredible jazz combo. The sequence of "Dark Eyes" is prolonged a bit and comes too late, but, otherwise, "Hollywood Hotel" is a jewel that is worth it, and certainly a movie that should be considered for the release of the DVD.
