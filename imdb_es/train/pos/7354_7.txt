The first time I saw this film more than 25 years ago on British television, last week I found it again on a DVD copy purchased on eBay. I remembered the musical sequences, the color and the beautiful postures of the fashion plates, but the plot is weaker than the previous Anna Neagle / Michael Wilding movie in Park Lane and Maytime does not resist so well over the years. . But Michael Wilding is a joy in the film, charming, fun, elegant, seems to be having a lot of fun and above his form. It's worth seeing for him alone. Anna Neagle appears a bit aloof at her side, and a little too old for the role she plays, but by the end of the 1940s her film association was well established with the fact that cinema was public. The spring in Park Lane had been a great success for 1947 and a great money maker. In his autobiography, Wilding wrote at length for his great respect for Herbert Wilcox, the director and instigator of this series of London films.
