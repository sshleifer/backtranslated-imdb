The success of John Van Druten Broadway appears on the screen with a maximum of star power in this romantic fantasy about a modern witch that deceives a successful Manhattan publishing house. James Stewart can get a higher turnover, but it is Kim Novak who steals the show as one of the most attractive witches to cast a spell on the movie screen. The pairing of leaders is, in fact, one of the film's few weaknesses: Stewart, gray-haired, seems a bit old for the role, and although it's easy to see why he falls in love with Novak, it's a little harder to understand what she does He finds attractive in him, since they do not seem to match in temperament and perspective. (One of the funny concepts in the story is that witches and witches are represented as beatniks and bohemians of Greenwich Village). Interestingly, the Stewart-Novak pairing would generate much more heat in "Vertigo", released the same year as this movie, then "Vertigo" had a compelling suspense story, and the benefit of the direction of Alfred Hitchcock. <br /> <br /> The comic moments of the film are mostly provided by the star-supporting cast, including a young Jack Lemmon (as Kim's brother), Elsa Lanchester (his aunt goddess) and Ernie Kovacs ( !) As a dazed writer. Hermione Gingold even appears in a hilarious cameo as a kind of Great Witch. There are many things that I like about this movie (wit, romance and a great cast), if you can look away from the lovely Miss Novak. I've seen the movie half a dozen times, and I can never.
