['This movie is smart. That is, more than most other films, it transcends the less common denominator: stupid people probably will not appreciate it. History is also based largely on dialogue. It has some parallels with Lost in Translation, although Before Sunrise is much brighter, somewhat less abstract and, simply, much better. <br /><br /> The script, the characters and even the slightly surreal atmosphere feel totally realistic. The actors play absolutely brilliant. I have rarely seen a film in which the script and the performance have merged perfectly. <br /><br /> The dialogue moves on very personal issues, with the risk of becoming a little exaggerated. However, it remains on the right side almost all the time, although I found it a little uncomfortable and embarrassing. The balance in this fine line requires scandalously talented actors. Sometimes, it produces excellent results and, in general, this movie is just great! Only very, very rarely there is &quot;love&quot; in the films represented in a way that seems reliable and realistic. Each time it is achieved, the result is fantastic. I think the stunning and seemingly timeless beauty of the main actress helped a lot in this regard. She looks impressive in this movie, 12 years later. <br /><br /> This is simply a jewel of a movie that you can not miss. One of the best movies I&#39;ve seen since the 1990s!']
