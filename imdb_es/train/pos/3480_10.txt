This is the best comedy I've seen! But not everyone can understand this, you must be from Georgia to understand this incredible movie! :) Overall, it's one of the best movies I've seen ......... Vachtangi (Benjamin) and all the supporting actors who play very well, but the performance of Kote Daoshvili (Father Germogel) is, in my opinion, the best performance in the supporting role in film history :)) in this film playing many Georgian stars like ipolite xvichia, sergo Zakariadze, sofiko chiaureli, verikoan djafaridze, Sesilia Takaishvili, Dodo Abashidze ... all they are stars in the Georgian cinematography :) more in this film is playing the great Russian star Evgeni Leonov and, of course, the director of the film Georgy Danelia is one of the best ... I recommend this movie for everyone, but remember that you must Know a good Russian language to watch this movie.
