The Sopranos is perhaps the most amazing series you could wish to see. It's smart, it's quirky, it's fun, and it carries the mafia genre so well that most people can not resist looking. The best aspect of this show is the overwhelming realism of the characters, set in the underground world of the crime families of New York. For most of the time, you really do not know if the wise will stab someone in the back or buy them lunch. <br /> <br /> In addition to the realistic approach of the characters in this show is the depth of their personalities: these are dangerous men, most of them murderers, but by God if you do not love them too. I have laughed at their jokes, they have torn me when they have made a mistake of judgment and I have been frightened by the cruelty of a serious criminal. <br /> <br /> The suburban environment of New Jersey is absolutely perfect for the subtext of this program: people are not always what they seem, and the contrast between the monotony and the actions taken by these apparently petty criminals reach weigh the odds. <br /> <br /> If you have not done it yet, you should definitely.
