What can be said about Mr. Moore? He's the godfather of rap, the king of the Z-level blaxploitation movies, and here, he's back as his most famous character, Dolemite! Can you dig? This movie is a crazy roller coaster of politically incorrect humor, trippy kung-fu, nudity, cheese, violence and many other things you would never find in most modern movies (or any movie, actually, haha!). The routine of standing that gives at the beginning can not be lost. In any case, D2 is definitely an entertaining way to lose about an hour. Dolemite: "He thinks he's bad and he has no class! I'm going to throw this shotgun in his * bip * to **!"
