This could not have been better. The strong restrictions on Mike Sullivan's expressions could not have been represented otherwise. Tom Hanks delivers the best performance of his career. The young Tyler Hoechlin runs an emotional wheel; playing the base character for the story. And the veteran Paul Newman offers one of his best interpretations of characters in a long time. <br /> <br /> This movie is based on a bold graphic novel by Max Allan Collins and Richard Piers Rayner. This is a father / son story that basically employs the two candidates who are not fit for the roles. Mike Sullivan had no father when he was a child, so John Rooney welcomed him. Although he was a generous man, Mr. Rooney was involved in organized crime. Therefore, Sullivan's debt should only be paid by getting involved in the business. Now, Sullivan has a wife and two children and is trying to keep his children safe, but at the same time, return his boss. The events that will follow will test Sullivan's loyalty and embrace the fate of his family. <br /> <br /> With a great adaptation of David Self, the dialogue rarely comes out, but very virtuous. The story unfolds in a beautiful 1930s setting (Brilliant Art Direction by Richard L. Johnson and Nancy Haigh) covered with a dark, rainy exterior (snow on the ground). Driving history, is the wonderful Irish score by Thomas Newman, which is installed only when necessary. <br /> <br /> But the most important technical element of the film is the beautiful photograph of Conrad L. Hall. This is one of the best movies I've seen; And I see many movies. The scene when Mike and Michael are in the car, entering Chicago is quite impressive. The shot starts at the front of the car, revealing Mike (Hanks) through the windshield. Later, it moves towards the side of the car, to see Michael (Hoechlin) wake up and look out the side window. As it continues, it moves sideways and the wheels move back, completely around the car and reveal a beautiful scenic Chicago from the 1930s. <br /> <br /> With a great cast and crew, the main man create a blatantly incredible movie. I'm talking about Sam Mendes, who made his film debut in 1999 with American Beauty. (he won several awards) Before American Beauty, Mendes worked as a theater director for the British Theater, but decided that he wanted to move forward by saying there was nothing new for him in the theater. With only two films, Sam Mendes has been marked in my book as one of the great directors (in a list of about twenty-five). <br /> <br /> The film illuminates a brazen genre that has its successes and is lost. and expresses the true subject in a brilliant way. Photography, acting and history is phenomenal. I am still waiting for Scorcesee's Gangs of New York, but for now, I have full confidence in saying that this is the "Best Movie of the Year". Taking into account that the competition (Signs, Insomnia, Minority Report) is a solid statement.
