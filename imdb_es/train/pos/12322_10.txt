This movie is one of my favorites. It's a mix of genre with Action- / Horror- / Romantic- / Comedygenre ingredients. Some of the special effects may seem obsolete compared to modern standards. This minor defect is easily ignored. There is much to discover in this story. The romantic relationship between the two main characters is so beautiful that it hurts. The images are beautiful too. The action is excellent, which is not a surprise, it originates in Honkong, the birthplace of the best action movies in the world. Humor sometimes seems a bit silly but in a good way. Somehow this movie is able to balance the different moods and is still good. Absolutely recommended.
