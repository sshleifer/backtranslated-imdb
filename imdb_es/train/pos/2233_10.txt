The first time I saw this movie was in the 1980s and now, in 2006, this movie is still one of the best movies I've seen! I would recommend to anyone who watches this movie. You will not regret. It is well represented, it is such a real moment and never boring. The acting is excellent and the location makes the movie look like you're there. From the beginning to the end, this movie is the kind that makes you lose attention. The actress does an excellent job portraying the girl who survived this horrific plane crash in the Amazon and shows how she managed to survive in the Amazon alone. It's amazing that someone can survive in such conditions. This is why this movie is so attractive. The fact that this is a true story makes the film even more interesting and to think that a little girl could survive this terrible experience is overwhelming. I find this movie that I can see again and again and one that I never get tired of. This is a great compliment since I have hundreds of movies! I would say that this is probably my favorite movie and the best I've seen!
