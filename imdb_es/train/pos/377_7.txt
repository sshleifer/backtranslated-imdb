Genteel, Steven Spielberg's drama, softly spoken, was his first real adventure in this genre. A departure from his normal / fantasy adventure, paved the way for his success in 1993, "Schindler's List". <br /> <br /> Based on Alice Walder's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, the story is about the arranged marriage of a hardship girl to a brutal and angry farmer and her painful separation from her beloved younger sister Nettie. While the plot (about compassion, abuse and the power of love to heal all wounds) is often powerful and moving, it is lost because of the continuity and script of Menno Meyjes. "The color purple" is sometimes difficult to follow and on one or more occasions it tends to be a bit erratic with respect to the time frame. This lapse in the scripts has cost the viewer the depth and detail obviously present in Miss Walker's novel. A real pity that the teacher Spielberg has not been able to detect and rectify these problems, since most of the show is a wonderful example of his skill as a director. <br /> <br /> Performances are strong everywhere, with Whoopi Goldberg making a Debut, which she has never equaled from the point of view of acting, like the torn Celie who longs to be loved. Danny Glover lends a solid support, although his "Moses" was a superior turn for him in "Places in the Heart". The outstanding sample comes from the unannounced Oprah Winfrey as Miss Sophia, the only black wrestling woman whose spirit is crushed by a terrible incident involving a white woman of high class and condescending. Good support also from Margaret Avery, Adolph Caesar and Rae Dawn Chong. <br /> <br /> Quincy Jones (co-producer of Spielberg, Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall) has written a beautifully melodic score and has also provided some original blues for The occasion. The Michael Kahn edition is a sound as always, while the director of photography Allen Daviau shows a consummate skill in capturing some glorious southern landscapes. <br /> <br /> This true matter of the heart will surely bring a tear to the eye, it is unfortunately, we are left with many unanswered questions. <br /> <br /> Wednesday, January 15, 1997 - Video
