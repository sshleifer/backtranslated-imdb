['This is different from any other movie, the closest thing to what I can compare it to is a Woody Allen movie ... But while Woody Allen is constantly understanding human weaknesses, Bret Carr seems to be trying to find a way to deal with that. An overwhelming insecurity that tends to define us for good or for bad. In the case of Lou, it is the root cause of his stuttering, which goes back to a singular childhood hood trauma that is revealed through flash backs. <br /><br /> There are so many strangely neurotic people in the world and I think they all deserve an opportunity for redemption, although the diversity of human character is what makes the world such an intriguing place, so maybe we should not correct our neurosis any more than we do . We should fix our noses or breasts. <br /><br /> This is an independent film shot with a lot of time, but the production values are tremendous, as is the scope of the film. I feel it is a peculiar jewel for the self-help market. I really want to see what this filmmaker does next, I can imagine a career similar to Woody Allen or Albert Brooks, but usually when a guy like this makes his way, he goes and makes &quot;X MEN&quot; and his humble peculiarity . the origins are soon forgotten or are ... X Men is a lot of monsters if I remember correctly :)']
