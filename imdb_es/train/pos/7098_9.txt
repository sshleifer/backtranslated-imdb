"Twelve Monkeys" has all the elements to become the masterpiece of Terry Gilliam. An outstanding script, a sustained rhythm, witty and sometimes ironic dialogues. Also, he had a good nose in the cast. "Twelve monkeys" is also the first film in which Bruce Willis moves away from the type of character he used to play in his previous films. Here, a jaded and hopeless character who could be nicknamed a prisoner took charge of an intrepid and invincible hero (as was the case in "Die Hard"). No matter how he tries, he is a prisoner of the time. The movie also has a very exciting ending. It has a real dramatic power. But this excellent film is also a reflection on man, the dangers that he fears (in particular, those that could cause the end of the world and here, these are viruses that can create diseases). No matter how long it takes, "twelve monkeys" will be estimated at its true value: one of the masterpieces made in the nineties.
