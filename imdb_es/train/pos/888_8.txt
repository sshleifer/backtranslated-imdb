One of the best kung fu movies, but not as impeccable as I expected, given the enthusiastic reviews. The film starts well enough, the jokes are visual enough to translate the language barrier (which is rarer than one might think in this era) and make the non-fighting dialogue sequences passable (for a Kung Fu movie, this is a great compliment). Unlike other Chinese action films, which were always period works or police dramas, Pedicab Driver offers us a look at contemporary rural China. Unfortunately, in the last 1/3 of the film he got into the tragedy of the dark melodrama, which I thought was unnecessary. <br /> <br /> The action is good in general, with a duel between Sammo and 1/2 of the 2 stars of Shaw Brothers, Kar-Leung Lau and then a fight at the end with that taller boy who always plays with the bad guy Jet Li. Here there are only 20 minutes of combat, which is standard, but what bothers me is the obvious acceleration of the camera frames. I understand that they have to shoot at half the speed to avoid hurting each other, but there are smooth issues and then there is this. It really gets away from the fights when it's obvious that the footage was messy. <br /> <br /> That said, if you like kung fu movies, my opinion here will not dissuade you, and if you do not do it. , you only lost 2 minutes of your life reading this.
