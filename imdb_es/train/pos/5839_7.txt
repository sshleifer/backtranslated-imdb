The last (I think) of the movies The Boys made with Hal Roach, this is also the last really funny movie they did, before going to the 20th century fox, which so famously mistreated their talents. Although there are weak moments, the business with the "lung tester", for example, is a little exaggerated (but it's worth having it, just to see "Dr." Jimmy Finlayson), but in general this movie is A good summary of what the boys brought to the screen. Richard Cramer (uncredited) appeared in other L & H movies, and is deliciously threatening here as the convict Nick Granger. The scene in which The Boys have to eat their own synthetic food ("It looks good, smells good and probably tastes good, eat it") is one of my favorite moments in the play. Stan and Ollie will always be pleasant companions in the lives of their millions of devoted fans.
