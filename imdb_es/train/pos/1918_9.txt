I'll be honest with you, I was a high school student in high school when this comedy was first aired on ABC. I did not think I would like it at all. But with John Ritter in it I felt that it had a bit of potential, plus there was something else that I liked. The acting was great, not many of the horrible comedy lines ranked second, John Ritter always brings his A game when it comes to comedy. This was a great show to watch, and I'll tell you why it was a great show. My father, who never sees comedies, just watches movies, sports, and law and order, he actually sat with my 3 brothers and 2 sisters, my mother and I, and I watched the show, I think, because John Ritter was in that. Sincerely, I believe that this program would still be underway if John Ritter God rested his soul, I wish he had not passed away.
