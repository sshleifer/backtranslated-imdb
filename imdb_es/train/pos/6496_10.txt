['Example of how to make a documentary of the Second World War, using first-hand accounts of the troops and real civilians who participated in this terrible conflict, and the archived images compiled from the time. I realized this in a replay on the History channel about a year and a half ago, not really knowing World War II at the time, but it engulfed me, and now I consider myself a World War II fan, observing and reading everything you can find about it, but nothing comes close to this historical documentary, it&#39;s definitely worth buying the game in box ............. <br /><br /> This is, simply, the documentary realization of the highest level.']
