Only occasionally do we get a R rated comedy that gets everyone's time and attention. It's an even rarer case when critics are going to like it. I just returned from The 40 Year Old Virgin and I can honestly say it was one of the biggest laughs of my life. I went to a sample of 10:35 and each row was full. Not only that, they all laughed all the time. It's two hours of non-stop laughter. I encourage you to watch this movie and do not laugh. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple. A man is forty years old and a virgin. However, behind this simple five-second joke, we received a deep and complex story that is not only one of the funniest you have witnessed, but has genuine lessons. Steve Carell plays Andy Stitzer, the 40-year-old virgin. We've known Steve Carell as, in my opinion, one of the best scene thieves of all time. Steve Carell has come a long way, stealing the hilarious scenes of Bruce Almighty and especially of Anchorman, as finally, and with pride, he is given his moment to shine like the star. No one will forget his name once he witnesses this hilarious, funny and heartbreaking comedy that goes through the bowels. <br /> <br /> The beauty of the movie is that it is not 100% stupid. The brilliant writing of Judd Apatow and Steve Carell really has a purpose and is not just an incredible story to tell. Behind the crudeness and the vulgar and uninterrupted walk of the film, there is an important lesson to learn. Although it is not presented in the best possible way, the film gives us more than a purely pleasant time. Your dexterity attitude will make you laugh all the time, while at the same time we see the real-life struggles of people like Andy and his co-workers. The ending could not have been better. Not only does it fulfill what was promised, but it also offers one of the most memorable final numbers a comedy has ever seen. It would have been perfect if there was Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson in the place somehow, but you can not beat them all, now you can. <br /> <br /> Finally, I think that, as Roger Ebert said, Catherine Keener gives an inexplicable perfect performance like Trish, the only woman for whom Andy really has her heart. She not only gives us laughs, but it is also crazy to see how bright the story is. She was chosen for the role and she and Carell have an excellent and funny chemistry on the screen. <br /> <br /> Regarding the Canadian rankings, once again, Ontario escapes with a 14A, while British Columbia, Alberta and Manitoba slapped the 40-year-old Virgin with an 18A. The same thing happened with Four Brothers, in my opinion, the second best movie of the year, and I can honestly say that I love Ontario more and more because of that. To all of you, fellow teenagers, in the United States: Good luck in secret! <br /> <br /> In general, Steve Carell offers one of the funniest performances I've seen and almost everyone in the cast distributes the laugh without stopping. Everyone will love the 40-year-old Virgin this summer and I encourage them to see it as quickly as humanly possible. It's the best comedy of the year, no doubt. It surpasses The Longest Yard, The Wedding Crashers and, of course, Comat, the last memorable comedy of Apatow and Carell, Anchorman. <br /> <br /> It's a comic book masterpiece and deserves the remarkable amount of praise from critics who have been loving it. Each of my favorite reviewers loved it and deserves a place in the Top 250 of IMDb immediately. Steve Carell is a great star. Look at one of the brightest of summer at this time. <br /> <br /> My rating: 9/10 <br /> <br /> Objectively? 9/10 <br /> <br /> Subjectively ?? 10/10 <br /> <br /> Eliason A.
