Saving Grace is a movie to feel good with your heart in the right place. Grace is a widow recently and realizes that her late husband left her with many debts. She could lose her beautiful home and see no other solution to her misery than to start growing marijuana. She lives in a beautiful village where most of the viewers would love to live and the villagers are wonderful people, most of the viewers would love to have as neighbors. There is only one wrong thing in this image and that is the way it portrays the effect that marijuana has on its user. It is obvious that none of the actors or writers of this film really smoked that material. The way villagers act after smoking a joint is ridiculous and only supposedly funny. It is precisely in these scenes that ingenuity is replaced by the English slapstick, and that is a pity in a film that, however, is very pleasant.
