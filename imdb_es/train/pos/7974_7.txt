I found this movie like the usual French slap in the face of America. The camera, too often, focuses on fat people, careless homes and rural areas of bad taste. While the narrative seems to sympathize with and admire the people of the small cities that present themselves to the viewer, the cinematography exploits them and belittles them. Undoubtedly, there were thin people to see in Glencoe and orderly and organized homes, but Malle chose to show us the worst of what there was to see. <br /> <br /> I can only hope that some American filmmakers will go to France to reveal their worst elements to the American public. I can assure you, as a frequent visitor in France, that all is not well there. Foreign immigrants are not easily assimilated, which creates serious social inequalities. But Americans are not eager to unmask the French because of their prejudice towards their own countrymen and their envy towards the United States, so we are not likely to see films on the subject.
