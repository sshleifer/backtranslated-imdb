Once in Life means that once a bully, always a bully, and no one enters or leaves 'The Life' for free. Bullies in New York neighborhoods sell drugs and administer scams because they can not do it in the legitimate world, maybe because they have a criminal record, or a drug habit, or simply because they are lazy. This simple story with a couple of turns about mostly despicable characters manages to attract the audience's compassion towards their main players due to their loyalty and compassion for others. The film is written, produced and directed by Laurence Fishburne, who also plays 20/20 Mike (all thugs have nicknames), and is based on his work, "Riff Raff". It feels like a play from start to finish, especially during the longest scene where the three main players face each other to decide who can be trusted. Many times, the dialogue arrives very fast, much faster than on the stage, and I think it is the biggest flaw in the movie. Mixed as flashbacks throughout the film are the poems of the street, a kind of iambic rapper pentameter, which is violent and reminiscent of the world that this film reveals. Poetry makes it difficult to dismiss these men, these thugs who are murdered, cheat and betray each other, as unworthy of our attention or below our contempt. The worrying thing about this film is that its realism shows us not only how these people live, but also how they suffer for the same reasons that we do. One is too stupid, another is a drug addict, and the last one suffers from conscience while the public asks, or even laughs, about the irony of the executioners who ask him to hang on the gallows to tell jokes in the middle of his death.
