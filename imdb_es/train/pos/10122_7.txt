I found this a little hard to follow as it seemed to sink in the middle as I tried to discover who was fighting who and why. One of the problems is the cultural / language. Here we have a Chinese / Taiwanese / Japanese problem that we know little about and because we are simply reading the English subtitles, we inevitably lose some of the subtleties. Another problem is that there seems to be too many turns and coincidences half explained. However, it seems unlikely that there is a totally bad Miiki movie and this certainly is not that. A lot of violence with style and crunch of bones, a window to some unorthodox sexual acts, plus the familiar aspect. In general, a decent walk, but maybe reviewing the history could be useful before seeing this.
