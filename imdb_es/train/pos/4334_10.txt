['Who would not want to go on a trip with Peter Falk? The right eye of that type has more character than most of today&#39;s actors. This is the kind of funny and moving movie that we are all looking for as a counterweight to all boring special effects. Women are going to love all the awakening advice for men, and men will love it for their successful study of father / son characters, one small big scene after another. And it has enough advantage to be a true indie find. Obviously, this is a work of love for Paul Reiser, who understands what it is to be a father and son, as well as having laughs and tears as he goes through life. The funniest part, however, was watching Reiser look at Falk. You could say that it was his character who came to a new appreciation of his father and a fellow actor who really enjoys the special art of Peter Falk. Really charming Hopefully this movie will hit theaters across the country soon so that everyone can have a chance to laugh and cry with Paul Reiser and the people.']
