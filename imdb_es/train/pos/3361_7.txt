He intended to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the death of Marcello Mastroianni with numerous unseen films of his property on VHS; However, given my joyful Christmas marathon, I had to settle for this alone! It happens that he presents one of his best performances, and was just nominated for the Oscar for it (with the same honored film). This was also one of the 14 collaborations with the other most recognized star in emerging from Italy, Sophia Loren; both, by the way, are playing against the guy here, she as a housewife without glamor and he a homosexual! <br /> <br /> By the way, the title of the film has a double meaning: the main characters meet on the historic day when Hitler arrived in Italy to meet Mussolini (the event itself is shown in a long archival archive), but it refers more specifically to the '' brief encounter '' of the stars in which they share moments of friendship, revelation and, briefly, passion - although each one knows that a return to normal existence is inevitable, which leads to the abrupt bitter-sweet end of the film. . This is virtually a two-person game (with all the other characters, except for the nosy concierge of the apartment block in which the story unfolds in its entirety), which includes Loren's abrupt and fervent patriotic husband, played surprisingly by John Vernon, only appears in the start and end sequences); even so, the crowded environment does not dissuade director Scola (for the record, this is his seventh film I've seen and I have 3 more on VHS) and the director of photography Pasqualino De Santis, so the result, although essentially low Clave : it is far from being stagy: the camera can wander through the different sections of the large building, observing the process in an intimate or dispassionate way when the situation requires it, but always with great interest. <br /> <br /> The narrative, of course, depends entirely on the performance of the two stars to make it convincing, and both deliver (their chemistry on the screen is quite incomparable); It is interesting, however, that while Loren took the awards on her own turf, it is the strange but unsentimental one of Mastroianni (the film, in a way, seems to equate her sexual deviation with antifascism) that generally impressed international audiences!
