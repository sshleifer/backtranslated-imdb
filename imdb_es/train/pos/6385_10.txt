This movie was great! It was an excellent version of an ancient myth. The animation was strange, but nothing new from Disney. It was definitely better than expected for a Disney movie without singing. <br /> <br /> The background animation was magical. It was a different level of work for the people of Disney. Some of the characters were a little square, but they were more than offset by the beauty and exuberance of the landscape. The music was largely instrumental, but that was perfect for the movie. Definitely, this was not a movie that needed the characters to form a song. <br /> <br /> Perfect. 10 out of 10
