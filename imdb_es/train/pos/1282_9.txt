I saw this a couple of times on the Sundance channel several years ago and it received a good cinematic shake in the system. A semi-surrealist but harsh version of the modern media culture (or the lack of it), centered on some very marginalized inhabitants, beyond those furthest from Hollywood. He had a fun early performance by Mark Ruffalo, and a memorable DP cinematography that made the films of the Polish brothers. There was a wild and committed mood and a strangely original feeling that definitely differentiated him. This movie had a cult classic everywhere, and I'm surprised it's not yet on DVD. <br /> <br /> Hopefully soon.
