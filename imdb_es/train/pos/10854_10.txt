This series could be the best Britcom of all time, and that is saying a lot, considering the competitors (Fawlty Towers, Good Neighbors, to name just two). <br /> <br /> What made Butterflies so superior, even The best of the best is that he not only exemplified a great, classic, elegant and intelligent comedy, but also expanded the horizons, reflecting, without fail, with softness and in every detail, the great social change that was taking place in Britain. The time. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing this program when I was a teenager and I was amazed by everything related to it. The lifestyle represented was remarkable in itself. This was the first time I saw real people using cordless phones. And the wardrobe of all the characters was far removed from the attire of the seventies that was still seen in North America at that time. Then there were the decorations, facades, cars. These people, even the lay children, with their philosophical approach to life and epigrammatic humor, were sophisticated. They were examples of "new Europeans" who would have an impact on life and style around the world in the next decade (1980s). <br /> <br /> Of course, the premise was strange and fantastic. The idea that someone who was living the suburban dream could be so dissatisfied and restless was revolutionary, particularly for Americans to whom happiness was always defined as money and things (surely the situation was shown in American movies and television, but not with intensity). of butterflies or the movie montenegro). And, if the premise was not surprising enough, the means by which he expressed it took him to the extreme. A potential issue that was not really about sex, or even romance? The butterflies dazzled many, but it must have left some people beating their foreheads with disbelief ... at that moment anyway. <br /> <br /> Butterflies turned out to be, in many ways, prophetic. He documented, before his time, postmodern boredom, omnipresent lifestyle, the notion of emotional infidelity and generational disengagement and male discontent (perfectly portrayed by tense parent-child relationships). It is a pity that this series has not been rediscovered to a large extent, and all those involved receive credit for creating a significant snapshot of a certain time and place, and for foreseeing all the cunning and anguish that would come.
