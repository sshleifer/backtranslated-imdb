Cassandra Peterson originally created Elvira as the hostess of the night's horror films, and when the character became unexpectedly popular, she suddenly found herself doing everything from beer commercials to spots on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson. It reached the peak of its popularity at the end of the decade of 1980, and the result was the film ELVIRA, MISTRESS OF THE DARK. <br /> <br /> The argument is the flyweight. The presenter of the horror film Elvira dreams of success in Las Vegas. When her great-aunt dies, she travels to New England with the hope that the farm will provide enough money to support a theatrical show; She is disappointed to discover that she has inherited a ruined house, a poodle and an old book. It happens that the town is puritanical beyond description, and it provokes just indignation wherever it goes. It also happens that his great uncle is secretly an evil sorcerer and is very determined to get his hands on the "old book". Add a few teenagers, a muffin, and a hateful woman with fakes, and there you are. <br /> <br /> No one would accuse him of being a cinematic masterpiece, and he crawls from time to time. But Cassandra Peterson shows great talent from beginning to end: twisted, sexy and mixing humor with flashes of sharp comedy, dances through the film like a master of ceremonies in a joke circus and often mocks herself . From a FLASHDANCE disaster to the witchcraft craze, she is never less than tremendously entertaining. It is a tremendous fun, and the conclusion of the film even manages to generate considerable suspense. Will Elvira beat her evil uncle and save the day? Well, I do not want to reveal anything, so let's say you'll have a lot of fun discovering it. <br /> <br /> The quality of the DVD is fine and there is little extra material, but if you're in the mood for something silly, it will respond to the desire. And if you've never seen tassle-twirling, you're on a whim. Recommended. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Reviewer
