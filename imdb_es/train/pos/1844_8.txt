['I was not sure if this was going to be another of those idiotic nighttime soap operas that seem to saturate the primetime, but it turns out that this is a pretty good show (not only thanks to the talent of the casting). Four friends with diverse backgrounds meet and share the weekly events of their love lives. The one-hour program follows each of them separately through their often complicated missions to find love and does it without being boring or trite. &quot;Trudi&quot; by Sharon Small is one of the housewives (supposedly a widow after September 11) who has a bit of preaching and is upset with her friends (who tend to be a little more relaxed and more creative in their efforts) . It&#39;s great to see Small back on television, since she was great at &quot;Inspector Lynley Mysteries.&quot; The girl can act. The character of Orla Brady (Siobhan, a lawyer) is perhaps the most damaged but still very sympathetic to women, as she struggles with her husband Hari (Jaffrey, formerly known as &quot;Spooks&quot;), struggling with her desire to have a Child with her, regardless of their needs. The last two cast members are the effervescent Jess (Shellie Conn), an event planner who is a wild child who sleeps with each and every one, the genre is not specific, and Katie, (Sarah Parrish) a grim doctor who has a relationship with a patient AND His son has sent his career and his love life out of control. That said, I&#39;m hooked now and I hope the BBC continues to release this series because it&#39;s good, it&#39;s different and it has a great cast.']
