Diane Keaton has played some "heavy" roles in her many years on the big screen, but is known mainly for the "light and fluffy" things with Woody Allen, such as Annie Hall. She deserves an Oscar for best actress in a drama for this effort and it does not really matter what competition was the year she was presented for the first time. Try to find a scene where it does not appear. And everything was a heavy drama, exhausting in its rhythm and take, action, everything at full speed. The make-up made her as young as possible and she adjusted to the category of 30 years even in close-ups, but she played half her age and at a very fast pace. The film, in general, was pretty well done, organized and filmed well with a solid cast of support, but Keaton took the load.
