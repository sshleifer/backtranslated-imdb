Gentleman Jim is another of the legend's impression cases, with Errol Flynn playing the legendary boxer as a bold but charismatic social climber in a fun entertainment that barely stops to breathe. It's as futile to look for historical accuracy here as in Flynn's The Charge of the Light Brigade: this is a true Hokum with all the stops removed, filmed on a surprisingly generous scale and with a true sense of energy by the vivid direction of Raoul Walsh . Flynn is still at the height of his powers (he would never imagine that he suffered a mild heart attack during production), with Alexis Smith, a beautiful and romantic sparring partner and perpetual partner Alan Hale, largely as the father this time of Flynn (Jack Carson takes fellow duties this time). In fact, even the pirate galleon from Flynn's previous films makes a cameo out of place in a fight by the dock. The 103 minutes just breeze by.
