I'm not aware of "Largo Winch" as a comic book (or is it a graphic novel? I really do not know), but I must admit that when I heard about an actor / hero movie, I expected something different from what I actually got. <br /> <br /> Although it was surprising to see this at the beginning, it was nice to see how it progressed. You could never really say where you would go (some turns are predictable, but in general, you can never really say, if it will end up going). A more than stellar performance by the main actor and a really good cast, make this a nice watch. Not as full of action as some might expect or expect for a movie like that, but a really good mix.
