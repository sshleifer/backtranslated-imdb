As predictable as a Hallmark card, but not without merit, The Rookie makes a solid start. Dennis Quaid, the most reasonable jock actor who works today, is absolutely perfect when the science teacher became the baseball player Jimmy Morris. The film never remains silent for children, as would be expected from a G-rated film. As a sports movie, The Rookie is one of the best I've seen since Sunday night.
