I do not see soaps. My grandmother still looks at her with the hourglass. I made fun of them when I was ten years old (it was very easy). <br /> <br /> But this movie takes parody and spells it in a new way. I found the story quite funny. The fashions of the 80s - shoulder pads, sequins and polyester - simply top. The enormous hair, the high heels and the histrionics: what combination. <br /> <br /> And all the actors simply go to the city, chew their parts and spit them into a large, well-written pile. Sally, Kevin, Elisabeth - wonderful! Whoopi - great! Robert Downey: refreshing to see him when he had so much potential before the newspapers. And Garry: why did we have to wait so long to see it in a movie? Leesa Gibbons: I had not missed her, but it's nice to include her as a real-life entertainment reporter (and where do you apply for ESE work?). <br /> <br /> It's true that I could have done it without him. Sally climbing the drain. Lucy Ricardo did it, how many times? As every comedian has done, from Carol Burnett until now, I do not know who and I've finished it so much, I could spit peanuts if I had them. Apparently that's what you do when you're being funny in a tall building in New York. I'm just grateful that they did not take the bit from the flagpole. <br /> <br /> But it was nice, it was fun, it had twists in the plot, it had a later credit that ended before it was common, it had clothes worth a second look, it had a great cast and personal memories for me . Really, what else do you need?
