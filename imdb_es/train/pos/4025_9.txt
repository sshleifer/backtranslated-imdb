Magnificent. Initially I thought that, given Amrita Pritam's communist inclination and Dr. Dwivedi's inclined nationalist film, it would be frank rather than novel, but when I read the novel I was surprised to discover that it was the other way around. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to Marita Pritam for not being pseudo-sec and Dr. Dwivedi for being objective. This film touches a sensitive topic in a sensitive way. The victims of any war are women, as one poet said, and this film personifies it. It is also a sad commentary on the Hindu psyche, since they can not oppose the kidnappers of their girls or the Hindu Brother who can only burn the fields of his tormentor. On the other hand, it also shows economic angles behind the partition or, in fact, why the girls were kidnapped in the first place. I believe that the kidnappers thought that by kidnapping the girls they will become the legal owners of the houses and, therefore, a new government. You can not ask them to return the houses. This aside has to salute the courage of the characters of Puro and his Bhabhi, are two simple girls of the town that do not take into account the outside world and risk everything when trying to return after being dishonored. Because there are many documented cases in which these women were not accepted by their families in India. <br /> <br /> No wonder it was necessary for a woman to understand the pains of other women.
