Another one of those movies that you listen to about friends (... or about which you read in IMDb). There are not many false notes in this. I could see that almost everything that is happening here really happens to a girl who runs away from a dead end city in Tennessee, Florida, with all her worldly possessions in an old hit car. <br /> <br /> The heroine, Ruby, makes some false starts, but learns from them. I found myself wondering why, why he did not lean a bit more on Mike's shoulder, but ... it turns out he has his reasons. <br /> <br /> It's just a good movie. The only thing I do not like very much, I think, is the title.
