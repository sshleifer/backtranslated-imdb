A good premise of "race against time": it is found that a murdered John Doe has pneumonic plague, so while the health authority and the NOPD fight together to try to find their contacts on the coast, the murderers believe that the heat is due to the fact that the victim's infected cousin is holding on to them. <br /> <br /> This movie is freely available on the Internet Archive and is worth downloading. A lot (everything?) Of this movie was filmed in genuine New Orleans locations, which makes it interesting to see the details of the time, although for me it seems to be underexposed, even in the case of noir, maybe lighting platforms mobile They were not what they are. There is also a lot of background noise in the location, which is a bit annoying: car horns in the love scene, anyone? There are many non-professional artists who support the crowd scenes, and this may explain why the pace of the film is a bit lazy to begin with, there are not many possibilities of re-taking it or recasting it, although the final chase is worth it . Nor is there much bad with the main actors: Jack Palance is genuinely terrifying as a charismatic and intelligent psychopath; the last scene, while alternately comforting and threatening the sick cousin, is great, while Widmark, as he used to do, launches the just wrath of Man on a mission at a credible level, most of the time. <br /> <br /> Someone should redo this: no supernatural, no mysticism, no special effects, just a good thread full of character conflict and a current issue. Another critic mentioned the writer John Kennedy O'Toole, and that is right with the amount of extravagant types of New Orleans that dot this dark drama, of poor quality and against the clock. There is even a dwarf newspaper vendor. <br /> <br /> "Community? What community? Do you think you live in the Middle Ages?"
