Attractive and innovative! At the beginning of this Whoopi Goldberg film, criminally undervalued, the writers drew a parallel between Theodore Rex and the 1941 Orson Welles classic "Citizen Kane." Writers are justified in drawing a seemingly disparate parallel, but the public who sees it too often becomes a Hollywood fan to appreciate the subtle similarities between these two films. In "Citizen Kane" Charles Foster Kane is feared and admired by his colleagues and his subordinates, much like Whoopi Goldberg in this film. This film tries to find love in everyone's differences. It is an epic examination of the fear of abandonment and the need for love and acceptance in a society dominated by greed and self-absorption. Whoever paired Whoopi Goldberg and Theodore Rex formulated a dyad for ages, with the only justifiable comparisons that are Bogey and Bacall, Hepburn and Tracy and Hall and Oates. If you would love to see an edifying and cellulosic philosophical examination of some of the deepest impulses of humanity; Bergman-esqe but not so depressing, Theodore Rex must be seen immediately!
