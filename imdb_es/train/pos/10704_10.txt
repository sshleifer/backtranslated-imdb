['Are you a giraffe? ... ask John for Nadia, and she, sure to respond well, responds: yes. In this way the communication between a man and a woman who does not know each other begins, and at the same time, the questions and doubts in &quot;Birthday Girl&quot;. A film that I heard many times, but I dare not see ... until two hours write this. <br /><br /> &quot;Birthday Girl&quot; is a passionate movie that makes me realize, at the same time that Nicole Kidman is one of the best actresses (besides being pretty and intelligent) that I&#39;ve seen in my life. &quot;Birthday Girl&quot; is the story of a lonely and routine man looking for a wife on the internet. The woman he meets comes from Russia. She seems to be that delicate, normal woman, no more. One day, his birthday comes suddenly, his cousin and his friend. Man, begins to discover certain things. From here, he will not be the lonely and routine man he has always been. <br /><br /> Many of us are going to think that this movie is just a regular one with an exploited plot. Many of us are going to think that action and emotion are safe and not novel. But &quot;Birthday Girl&quot; is the opposite. This movie is full of good surprises, good performances and an imaginative plot that I had never seen and imagined. This romantic thriller with a certain funny touch is an excellent natural movie with many proposals for films of this type. &quot;Birthday Girl&quot; has a certain beauty and rawness in her scenes, but at the same time, a certain touching nature, and makes it so profound. <br /><br /> &quot;Birthday Girl&quot; is sometimes sad, sometimes funny, sometimes violent, but in the end, it is totally satisfying. And I do not regret saying that this is a masterpiece. <br /><br /> * Sorry for the mistakes ... well, if there are any.']
