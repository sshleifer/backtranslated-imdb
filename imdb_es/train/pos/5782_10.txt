['The Internet database lists this as a television show. And yes, it was a series on MTV that is shown in the &quot;Rarities&quot; program, after &quot;The Head&quot; and before &quot;Aeon Flux&quot; if I remember correctly. But the version I saw this time was a VHS tape with all the episodes together in a movie without annoying credits in the middle or having to wait a week for the next fifteen minutes. <br /><br /> You have the story of Maxx, Julie Winters, Sarah and Mr. Gone. The Maxx is a superhero or a vagabond, Julie a social worker or a leopard queen, Sarah a girl who should listen less to The Smiths and Mr. Gone, a guy who can not seem to stay calm. And then there are the other strange creatures ... <br /><br /> Use &quot;or&quot; with Maxx and Julie, because part of the fun is trying to discover which parts of the story are real and which are dreams. Maybe all are real or dreams. Maybe one of the characters does not exist. Maybe there is only one and dream with others. You will have to wait and discover it. <br /><br /> I had the comics before the show came out, and it was one of my favorites. The artwork was spectacular and the original story, unlike everything you&#39;ll find in Superman or Batman. It will double your mind and have strong adult connotations without being obscene or offensive. And the program basically used the exact same artwork (only now it moves) and the same story ... ensuring that the beauty intrinsically found in the comic will be reproduced faithfully. This was the best program that appeared in &quot;Oddities&quot;, without a doubt. <br /><br /> If you like comics of a darker nature or need a good mental journey, this is a show to see. It&#39;s &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; before there was such a thing. <br /><br /> The most surprising thing is that this never became another movie or TV series, but I do not say it in disappointment. By keeping it simple, they have sealed this film in gold and kept it free from the imperfections caused by successive failures.']
