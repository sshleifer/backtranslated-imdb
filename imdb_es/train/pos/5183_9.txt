<br /> <br /> This movie is, by far, one of my favorites. I saw it while I was in college in the early 90s, and although I could not identify with the thirty-something of the movie, I felt that the story, the characters and the film in general were first class. For people who spoke negatively about Indian Summer, feel free to stick to your exaggerated Armageddon films and leave the movies with an excellent and healthy story for those who can appreciate them.
