I think many viewers completely missed the fact that it is obviously a parody of Western movies. <br /> <br /> This is not a bad movie, it's an ingenious language to understand westerns. I do not think this movie was taken seriously for a moment. <br /> <br /> What makes this film even more unique is the fact that it focuses on 4 strong and beautiful women, two of whom are black, one Asian, and one Mexican / Hispanic character. <br /> <br /> These are not the usual Western women, they are hard, they can draw fast and shoot. <br /> <br /> you're so hard that even the waiter shakes when he pours his whiskey. <br /> <br /> The plot that advances this story is typical of westerns, in the vein of "you shot my brother - so 'I'm going to get you!" Only in this western, to the sister of a woman They shot her and she wants to take revenge on the gang that did it. <br /> <br /> So he's going to rescue his old friends from his days of bank robbery. <br /> <br /> One of them, Maria, is not really interested in avenging Rachel's sister, but is motivated by the fact that there is gold and jewels hidden in the city to which they are heading. <br /> <br /> There are a couple of scenes that do not make much sense, not that they interfere so much, they can be ignored, but I wondered why they were there. Then, the movie could be a bit tight, but above all, this is a well-made movie that could not find an audience that recognized what it is. <br /> <br /> My only disappointment was that the only lesbian in the movie is a villain - of the "heroines", one is obviously straight, the other sexual orientations are never revealed. <br /> <br /> 7 stars
