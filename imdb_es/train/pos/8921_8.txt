I look at this page, and I find it disapproving to have to listen to someone ramble and rant in a true classic. Of course, I agree to let everyone have their opinion, but here is mine: <br /> <br /> This classic horror watcher should not miss this movie, and should be seen by many casual viewers from around the world. Sure, it has lost some style and grandeur with age, especially in the current world of CGI effects, but that's not why you should like it. <br /> <br /> You would like it because it's really a scary movie. , even by today's standards. His general bad mood will scare him as much as the original audiences, so do not criticize a classic if you have not given him a chance. Look at it, but not with a critical attitude. Look at it to have fun, how it was originally thought.
