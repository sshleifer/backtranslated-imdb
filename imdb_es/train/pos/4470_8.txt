As in "On the Town", this musical about sailors on the coast does not reach the later classic in terms of rhythm and quality of the songs, but has its own charms. Kelly has three fabulous dance routines: one with Jerry, the mouse cartoon of the fame of "Tom and Jerry", another with a girl and a fantasy sequence in which he is a Spanish lover determined to reach his lady in a tall balcony. Sinatra, playing Kelly's shy and inexperienced partner, and Grayson, the woman who serves as a love interest for both men, do most of the singing. Iturbi offers a good piano. In almost two and a half hours, it's a bit too long for a light musical but it does not creep.
