I must begin by apologizing because I thought the first 75-80% of this movie was very funny. It's mostly due to the performance of Brad Pitt. Spot. <br /> <br /> The performance of everyone involved was pretty good, but Brad stole the movie. The atmosphere was perfect in all aspects. I'm not a big fan of Pitt, but this has to be one of his best roles. <br /> <br /> Brutal, Honest, Gritty. All the good words to describe this movie. <br /> <br /> I was reading a previous review and the person said that the reasoning behind Early's violence is not explained. It is explained, but fortunately you do not have to go into graphic details to express your point of view. <br /> <br /> In general, I gave this a 9 because every scene bar 1 or 2 was effective. I think the humor in the first half is perfect for this movie. Undervalued
