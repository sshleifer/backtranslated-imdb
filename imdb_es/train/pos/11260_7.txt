Well, the story is a bit difficult to follow the first time, but that's only because all the vampires / witches painted naked in the 70s dancing on the bongo drums. This, of course, interrupted by a few vampiric orgies. And there are some very interesting candles and uses for them. And for the action of girl with girl, vampiric or not ... this movie just rocks!
