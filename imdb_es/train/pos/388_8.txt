...and I love it. Many special effects, and for a movie that is not made with a mega budget, this movie really does a great job of creating a fantasy masterpiece. I'm one of the guys who did not understand the story, but this was a great movie to watch. It is definitely up in standards that surpass Bored of the Rings and on par with films like Harry Potter. What is saying a lot for a movie again, made with a fraction of the budget of these international hits. <br /> <br /> One thing I really like about this movie is that it extends to the limit of the adventure movie to come. outside hong kong The theme is exotic and original. The production quality is different to everything that is seen coming out of HK for a fantasy action movie, and the acting is excellent. <br /> <br /> One of the best films that come out of Hong Kong, this is the fantasy film of Infernal Affairs of Hong Kong, and I hope you continue to work in this area, until you get over the Hollywood adventure films . <br /> <br /> Simply fantastic.
