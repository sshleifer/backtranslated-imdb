This lovely and enjoyable sequel to the hit "The Legend of Boggy Creek" is a follow-up only in name. Stories abound in a sleepy and sleepy fishing community of a supposedly vicious Bigfoot creature called "Big Bay Ty" found in the depths of the unattractive bogs of Boggy Creek. Two spoiled brothers and their older and more sensitive tomboy sister (a sweetly fighter-like performance by comedy star Dana Plato of "Different Strokes" of the cute future with braids) are going to venture into the treacherous swamp to see if the creature of the legend local can be in fact a real living being The trio is irremediably lost in a fierce storm and hairy Sasquatch, like a bear, huge, but very soft and benevolent comes to the rescue of children. <br /> <br /> Tom Moore's informal and simple direction is related to this simple story at a leisurely pace, which cleverly captures the everyday minutiae of the rural city's work with convincingly accurate detail, drawing the varied characters of the country with great warmth and affection, and fortunately develops the feeling in an organic, restricted and unforced way that never degenerates into sticky - Happy papita. The adorable Dawn Wells (Mary Ann on "Gilligan's Island") offers a captivating portrait of the loving working-class single mother of children, while Jim Wilson and John Hofeus offer incredibly irascible support as a pair of nutty fanatics. The capable and sunny cinematography of Robert Bethard shows the wooded scenery in all its splendor sumptuously calm, painfully pure and fragile, untouched by the splendor of civilization. The score of Darrell Deck skilfully combines the synths that crawl through the skin and the jubilant regiment of the blue of the country in a sonic musical melody. In addition, this image deserves special praise for the way it mysteriously predicts the fashion of children of the 90s with Bigfoot for some 15 years in advance.
