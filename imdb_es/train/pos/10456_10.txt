This movie is not about entertainment, not even a movie you want to watch to pass the time. This film is a genuine sample of true love that can only come from God. One can not help but be moved by watching this movie. We have several dimensions of love that contribute to the value of this film. There is the divine love of God that is beautifully portrayed. The love of God transcends the heart and the mind and endures and is eternal. There is love in a marriage. While the main character deals with his wife's illness, he realizes through the love of God that he loves his wife more than he could ever imagine. He knows that he and his wife are one and can never be separated. Finally, you have the love of child and father. The children of the family come together and realize that nothing else matters, except that love conquers fear. Dear friends, love is not love unless it comes from God, because God is love and love comes from God. Talk to someone and let them know you love them. Love does not do well unless it is given to another. I pray that this film can inspire and change the lives of all who see it. Amen!!
