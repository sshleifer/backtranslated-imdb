This movie has a special way of telling the story, at first I thought it was quite strange, since it jumped through time and I had no idea what was going on. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the story line was simple, but still very real and touching. You met someone the first time, you fell in love completely, but you ended up at last and promoted a deadly agony. Who has not gone through this? but we will never forget this kind of pain in our life. <br /> <br /> I would say that I am quite moved as two actors have shown great performance in showing the love between the characters. I just want the story to be a happy ending.
