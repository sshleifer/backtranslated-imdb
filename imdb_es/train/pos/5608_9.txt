Sure, it quickly became uneven after this movie, but from "Knife in the water" to "The tenant", you could always count on Roman Polanski to offer something fascinating and unique. Despite many themes to run (alienation, paranoia), there are not two of his films that are really the same. The story of this is somewhat similar to his own "Repulsion" ten years earlier, but the tone is completely different. "The tenant" manages to balance the absurd darker than the dark (I am a little reluctant to call it humor, although the strange behavior and dialogue of the protagonists was fun at times) with a paranoia truly suspense. Polanski was always a master at creating restlessness, and the moments in this film are almost unbearably creepy. The general rarity of the film is also an advantage. <br /> <br /> In addition to Polanski's exquisite address as usual, the rest of the cast and crew offer excellent contributions. Polanski, the actor, is often overshadowed by director Polanski, but his performance here really captures the discomfort of his characters and the feeling of being an outcast. The issues of social discrimination make this film more than strange because it is strange. The rest of the cast also offers strong performances, especially the nice turn of Isabelle Adjani, and Melyvn Douglas and Shelley Winters appropriately annoyed. "The tenant" is often underestimated because of how prepared people are to praise both "Repulsion" and "Rosemary's baby", but it's as bright as any of those classics. (9/10)
