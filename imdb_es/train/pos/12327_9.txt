In 1987, Hong Kong had given the world films such as "Encounters of the Ghost Class" by Sammo Hung, Chow Yun Fat, in the iconic "A Better Tomorrow" by John Woo, "Warriors Zu" and the classic "Vampire". Jackie Chan was having international success in video, but it was with 'A Chinese Ghost Story' that the HK cinema had its first real theatrical success in the West for many years. <br /> <br /> Western viewers had never seen anything like it. It was a film that took several ingredients that the cinema of HK had used for years (flying swordsman, martial arts with a great choreography and the supernatural) and combined them to create a film that was unique in its appearance, sensation and execution. Forget about the poor and unnecessary sequels that generated, this is the best and original. <br /> <br /> Director Siu-Tung Ching (still better known as an action choreographer in films like Woo's `A Better Tomorrow 2 '/' The Killer '), under the watchful eye of legendary producer Tsui Hark, has created a masterpiece of fantasy / horror movies. And with such an expert team at your disposal (no less than 6 Martial Arts Coordinators), the chances of the film being something more than wonderful would be unthinkable. <br /> <br /> The edition by the incredibly prolific David Wu (who wrote "The Bride With White Hair 2") and edited classic titles like `` A Better Tomorrow 1/2/3 '', `Hardboiled 'and the cult success `The Club ') is a work of genius. His elaboration of tree climbing sword fights, perfectly choreographed, makes them some of the best HK films ever created. In fast motion, extravagant but never confused, they are, even today, the peak of their art. <br /> <br /> The team of cinematographers has also worked miracles. This is a film where each shot is a painting made by experts. Where the wonderful nocturnal sequences dyed in blue, enveloped in an ever-present ghostly fog, are the impressive platform for our story to unfold. It is a film where everything is used to weave a dream beauty. Even the silk gowns and dresses worn by Hsiao Tsing become living parts of the film, whether in romantic sequences or in battle scenes, the ever-present silk flows through the screen. Even a simple scene in which Hsiao Tsing is changed into a tunic becomes a thing of Aletean beauty as each skill in the ensemble combines to create a memorable scene from such a simple act. The sets are also amazing, giving another worldly sense to the forests, and the temple and hardness to the desolate and overcrowded land of hell for the incredible end. The production design of Zhongwen Xi deserves the highest praise. <br /> <br /> Another important factor for the success of the films is the music of Romeo DÃ­az and James Wong. Hong Kong movies have given us music and fantastic songs that have contributed a lot to the success of a sequence, but in 'A Chinese Ghost Story' music is simply vital. Starting with the opening song, the music becomes as important as the characters. <br /> <br /> The score is a perfect blend of modern and traditional instruments. Batteries, bells and guitars hit the action sequences with a great effect, but it is in the slower and increasingly romantic pieces in which it is found. Here; flutes, strings and female choral effects create what are possibly the best pieces of music heard in an HK movie. Add to this the incredibly beautiful female vocal song that plays about the love creation of Tsau-shen and Hsiao Tsing, (you never see anything, but the effect is wonderful, this is a lovingly innocent romance) and you have a brilliant example of power. The music of a movie can have. <br /> <br /> And, of course, we have the talent to act. Leslie Cheung (`A Better Tomorrow 1 & 2 'and a very popular singer) stands out as the innocent tax collector. His work on the comic sequences (thankfully mild) is never exaggerated and his scenes with Joey Wang are reproduced with just the right amount of passion and innocence. <br /> <br /> Joey Wang (who will then be mostly relegated) to support roles in films such as Chow Yun Fat / Andy Lau's "God of the Players" classic, has never looked as radiant as does she here She is the epitome of ethereal beauty. His interpretation of the tragic Hsiao Tsing is impressive. She shows her characters the sadness for what she has become and what she is forced to do, but she also emits a subtle eroticism in the scenes in which she is drawing men to their horrible deaths. Veteran actor Wu Ma ('Mr. Vampire', 'Swordsman') is very funny as the Yen wise, brave, but always so grumpy. It runs a thin line between the eccentric and the annoying with ease practiced. And what could have easily been a character that could have damaged the film is actually wonderfully entertaining and memorable. <br /> <br /> But what about monsters and beasts? I hear you cry. Well, they range from the rather rude but fun animatronic zombies that inhabit the temple (resulting in a great joke with constantly frustrated attempts to chew on Tsau-shen, incredibly unprepared), to Lord Black quite surprising but surprisingly effective. Complete with an arsenal of vicious flying heads, and excellent work with cables. Most of which, to this day, have never been surpassed. <br /> <br /> But the most outstanding effect and creation is the murderous tongue of the tree spirit. First we find this thing with an "Evil Dead" style camera effect that crushes the throats of its victims to offer a lethal French kiss that turns the victims into zombie shells. But then he shows up in all his crazy glory. It can grow so long and so long that it shoots through the forest after a dam, rips up trees, wraps around buildings and rolls around people before picking them up and throwing them against tree trunks! It can even be opened to reveal a mouth full of fangs! It is a scandalous idea that, given the main plot, deeply romantic, should not work. But it does, with a fantastic and unforgettable effect. <br /> <br /> Then, all this adds up to a classic example of film making in Hong Kong. A true team effort that has given us a truly innovative film. It is a film full of wit, inventions, action, monsters, martial arts, ghosts, fantastic ideas, exuberant images, beautiful music and most importantly for its lasting charm, one of the most moving romances of cinema.
