I really enjoyed this little movie. It is a moving film about struggle, sacrifice and especially the bonds of friendship between different people (the child actor who plays Miki is especially good). There are so many large-scale impersonal films around the Second World War, that this little story is convincingly a true break from the norm and an original one. I will also add that this movie is far from boring, far away !! Of course, the horses are wonderful and the scenery breathtaking. For anyone who really treats their animal as part of the family (I do), you will find this film especially rewarding. Recommended for movie fans who are looking for something a little different.
