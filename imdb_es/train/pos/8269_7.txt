This movie has intrigued me for a while, partly because of the extremely high score that appears here in IMDb: an average of 9.0 with more than 300 votes gives it the highest rating of all accessible silent movies! How had I never heard of this movie before this website? Well, you can not always trust the qualifications. This is actually a very good movie, which is fairly well preserved if the good VHS transfer that I rented is a clue: excellent performance by the directors, especially William Haines as Brown, and a good job of location in Cambridge with some excellent images of action in the Harvard climate / Yale soccer match, but the story must have looked like a gray-haired brunette even in 1926. An odious, self-centered and charismatic man goes to school and puts himself in his place, becoming the process in a loving and self-sacrificing friend; I doubt that the people in 1926 found much that was really exciting in the last reels, the predictability factor is high. Still, it starts very well, and certainly deserves to be remembered, if not praised to the heavens. Maybe the 350 previous voters are mostly Harvard men ... <br /> <br /> EDITE Now there are more than 600 voters and the score has actually risen to 9.2! Seriously, folks, here's a fill of ballots. I challenge anyone to explain why this is a better movie than "Metropolis" or "The General"!
