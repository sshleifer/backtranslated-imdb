A very memorable film of the variety of people who kill animals, specifically similar to "Willard" in which stars an actor of aged character (in this case, a step a little below the level of Les Tremayne, who puts the only distinction I have seen performance in a role as a man whose life is unbalanced and who later decides to use his animal friends to take revenge on those who have offended him. Yes, this is one of those movies in which almost everyone is despicable, so you'll cheer when they die, and really the selection of actors, places, etc. It could not be better to give the film an atmosphere of bad decadence. <br /> <br /> The character of Tremayne is "Snakey Bender", and it is certainly the most interesting thing in the film: an old snake collector who is obsessed with the music of John Philip Souza. When the local preacher suppresses his practice of collecting small animals from the children of the local school as bait for his snakes, and his friend marries a stripper (which alters his ritual concert of the band on Wednesday night), he goes in the uproar, in the process. creating a memorable pile of pots under the cliff where he throws the remains after getting rid of his unfortunate owners. An entertaining game that you can play while watching "Snakes" is to bet on the cars that will land farther from the cliff. <br /> <br /> In general, very cheap and exploitative, but in reality they will be many. Fun for the fans of this type of movies.
