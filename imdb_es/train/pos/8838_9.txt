['Finally a film where the public keeps guessing until the end what will happen. Well, we all know that the lives of the brothers Andy (played by Hoffman) and Hank (played by Hawke) will spiral towards destruction, since where else is there to go, but we do not know how or when? Until near the end of the movie. Hoffman is excellent, as usual, and even Hawke was decent as the younger brother who basically does what he is told, since he really can not think for himself. Hawke could have been a bit out of his element, but he played the role well enough. Add to this mix Andy&#39;s wife, perfectly interpreted by Marisa Tomei, cheating with Hank; The misappropriation of company funds by Andy to pay for his addictions to drugs and sex; and a father who finally discovers exactly what happened on the day of the robbery. This movie will make you think.']
