FINALLY!!!!!!!!!!! I've been waiting for this movie to come out for almost a year, and I finally saw it at the premiere in SB. I met some of the actors, who were very nice and who were great in the movie. I saw the trailer so many times that I did not know what to expect, but I let myself get caught completely. The movie was really beautiful and the music was good too. I recommend it to anyone who is a Ryan Donowho fan, and Dominique Swain was also good at that. The other actors were good too. I hope it comes out on DVD soon !!!!! <br /> <br /> I first got into Ryan after seeing the OC and then I saw him in a group of good indies like Imaginary Heroes. He is great in this movie, and everything he does is indie. I also like Dominique but I have not seen her that much. I hope to see you both sooner!
