['It&#39;s an awesome classic 1950&#39;s monster movie! I love the look of the 50s in general, like cars and music. Anyway, I love how the stain looks. I love it when everyone is in the horror movie at night and the stain comes in and breaks the party. Another thing that I love about this is that it takes place all in one night, just like in Halloween II. <br /><br /> When Steve and Jane are kissing, they see a meteor fall from space. The stain is inside the meteor. Every time the stain consumes a person, it grows bigger and bigger. They try to convince the people of the city about the blobby monster, but nobody believes them until later. Can anything stop this blobby creature? I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE BLOB !!!']
