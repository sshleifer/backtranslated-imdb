"The College Girl Murders" is my first contact with the writing work of Edgar Wallace. And in general my first real contact with the films of "Krimi" in general? and I can say that I am moderately impressed. Is this really entertaining, although I never would have expected it to be like that? goofy! The film has an exciting and very complicated plot, with a good dose of humor, extravagant turns and quite ingenious murders. Is there some kind of bad temper from James Bond? who always sits in the shade and in front of a large monitor, recruiting prisoners to kill certain girls in a specific university with a new type of poison. There is also an evil monk with a whip, dressed as a member of the communist KKK, who gets rid of the leftover characters, as very curious teachers and so on, as well as a police commissioner who persists in resolving the case with a psychological focus. Seriously, if I had known before that these Krimi movies were so colorful and crazy, I would have already bought a whole collection of them. The pretzel plot actually generates more questions than it responds to at the end, and the overload of comic gadgets in the Scotland Yard Higgins inspector's account is sometimes too hard to swallow, but I do not care because it was a sublime entertainment. Even the soundtrack of the funky 60s remained trapped in my head for a long time. It's like a variant in the Italian Giallo, but with slapstick elements.
