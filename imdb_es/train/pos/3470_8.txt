Although I'm quite young, The Beatles is my ABSOLUTELY FAVORITE band! I never had the opportunity to listen to their music as it was the launch, but I have loved it since I can remember. <br /> <br /> It's the kind of movie worth trying once. I can see why it was not released at the movies, but it is certainly a great movie to put on television. I was flipping through my television guide and, by chance, I saw this movie, it did not have many details, except something like: "John Lennon and Paul McCartney meet after The Beatles split, Jared Harris Stars." I had never heard of him (played John) or Aiden Quinn, who played Paul. However, they are certainly underestimated actors! <br /> <br /> The movie had a slow start, but as it developed, I could see how well Quinn, but especially Harris, played his characters. As a big fan, I know how real Lennon and McCartney are. The script was brilliant and Harris managed to make Lennon's accent, personality and manners look good! Quinn played very well with McCartney, but sometimes he adopted his Irish accent. The makeup artists made them look excellent. <br /> <br /> THIS PARAGRAPH COULD BE COUNTED AS A * SPOILER *: <br /> <br /> As I mentioned before, it had a slow start but soon it developed and became quite an emotional movie. The bit in the park seemed like a total waste of time and quite out of place for the two musicians. As for Lennon's rude line at the Italian restaurant, totally unnecessary. The ending was very moving and makes me cry every time I see it. <br /> <br /> It is very different from the other biographical films that I have seen in which it is about how the Beatles met and became famous. And those really never made the characters so well. E.g. 'Backbeat'. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I would say that, if you are a fan of the Beatles or John Lennon or Paul McCartney, give him an opportunity to have a pleasant surprise. With only 95 minutes, it's worth waiting for the film to develop. <br /> <br /> If anyone knows if the 1976 meeting really happened, please send it to the 'comment page' of this movie. I would be very interested.
