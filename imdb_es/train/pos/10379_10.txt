Plato's career is an entertaining movie with Gary Busey. It's a pretty unknown movie, so I saw it in a trunk. I thought it was entertaining. I wanted to play. Plato, a hard mercenary, bound for murder. of a powerful Cuban crime lord now on the run, Plato must survive long enough to prove his innocence with the help of his friends played by Steve Bauer (scarface) and action star Jeff Speaksman (the expert). What I liked about Plato's career was the way the movie never got boring, the plot could have been done before, but it was still good, the acting was fun and the action was also very funny, especially the climax Gary Busey makes a good ironic hero as he usually plays a bad guy and Steve Bauer is good as a teammate of Plato, even Jeff Speaksman makes a good performance and can not act well to finish it. Plato's career is a nice effort from nu image movies and I give it 7 out of 10
