Richard Attenborough is a director whose name is synonymous with the winner of the 'Gandhi' Academy Award, in '83. I did not know of any other work of his until I recently found 'Cry Freedom', released in 1987. Although he may not have been as popular as his Gandhi, it is so exciting, if not more, and was released when South Africa had not yet been undone of the apartheid chains. While most of the films on social issues come out after the event, I guess it was released during the time. <br /> <br /> The story is based on characters and real-life events. The book on which the film was based was written by Donald Woods (Kevin Kline), a journalist who worked in South Africa until the late 1970s. It traces the origins of Woods' friendship with the charismatic black leader Steve Biko, who is beautifully played by Denzel Washington. I can not imagine a better option for the role. Washington exudes a natural charm and a presence on the screen, which the character of Biko required. <br /> <br /> Although, initially, Woods was against what he felt that black racism was spreading through Biko, after meeting the man, he could not help being attracted. In their struggles and ideas. The bond between them is strengthened, and Woods and his family realize and become more sensitive to the plight of the people Biko represents. <br /> <br /> However, finally, the tragedy hits and Woods must now concentrate on escaping from the south. Africa, with your book, so you can publish it and the outside world knows what is happening. The second half of the film is an exciting story of his escape from South Africa, along with his family, and will keep you in suspense. <br /> <br /> There are also some delightfully comical dialogues. The scene between Biko and the lawyer in court is an example. <br /> <br /> Lawyer: Do you advocate violence? Biko: I advocate a confrontation. Lawyer: Well, is not that violence, Mr. Biko? Biko: Not necessarily. You and I are having a confrontation now, but I do not see any violence. <br /> <br /> However, there are moments that return you to the horrors that permeated the country before the meaning prevailed. The scene in which the army opens fire on a protest by school-age children is heartbreaking and heartbreaking. <br /> <br /> This is definitely a must see. I would suggest that those who are not familiar with Attenborough's work, take time for this. There are movies that make a lot of money. And there are movies that make life. Any day I would prefer the latter.
