Nick Cage is Randall Raines, a retired car thief who is forced to retire when he is forced to save the life of his brother Kip (Giovanni Ribisi) when he finishes a job, completing his brother's job of stealing 50 cars in one night. He has to reunite his old team he can trust to help him achieve it and get his brother out of Dutch. But the cops are on him, so can he get him out? This was one of the great candidates of a film to make a new version, since Original was far from being a classic. And if you do not get into that, wait a lot, and disable the mental part of your brain to ignore the hole in the plot and just take the movie as it is. You will end up enjoying the ride. Look at it in a double bill with "The Fast and the Furious" for a night of great speeds, just do not take the car out for a spin right after. <br /> <br /> My rating: B - <br /> <br /> DVD extras: 7 minutes of interview with Jerry Bruckheimer; Bruckheimer Bio / Filmography; Action overload: Highlight Reel; The great persecution; "0 to 60" featurette; "Wild Rides" featurette; Stars in movement; The cult of the music video "Painted On The Heart"; Theatrical trailer and trailers for "Shanghai Noon", "Mission to Mars" and "Coyote Ugly"
