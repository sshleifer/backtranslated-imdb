['Honestly, when I saw this movie years ago, I immediately wanted to turn it off. When I sat there for the next 10 minutes or so, I realized that the actor who played Navin stole the show. His facial expressions and his comical behavior make me move my head as to WHY he has not been in more comedies. He has this &quot;Marty Feldman&quot; thing in his favor, but MUCH, MUCH more talent ... he does not take anything away from Marty. The movie really surprised me because of how close it was to the original Jerk, but, again, it was MUCH MORE. I really think that if this movie premiered first, and I saw Steve Martin&#39;s second film, I think the second one was a cheap scam. I know it sounds like a BOLD statement, but it&#39;s true. In fact, I really like Steve Martin, but his performance is the actor&#39;s second in The Jerk Too. I wish I could get a copy for my collection. I urge you to see it if you can find it.']
