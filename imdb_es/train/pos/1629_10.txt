['This movie is so cheap, it&#39;s endearing! With Ron Liebmann (Major Vaughn) providing the most entertaining screen diatribes in the history of cinema. I have 2 copies of this film on video ... in one, Ralph Macchio is stuck in the background in Major Vaugn while he is ranting in &quot;Hash&quot;. Obviously, they forgot to edit this error in the movie, but it&#39;s about showing how funny the movie is, when the actors themselves can not keep a straight face.']
