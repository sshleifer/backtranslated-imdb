Mr. Destiny - 3.5 / 5 stars <br /> <br /> The "Mr. Destiny" theme is recycled from many movies spanning many different years. His theme ranges from recent skits in such plots (see "Scrooged"), to the same more serious and dramatic notion that worked in "It's a Wonderful Life", and a century earlier in the story of Scrooge told by Charles Dickens in "A carol." "Involves an ungrateful man who is taken on a guided tour of his life, and witness how his life may have been (or would have been) first hand. <br /> <br /> In most of these types of movies , The guardian angel rescues a man from ingratitude and shows him his life in retrospect, or how it could have been.He should have been.It would have been.In this case, we are shown a businessman named Larry (James Belushi) He hates his life, lives with an unattractive wife (Linda Hamilton) and longs for a bigger life with a bigger meaning, if he had just hit the ball in the state championship in high school years ago. his life would have been better, I suppose he remembers this seemingly small moment in his life because it had a great impact on his subconscious side, but I doubt that an adult man longed for a single high school act, but it does work in the movie. br /> <br /> From Anyway, Larry is driving home from work one night, where he is a penpusher along with Jon Lovitz, when hello's car breaks down. He enters a bar in search of a public telephone and, reluctantly, decides to tell the bartender (Michael Caine) how his life is going. This is where we see him for the first time remembering the baseball punch of his childhood. <br /> <br /> The bartender listens and agrees, apparently not caring about any other customer. This is probably due to the fact that the bar, although it is old and tattered, seems to have never been occupied by any living human, except these two men. In fact, Larry even makes a comment about never having seen the bar before. This is more likely for some reason that the audience waits before Larry. <br /> <br /> Then the bartender, who could well be an angel of God incarnate, like Clarence, prepares Larry for a special drink of his own, which ends up putting Larry's life in reverse, showing him what his It would have been as if he had hit the homer all those years before. But Larry has no idea of ​​any change at first, just as Jimmy Stewart did not realize that Clarence had erased his life until he entered the bar and was expelled. Larry continues to ignore any changes until he goes home to find the different lawn outside, and a big, wrestling guy who occupies his home. <br /> <br /> Larry soon discovers that his life would have been very different if he had hit the home run. Instead of marrying Linda Hamilton, he married Rene Russo and moved into a large mansion with children. Discover that Jon Lovitz is no longer his friend, but an employee of his. And the most surprising fact of all is that with his new life, which Larry has always wanted ... he finds himself wanting his former wife, Linda Hamilton; proof that, sometimes, money and a beautiful but superficial wife do not invent everything in a man's life, as an intelligent wife and love and true happiness. As "It's a Wonderful Life" showed the public the life of a man is what he does, and each person has an impact on people, "Mr. Destiny" shows us that material wealth is not the same as spiritual wealth, a lesson. He taught us again and again, but it was never so soft, easy to forget and really sweet as it is shown in "Mr. Destiny". <br /> <br /> "Mr. Destiny" is never extremely funny, but it is a sweet and kind comedy that never takes itself too seriously. The problem with all the retreads of "It's a wonderful life", like "The family man", is that they try to be as influential and memorable as it was "It's a wonderful life". But there are only so many times that you can only cheat a famous movie, and "Mr. Destiny" knows it, and plays directly to the fact. It does not try to be something it is not; rather, it is something that he did not intend to be, and this is obvious to the audience. <br /> <br />
