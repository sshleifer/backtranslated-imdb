This is one of the most spiritual movies I've seen. I went with about 150 people to St. George and saw this movie in the visitor center of St. George's temple. No person had dry eyes in the audience. In addition, there were some non-religious and anti-Mormon people in the audience who felt the spirit of the film and were moved by the captivating music and recreation of the history of the pioneers and the difficulties they faced due to their beliefs. <Br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to understand more about Joseph and the difficulties the pioneers went through. After all, it's part of American history.
