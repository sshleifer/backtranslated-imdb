Almost all the criticisms of this movie that I had seen were pretty bad. It's not bad enough, it's actually pretty good, although it's not great. The character of Judy Garland could have become annoying, but she did not allow it. Somewhere along the line, I've become a fan of Van Heflin's melancholy, arrogance and overacting, at least in the early 40s. Judy's singing is great, but the movie lost a great opportunity by not showing more of your relationship. I gave him a 7.
