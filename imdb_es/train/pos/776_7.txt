I think the idea of ​​the plot is perfect to explore, in the first place, the emotional experiences of the people involved and, secondly, as someone else wrote in a commentary, the implications of this type of relationship (incest and lesbianism) in the Romanian society. <br /> <br /> so ... to start with the second aspect ... for short, it was not visible at all ... <br /> <br /> as to the first ... as I said, I had a lot more potential ... I think that that kind of relationship involves a lot more tension ... a lot more tension ... and the potential tension was not achieved ... <br /> <br /> I think the band sound could have been more than those few songs in the background and the theme (which was good but not enough and not always at the right times) ... yes ... I could feel the absence of a better soundtrack .. . <br /> <br /> the actors ... I think they were somewhere from 7 to 8/10 ... there is not enough sensuality at key moments ... <br /> <br /> A total of 7/10 ... mainly because of the story.
