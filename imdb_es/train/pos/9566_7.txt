An ultra-severe criminal drama by Pou-Soi Cheang, the director of "Home Sweet Home". In general terms, it reminded me of "Run and Kill" by Billy Tang, although it is not as polished as that. However, it is a bit of confusion and lack of chaos about a lonely Cambodian, Pang (Edison Chen), who arrives in Hong Kong to murder a lawyer. While fleeing from the scene, he kills fellow police officer Sam Wai, who, to add insult to injury, finds himself in the middle of dealing with his dying father, so Sam begins a crazy and obsessive Pang chase resulting in almost a dozen. Dead bodies and relentless violence. There must be something in the air lately because I've never seen so many humans stick their pulp to each other like I've done lately. This is something dark and unpleasant, so I am so partial and I applaud your vibes. It is visually striking and the sound design is very unique. Dramatically, everything spirals down until each character finds himself in a world of screams of pain. A secondary plot that involves Pang's attachment to a sexually abused girl adds depth to the story and generates a fourth surprise act that features an excellent act of grotesque surgery.
