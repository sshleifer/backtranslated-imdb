FORBIDDEN PLANET is one of the best examples of Hollywood SF movies. His influence was felt for more than a decade. However, certain elements related to the way in which this wide-screen entertainment was aimed at an audience of the mid-fifties that has already left have been dated, and the sometimes slow pace of the film does not help. But the convincing central idea of ​​the story involving the ancient and extinct civilization Krell and the "monsters of identification" has not lost its appeal and continues to make this film a relevant film that "must be seen". What I am most interested in saying here is that the current DVD of this movie is terrible. The movie has never looked so good in the home video and its elements need an extreme restoration. I hope that happens soon and we get a special edition of this SF classic.
