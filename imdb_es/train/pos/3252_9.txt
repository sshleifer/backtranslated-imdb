The story of "A Woman From Nowhere" is quite simple and is quite adapted from an Eastwood Spaghetti Western: a mysterious stranger enters a lawless city run by a capo and starts firing on the spot. Even opening credits and music have that spaghetti sensation: Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone would be proud. The really interesting twists are that the stranger is a beautiful (!) Woman, Saki (Ryoko Yonekura) on a Harley, and the location is in a city somewhere in Japan. <br /> <br /> In this action, there is a considerable amount of shootings, some good, some predictable, and some other clumsy places, but it's a lot of fun. Ryoko handles her weapons with credibility and poise and gives the thugs their due. It was not a great acting challenge for her, as it was a physical challenge, but she handled things very well. She shows off her acting skills much more like Otsu in the NHK drama, "Musashi." <br /> <br /> I would highly recommend a movie if you are a fan of Ryoko Yonekura (which I adorably love) and / or "Girls with Pistols" fan of the movie and it keeps up to see you again and again. For me, there is something eminently and inexplicably attractive about "girls with weapons" movies like "La Femme Nikita" and "The Long Kiss Goodnight". And having a beautiful girl like Ryoko starring is also a lot of frosting on the cake.
