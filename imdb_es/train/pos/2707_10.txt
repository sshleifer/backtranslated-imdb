['Cor blimey. This movie really surprised me since it is a comedy masterpiece. Billy Zane is awesome as the central character, and everyone manages to play it straight enough so that the comedy is natural and easy. <br /><br /> The soundtrack is really good, and the pieces are a joy to behold. I recommend that you watch this movie with a group of friends, a few bottles of the liquor you choose, and prepare to be amazed and entertained. <br /><br /> This is transmitted as perfectly to the kitsch masterpieces as Plan 9 From Outer Space which is in the true tradition of the movie &quot;B&quot;. But what makes it more than that is the caliber of the people who participated in the film. Ron Pearlman for example. I still find myself laughing at the scene in which Zane moves through a series of steps without any apparent reason in an almost ballet style. All a little angry, and much better for it.']
