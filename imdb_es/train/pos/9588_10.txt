When Paris is Burning came out, I totally discarded it. I was not interested in the phenomenon of Madonna and fashion. I thought I was going to be campy and stupid. How wrong I was with this movie. I saw it after the movie had gone out for ten years and I ran out and bought it. It took me back to a time and place of fun and excitement. I felt as if I knew all the characters personally. The 80s were spectacular and the film captured the essence of gay culture. What a great job! I went online and discovered what some of the original cast members were doing now, but I have not been able to locate them all. If anyone has information about any of the cast members, please let me know. <br /> <br /> I hope they make another documentary. I LOVED
