"Dressed to Kill" is the best film by Brian DePalma, a game of suspense, humor and style that is unrivaled today. DePalma has a big blow in Hollywood, since most people claim that he cheated Alfred Hitchcock. He does not. Hitchcock could only dream of what DePalma shows in his thrillers. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the original uncut version of "Dressed to Kill" is no longer available on video. The current copy published by Goodtimes is the nominal cut R approved by Jack Valenti. But there are still some copies of the original cut of DePalma. It is distributed by Warner Home Video, both in a green cardboard box with Angie Dickinson on the cover, and in a black case with the theatrical poster on the silver lining. These are the ones you should get, if you can find a copy. I have green and it is among my prized possessions. <br /> <br /> Anyway, going back to the story. Dickinson plays Kate Miller, a sexually frustrated woman who is being treated by Dr. Robert Elliott (Michael Caine) for her obsessive fantasies. During a trip to the museum (a real tour de force for DePalma in terms of camera work and suspense), <br /> <br /> Miller is picked up by a stranger. You can guess what happens to her, since the advertisements and the art of the box give away the story. But there are some complications. A prostitute (Nancy Allen) is the only witness to the murder. Kate Miller's son, Peter (Keith Gordon) is a teenage genius determined to solve crime. And Dr. Elliott's answering machine has a certain message ... about a missing knife ... <br /> <br /> I'm not ruining the movie for you since what I've described above takes place inside La Half an hour of opening and the biggest surprises of DePalma are reserved for the last hour. This film is explicit, however, enough for Valenti (head of the MPAA) to demand cuts in the film. What surprised me is what the cuts wanted. Several cuts in the initial scene of the shower and one or two cut scenes and some of the dialogues by Nancy Allen (Valenti wanted "cock" to be changed to "bulk"). This is a film that is very violent and bloody, however, the objections are to the sexual content. I would love to hear Valenti's explanation of how to see two women in a tender love scene in "Lost and Delirious" is somehow more damaging to a young mind than Arnold Schwarzenegger blowing people with a gun. It just is not fair. <br /> <br /> What makes "Dressed to Kill" so good is that not only are the first class technical credits, but the performances are also very good. Michael Caine, who was in a lot of trash in this period of time, gives one of his best performances as a doctor. Angie Dickinson is better than usual, possibly because she actually has a strong role here. Nancy Allen adds this to her range of performances that has her as one of the most underestimated and overlooked actresses in the world. Keith Gordon is wonderful as a genius and I loved all those inventions. <br /> <br /> DePalma is one of our best directors who has never received the recognition she deserved. The recent joke on the list of AFI 100 Best thrillers showed that very few people really know what a thriller is. If they were to open their eyes for once, they would see that DePalma has opted for his career in thrillers and that he is actually the best craftsman. This is even better than "Psycho". It's a pity that very few really know. <br /> <br /> **** of 4 stars
