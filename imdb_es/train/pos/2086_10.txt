True to the work of Pearl S. Buck, whose years were spent in China as the daughter of missionary parents who provided her with deep knowledge of Chinese culture and philosophy, this film adaptation is brilliantly accomplished, both in technique and in acting. . <Br /> <br /> Wang Lung is a humble farmer grateful for the basics of life: surviving out of his land and being newly married to Olan, a servant of a rich and powerful family in the village area. Despite the efforts of Wang Lung and Olan to cultivate the land, raise children and accumulate savings and wealth, a famine threatens to end everything they have worked for. Choosing not to sell their land, a traditional Asian belief, instead they travel to an important city to wait for the famine. While in the city, they are reduced to begging and being just one of the hundreds of other unfortunate homeless families. Although he is not a looter, Olan is caught in a mob that sacks the house of a rich man. It has met to be executed by the army, but it is saved at the last minute. Her good fortune, however, is that she found valuable jewelry at the looting site that gives her and her family the opportunity to return to their farm to start over. The newly found wealth transforms Wang Lung. It becomes selfish, egocentric and the finding is credited. He becomes a rich farmer, but that only makes things worse as he becomes more and more despicable, arrogant, and difficult to reason. He loses contact with the basic things in life that money can not buy: loyalty, commitment, trust, impartiality and honesty. As punishment, nature sets the table on Wang Lung sending a plague of locusts to destroy everything he has. Kneeling, Wang Lung gets the help of all his friends, old friends, workers and family. With all that help, he manages to save the farm. From that experience, once again return to humility and appreciation of the basics in life.
