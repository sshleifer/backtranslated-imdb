This film does not stop getting involved and moving, even in 2008 to an audience that is only familiar with modern overproduced sound and computer-enhanced techniques. <br /> <br /> The film's viewer's experience in 1922 that he could only see this in a cinema with others on his big screen must have been truly profound and a completely satisfying experience. <br /> <br /> One has to ask if a filmmaker today can make a silent film of two hours and make it interesting and achieve the same structure of tempo and balance that this film has. The silent creation of films was pure art, had to maintain attention through its structure, direction and performance, there was no filling with more words or distractions generated by computer. A silent film, poorly made or uninteresting, is unappealable. <br /> <br /> This film should be put in context for those who may be bewildered with the mention of Christian themes. This is not a "Christian" movie, it is not selling anything. These issues, together with current moral standards, often appear in this era; Also on Sundays the church was a national past time, Christianity was a fact in most homes, so the film only describes normal life as it was then. The themes would have sounded true and profound at that time. <br /> <br /> It is very strange given the strong support for good Christian thinking of this particular film (and it is not preaching the religion to anyone, just highlighting the difference). between the hypocrites and the honest ones) that in 1922 a Pastor in an open debate with a representative of the film industry with a large crowd denounced Pickford as an example of immorality, along with other people he called. NY Times 1922. <br /> <br /> Maybe they should have seen this movie that also premiered in 1922 and learned some lessons. <br /> <br /> The pastor complained that the film industry had started the church The attendance had dropped 500,000. The representative of the film in the debate, however, made the following observations; that assistance was also reduced, that there were many more pastors in prison than actors (fact) and that selecting some examples was not representative of the whole. <br /> <br /> Therefore, there was a continuous process. battle between the church and the film industry during the first days of the film. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful movie about being honest and faithful to family friends and being willing to make sacrifices. Mary Pickford, naive, honest, fighter, full of happiness and joy, faithful, humorous and silent sacrificing, although poor and uneducated, represented the perfect character. However, this does not get in our throat, but it is revealed little by little through the film. <br /> <br /> This is reminiscent of some modern Chinese films in which the characters reveal themselves slowly and languidly in the course of a movie and it is this Tempo that creates a stronger connection with the character. <br /> <br /> It has a smooth and uniform rhythm for the first half that builds all the elements for the last section. The last 30 minutes are excellent for making movies and you have to appreciate that it was achieved without the benefit of sound, the dialogue in execution, was achieved through a good performance and a great direction. Sometimes it's surprising to realize that at the end of the movie he did not hear a word, but he feels as if he has heard everything. <br /> <br /> The cast of cast in great performances, especially Gloria Hope, Jean Hersholt and Lloyd Hughes. <br /> <br /> The few final minutes are Pickford's typical discreet humor when he goes out on the street with the pretext of sweeping the snow, a balance and an almost perfect finish. This is a special kind of poignant humor that should not be underestimated. Chaplin used this device often and copied some of Pickford. <br /> <br /> Another special remark that must be made about silent films and especially Pickford films is that the star often has to hold the camera for much of the film without the audience having tired or boring, with the overexposure of the actors. The fact that Pickford is often the center of attention through most of his films, but people have not yet tired of it, is a testament to his excellent ability to act.
