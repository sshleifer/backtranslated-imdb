['If you like romantic comedies, you&#39;ll find this tale of two 30-year-old bachelors who fall in love during the American League pennant race. On the other hand, if you&#39;re waiting for Kill Bill Volume 3 or Sin City 2, then you should probably stay away. The plot contains the mandatory that the man meets with the friends of the girl, the girl who meets the girl&#39;s friends and the scene of the girl&#39;s parents with the boy who is. There is even a boy who meets the scene of a girl&#39;s pet dog. That&#39;s all on par with the course in a movie like this. However, what I liked was that the plot delved into the decision-making process that people take when they realize that their romantic interest is not perfect and, in fact, is a bit peculiar. The plot focuses on answering the questions; How much rarity is too much and how much love is needed to overcome these peculiarities? It is interesting to see how the characters work because in the background (if we admit it) we all have peculiarities. Barrymore does a very good job in his role and Fallon sorta surprised me, he is also good. I consider it a 7 out of 10 as a romantic comedy. Add a point if you are a baseball fan or if you are romantically involved with one. Add another point if you are a Red Sox fan and subtract two points if you are a Yankees fan.']
