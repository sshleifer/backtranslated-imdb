It is not one of your most shocking stories, and that is a true strength of this movie. There are at least two relationships in which less certain writers would have added some too predictable romantic tension. Not only do they save the public this, they also throw some surprises at the same time. There are some Disney moments, especially near the end, but they are manageable. Overall, it was worth the rent and it was good, fun and relaxed. <br /> <br /> By the way, if you get the DVD, look at the segment where the director shows you how to do aloo gobi. We followed his instructions and it was great! Next time we will do it the day before we start eating it, because this is a dish that definitely improves with a full night in the fridge to let the spices out!
