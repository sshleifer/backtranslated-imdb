When I read a review from another user, saying it is a terrible game, I could not sit idle and do nothing! <br /> <br /> Well, this game is great, from the news clips (with two real people, full of sense of humor and credibility!), to the story, I find it very good! I only complain that the enemies start blinking when they die, until they disappear; and some frustrating situations in the missions of LEILA VR, when riding a bicycle, here and there ... <br /> <br /> Except that, it is a great game, with a great history, good graphics, excellent characters, excellent soundtrack ... I recommend it! Surely! It may be a bit old, but still nice! At least, in the Dreamcast ... but the PS2 version will be the same.
