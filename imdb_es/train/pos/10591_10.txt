It can not be denied that Ealing's comedies are good, but for me this film stands out as one of the best. <br /> <br /> The basic premise of the film is that it is discovered that a small part of Pimlico in London is part of Burgundy, not the United Kingdom. Then we follow the lives of the residents in their battle to keep the treasure found after the bomb explosion, and we prevent black market merchants from realizing that they are exempt from the laws of the United Kingdom, there is no rationing. When they become prisoners in their own street because the government has decided to close the border, we see them fight against the system. <br /> <br /> They are forced to ration water and food at their booth so it is correct. In fact, they get worse than they were before everything started, that's where the moral comes in. When they lose all their food, they think they are beaten and ask for a surrender, only for all of London to respond to their plight. Sending food, a lot of that. Therefore, it allows them to continue their struggle. <br /> <br /> This movie is the right note at all times, the acting is excellent, with Stanley Holloway, Margaret Rutherford, Hermione Baddeley and Betty Warren standing out. He launched himself in a fair way, not too sentimental and the moral of the story was not forced by your throat. Well worth a visit
