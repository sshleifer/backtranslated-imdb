"Kolchak: the Night Harasser" is a very entertaining television series in which an aggressive, sarcastic and forty-something reporter is repeatedly involved in a deadly combat with supernatural (and occasionally extraterrestrial) forces. Based on a very popular pair of television movies with the character of Kolchak, this series died quickly in the mid-1970s due to low ratings, but still maintains a strong cult today. But can the modern spectator of today dig Kolchak and his weekly clashes with the undead? <br /> <br /> It's really a difficult question to answer fairly. The detractors of this series tend to argue that it is a formula and it is dated without hope. On the other hand, the fanatics argue that it is intelligently written, well acted and, at times, genuinely spooky. And me? I have one foot in both fields. Recently I enjoyed watching the 20 episodes of Kolchak on DVD, although I can clearly see that the series has major flaws. <br /> <br /> I will address the question of whether Kolchak is the "formula" of fiction first. Now, I think we can all agree that most television shows have formulas: almost all episodes of Columbo are developed according to the same pattern, for example. Repetition is not necessarily a bad thing in itself; In fact, critics have long recognized that audiences often enjoy and actively seek repetitive entertainment. However, the problem with Kolchak is that his formula is simply too rigid, too repetitive even by the most generous standards. <br /> <br /> In almost every episode, Kolchak investigates a murder and discovers that it was committed by some form of monster. He tries to publish a story about that monster, but his publisher Vincenzo blocks it, always because Kolchak does not have enough evidence to back up his claims that the supernatural forces are acting. And, unfortunately, Kolchak is also obstructed by the police. Then, in the end, Kolchak makes an independent investigation into the monster, discovers how to kill it ... and then kills it. Without ceremony, reward or writing a great story about it. <br /> <br /> You can see where this strict formula can get boring, right? I am particularly taken aback by Vincenzo: if Kolchak is always delirious with the monsters, and Vincenzo never believes it ... well, then, why does Vincenzo not fire Kolchak or have he committed it? That's what any normal boss would do. But the series avoids such realism and prefers to keep Vincenzo and Kolchak as comic antagonists. As a result, many of their scenes together are deeply incredible, although they are also quite funny. <br /> <br /> The best episodes of Kolchak manage to jump over the limitations of this formula, however, generally because they contain a kind of unexpected turn. These selected episodes are good enough so that I think they are largely immune to the typical criticism of the series. Some of my favorites include: <br /> <br /> Horror in the Heights: an episode that is noteworthy for being dirty, creative and socially conscious. Kolchak's dialogue has an unusually sharp and cynical edge. Although it adheres closely to Kolchak's formula, the script (written by Jimmy Sangster, veteran of Hammer Studios) is remarkably cultured and delves into the monster's background story. <br /> <br /> The platform of the devil: a possible inspiration for the "Omen" films, this episode stands out because the villain, a very young Tom Skerritt, tempts Kolchak with a satanic contract full of goodies (and, in doing so, it reveals a lot about the reporter's character). <br /> <br /> Firefall - this episode seems to have a bad reputation among fans, but I enjoyed it because it has a big fake track and a really creepy, almost unstoppable monster. <br /> <br /> Although I have chosen these three episodes to praise them, I would say that most stories are entertaining at least. For my money, there are only two full turkeys in the 20-episode run: Primal Scream, about monkeys running rampant in Chicago, and Sentry, which features the dumbest creature's makeup in the history of filmed entertainment (and this evaluation comes from a Doctor Who and Godzilla fan for life. <br /> <br /> In short, this is a good series, a bit repetitive, maybe a little cheesy, but it has elements of greatness, even during the episodes. weaker, the wonderful performance of Darren McGavin as Kolchak, caustic, fatigued by the world and infinitely funny really shines, takes the series effortlessly, in a way that, for example, Sarah Michelle Gellar never achieved in "Buffy." McGavin was A great character actor, and it's worth watching this series just for him.
