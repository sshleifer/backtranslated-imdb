It's always a pleasant surprise when a movie made for television turns out to be entertaining, like Little Richard. This is a very visible film about the history of Rock and Roller, Little Richard played by an actor named Leon who I had never seen before but who does a very good job. Like most television movies, this is a bit more modest than if it were made for movies, which is a shame because I'm sure there's a lot we could have seen about Little Richard that was controversial. Instead, we see a lot of religious trash, which is the only thing that ruins the movie and ultimately ruins a very promising career. In general, this movie is good and the performance is above average for a television movie. 7 out of 10
