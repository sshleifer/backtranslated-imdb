While watching this movie, I felt frustrated and distracted and, in the end, I wanted to give the film a solid 4 or 5. I thought the animation was random and all over the place and that there was too much activity. Even my A.D.D could not keep up. It felt like a light acid trip. Everything seemed flat, there was no dimension at all. There were so many shapes, lines and patterns. I really wanted to stop the movie halfway and destroy my burned copy of this movie. But after I finished watching it, I hooked up online to read about the movie and I should have researched this movie a bit before watching it. <br /> <br /> The Secret of Kells is based on the true story of The Original Book of Kells. A young child, Brendan, is entrusted with the task of writing new pages in what is considered the best book ever written. This book will contain information that will help "change darkness into light." Brendan lives in the village of Kells behind huge stone walls. Taking place in the 8th century, Brendan's uncle, the abbot of Kells, is trying to build the wall to keep the Vikings out. Brendan's uncle insists that he help him complete the wall, but a traveler and guardian of the "book" trains Brendan secretly to hone his illustration skills, and convinces him to complete the "book" and keep his word. <br /> <br /> All the time I saw the movie I thought I was missing something because I really did not understand what was going on. I thought I was missing a piece of Irish history. A simple Google search taught me everything I needed to know about the original Book of Kells. After reading many articles, my opinion of the film changed enormously. <br /> <br /> The Book of Kells is a copied version of the first books of the New Testament transcribed into Latin by Gaelic monks in Ireland in the 8th century. . Along with its paleographic and insular writing, the book is also beautifully illustrated in insular art, a type of ancient art known for its complexity, complexity and miniature illustrations. Much of the art in the Book of Kells is represented as much art at that time, the plane and the dimensionality were challenged without perspective. But what makes the Book of Kells different from other ancient works of art is its use of many colors. <br /> <br /> The Secret of Kells is very colorful. Originally I thought the animation was flat and boring. It reminded me a lot of the cartoon Samurai Jack, who also had a flat and "aminic" look. Once I learned about the artistic styles of the Book of Kells, it is obvious that many of the styles of the book are imitated in the film. There are lines and whirlpools and various forms that inhabit Brendan's mind. Every time it enters your imagination, circular shapes that resemble the sun, gears, clocks and wheels begin to fill the screen. The edges of the screen are framed in triangles or decorated moving circles. The transitions fill with color, and Celtic knots. From trees to floors, many things in this world are covered in shapes or patterns. <br /> <br /> With only 70 minutes less credits, The Secret of Kells is a fun little history lesson with a little adventure and they threw themselves silly things to keep people (maybe only children) interested . I think that, in general, one has to be open to The Secret of Kells as a half piece of art, half a movie about history. Despite looking like he was animated with Adobe's illustrator, it's a very nice movie. But based on the 20 films sent for Oscar consideration, I do not think it's worth being nominated by Mary and Max. <br /> <br /> ThatWasJunk.Blogspot.com
