As this is one of the most favorite novels, I was very excited to see the movement. I was not disappointed! Yes, of course, there are some things I could capture, but I think the film stayed true to the book, and it was really a good movie. It seems that Stephen King's films mostly receive a bad review, but this is one of the good ones. It's such a dark story, and I think that's why I like it ... and what's better than the dead that come alive ... and something about the animals that come back from the grave is also pretty creepy. If you've seen the movie, do yourself a big favor and now read the book! It is a well-written screen game, the actors could have done a better job (I only say this for Rachel, and Ellie ... she was so neighing) I liked others very much ... and most importantly for me ... It got stuck It's true with the novel.
