First I would say that somehow I remember seeing this movie in my childhood, I could not read the subtitles and I thought Sonny Chiba was Sean Connery. But I really liked the concept. If you can not at least partially suspend your adult skepticism and embrace your seven interiors, you may want to avoid this movie. Having said that, after having seen the restored version of 137 minutes on DVD, I must say that I enjoyed it, although not as much as when I was seven years old (I remembered the ending). <br /> <br /> There are aspects of the film that are worthy of criticism, the first 15 minutes and the last 15 minutes have really funny moments, my favorite is the contrast between the scenes represented in the last 10 minutes and La curiosa option to accompany the music (listen to the lyrics). <br /> <br /> For an action movie, there is a great concentration on the personal stories of certain soldiers and the social dynamics of the team, since the pressure of their time travel has its effect. By the end of the film, I had decided that this was a good thing, when seven I thought that the "relationship" relationship was a bad thing. <br /> <br /> For an action movie there is also a lot of rewarding bloody action. , especially a pair of epic battle scenes between the platoon and the hordes of warriors of the Shogun era. The creators of the film have ensured that as many deaths as possible are bloody and, let's be honest, humorous. I thought that this was a splendid aspect of the film when I was a child, and I am not ashamed to say that I still do it. <br /> <br /> I also like the fact that today's soldiers generally do not. They pass the film walking on egg shells trying to avoid altering the space-time continuum, they have large-caliber machine guns, mortars, rocket launchers, a tank and a helicopter and they are bent on taking over feudal Japan. Which is what I would like to think that any vigorous IMDb user would do in their boots. <br /> <br /> In summary, the films that are worth watching, make the viewer regret that there are no more movies with a similar premise. , and at the same time offers some advice on why a film like GI Samurai is so unique.
