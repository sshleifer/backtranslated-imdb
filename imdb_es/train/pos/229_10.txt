In the current world of digital manufacturing, there is no computer that can replace the actor and the writer. Unfortunately, this type of "character-based" movie is too rare these days. Both the performance of Duvall and James Earl Jones are faithful to the high expectations of his audience. I wonder if this movie was made for television. It has a personal quality "close" to the narrative. It is an understatement to say that the performances are all exceptional. The only thing that prevents it from being a masterpiece of cinema is the lack of a great director of photography, but beautiful images are not everything. How can talents like Jones and Duvall continue to produce such good work at a time when actors pose for digitalization?
