My family returns to New Orleans in the late 1600s in the early 1700s, and when I saw the movie, I knew it was a story my grandparents had never spoken of, but we knew it existed. I have obviously black cousins, also known as African Americans and others who can "pass" as targets and decided not to. It's a hard story to watch when you realize they're talking about your family and that Cane River is part of that story. It makes me want to cry and it makes me want to kick the "butt" of my great-grandparents who owned those plantations and I am amazed at how my great-grandmothers of African heritage lived under that oppressive and yet aristocratic existence ... And at the same time, If it had not come out of that story, it probably would not be the successful business woman who today lives successfully in a fairly integrated world. The performance was excellent and fair depending on the actor, but it is a film that he NEEDS to perform. Anne Rice is amazing and I wonder why she writes "symbolically" about my family and I do not. I recommend this movie to everyone. Leza
