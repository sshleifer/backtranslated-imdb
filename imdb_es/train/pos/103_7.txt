['When I read another comment, I decided to watch this movie ... <br /><br /> First, the cast especially Michael Madsen and Tamer Karadagli; good enough... <br /><br /> Film, very smart and interesting because, the cast has a lot of international actors and actresses especially European, like Turkey and Russsia ... <br /><br /> Second, the story is basic and you can guess, but if you&#39;re interested in good action, you&#39;ll like it in my opinion ... <br /><br /> Third, the final chapter is not special or interesting, it&#39;s as regular as other action movies ... <br /><br /> Finally, I recommend watching this movie ... And I hope you like to enjoy: D']
