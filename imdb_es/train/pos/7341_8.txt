I enjoy the films of Ralph Bakshi ("Wizards", "Cool World" and the underestimated animated "Lord of the Rings") and I am a collector and a fan of Frank Frazetta. I am also a fan of sword and witchcraft that loves the worlds of Edgar Rice Burroughs and Robert E. Howard. <br /> <br /> I missed the theatrical release of "Fire and Ice" in 1983 and I'm looking forward to seeing it on Video or some revival since then. That's why the 2005 launch was a dream come true for me. However, I bought it with some trepidation, because I hoped it would not be worth it to see it once and then place it on the shelf as a "collectable" powder that accumulates until the day of my death. Fortunately, my fears were unfounded and I was pleasantly impressed by this movie. <br /> <br /> As with the art of Frazetta, this is a rough movie that has a physics and sexuality hard to find in most fantasy / sword and witchcraft movies. without being corny or dirty. Art is good and you see the best of Frazetta. Even my youngsters loved seeing him with me and asking me to watch him again and again. However, my wife has some objections due to the little dressed princess (very Frazetta-esquire). I do not care because it is credible and there is no sex scene. <br /> <br /> Range control is used, but I personally enjoy the range scope. It gives the characters more fluid and realistic movements that are difficult to find in animation. <br /> <br /> Despite some continuity problems, I recommend this movie to all the Bakshi, Frazetta, Conan, and swords and sorcerers. Enjoy!
