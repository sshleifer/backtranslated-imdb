['Why am I so convinced that there is actually another cinematic version of this novel somewhere? I went back to see the film this year, since I am teaching the novel and find the changes in the film annoying. The child does not appear in the novel and the ending has been changed. He is killed in the movie, but the point is that he is obsessed with the events at Eel Marsh House for many years, but he remarries and finally leaves the events behind him. Mr. Bentley is a much nicer character in the novel, the scene in the film in which Kipps sets fire to the office is nonsense, and the constant appearance of the toy soldier to indicate the presence of the child is really creepy but meaningless ... Kipps is persecuted by the woman who seeks revenge, not the child. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve seen a movie that is better and closer to the novel and, in fact, more terrifying. Did I just imagine this?']
