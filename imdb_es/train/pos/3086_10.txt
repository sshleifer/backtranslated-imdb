Here Italy (I write from Venice). Why canceled? ABC should have given him the opportunity to build an audience. The cast (with Hope Davis, Scott Campbell, Erika Christensen, Zoe Saldana, Jay Hernandez and Bridget Moynahan) is one of the best I've seen in recent times. We need more programs like this that make viewers feel that they are intelligent people, not meaningless drones. I hope ABC reconsiders its decision or that another station picks it up.
