['I really enjoyed this movie. I firmly believe that Matt Stone and Trey Parker are comic geniuses of our time. They have the strange ability to add this level of absurdity to pop culture and make it ridiculous, but in a realistic way ... if that makes any sense. This is mainly what makes South Park so fun. Once you overcome the fact that it is probably the most vulgar and indiscreet caricature in history, you see in each episode the message that is transmitted. That is evident in BASEketball. Although it is directed by David Zucker and is completely ridiculous, it has a sincere message about American corporations and the misfortune that is the sports of the big leagues. I am also a fan of sports, so sometimes I find this movie hilarious because it is very true in that strange way that people hate to love. The opening prologue is brilliant ... the tears of laughter form every time I see those soccer players start Riverdance! Some may not like this movie because it&#39;s not everybody&#39;s cup of tea ... but, like South Park, once you look at the absurd ... it has a really genuine message that is transmitted through the literal comic book genius. I gave this movie 8 out of 10 stars.']
