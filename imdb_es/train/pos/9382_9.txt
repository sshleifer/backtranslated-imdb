Red Rock West is one of those noir thrillers that we rarely see. It is of good rhythm, well acted and does not leave us with loose ends or unanswered questions so typical in this genre. <br /> <br /> Nicolas Cage stars Michael, an unemployed Texan, desperate enough for a job to drive all the way to Wyoming for potential employment. He is honest, but he is always on the dark side of destiny. <br /> <br /> After not getting a paid job, Michael runs into the Red Rock bar, where owner Wayne (JTWalsh) confuses him with a hit man he summoned in Dallas, hired to do his job. charming but lethal wife Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle). <br /> <br /> Wayne gives Michael the necessary details and an initial payment for the blow to the adulteress Suzie. Without intending to move on, Michael accepts the money and then proposes to warn Suzanne of his impending demise. He also sends a letter to the local sheriff in which he exposes the plot and divides it. <br /> <br /> As fate would dictate, Michael will not get rid of the situation so easily. While leaving in a violent storm, he runs for Suzannes' lover. Of course Michael is Michael, he takes him to the local hospital where it is discovered that he was also shot. <br /> <br /> The sheriff is summoned and, fortunately, Wayne is also the local law. Michael manages to escape while taking him on that last trip and then is picked up by the real "Lyle from Dallas" played with murderous joy by the peculiar Dennis Hopper. After discovering that they are partners in the Navy, Lyle insists that Michael meet him for a drink at the Red Rock bar. There Wayne realizes his mistake and soon he and Lyle pursue Michael, who falls willingly into the arms they expect from Suzann. <br /> <br /> As the pace progresses, we realize that Wayne and Suzanne are really weapon hunters, but Lam for a multi-million dollar theft. Getting the money now becomes the central focus of the film with a series of betrayals, double crosses and murders. <br /> <br /> The movie was very well chosen. Nicolas Cage was typically discreet, Dennis Hopper and Lara Flynn Bolye assumed their respective roles with more than ample capacity. The best performance was at the end of J.T. Walsh who was threatening without appearing to be. Walsh was a great character actor who left us too soon. <br /> <br /> The photography of Marc Reshoskys used many unique angles that added to the suspense and the development of the plot. The film was further enhanced by the style of John Dahl's tight director and the rapid fire edition of Morris Chestnut.
