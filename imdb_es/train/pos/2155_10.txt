And I really loved it. What a beautiful and lovely movie! The story is incredibly good, with drama, comedy and romance. The cast is excellent, and I was especially impressed by the cold beauty and kindness of director Masayuki Suo's wife and professional ballet dancer Tamiyo Kusakari. On September 6, I saw the new American version of "Shall We Dansu?" For the first time, and I found it a lovely entertainment. But now I can say it's another unnecessary new version, and I recommend this original movie instead. My vote is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Dança Comigo?" ("Dance with Me?")
