Everyone plays their part quite well in this "nice little movie". Belushi has the opportunity to live part of his life differently, but ends up realizing that what he had was just as good or even better. The film shows us that we must take advantage of the opportunities we have, not the ones we do not have or can not have. If U can get this movie on video for around $ 10, it would be an investment!
