I saw this movie luckily, just because I was going through a phase where I had a new admiration for Bill Pullman and I wanted to see all his recent films and thank God I did! This movie has stayed with me since then and it is still one of my favorites. The story revolves around two girls who embark on a dramatic journey in a foreign country where they will learn the true meaning of freedom. <br /> <br /> Alice and Darlene were just trying to spend a vacation together before going to college. But their trip ended up being a much more complicated story. The struggle they are going through when they are arrested in Thailand and become prisoners is very moving and intense. The performance is incredible, the images extraordinary, the soundtrack is fantastic and, therefore, it is very successful for the film and the message transmitted. In fact, I can not even find the right words to describe how this movie makes me feel every time I see it. I know that some people have not appreciated me as much as I do for the qualification that the film has, but I swear, it must be seen !!! I promise he'll stay with you!
