I think this show is graciously funny! It's not for everyone, and I'm not going to elevate or denigrate people who do not get it. I am sure that they are wonderful brilliant people who operate on a different wavelength. But if you like it, you REALLY like it. Sarah plays a self-loathing loser named "Sarah Silverman" who often finds herself in the problems of Homerian (which is "Homerian" as in "Homerian Simpsonian"). <br /> <br /> I remember Sarah Silverman from her brief concert on Saturday Night Live in the early 90's. I liked immediately at that moment and I make an effort to see everything he has done. <br /> <br /> This show is funny to suck your food and wet your pants. That's why I always fast before seeing it and I wear diapers for adults. Check it out!
