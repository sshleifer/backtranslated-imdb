['I loved the story. Somewhere, a sign said that there are no families like the one portrayed in this movie. Well, maybe there should be. I thought everyone looked really human and believable. What a first-class cast. What great music on the soundtrack. How beautiful this, and how nice, but above all, I will say two words to recommend this movie. <br /><br /> Steve Carell <br /><br /> It really showed a nice and subtle depth that moved me. He was really in charge as a widower who had perhaps devoted himself too much to being a good father first, at the cost of denying his own needs. <br /><br /> Did he act like a petulant ass? Yes, he did. <br /><br /> And you see, that&#39;s the perfect thing about this movie. The actor who played this character made me believe that he was feeling something, and not simply ACTING as if he was feeling something, and he perfectly conveyed to me what he was feeling, and what he was feeling was denied. <br /><br /> The happiness denied. <br /><br /> Compliance denied. <br /><br /> Negated love <br /><br /> Losing your love is painful beyond belief, and many who do it will never feel that way again. <br /><br /> Beautiful movie <br /><br /> I gave him eight out of ten.']
