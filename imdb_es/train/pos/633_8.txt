['Stardust Another Protected Review (originally written on June 15, 2007) <br /><br /> The marketing machine has just started for this (is there no place yet? With what?), So I doubt most of you have heard about this. In truth, I did not have (more or less) either. When I got the publication, I thought it was another code name and I was really worried that it was Transformers, one of the movies I want to watch when I&#39;m not working, so I enjoy 100% as a mere mortal spectator. It turns out they were not Transformers and I had been aware of that when &quot;Neil Gaiman&#39;s movie&quot;. What is it about? Well, in short, it&#39;s a fairy tale by Gaiman about a child and a fallen star. More than that and would be giving away information about the plot that is (a) a breach of contract, and (b) ruin your fun. If you really want to know what it is, go buy the book. The rumor has it, Gaiman could be something of a writer. <br /><br /> Not knowing what to expect in a movie can be so nice if the surprise is worth it. And for this, it certainly was. This screening was &quot;special&quot;, since it not only included film critics, but also exhibitors (rarely have a mixed projection) and local science fiction / fantasy people. So, you know the expected audience, right? I mean, with this crowd and the Stardust title, I knew what to expect. <br /><br /> Oh, how sweet I was. <br /><br /> Yes, it is a fairy tale written by a famous author in the comic. But he was not the lord of the rings. He was not even another imitator of The Lord of the Rings (ahem, Eragon). It was much more intimate than all that. <br /><br /> But, like The Lord of the Rings, it was the humanism of the film that sells the fantastic qualities. Surely it is a romantic tale, but with generous splashes of humor. And that humor is of the type that is not shrekismo slapstick. It is more in the line of dramatic comedy than in comedy. Before continuing, let&#39;s make this review of the movie. <br /><br /> Acting is, at least, good. It is always difficult to say anything more than that for fantasy movies, but I think there were important roles with excellent acting. Michelle Pfieffer is not, unfortunately, one of those. She plays a villain, and she does the work. Nothing special. Rupert Everett, however, was a real imbecile. That is to say, a great villain. Peter O&#39;Toole is, well, Peter frickin &#39;O&#39;Toole, which is wonderful. Ricky Gervais is perfectly cast and shows why. Robert De Niro seemed to be having too much fun for the most part. However, when he wanted to deliver the goods, he did. And Charlie Cox (who?) As a protagonist it was a good surprise from a guy I had never heard of. <br /><br /> Claire Danes Claire Danes Claire Danes I have always had a mixed opinion with her. She can be great, and then it seems that the brand can fail. In this, she is the first. And she is, literally, the star of this movie. Of course, his accent stumbles here and there. And, yes, it&#39;s not as good as it can be when Cox is not on the scene. However ... well, see for yourself. <br /><br /> Special effects are silenced but they are achieved, and they are only significant where they should be. The best flying boat yet, sorry Potter. The address is cheerful and flows very well. The cinematography could have been better, but not all the films in New Zealand. Everything else is superior support. <br /><br /> And now that it&#39;s done ... <br /><br /> ...the writing. Oh, the writing! Neil, devil. It is difficult in today&#39;s climate to do something original and, at the beginning, you start wondering. A kingdom, a dying king, a boy who wants to show his own courage, witches, ghosts, a quest (or three): what&#39;s new? But Gaiman&#39;s story attracts you with its superficial familiarity only to subvert everything in a sweet and original story of a child and his heart. And, although you suspect that everything is going to happen, you begin to ask yourself in the third act and, if you are me, you will find yourself in the climatic confrontation and hoping for the best. In the end, you will find this story, this movie, it is what all fairy tales should be, but all too often they are not. Fantastic and real. <br /><br /> (I wish I could talk about Septimus vs. Tristan, but I will not ruin it for you.) For those who read the book, you can be sure it&#39;s done correctly.) <br /><br /> Those with whom I spoke later had the same impression as me. A great movie for all ages to enjoy, and the new {WITHHELD} for this generation. The blank space is filled only after the movie premieres because, well, it could be waiting for it. You&#39;ll know when you leave, anyway. I sincerely hope that Stardust does not get lost among the tentpoles. Even if it does, it will be a pleasure to push the hands of everyone I know. <br /><br /> --- <br /><br /> I forgot to add the revelation of {WITHHELD}. I arrived a few years late, but ... &quot;A great movie for all ages to enjoy, and the new THE PRINCESS BRIDE for this generation.&quot; <br /><br /> Maybe a little high evaluation, but I still trust that the years are formed now, there will be the same response from &quot;Oh, I love that movie&quot;, as there is now for The Princess Bride.']
