['This film was filmed in Gerard Gardens, in Liverpool, and was the response of the United Kingdom to films like &#39;Blackboard Jungle&#39;. The film resists the test of time quite well, with all the moral stories still (or even more) relevant today. The film presents some good performances by some notable British actors such as David McCallum, Stanley Baker, Peter Cushing and Anne Heywood. Baker plays a Liverpool cop assigned to youth liaison duties, with the premise that if he catches children at an early age, they will end up being responsible adults. <br /><br /> Among the notable cameos in the film are Freddie Starr (Fred Fowell) and Melvyn Hayes (Gloria). Tsai Chin and Michael Chow play a brother and sister (they are real life brothers and sisters) who are trapped in a network of arsonists. Tsai Chin is still acting and can be seen in Nicole Kidman&#39;s latest film, &quot;The Interpreter.&quot; <br /><br /> Violent Playground presents a siege of weapons in a school, so it is unlikely to be shown on TV after similar events in Scotland / Russia. <br /><br /> I lived in Gerard Gardens, where the film was filmed (although it was not born at that time), and I have good memories of the area. I recently completed a documentary about Gerard Gardens that includes excerpts from &#39;Violent Playground&#39;, and a small UK film &#39;Coast to Coast&#39;, starring Lenny Henry and Pete Postlewaite. The houses were demolished in 1987 and the films help to keep the memory alive. <br /><br /> There were some complaints from residents when the movie was released, as the film portrayed the area in bad light. Time has helped to heal those wounds. <br /><br /> A little gem of a movie, I recommend you look for this']
