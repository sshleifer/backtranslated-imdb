It's true that I do not know anything about baseball, I'm not even a sports fan, but that did not stop me from enjoying the Farrelly brothers' latest film, Fever Pitch, a charmingly irreverent romantic comedy. The movie is not really about baseball; rather, it is really about relationships and the emotional disconnect that can often take place. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Fallen? Giving your best performance to date? Stars like Ben, a dorky, slightly nerdy school teacher. Ben is a type of man-boy, who unfortunately has never grown up, and fosters an almost fanatical addiction to the Red Sox baseball team. Ben has dedicated his life to the Red Sox and does everything from making the pilgrimage to Florida for spring training to decorating every square inch of his apartment in team paraphernalia. <br /> <br /> One day, while taking your geometry honors class. On a field trip to his office, Ben meets Lindsey (a wonderful Drew Barrymore). Lindsey is a career-oriented corporate girl, but she has a kind of tenderness that Ben finds utterly endearing. Initially, he hesitates to invite her out, thinking that he is out of his "class" and, Lindsey does not immediately see a possible partner in Ben. <br /> <br /> Your first date had a disastrous start when Lindsey suffers a severe case of food poisoning? and his resonant response provides the first clue that we are, in fact, watching a Farrelly brothers movie. Instead of accepting Lindsey's request, rather urgent, to reschedule it, Ben stays to play the nurse, the order and the janitor. So Ben scrubs the toilet and teeth of the dog, while his love interest faints with a bucket next to his bed. <br /> <br /> When Lindsey wakes up in the morning and finds him asleep on his couch, he starts. the long and unintelligible process of dismantling the network of anxiety and ambition of state that she considers as her standards. Soon they are falling in love, with Lindsey happily accepting Ben's fanatical devotion to his sport. <br /> <br /> Having inherited your dear uncle's season tickets, has Ben organized his life around the season? A game has never been lost. But their relationship, which has progressed smoothly during the winter, is complicated at the beginning of the season. <br /> <br /> Lindsey wants Ben to do other things, like spending the holidays with his parents and having fun with his friends. , but Ben begins to have trouble modulating his interest to meet Lindsey halfway. Can Lindsey consent to her irrational dedication to summer boys to make their relationship work? Can she really accommodate Ben's infatuation with sports? Can a red-blooded Red Sox fan and nerd find true love after all? Of course, Lindsey and Ben come with a colorful assortment of friends who have opinions. Lindsey's strictest friend, the skinny, rich and blond Robin (KaDee Strickland), insists that there must be something wrong with the boy if he is still single at 30. However, plump Sarah (Marissa Jaret Winokur) and Molly (Ione) Skye) offers a more optimistic and positive view of Ben. <br /> <br /> Ben's eccentricity could apply to practically any obsessive sports fan, while Lindsay's frustrations could be representative of any woman with a mobile ascendant career. Fallon is great as Ben, exhibiting real big-screen potential, overcoming the not insignificant challenge of keeping Ben from being indifferent. Meanwhile, Barrymore is as charming as the workaholic, Lindsey, particularly when she struggles to accept Ben for what he is, without losing sight of his own needs. <br /> <br /> Fever Pitch really works, and although there are many In comic inspired moments, the film also addresses the serious problem of addiction to sport and how difficult it can be for couples to negotiate this fragile territory. <br /> <br /> Much of the film was shot at Boston's Fenway Park, which adds a good sense of authenticity to the proceedings, as well as the atmosphere of the games, although fully appreciating what happened to the team It will probably be limited to baseball fans. Still, Fever Pitch has been blessed with such a sophisticated and cleverly crafted script that even baseball novice fans will find plenty to connect with. Mike Leonard September 5th.
