['&quot;Maybe we can organize a meeting.&quot; &quot;Where is he now?&quot; &quot;I&#39;m sitting in my office.&quot; &quot;I doubt it&quot;. &quot;Why would I doubt that?&quot; &quot;If he were in his office right now, we would have this conversation face to face.&quot; <br /><br /> Bourne remains tough and elusive. Only his inhuman resistance leads the film a little too far in fantasy. The conversation is chauvinistic, to the point with only fragments of humor Bond type gallows. It&#39;s about the action. <br /><br /> The feeling that something is happening on another level in the world we live in is what the trilogy conceals so well. A scene set in Waterloo with a journalist from The Guardian does this with great effect. There is no meeting of worlds: you are in it or you are simply a superfluous body. <br /><br /> If the unstable camera does not bother you too much, enjoy this movie and hope that somehow continue with the franchise.']
