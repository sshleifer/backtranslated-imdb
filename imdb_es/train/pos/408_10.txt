['I can not tell everyone how much I love this movie. I have read reviews that say that this movement is &quot;too confusing&quot; or &quot;like swimming in concrete drying&quot;. I say that these critics have no imagination! For those who love Fantasy Fiction, this movie is for you. If you ever loved playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons ... this movie is for you (especially if you got into Oriental Adventures), I regret not having seen this movie on the big screen. (Just more incentive to get my own big TV screen :-)']
