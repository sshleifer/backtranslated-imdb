This is the kind of movie that Hollywood needs to do more. No extravagant accessories, no car chases, no smart phrases. Only people who try to be people. <br /> <br /> William Macy plays a hit man who works for his father, Donald Sutherland. Macy is the obedient son, Sutherland is the dominant father. The son wants to leave the business, the father does not leave it. Macy loves her own son, played beautifully by David Dorfman ("The Ring"). He also begins to fall in love with Neve Campbell, a girl he meets in the waiting room of his psychiatrist's office. <br /> <br /> It's an interesting juxtaposition of characters and the film follows the reluctant killer while balancing his own. Needs with those of your family. There are many moving scenes, especially between Macy and her little boy. And as you would expect in a movie with William Macy, there is also a bit of humor. <br /> <br /> Excellent work, actors and director. It's good to know that you can still make a good movie in Hollywood with a small budget.
