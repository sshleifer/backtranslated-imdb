['Eric Rohmer &quot;The lady and the duke&quot;. I could have used a better translation for the title. &quot;The English woman and the duke,&quot; perhaps, would have been more accurate. While it is obvious that this film is not for everyone, judging by the comments to this forum, it is worth seeing because despite the intricate pattern of the story, Mr. Rohmer has created a film that could be seen as an exhibition of art in a museum. The mixed technology used in the movie, ultimately, works well. <br /><br /> The strange story of Grace Elliott, a noble lady who had been the mistress of the King of England and the French Duke of France, draws our attention. The scene is Paris during the days that followed the French Revolution. The country was agitated and the power was in the hands of the people, who could care less about the aristocrats. The images show the agitators running with heads of famous people just after their trip to the guillotine. <br /><br /> The relationship of grace with the Duc had ended, but she remains a true friend of the great man who is in danger, himself, of losing his own head. Grace moves through all the horrors around her without being able to escape. He even has an enemy in his own house, in the form of the cook, Pulcherie, who would not hesitate to denounce her at the slightest provocation. <br /><br /> Watching the film sometimes gives the viewer the impression that he is going on a trip through the Louvre to see those huge canvases that represent this crucial time in French history. Instead of distracting the digitization process, we found it to improve the film in many ways. <br /><br /> Lucy Russell, like Grace Elliott, does a good job of portraying this woman she saw a lot during her life. His French seems to be excellent, since he seems to speak it fluently. Like Duc d&#39;Orleans, Jean Claude Dreyfus made a fantastic contribution by making us believe that he himself is the nobleman without any effort. The cast was also great. As a piece of equipment, Mr. Rohmer has good performances in general. <br /><br /> For lovers of history, &quot;The Lady and the Duke&quot; will be an interesting movie to see thanks to the vision of Eric Rohmer.']
