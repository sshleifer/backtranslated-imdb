"Fido" is worthy of praise for taking a tired genre, zombies, and turning it into a more original cinematic experience. The atmosphere of the early 50's is impressive, the performance excellent, and the entire production shows a lot of careful planning. Suddenly, the viewer is immersed in a world of beautiful classic cars, clothing from the "Eisenhower era", art deco furniture and servants of zombies. It would be very easy to dismiss "Fido" as a caricature-like fluff, similar to "Tank Girl", but the two films are very different. "Fido has a structure, a script that tells a story and a superior performance, make no mistake, this is a daring black comedy that triumphs where many others have failed ... Highly recommended - MERK
