['This movie was released by Roger Corman, so you know that the filmmakers did not have much money to work with. <br /><br /> Although some viewers may overlook the subtleties of this film due to the very typical marketing approach of the &quot;obsessive killer&quot; type, there are unique differences about this film. <br /><br /> AMANDA, played by the obviously talented Justine Priestley, is a complex character. Some people like these movies precisely because violence may seem random, but here the ramifications of abuse in the past (treated realistically but with good taste) are what shape AMANDA&#39;s psychosis. Surprisingly, Amanda redeems herself at the end with an act of love, where most of these movies become the typical fights to the death and the evil character dies so evil in the end to begin with. <br /><br /> Some rough edges in this image, but I have to give 7 out of 10 stars based on their consideration and yes, originality compared to usual, especially with a budget.']
