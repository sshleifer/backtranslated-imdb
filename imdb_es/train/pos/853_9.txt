['&quot;The Matador&quot; stars Pierce Brosnan as a burned assassin. He is James Bond who went to the seed, with too tight, squeaky clothes, gold chains and an ugly haircut. Our murderous fighter, Julian Noble, is in Mexico, trying to recover his courage. Staying at the same hotel is a nice businessman, Danny Wright (Greg Kinnear), who tries to regain his balance. Danny is desperate to close a deal and return with his wife to Denver (Hope Davis) with good news. <br /><br /> Noble and Wright unexpectedly become friends. Wright convinces Noble to reveal certain techniques, which he demonstrates in a bullfight. Noble is finally the target of their employers and appears in Denver. <br /><br /> Writer and director Richard Shepard asked the questions and answers after this enchanting film at the Austin Film Festival. Shepard also had bad luck. After suffering the loss of his agent and the rejection of recent scripts, he decided to write a story that no one would buy and create a character that no one would want to interpret. Then he called Pierce Brosnan. Brosnan regains his balance in this film. (There&#39;s life after Bond!) He has a wonderful talent for self-critical comedy. Do not miss it <br /><br /> Stay for the final credits to read what the filmmakers say about bullfighting. I look forward to more of Richard Shepard&#39;s projects.']
