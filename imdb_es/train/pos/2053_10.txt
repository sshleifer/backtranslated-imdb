First of all, I would like to say that this movie mocked more than any of the recent trash that Hollywood has cooked out of its entrails. McBain is a true action movie with more violence than most viewers can handle. It has all the classic elements of an action movie of the late 80s and early 90s ... the gratuitous random acts of violence (that is, when Walken and his team enter to confront drug dealers for money, they only appear and they kill them instead of letting them live and just take their money), the snap of the necks, the boys on fire, the boys who are fired from the buildings and, of course, the guys who are on fire who are fired from the buildings Walken is at his best in this image and offers memorable lines such as, "Let's sit .......... on the deck." and others who make this movie a top purchase of the Clearence rack at the local video store. If you feel thirst for blood for unnecessary random acts of violence, rent this movie today and satisfy your thirst.
