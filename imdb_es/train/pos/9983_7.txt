This film is basically about human relationships and the interaction between them. The main character is an old woman who in the twilight of her life begins a journey towards her past, making an analysis of how she lived her life. This trip is precipitated due to the economic crisis of the children and their intentions to put her in a nursing home. It is a very honest look at some issues that we all ask at some point in life, and there are many secondary ideas to discuss in this film, such as family legacy, real love, marriage or destiny. Although this type of film melodramas is nothing new, this can be useful to see with family members to discuss some ideas. There is a good performance of the actors and the characters are very credible, but due to the time, it is possible that some characters are not fully developed. I really recommend this movie for a quiet Saturday afternoon.
