I had read an article about Dan Jansen's Olympic and personal journey before watching this movie. I have always been intrigued by a story of hope and overcoming events that change lives, and this was no exception. <br /> <br /> The background of the characters provided gives you an idea of ​​the closeness of the family and the positive way in which they find themselves. They affected the lives of others. I can not speak of the precision of the specific details in this film, it is customary to take some creative license when organizing a script. However, the spirit of Dan and his family is what matters here. <br /> <br /> It is a worthwhile film of a story that should be told. I felt empathy for the characters and encouraged at the end.
