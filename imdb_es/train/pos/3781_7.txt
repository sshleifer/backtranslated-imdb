I would not dare to say that this movie is better than the original, but it is very good in its own right. However, the comedy in this film is as good as the original, there are so many scenes that make me laugh just thinking about them. <br /> <br /> The story in this movie is even stranger than the original, but that's what makes it so cool. Peter Hewitt does a great job directing this film with a great cast. The central cast of the original film returns to its characters in this film and everyone does a fantastic job with their roles. I do not care what others say, I think Keanu Reeves is a great actor! I really enjoyed his portrayal of Ted in both films as I did with Alex Winter's Bill. I was very happy to see George Carlin return to the role of Rufus, very good! Hal London Jr, who plays the father of Ted Logan, does a very good job. The scene in which Ted possesses the body of his father and Hal London Jr. begins to act as Ted is a great scene, and he achieves it in an impressive way. I can not forget to mention William Sadler as Death, he made the film completely for me. The rest of the cast is also pretty good. <br /> <br /> If you liked the first installment of the Bill and Ted series, then I hope you like this movie too. But, do not expect it to be as good as the original. I really hope you enjoy the movie, thanks for reading, <br /> <br /> -Chris
