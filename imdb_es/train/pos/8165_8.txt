The dentist was made at the time when almost all professions had psychology. We had crazy cops, ambulances, secretaries and that was only to begin with. The dentist arrived surprisingly late because going to the dentist is usually everyone's nightmare. <br /> <br /> The plot is crooked. The super clean dentist, Dr. Feinstone, lives a perfect life in his great "white house", has a beautiful blonde wife and an excellent place to work as a dentist. Dark clouds are coming to your horizon in the form of the nasty kid from the IRS (Terminator's Earl Boen), the dirty pool cleaner "cleans" his wife and all of a sudden, all the teeth seem to have gone through a dark filter. He goes crazy and begins to take care of people's teeth in the most unpleasant way. And you do not want to go your way. <br /> <br /> The crew was professional. The producer / director Brian Yuzna had produced elegant horror films such as Re-Animator and From Beyond. He directed the sequel to Re-Animator and his first film, Society, was a good derivation of They Live by John Carpenter. The producer of the film Pierre David is known for films such as Scanners. The cast was great. Corbin Bernsen really surprised me. I knew him from LA Law and Major League, but I could dream of him as a dental psychologist. Actually, he was great in his role and was a bit sad. Linda Hoffman was beautiful and silent like Feinstones' wife. Micahel Stadvec did not have many lines, but after seeing him with ladies from the neighborhood I knew my future profession. Ken Foree (Dawn of the Dead, From Beyond) was a good view as a policeman in the case. Virginya Keehne was the innocent teenager who is about to be Feinstone's next client. <br /> <br /> Final warning: if you are like me and have problems with the dentist, maybe you should skip this one. But if you want to try it you must prepare yourself with black humor and many unpleasant piercings.
