['This movie scared me so much when I was just a kid. He is not a &quot;citizen Kane&quot; but he has his moments. The arm ripping scene is good. The plot is good, even if the characters are not, it could have something to do with acting. Put some top-notch people in the roles and then see what you get. This was one of those shots, editions (what little there was) and we distributed the type of movies in a couple of months. This is a low budget science fiction classic and it deserves it. I rated it as a 9 based on other films of this genre and age.']
