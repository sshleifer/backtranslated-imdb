This film has a constant and disturbing rhythm backed by a great performance (one of Chamberlain's best performances) and a story that reveals itself to us over time. <br /> <br /> Beyond that, music completely sets the mood and music. helps maintain a restless, cautious and somber tone. <br /> <br /> Weir's story is reinforced by the use of aborigines, their stories and their tensions with the dominant white population to offer a fantasy tale that is sinister. <br /> <br /> Although they are not related to history or gender, this maintained the same feeling within me that the "Torno del cielo" by Ursula Le Guin (1980). <br /> <br /> "The Last Wave" is a dramatic thriller with some shocking moments. Remember, "hacking and cutting" does not make a movie a horror movie, it is the psychological element of fear and restlessness that resides in all of us.
