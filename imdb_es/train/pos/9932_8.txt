If you go to this movie waiting for something that is not, you will be disappointed, as with any movie. This film contains what Hemmingway described as the "iceberg effect". On the surface, it is simply a cache of random movie clips that were broken to make a movie. If this were written in a book, it would be a short story, because the action in the movie is very fast and, unless you really try to catch it, the reasoning behind the plot (along with a subtle omen) may very well happen to you. Definitely a movie that you will have to watch twice to fully appreciate it. Experimental cinematography hardly describes this movie. The camera work and postproduction add much to the general flavor of the film, which makes it quite artistic in some points and open to interpretation in others (something that is desired in American films in recent times). Although, in some parts it can be a bit obscene, frightening and too heavy for some audiences, the film never becomes completely unrealistic. The only aspect of the film that he would write as "needs improvement" is the selection of the soundtrack. No film is always good without an adequate soundtrack, and although the soundtrack is quite adequate, the opening is too long, and the other rap songs of the film could really have been replaced by something more appropriate (heavy rock, grungy or psychedelic electronics would have made this film a real journey, the flood of images and the dynamic color palettes ... add another "artistic" aspect, also combined with the events that happen throughout the film, this is not a movie that you can get lost in and still understand, but that also makes it a much more desirable movie to watch, and not one that bores you quickly.
