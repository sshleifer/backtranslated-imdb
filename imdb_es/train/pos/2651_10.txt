It's okay. The movie is better than the book. Do not get me wrong, I love the book. But the movie is much better. This movie has Jack Nicholson and Shelly Duvall at their best. (I have not seen Scatman Crothers and obviously Danny Lloyd in anything else). Some of the ideas used in this film are better than those used in the book. But I already talked about that in my commentary on the mini series. But, I missed some The film was filmed in a better place than where the mini series was filmed. And the REDRUM scenes are more scary than those in the book. So if you're looking for a great movie, get The Shining by Stanley Kubrick. But expect to have nightmares every night for 3 weeks.
