I grew up during the time when the music of this movie was popular. What a wonderful moment for music and dancing! My only complaint was that I was a bit too young to go to the USO and nightclubs. I guess it sounds like I'm living in the past, (I have wonderful memories), so what's wrong with that ?! World War II was a terrible time, except when it came to music. The death of Glenn Miller was a terrible sadness for us. This movie will be one of my favorites. Clio Laine was excellent; what a voice! I do not know how I missed this movie. My main reason for this comment is to alert the modern generation about an alternative to Rap and New Age music, which is offensive to me. Please watch this movie and give it a try!
