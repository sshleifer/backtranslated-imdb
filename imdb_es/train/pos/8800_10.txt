First of all, I do not understand why some people find this film so anti-American. Of course, there are times when the United States is directly accused, as in the segments of Youssef Chahine, Ken Loach and, to some extent, Mira Nair. But come on, they are not naive accusations; instead, they are based on real and documented facts, and all the documents that the CIA published about Chile confirm it, for example. <br /> <br /> But going back to the movie itself, what I most enjoyed is the Variety of moods that we find in it. We find children educated for the respect of all the people who died in the event; we find an unhappy couple that will be changed by the tragedy of that day; we find ordinary people who have their feelings degraded in the shadow of the events of September 11 and react differently to this, with dignity or frustration; we even find someone in the film for whom the fall of the towers is a reason for a moment of true happiness. <br /> <br /> All these visions and others, as powerful as these or even more, make a consistent and helpful combination. The viewer could see how different people from all over the world reacted to the events of September 11th. Therefore, what we see is a scenario that is much more complex than whites and blacks, and this can cause some people to get angry; but this is the world where we live, and in it there is no place for manicist ideologies, regardless of what the presidents or priests tell us. <br /> <br /> Finally, I think it's a shame that there is not even a release date for this movie in the United States of America. It's a shame because most Americans are wondering why this catastrophe happened and this movie could give you some clues. This film explains very clearly, unlike what some people think of this forum, that everything we do today will determine our future and that the mistakes of the past will affect the way we live today.
