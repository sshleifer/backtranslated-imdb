I've only seen the first series on DVD, but I would summarize The Sopranos as a plot by Shakespeare with a script similar to Tarantino. The series is as good as Goodfellas and Casino, and almost as good as The Godfather (therefore, it's not a "10"), and much better than any of Guy Ritchie's efforts. Although there is a lot of action, some of them quite bloody, the story is directed by the characters. Even some of the minor characters contribute to great story lines; eg the priest's relationship (or lack of it) with Carmilla and the restorer's wife, and Christopher and his foolish friend (who did not last long (a Darwin Award nominee?)) <br /> <br /> Apart from the plot, the script and the performance, the other reasons I liked; <br /> <br /> 1. I wanted to visit New Jersey and eat pasta with tomato sauce. 2. The music. 3. Show that, literally, anyone can suffer mental health problems.
