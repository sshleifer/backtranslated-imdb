['The prominent lawyer Walter Pidgeon takes a case of pro bono murder, wins an acquittal and discovers that his client (Keefe Braselle) was not only guilty but was part of a network of extortion that reached the highest pitfalls in the city. Changed by his own complicity, he undertakes an investigation, stumbles upon the identity of the &quot;unknown man&quot; who heads the union and murders him. <br /><br /> The ironies are committed when Braselle is accused of this second murder and Pidgeon must defend it by pointing out the existence of another &quot;unknown man&quot;: himself. Although a bit lacking in urban agility and long rhetoric, the Unknown Man belongs to the black cycle less for its style or structure than for its recognition of the widespread corruption of US municipal policy that came to light in the postwar years.']
