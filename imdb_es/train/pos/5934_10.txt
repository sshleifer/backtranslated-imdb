I'm sorry to say that I have no idea what Hollywood is doing. Of course they give us movies like Batman Begins. Oh, by the way Hollywood I think they can cover the storyline in the movie Batman, but please do not entertain us with what we really want to see Batman and Superman together. I really hated this trailer because it left me wanting more. I looked around to see when he left. It was like a terrible practical joke. The graphics where the story was good seemed solid and had all the trappings of a great movie. Unfortunately it will not happen for now. Great job for the producers, directors and all the actors, but I hate you for doing this to me. You left me wanting more.
