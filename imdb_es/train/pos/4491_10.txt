I love this film 'Primavera y vino de Oporto'. I was born in Leigh, a city about 7 miles from Bolton, I moved to Bolton in 1965 when I was 20 years old. My workplace was daily through Little Lever through Farnworth, sometimes by bicycle but then by car when I could pay. The film brings all the memories of the working-class neighbors who were almost always shattered, but who would always help you if they could. Fred Dibnah was just around the corner from Bromwich St. where my bed was. If you did not see the movie when it was first released, you can forgive it for comparing it to a soap like Coronation St, well, I agree it's a soap, but then, it was called 'Kitchen Sink Drama!' Watch this movie for the talented cast that soon after became a household name for frequent roles on television. I look mainly at the shots of the locality and the feeling of being good factor that people are poor but happy.
