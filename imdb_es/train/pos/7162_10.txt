This is one of my favorite movies of all time. I read the book and I liked it, but this film extends everything the book made famous. The performance is fantastic, especially Jon Voight, who plays Mr. Sir, a very evil character. This film has a certain form of storytelling that keeps you hooked at all times, until the end, where everything comes together for a grand finale. I also love the way this is going, alternating between modern history and the stories of Stanley's ancestors. The story was written by Louis Sachar, yes, but it seems that this story is made for the movie and Andrew Davis does a great job directing it. I definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys good movies.
