Playing as a kind of runner prior to The Great Escape some 13 years later, this crushing and small British film plays directly without emotion and dares to do well. The first part of the film is the configuration and the subsequent escape of our protagonists, while the second part focuses on their survival while fleeing while trying to get to Sweden. The film is based on pure characters with a simple dialogue, effective and, yes, credible to carry it out, and achieve their goals generously. There's not a lot of suspense that makes the movie go on, and as an adventure story it works perfectly during the time period it adheres to, so a big thumbs up to the movie that could be the first of its kind. <br /> <br /> 7/10
