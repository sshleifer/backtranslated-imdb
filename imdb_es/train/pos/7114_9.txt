Definitely, among the first five of John Garfield's best films must be the Pride of the Marines. It is the real story of the soldier Al Schmid, who at the cost of his own sight, while wounded, stopped a horde of Japanese who assaulted in Guadalcanal. <br /> <br /> The story is divided into three parts, the family life of Al Schmid, in which he is a simple and rigid worker who is getting serious with a woman and who does not like anything more than his night of bowling. Pearl Harbor is bombed and he is at war like millions of others. <br /> <br /> The second part is in Guadalcanal and we see part of the action in which it is in a nest of isolated machine guns, stopping the Japanese troops. Its action prevented that the positions of the Marines were invaded, but a grenade does it before his sight. <br /> <br /> And, of course, the third part is its painful adaptation to civil life and the tranquility that people do not only care about them. for pity, most of the girl I saw with Eleanor Parker. <br /> <br /> This film was broadcast by TCM on John Garfield's 95th birthday and there was a documentary about Garfield presented by his daughter. One of the people interviewed said that Garfield was the most credible actor in the working class roles in having and having a union card. <br /> <br /> In that sense, he was lucky because he landed with Warner Brothers in Hollywood. Although he continued to be classified in gangster roles in the tradition of that study, Garfield was fantastic in these parts because of his past, because it came from the kind of life that Al Schmid had, with the exception of the Jewish origin of Garfield. <br /> <br /> In that regard, it was perfect to play the role of a working class hero like Al Schmid, who accepted the responsibility of defending his country. There are no superheroes here, just a guy who would have preferred to go back to Philadelphia, but do a job that needed to be done. <br /> <br /> It's a big part for Garfield. It is a film that one should not miss. I wonder, however, what happened to the real Al Schmid.
