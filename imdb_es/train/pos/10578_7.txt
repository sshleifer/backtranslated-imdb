"Footlight Parade" is just one of several wonderfully funny musicals that Warner Bros. produced in the early 1930s to ward off the Depression. "42nd Street" and the Golddiggers series were also produced during this era, and literally, millions of Americans forget about their problems for a while and have fun. <br /> <br /> While most of the films produced had the great talents of Joan Blondell, Ruby Keeler and Dick Powell, only Foolight Parade had the incomparable James Cagney. Almost ten years before his best-known musical, "Yankee Doodle Dandy." Here he dances in the most original of the styles of dance, with the arms generally lowered to the sides and legs doing all kinds of undulations and kicks. It is easy to see that he is having fun, and that makes us enjoy it even more. <br /> <br /> While almost all the musical sequences appear at the end of the film, they are worth the wait. I think this movie was made just before the installation of the production code, so some of the costumes and scenes are a bit risky. But everything is fun. <br /> <br /> No matter what the plot of the movie is, you only know that there are a lot of laughs and a superlative cast. In addition to the aforementioned, Guy Kibbee is in his best mood here. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10
