['The original with Barbara Stanwyk is saved only by the performance of Stanwyk. The story and the other performances are too sweet and the film itself is too old-fashioned to be enjoyed today. Bette Midler&#39;s version is much more interesting. She is Stella Claire, an independent and free-spirited single woman who becomes pregnant and refuses to receive help from her boyfriend (Stephen Collins) or his friend (John Goodman in an underrated performance). She raises her daughter Jenny played so sweetly by Trini Alvarado and then concludes that Jenny&#39;s father can do better for her and, ultimately, makes a life-altering decision. Throughout the film, there are many laughs, tears and memorable moments, mainly between Midler and Alvarado. Marsha Mason co-stars as the possible stepmother of Jenny, who although rich, turns out to be a very good influence for her. If you like Midler, Goodman or just good movies with a lot of emotion, you will enjoy the STELLA version of Bette Midler.']
