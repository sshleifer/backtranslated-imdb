This is a very dark and intriguing horror thriller based on the idea of ​​religious assassinations. The story centers on a deranged man who lives in Texas, USA. UU., Who will suddenly kill his two small children after God ordered him to redeem the world from bad people. <br /> <br /> Bill Paxton, who directs this film plays the deranged father, known as the Hand of God Assassin, while Matthew McConaughey performs his best performances to date as the eldest son, Fenton Meiks. The film revolves around Fenton, who decides he can no longer bear the burden of his murderous childhood alone and uses flashbacks to tell the story to FBI agent Wesley Doyle (played by Powers Boothe). <br /> <br /> I can not think. of many films that literally keep the viewer chained to their seat from beginning to end and this is definitely one of them. Even if you want to stop looking, you can not do it because of the power of this movie. <br /> <br /> The directors have filmed this movie very well, and they help the plot unfold across the stage. . The acting in this film is excellent, but if there is any problem it is that some parts are very powerful and can bother some people. <br /> <br /> While the concept of this film is very dark, young children help to portray the idea through brilliant acting. This is really a tingling movie and is guaranteed to have you on the edge of your seat at all times. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys horror, disturbing and powerful movies or anyone who just wants to see something different. <br /> <br /> 8/10
