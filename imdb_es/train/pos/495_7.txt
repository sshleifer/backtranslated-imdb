<br /> <br /> There is a STAR TREK canon - a lot. From canon we know the history of the future. Advances in technology, events, places, first contacts with new beings, names, dates, etc. <br /> <br /> ENTERPRISE largely ignore much of ST canon. An unfortunate fact for serious fans for a long time. As one, I assumed that the producers would at least take a look at the first episodes of TOS and retro from there, but no. <br /> <br /> Phase guns, like much of the technology, look much more modern than the one found in TOS. An old-style Starfleet laser gun, a slow golden dot protractor effect, that's what I expected to see. Also, I did not expect to hear sound effects purely based on beeps similar to TNG, but far removed from the TOS sound effects. <br /> <br /> In the oldest view of TOS (the original pilot: THE CAGE), we see a Starfleet with a more formal military aspect: a bit of the old Navy of the Earth. With ENTERPRISE, we see a surprising disdain for rank. There is more military code in STAR BLAZERS cartoons than in COMPANIES. <br /> <br /> It's fine that Captain Archer is not sure of the needs of the Universe (unlike Kirk, who never lacked confidence in his application of human justice). ), but within the company they all look the same. Not professional, insecure, more distant from the feeling of formal military service than in any ST series, and that says a lot! <br /> <br /> The opening song of informal country music announces the trips of a family instead of the adventures of an important and large military ship. <br /> <br /> ENTERPRISE seeks to show us a mostly fun and warm exploration of human relationships instead of leading us to a historical exploration, bold, courageous and high level of space. <br /> <br /> I would have selected Adrian Paul to play the Captain and an older human as a doctor. Still, I liked the actors for the most part. Linda Park, a prominent ballroom dancer at Boston College, will surely develop well. The characters that make up the crew seem to have been created carefully. <br /> <br /> The COMPANY begins its career stronger than that of the last three STAR TREK series. Let's hope for a good future!
