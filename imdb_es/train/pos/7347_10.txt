I own Ralph Bakshis, a forgotten masterpiece of Fire & Ice, on an old videotape for rental of home objects. <br /> <br /> Well, first of all, this is better than any other Conan-esque movie you'll ever see. Sure, it's corny, but who cares? He passed the test of time, and the only way he started looking corny is in comparison to the modern fantasy epics like LOTR: FOTR (although I love that movie). <br /> <br /> The plot is as follows: After a battle between Fire & Ice, a daughter of the kings is kidnapped by subhuman creatures Jarols (Ice), while the only survivor of a victimized village rescues her. <br /> <br /> Yes, it does not sound as original as a Betty nurse, but that's not the point. It really is to give life to an interesting idea of ​​a world of two enemies: Fire and Ice. And it is successful. <br /> <br /> Regarding the action scenes: excellent. They handle well, they have a great suspension and they have a lot of loud noises. Just take a look at the climate battle, now that it's an end! <br /> <br /> The acting and the dialogue: competent. Really. They're not going to be nominated for an Oscar, but they're good and they do not get nervous. <br /> <br /> The animation is pretty good. Taken in 3D and rotoscopado (I think), it looks pretty good. Many of the backgrounds seem very detailed and well drawn, and although the designs of the characters feel a little in 1 dimension, they are fine. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a little neglected jewel that will entertain you more. than any of the superficial "entertainments". 10/10
