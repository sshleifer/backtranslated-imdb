The facial expressions of Andie MacDowell are again great in this movie. When you enter 40 and have been single for a while (or your whole life), you may feel that you are consuming. The movie is a sweet reminder that love can be found anywhere if your antenna is very active. I liked the quick sexual encounter, which must be out of place for a normally reserved school teacher (MacDowell). Your former student is nice enough, he is still in love with his teacher for so long. <br /> <br /> However, there are some parts that I found unrealistic or impractical. For example, in a scene in which the jealousy of other women was canceled and a scene was created to make Andie MacDowell leave the young man, a mature cop (the other friend of MacDowell) would allow her friend to do such a sinister act ? Is it so easy for someone not to stop in front of a car? Of course, accidents happen all the time, but I expected to see the heroine marry happily with the first man she got involved with (it was the hardest part to believe !! That such a beautiful woman remains single by So much time!) ... <br /> <br /> Perhaps movie producers are aware of the fact that many of the romances between an older woman and a younger man do not last long. In addition, they know that a happy ending would not attract the public, especially the jealousy of over 40 years, who expect some miracles to happen. The sad end with a glimmer of hope for the sad woman who lost her true love is sweet, but if man continued to live, would that last? For how long? Nobody knows. However, it's a movie to make you want to see her again sometime ... a year later, maybe.
