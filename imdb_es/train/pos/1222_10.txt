I listened to this short on a DVD of the best shorts in New Zealand, all great, but The French Doors was amazing. Start slowly and ask yourself if something is going to happen. Just when you relax on the drum of home renovation, the most spooky happens. <br /> <br /> EEEEkkk, I wanted to stop looking, but I was stuck. <br /> <br /> The films are immersed in the primordial fear of the dark and with little or no special effect. It cools you to the bone. A simple but brilliant concept opened all those memories of when I was young and I could not see the most improbable but spooky situations. <br /> <br /> The visual style of the filmmakers is marked and the main character takes you convincingly through the story. It's a quality short that I have not seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> French doors have all the characteristics of a great feature, unfortunately, it ends after about ten minutes. Never less a grand finale that begs you to want to know more. <br /> <br /> I loved it and well done and thank you for the trip. These New Zealanders are really turning talent. <br /> <br /> A new fan.
