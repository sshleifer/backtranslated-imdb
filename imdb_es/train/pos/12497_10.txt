If you have not seen this Mary-Kate and Ashley movie yet, then all I can say is, "What are you waiting for?" This is another fabulous and wonderful movie of the fraternal twins that we all know and love so much! It's fun, romantic, exciting and absolutely stunning (in terms of landscapes)! Of course; As always, Mary-Kate and Ashley are the main stage here anyway! Would any real fan want it any other way? Of course, no! Anyway; It's a great movie in every sense of the word, so if you have not seen it yet, now you must do it! I want to say now too! So, what are you waiting for? I promise you will not be disappointed! Sincerely, Rick Morris
