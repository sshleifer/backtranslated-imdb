The holes, the novel, were forced on me in an education course. I did not think I would like a novel for children; Also, the other couple of books that forced me to read for the class were very bad. But, to my surprise, I loved the holes. It really is one of the best written novels I've read. I think it has the rare quality that makes it attractive to pre-teens, teens and adults. Everyone who reads it, I think, will leave with a better person. While I can not say the same about the movie, I'm happy to say that they did it mostly. I do not think that the movie's spectators go away as enriched, but they will certainly entertain themselves, without the side effect of being stupider when they sit down. It's an intelligent story, and it's very well told. I think it moves a little too fast. The novel takes more time to develop the characters. And flashbacks come and go so fast that they do not have much time to register. Interracial romance in the past feels more clich√©d and trite than in the novel. And the ending, which unites all the loose threads, seems very ridiculous. It's exactly the same in the novel, but there's a sense of the absurd that does not exist in the movie. It works much better. I also do not like the multitude of pop songs. I wish Disney did not feel so much need to sell soundtracks. The cast is excellent, from small children to old professionals. Jon Voight is especially great. Although I'm not sure why we need Catwoman and Fonze. 9/10.
