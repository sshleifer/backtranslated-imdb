I have seen almost all of Miyazaki's films, and they are all beautiful and captivating. But this rises above the rest. This movie totally impressed me! <br /> <br /> I fell in love with Pazu and Sheeta, and with their sweet and loving friendship. They were the ones who made the movie for me. Of course, the animation is also excellent and the music perfectly captures the feelings in the film. But the characters are the bright spot of this film: they are very well developed and full of personality. <br /> <br /> Now, let me clarify: I'm really talking about the Japanese version of the movie (in English subs). While dubbing in English is good (mostly), it simply pales in comparison to the original language version. The voices are better, the dialogue, everything. So I suggest seeing (and listening to) the movie as it was originally.
