The fantastic performance. The story, incredible. The script, wonderful. <br /> <br /> Only some ways to describe this movie. Yes, it is slow and mostly speaking, but the full story of all their lives and how flashbacks are thrown in and out makes you want to hear every little thing to learn more about this disturbing and tragic story. I myself am reading the book on which the film is based and it has shown me even more light in this story and answers some questions that were left unanswered in the film. I must also read the Exectioner's song, which is the "other" half of Gilmore's story. This movie made me think a lot about the phrase "drilling on the other side of the mirror". You hear a song in the movie called Gary Gilmore's Eyes, which is from a punk band that wrote a song about what it would be like to have the eyes of Gary Gilmore (which is one of the things that Gary gave as a transplant when he died). and as you listen to it, which is after the last time Mikal sees Gary, you look at the situation a little differently if you were only here in the song. This movie opened my eyes that way and in many others. I highly recommend this movie (and the book).
