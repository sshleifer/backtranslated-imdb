If you have some kind of appreciation for character and dialogue, and some sense of American cultural history, you will find a lot of very absorbing material in this movie. It was probably originally a play, and that is why it is a heavy dialogue, but I can not emphasize enough how these icons of which we only have a superficial understanding become truly complex and wonderful characters. <br /> <br /> This movie is better than any college course to tell you how to create a story based on characters. <br /> <br />
