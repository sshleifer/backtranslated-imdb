I can not believe that this movie is currently rated at 6.9. Anyway, this movie was probably one of the most moving real Indian films I've seen. It was really refreshing to see a movie that showed traditional family cinema. As for the story, I thought it was great that it was shahid kapur in an arranged marriage with Amrita Rao. He is a happy and fortunate type of person, while Amrita Rao is a traditional Indian girl who is very useful for her uncle, but the only problem is that her cousin does not get as much attention as her, so her aunt does not like Amrita with a passion. This bothers Amrita because she only wants her aunt to love her. It was also very moving to see that, although Amrita's family was not as rich, maybe just middle class to lower class, while the Shahids were upper class, they still treated their family with respect and did not even ask them to they discarded, what really hit a nerve with me. This is because I have actually seen people being very rude to people who are not so well off as to think they are below their standards, which I think is very superficial. This movie showed that the Shahids family was willing to see the great values ​​with which Amrita had been educated and turned a blind eye to the fact that she was not a daughter of wealthy business magnates or anything. In general, this movie deserved an 8/10. I would like more and more movies of this type to be made.
