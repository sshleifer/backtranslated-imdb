An excellent example of "cowboy noir", as it has been called, in which Michael (Nicolas Cage), unemployed, loses a job because he insists on being honest (he has a lazy leg). With really nothing else to do, he decides that for once he will lie. When he enters a bar, and the owner Wayne (the late and great JT Walsh) confuses him with a murderer whom Wayne has hired to do on his sexy and young wife Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle in good shape), Michael follows ahead. and accept the Waynes money. * Then * approaches Suzanne and informs her of their husbands' intentions, and accepts * her * money to get rid of Wayne. If that did not complicate things enough, the real hit man, "Lyle from Dallas" (Dennis Hopper, in a perfect role for him) appears and Michael is in more trouble than before. <br /> <br /> "Red Rock West" gets a lot from the locations. Director John Dahl, who co-wrote the script with his brother Rick, was smart to realize the potential of a story set in a truly isolated small town that may have seen better days and where residents could participate in any kind of scheme . . It is also a fun idea of ​​the kind of problems that an honest person could have if he decided to abandon his principles and give in to any level of temptation. It is a sensibly dark and charged story with a variety of main characters who, if they are not corrupt, have at least been morally committed as Michael. The lighting of cinematographer Marc Reshovsky is excellent in his state of mind; Even the climax in a cemetery gives a good morbid quality to the whole affair. Even if the writing is not particularly "logical or credible", the film has a good way of intriguing the viewer and simply drawing it directly. <br /> <br /> Cage does a good job at the head, but his co-stars have spent a great moment sinking their teeth into their meaty and greedy motivated characters. Hopper, Boyle and Walsh are fun to watch in these parts. Timothy Carhart and Dan Shor are fine as officers of Walshs (in a particularly good turn, Walsh is also the local sheriff), and there is an entertaining cameo role for Dwight Yoakam, country and western star, who also adorns the film with a nice ending. tune in. <br /> <br /> It's a good movie that's worth checking out. Proceed at an impressive rate, and if there is nothing else, it will never be boring. <br /> <br /> 8/10
