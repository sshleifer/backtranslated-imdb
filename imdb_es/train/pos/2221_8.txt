One night I came across this at the Bravo satellite station. Initially out of curiosity, I decided to see it. To be honest, I was not disappointed. The main character is beautiful and his body looks good. You would think that his talent would be wasted like an executioner but apparently not after seeing the whole movie. My only real complaint is the performance of the cast, especially the actor who plays Melnik. Christ is bad! The prison guard Hank is also regrettable. All he does is get drunk and make bad attempts to try it with his co-guard Wanda, although luckily for us the viewer and for Hank he gets sad and dirty with Wanda near the end. The music used is quite tense and creates the perfect environment for performances. This movie looks good alone for the beautiful, talented and very sexy Jennifer Thomas.
