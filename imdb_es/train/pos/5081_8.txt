This movie was great and even with an unconvincing ending, it's still worth watching. The film begins when Claudette Colbert is about to marry Robert Ryan. When the minister asks if anyone has any objection, a man jumps and announces that Colbert CAN NOT get married because she is already married. Colbert insists that this is not true, but when they investigate they find that the Justice of the Peace and many others remember his wedding and there is even a signed wedding license. Slowly, it becomes clear that Claudette's mind is slipping and the people around her seriously doubt her sanity. Then, when the supposed first husband is murdered, all the evidence and suspicion fall on Colbert. <br /> <br /> The film is a thriller and exciting mystery, since what I have described so far is only the first half of the film. . What follows is incredibly intelligent and captivating. Unfortunately, the conclusion, however, is a bit disappointing, since the guiding force behind all this comes "just outside the left field", and it is disconcerting since it was so unexpected and impossible to guess based on the information given to the viewer. However, despite this, the film was so good that I can even excuse the inert end. In particular, Robert Ryan did a great job as promised "up to the knuckles", although, apart from him, the other performances were also excellent.
