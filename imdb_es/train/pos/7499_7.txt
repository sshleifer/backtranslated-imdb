But it's a bit hilarious, at least if you grew up in Weird Al, as I did. It's a fake documentary about his life and his career, which starts with stardom and retraces the origins. It is irregular in some places, but some of the segments are still very funny, especially when going to Japan. Although it does not have a texture as emotional as Lost in Translation, and he does not find the love for fleeting that it is, it captures in a bottle the absolutely strange cultural mixture that is the street life of Tokyo. <br /> <br /> Maybe Weird Al does not recognize himself as the insightful cultural commentator he is; maybe a rose with any other name would smell just as sweet. Still, this is a fun movie.
