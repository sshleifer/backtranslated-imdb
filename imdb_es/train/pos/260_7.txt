Woohoo! A Danish movie with this kind of content? I mean, the actors, the story, the images, the efx, everything was where it should be. <br /> <br /> And a Danish EFX house that produces those VFX - Wow! This is like the 2nd or 3rd time that a Danish FX produces visual effects of that quality. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER NEXT * The turn with the ghostly children in the submarine was pretty good, but in general I did not feel The great chill I would expect from a ghost movie. * END OF SPOILER * <br /> <br /> But anyway, this is a Danish film that I, as a Danish, can be proud of. <br /> <br /> The only "bad" thing about this is that I was not a Danish director, but a Swedish one.
