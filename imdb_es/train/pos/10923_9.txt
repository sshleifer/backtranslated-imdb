['This movie is really good. The plot, which works like a puzzle, forces the viewer to think and guess, what will happen next. This trick brings many surprises and makes the viewer anxious to solve an enigma. The fight scenes are very good. There are many different combat styles (although one of the styles was a little unreal to me, but it&#39;s just my opinion), and it&#39;s a fascinating show. The only thing that can be irritating is the appearance of the actors. A little too effeminate (at least for me). Hong Kong was always good at kung fu movies, especially in the 70s and 80s, so &quot;Five Venoms&quot; (or other versions) is a great choice.']
