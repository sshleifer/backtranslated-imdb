What the movie really represents The 60s (for those of us who growled in the belly of the United States in those times) is the turbulence and diversity of the decade. Despite the exaggerated and stereotyped characters, the authenticity of the problems remains clear. <br /> <br /> It was not only those radical times of change, but also very confusing times. Two basic things changed our world then: the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the overwhelming influence of the media. Those two new freedoms began social changes that were soon institutionalized. <br /> <br /> From the chaos came the sensitivity, from the disorder came the values. However, keep in mind that the majority of Americans did not participate in this ... they worked, they played, they saw the news ... and little by little they were affected by the efforts and struggles of minorities ... Civil Rights The workers, the political activists, the anti-war efforts, the war against poverty ... <br /> <br /> The representation of the power of the press and television in particular, was well reflected, although the conflict between the attitude of the general public and those who sought to change things were, in the best of cases, ignored ... and, at worst, falsified. The middle-class Americans were not all standing angry holding baseball bats or rejecting their misguided daughters. They were also confused. Let's not forget how the folk singers suddenly became protest singers, and how The Beatles began an onslaught that killed the popular protest movement. There are no Beatle songs in the movie, not even a mention of them. <br /> <br /> I think that if you did not live through the decade, you may not have an idea of ​​what the film is about, the general theme. The image is a bit dim. At one point I kept a steady job while my sister lived in the Hog Farm commune and went to Woodstock. At another time I was in Haight Asbury and in the Detroit riots while she worked and played as a housewife in Maine and Connecticut. The roles changed constantly. <br /> <br /> The film shows three brothers from a middle class family. They represent the hippie child, the political activist and active military personnel. Dad represents typical attitudes, and Mom represents the voice of reason, tolerance and, sometimes, commitment ... for the sake of peace. <br /> <br /> The Black family consists of a minister and his son ... disproportionately, I think. I guess the producers knew all the variables and had to settle for limitations, or else the film would have become a long and boring documentary. Dad's message was that anger produces bitterness and bitterness produces chaos. Clearly, it was a message addressed to the young people of today. <br /> <br /> We are looking for a unique solution to social problems, and also how problems divide us ... The 60s were unusual that way, and only Roar 20s compare. In other words, this movie has a moral after all. In the end, it is our Collective Individualism that survives. Put that on your oxymoron list. <br /> <br /> Everyone was a God, a Guru or a free spirit genius in the 60s. It was a time of magic and madness. No one is going to nail the sixties to the right ... it was too diverse (this movie is close). At least we can say that we are not ashamed of that, that we learned and grew from that, and that, for once, a generation shaped and changed the United States ... for the better.
