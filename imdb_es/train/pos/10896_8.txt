At first I did not think Ben Affleck could really make a funny Christmas movie. I was not wrong, my daughter invited me to see this with her and she did not disappoint me at all. James Gandolfini was fun, I really liked Christina Appelagate, and Catherine O 'Hara was also good, the story is what really sold me, I mean, also put up with the family, at the table for the people you barely see but one or twice a year, and we probably do not get along anyway, you really need as much alcohol as your system can handle Christmas, so I thought the premise was good there, buying the family with $ 250,000, it was a bit of the wild side , but it turned out that it worked quite well for me, because it was a riot at all times, it shows the class struggle of the different families. It has many fun moments, including embarrassing things on the computer for a teenager. In general, I loved this movie and will see it again next Christmas or sooner if my daughter also wants it.
