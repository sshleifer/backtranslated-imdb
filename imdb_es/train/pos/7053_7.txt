Do not confuse "War Inc." for a well-chiseled satire or an intelligent comedy full of jokes for news fans. It is not. <br /> <br /> This is an old-fashioned Screwball comedy, with ridiculously casual plot twists, stock characters (given some depth in the fun performances of John Cusack, Joan Cusack, Marisa Tomei and Hillary Duff) and a direct approach to political content. <br /> <br /> You see, the political points of the filmmakers are things that almost the whole country already knows to be true. Yes, we understand that the corporations that take advantage of the war are corrupt, inept pigs, the political leaders in charge of it are even more useless, and the US imperialism has never been so discourteous and more out of touch than at this moment , but none of that is the point. <br /> <br /> Here, all that noise is the scenery that they decorate, sometimes in a brilliant way, like the backdrop of a silly game, like the character of John Cusack (the blow (man with heart) to change his life with the help of the journalist who has no confidence in him (Tomei) and the young star of the Middle East who wants to cancel his marriage (Duff) .The sister of Cusack, Joan, plays her assistant with a quality almost caricaturally Ben Kingsley seemed to me squandered in his smaller part as a ruthless CIA boss. <br /> <br /> That's it, and it works, it's a lot of fun, but if somehow you can not see reality and You think the war is going well and that everyone involved is doing a good job and there is no corruption and people in the Middle East want our Western culture to supplant theirs, so you may not find it so fun. <br /> < For the rest of us, it was a light comedy with a ve political ntaja.
