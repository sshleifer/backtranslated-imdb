We do not find films about the brother-sister relationship in Indian cinema or in any other language or medium. This relationship has several aspects that have not been exploited in movies or novels. Usually, a sister is represented as a stack that can be used to obtain a ransom at the climax. This film deals with the subject in a completely different light. <br /> <br /> It is inspired by George Eliot's novel "The Mill on the Floss". The brother is very prosaic, all right, the blue-eyed boy who is conventionally a good son and a favorite of his mother. The sister is romantic, wild and defiant of the unwritten rules of society. Despite this, the sister-sister's love is the winner. <br /> <br /> This film is about the love of the two brothers who are separated in childhood and the resurgence of the same feeling when they meet years later. . It is also the quest of the tenuous brother to meet his sister, who has chosen to be wild to challenge the world. <br /> <br /> Although the film and the novel are located at a distance of approximately 3 centuries in two distant countries, however, the feelings are the same and are still true.
