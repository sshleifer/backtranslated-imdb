I was so surprised at how great Man on the Moon was. At first, I expected a cheesy and predictable movie, but I decided to put it aside when I saw it. Well, when it was over, I stayed. stunned (mostly in tears), so great it turned out to be The Man on the Moon. This movie is very entertaining and is very aware of its tone, and it is simply a fabulous movie. The performance was excellent, especially from Reece Witherspoon (who was so cute and adorable), and everyone else. There was nothing that really bothered me, I felt that the end was predictable, but it was very well done. I also felt that some things were clear or as if they had been made. before, but it's still a great movie. In general, I must say that I do not have much to say about this movie, it's not that it's bad, it's just a movie that you like or do not like. However, I would recommend this to anyone and everyone, even if you do not like this kind of movies, it's still a nice movie. <br /> <br /> 8.7 out of 10 stars
