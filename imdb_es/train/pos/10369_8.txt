"A Cry in the Dark" is a film masterpiece, disturbing and incredibly provocative. The true story of Lindy Chamberland, who, in 1980, witnessed a horrible vision, seeing her 3-month-old baby being brutally removed from her family's tent, while camping inside Austrailian. Azaria (the baby) was never seen again, and the result of her horrific disappearance caused a real frenzy in the whole world. Meryl Streep does immaculate justice to the role of Lindy, as she always does. But the one thing that helps "A Cry in the Dark" never fall flat is the brilliant direction. A truly inspired and accurate perspective in this disconcerting case, tears are brought to the eyes. The concept is nothing short of terrifying, and then you're delighted, but also inspired.
