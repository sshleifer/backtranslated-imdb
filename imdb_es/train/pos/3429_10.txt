I saw this movie premiere on Friday (1/19) of the night in Park City for Sundance and I was incredibly moved. Sitting in a theater and hearing firsthand the anguish of the soldiers was almost more than I could bear. Others in the audience were equally moved, and although we wanted to get away, the least we could do was bear witness, as these men and women shared their experience with us. Robert Acosta, Paul Rieckhoff, Sean Huze and Herold Noel, all veterans of the war in Iraq and featured in the film, were present. While they may be home now, you can see that this war is still inside them and probably always will be. Whether you support the war or not, it is OUR duty to support the troops with something more than a bumper sticker. Watch this movie!
