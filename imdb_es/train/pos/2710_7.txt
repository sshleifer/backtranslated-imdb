This is not my favorite WIP ("Women in Prison"), but it is one of the most famous films of the subgenre. It was produced by Roger Corman, who at this point had already produced some WIPs. It is obvious that the film tries to play with the established formula. The film takes place in a US prison. UU., Not in a "banana republic" like most WIP movies. I'm not sure if it was a success, but it's an acceptable change of pace. The writer and director Demme really gets involved in his work, always looking for new ways to present a family scenario. In fact, he is a bit too ambitious for his own good. The filmmaker creates a few sequences of surrealistic dreams that are almost pretentious, but it's fun to see how much he tries to put this movie above his average of chick-string movies. But do not worry, Demme still operates within the parameters of the subgenre. There is a lot of nudity and violence, something that will satisfy unconditional fans. The movie is a bit slow, but it's very entertaining. The cast is good. Roberta Collins is a veteran of WIP, so she does not need a presentation, and Barbara Steel is as crazy as the crazy wheelchair director. However, Pam Grier is very surprised.
