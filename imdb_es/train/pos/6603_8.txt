I have to mention two failures for you to understand that this film had a brilliant success when they failed: "A Scanner Darkly" and "Immortel Ad Vitam". If you were touched by the concepts of these two films and you felt sadly disappointed (like me), you will probably enjoy the Renaissance. It immerses you in the world of a future Paris. It is not entirely dystopian. They did the animation so well that I thought it was rotoscopied, but from what I can tell, it was not, it was just a capture of movement. The facial expressions are incredible! Not since TRON have I seen a fantasy world so well represented in a live animation / hybrid. The black and white medium is used to slowly direct its attention to the subject of the scene; My favorite effect was what they did with the lights of the headlights, look at it. The director plays with his attention and confusion, but finally is satisfied to find the thread he wants to find. The general effect is a rough and harsh urban world full of small surprises. <br /> <br /> The plot is secondary, but it is not terrible. It's noir-ish. There is a background story for most of the main characters that give them some depth. There is a climate There are "sets" to make you feel as if you were in different places in Paris. There is some action, and even a car chase. I'm going to have to see this again to get everything. I also recommend a very large screen to see it since the "sets" are detailed and the credits are small.
