['I just watched this movie, and I&#39;ve fallen in love with it. There&#39;s a little something for everyone, and it&#39;s particularly free for everyone when it comes to the romance between Lachlan and Lil. When they are on the beach, I almost cry ... realizes that time is the most precious asset and is most evident when they are together. This idea has been taken from several angles, from marriage to sibblings, until finding love in the least conventional place. The movie almost makes you want that kind of despair when you know that tomorrow could be your last. Crowe was particularly wonderful in his role as Lachlan. I&#39;ve always had a weakness for the accent, but I almost melted with his interpretation of his character. The way this film was filmed is also beautiful, with the music, the background of the open fields and the excellent performance. All together, this is a wonderful movie that pulls all human emotions.']
