** Attention Spoilers ** <br /> <br /> First of all, let me say that Rob Roy is one of the best movies of the '90s. It was an incredible achievement for everyone involved, especially the performance of Liam Neeson, Jessica Lange, John Hurt, Brian Cox and Tim Roth. Michael Canton Jones painted a wonderful portrait of the honor and dishonor that men can represent in themselves. But, ay ... <br /> <br /> constantly, and unfairly compares with "Braveheart". These are two completely different movies, probably just similar in that they both deal with Scots in historic Scotland. However, this comparison often bothers me because it seems that "Braveheart" is almost supposed to be a better movie than "Rob Roy". I really like "Braveheart", but the idea of ​​comparing it with "Rob Roy" is a bit insulting to me. In short, I love "Braveheart," but it's a pale shadow of how much I love "Rob Roy." Here are my particular reasons ... <br /> <br /> - "Rob Roy" is about real people. <br /> <br /> Let's face it, William Wallace in "Braveheart" is not a real person. He is a legend, a martyr, a figure bigger than life. Due to this description, he is also a perfect person, never does anything wrong and basically shows his Scottish compatriots to the promised land. When it finally fails, it's not your fault. Like Jesus, he is betrayed by the people he trusted the most. He even goes through the worst kind of torture because he wants freedom so much. <br /> <br /> Wallace's performance is very well done and very effective. But it really does not inspire or intrigue me. I find human ambiguity much more fascinating than human perfection. That's why "The Last Temptation of Christ" is a better movie than "King of Kings", and that's also one of the reasons why I think "Rob Roy" is better than "Braveheart". Rob Roy can be heroic and brave, but he is far from perfect. He makes several mistakes that affected the lives of many of his loved ones. Now, of course, not taking a false claim against the Duke of Argyll was an act of nobility and courage, but it was also an act of selfishness and self-centeredness. Let's not forget that the relatives he had claimed to protect were left homeless at the end of the film because of this act. But Rob did the best he could, and that was all you asked. <br /> <br /> Rob's wife, Mary, is also a normal and ambiguous person. Let's start, however, with how it looks in this movie. Sure, she's beautiful, but she does not wear makeup and basically allows her to see her natural beauty. Compare this with the two loves (or one, according to your point of view) of William Wallace in "Braveheart". Now these two ladies are attractive, but they hardly indicate what women looked like at that time (especially lay people). It may not be a fair comparison, but just another example of how Rob Roy's precision attempts are much more effective. <br /> <br /> Throughout "Rob Roy", Mary has to live with her brutal rape by the cowardly carrion, Cunningham. She feels compelled to tell Rob about her struggle, but not because she knows Rob should seek revenge for her rape. Said vengeance would surely mean Rob's death, and Mary is not prepared for such a sacrifice. <br /> <br /> The villains in "Rob Roy" are just as convincing. Although the enemies in "Braveheart" are well written, they are hardly original. Robert the Bruce, a brave and cowardly man, is plagued by moral decisions that are all familiar in the fictional realm. Should he take his claim as the King of Scotland, or should he betray Wallace to ensure the safety of his surname? Bruce is the most ambiguous character of "Braveheart", but from Brutus in "Julius Ceasar" to Fredo in "The Godfather Part II", these types of characters are not original. Longshanks, although a convincing villain in his own right, is very one-dimensional. He is the epidemic of evil, and his tyrannical forms contrast directly with Wallace's heroism. <br /> <br /> "Rob Roy" has three villains who are wonderful in their deception. First of all, let's start with the Marquis of Montrose. He is a man so obsessed with his self-image that he is willing to let an innocent man suffer for it. "Make sure you do not make fun of me" are your favorite words of your "factor". He is a man obsessed with power, annoyed because a man of great nobility like the Duke of Argyll can be considered of greater providence than he. It is shamefully self-obsessed and insecure. He is an evil aristocrat, but in ways that make him unique. <br /> <br /> Cunningham and Callarn are the conspirators in "Rob Roy", and they are also Roy's direct assailants. Callarn is so cunning in his cowardice that it is almost comical. He will do whatever it takes to maintain the goodwill of the Marquis, which includes stabbing and trickery. Cunningham is a convincing character, since he seems to have been educated to do everything possible to obtain the status and affection of the Marquis. He needs a father, little knows that the marquis is his real father. Therefore, when the opportunity to obtain wealth comes from Callarn, he takes it without even questioning it. It is very similar to the villain of modern man, so self-centered and vain that he does not care about the consequences of his actions on others. <br /> <br /> Many have criticized Tim Roth's performance in this film as an exaggeration. Hogwash I say it. It is clear that Cunningham is not simply evil but also psychopath throughout the film. In a world where a man and his stepson can shoot random people for fun, is Cunningham too much of an incredible character? We live in a society where people seem to have diminished the value of human life. "Rob Roy" simply teaches us that only the circumstances of this reduced value have changed. It is a problem throughout human history that the vanity of the human heart does not allow the capacity for compassion. Rob Roy and Mary give us hope that goodness will prevail, but snakes will always exist in our world. <br /> <br /> Another character that I find fascinating is the Duke of Argyll. He is a true nobleman, and his values ​​of honesty and courtesy are in direct contrast to the Marquis. Appreciate the courage of Rob Roy and Mary, and have a direct affliction for the Marquis and his factor. He gives the world hope for the people of power. With luck, people like the Marquis are an exception and not the rule. <br /> <br /> - The final duel in "Rob Roy" is more exciting than 10 of the battle scenes in "Braveheart". <br /> <One thing I get tired of is that people tell me that "Braveheart" is a better movie because of the battle scenes. First of all, the battle scenes are hardly original. From "Spartacus" to "Gladiator", Hollywood has had a long tradition of European historical battle scenes. "Braveheart" has some of the best battle scenes ever filmed, but they have a major problem. These battle scenes have no context, except the struggle for freedom. <br /> <br /> Now, do not get me wrong, the duels are not original either. In fact, there are probably 10 times more movies with duels than with battle scenes. But the context of the duel between Cunningham and Rob Roy is a beauty to behold. It is one of the best scenes in the history of cinema. Let me explain why ... <br /> <br /> First of all, the fighting style and the bearing of the two characters in this duel describe the characters perfectly. Cunningham is ephemeral and dangerous, Rob Roy is strong and brave. Cunningham uses a sword of fencing, while Rob uses a wide sword. Cunningham struggles with fast and difficult movements, while Roy's fighting style is more obvious. <br /> <br /> The whole movie, from the deliberately slow first half to the exciting second half, is leading up to this moment. It is something powerful, and it is clear that Rob must exterminate this menacing evil that has plagued his entire world. When Rob finally gets the advantage (literally and figuratively), it is one of the best moments in film history. Rob wins because he has more to live for, and his honor is more powerful than that of 10 Cunningham. The use of music is absolutely chilling in this scene. The good that prevails against a real evil is more powerful for me than seeing how they destroy a guy just to be able to shout "FREEDOM!". But hey, maybe it's just me. <br /> <br /> - "Rob Roy" is more realistic than "Braveheart" <br /> <br /> I do not know that the people of the aristocracy or the Scots spoke like The people in "Rob Roy", but I feel that it is clearly an attempt to capture your speech patterns. I feel like a lot of people are bored by "Rob Roy" simply because they can not understand what the characters are saying. If this is the case, then read something from Shakesphere, or put it in the subtitles. "Rob Roy" is actually one of the best written films of the '90s. Many of the dialogues in this film are intelligent, but I may have to watch the movie a couple of times to understand it. <br /> <br /> In contrast, the dialogue in "Braveheart" is not very interesting. Of course, what do you expect when the main character is a Scotsman played by an Australian? This is a legend, and clearly there was no attempt to capture the discourse of the times. This film takes place several centuries before "Rob Roy", and yet they speak like the people of today. Hence the reason why many people like it more. Today's audiences have become increasingly lazy, and they do not want to take the time or patience to understand things that are complex. Therefore, as with many epic movies, they expect to see the villains speak a recognizable English accent, while the heroes speak in a language not too far from our American language. Sure, it's clear that the Wallace is Scottish, but aside from sounding like Scotty from Star Trek and a couple of "Aye" for recognition, the Scots of this movie fit into the Hollywood tradition of how we think the Scots should sound. br /> <br /> So, these descriptions show that "Rob Roy" is a better movie than "Braveheart"? Barely. But if it proves one thing, it shows that it is unusual for "Braveheart" to be a better movie than "Rob Roy". In short, "Rob Roy" is a film that has very appropriate themes in today's world. "Braveheart" is a film about a legend that is inspiring but hardly realistic. You can make a decision about what you think is best ... <br /> <br /> Grade - A score - 9
