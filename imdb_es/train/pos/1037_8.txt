['&quot;A malefactor is often a man who has left something undone, not always the one who has done something&quot; - Emperor Marco Aurelio <br /><br /> The DVD release of &quot;Watch on the Rhine&quot; could not have occurred at a better time. It returns us a great work by Lillian Hellman, adapted to the screen by Dashiell Hammett (the audio commentary of the scholar Bernard F. Dick affirms its authorship). It features a subtle performance by Bette Davis, who assumed a tenuous supporting role long after she became the queen of the warhorse on the Warner Bros. batch. Equally significant, she reminds us that World War II had a purpose. <br /><br /> Sure, you say, as we needed it. We have heard Cary Grant lecturing in &quot;Destino Tokio&quot; (1943) about Japanese children and their Bushido knives. We have seen the booties tread the living hills in &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; (1965). We have toured an England cruelly occupied by Germany in &quot;It Happened Here&quot; (1966). However, the truth is that we still need the message spread. <br /><br /> I have a friend of 81 years who curses Franklin Roosevelt regularly. He feels that FDR cheated the US UU In a foreign fight we did not need, and therefore caused the death of his favorite cousin. He is encouraged by his demonization of Allied leaders and the trivialization of the Second War by Patrick Buchanan. <br /><br /> The political columnist has just published a fat book with a detailed investigation that states that Adolf Hitler would not pose a greater threat to Poland, Europe or the world if only the Third Reich had received the Free City of Danzig in 1939. Buchanan argues that if those Selfish Poles would not have confronted the Nazis, attracting the absurd meddlesome Great Britain and the vertiginously altruistic France, no war would have engulfed the West. He believes that without the rigors of Total War, no one in Germany would have built gas chambers to provide a final solution to the Jewish problem. <br /><br /> Some commentators on this site believe that &quot;See&quot; sinks under the weight of obsolete propaganda. Perhaps. However, neither my friend nor Pat Buchanan seem to have grasped the point of the film: some people injure and kill to seize the land, property and freedom of other people; these people dominated the Axis Powers and &quot;enough&quot; did not appear in their vocabulary. <br /><br /> Paul Lukas deserved the Oscar he won. He and Bette Davis put convincing passion in their portrayals of refugees fighting against the oppressors. They give an emotional blow to the intellectual case by getting away from the sides, by actively confronting torturers and murderers. Bernard Dick points out that Hellman did not care about Lukas as a person since he remained apolitical. Of course, as a Hungarian he had seen first-hand the bloody &quot;dictatorship of the proletariat&quot; of Bela Kun replacing an antiquated empire and then overthrowing the tyranny of Admiral Horthy&#39;s right. <br /><br /> In a wonderful cameo role added to the work of Hammett, Henry Daniell sardonically describes an officer of the Wehrmacht class who disdains the brown shirts he serves. His Phili von Ramme would undoubtedly be with Field Marshal Rommel in 1944 during the July 20 plot against Hitler. However, in April 1940, he pragmatically encouraged the Nazi cause, although he insulted Herr Blecher &quot;the Butcher&quot; and despised the Romanian aristocrat Branck&#39;s Teck for trying to sell information about an Underground leader. <br /><br /> Teck, a destitute and possible cuckold, wants money and a visa to return to Europe, where he can resume the fragments of a life that had been undone by the Great War that destroyed the empire and the greatest global economic depression. He has no political convictions, he has no scruples about changing a freedom fighter for his own tomorrow. The Mercury Theater graduate, George Coulouris, gives the Old World cynicism of this burnt case a desperate advantage. <br /><br /> Lucille Watson gives a great vitality to the hostess of the man, an older and dominant girl who knows her mind and gets away with it, but who does not properly appreciate her children and her achievements outside the home that she controls. She and her pale son linked to the office belong to the American version of the privileged type of von Ramme and Brancovis. However, this family has not seen the ruin and will never see it. They are wealthy people who could silently advance evil simply by not opposing it. <br /><br /> This mother and her son could easily make decisions that reflect that complaint towards National Socialism and fascism that flourishes today in my friend and the expert Buchanan. &quot;Watch on the Rhine&quot; has a very careful vintage appearance. Their dialogue reflects their erudite origins on stage instead of sounding cool from the streets. However, Hellman and Hammett&#39;s film has a power based on instinct. The hearings still need to listen and pay attention to their call to arms against the hoarders on the march without truce.']
