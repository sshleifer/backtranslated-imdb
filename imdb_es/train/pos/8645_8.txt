['I had seen this movie many years ago and it had left me a lasting impression. Unfortunately, I have hardened myself with many films over the years and I did not expect to be impressed by &quot;Kalifornia&quot; when I saw them again recently. I am pleased to say that it is as disconcerting and visible as it was about ten years ago. <br /><br /> There are two things that really give this movie its power. The first is his cast. We have an amazingly disturbing turn on the part of a young Brad Pitt like Early Grace. Knowing Pitt, as we all do, as one of the hardest beats that Hollywood has ever had, it is comforting to see him play such a vile and unattractive character. Pitt removes the show without resorting to clich√© or parody of white trash, and manages to remain genuinely terrifying throughout the film. <br /><br /> Juliette Lewis is as impressive as Grace&#39;s tragic girlfriend, playing the character as a ten-year-old girl with a forty-year life experience. Lewis manages to evoke compassion (for the position of his character in life) as well as contempt (for his naivety), but supports his performance with the kind of subtlety that a young actor rarely sees. Personally, I think it&#39;s a tragedy that neither Pitt nor Lewis have been nominated for any awards for their performances here. <br /><br /> David Duchovony and Michelle Forbes are perfectly chosen as the yuppy couple who, without knowing it, end up traveling through the United States with Pitt and Lewis. Duchovony is aptly geeky and naive, and Forbes seems emphatically cynical and closed, but both actors manage to portray convincingly the changes of their characters, as they are equally intrigued, rejected and strangely attracted to Pitt. <br /><br /> Leaving aside the excellent casting and the brilliant and uniform performance, this film really catches us by the proverbial balls through its impeccable rhythm. At the time &#39;Kalifornia&#39; was released, Hollywood was launching a series of films of nice characters that become psychopaths (&#39;Single White Female&#39;, &#39;Pacific Heights&#39;, &#39;The Hand That Rocks The Cradle&#39;, &#39;Deceived&#39; , &quot;Sleeping with the enemy&quot;, etc.). Most of these movies followed the same formula, the only variation being the nature of the relationship between the good boy and the bad boy. &#39;Kalifornia&#39; really does not stray too far from this territory, but their first two acts are the perfect example of the slow boiling thriller, and they keep us on the edge of our seats waiting for the tide to change. <br /><br /> When the penny falls, and Pitt is released to play the maniac bad man, the film changes gear completely and the last twenty minutes are not up to the rest of the film. That said, the action is thick and fast and the resolution is adequate when cold. The fight is over, but the scars will always be there. <br /><br /> Much of the narration (provided by Duchovony, an X, a little querulous) is a bit contrived. Of course, it is meant to be from the book that the journalist character of Duchovony has written, so it could be argued that the timid narrative is meant to be a nod to the kind of sensationalist style in which most journalists write. <br /><br /> The film is largely a success and certainly is a cut above 90% of the thrillers of the last twenty years. Highly recommended, but not for the weak of stomach or mind. This movie is disturbing on more than one level. But then, it is meant to be.']
