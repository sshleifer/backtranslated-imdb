With the death of GEORGE NADER, on February 4, 2002, I thought of this most interesting program, which, although it only had a short route, was a tremendous idea with good story lines. In general, without being seen for more than 40 years, it would be worth it to see it again. The opening credits showed many different images, one of which was a fragment of COLONEL JOHN PAUL STAPP, mounted on his famous rocket sleigh, at the point where he was often called "The most vivid man".
