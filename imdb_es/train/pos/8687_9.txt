['This was the second entry in the Columbo regular series, and it stays well today. As I can now see it carefully on DVD and see how it is built, I am very impressed with the direction of Bernard L. Kowalski (who directed the MACHO CALLAHAN fine, as well as countless television episodes): see how the actions following the murder of the murderer were They show in a split screen effect on their two lenses, they observe how the murder is shown in the form of montage, they observe the point of view from the perspective of the corpse. In addition, the incredible but impressive avant-garde musical score of the outstanding jazz musician Gil Melle was incredible and helped a lot to create an atmosphere. And Brett Halsey&#39;s supporting performance as a golf professional was wonderful: so much subtlety and complexity in a role that nine times out of ten would be a one-dimensional cut. The &quot;formula&quot; had not yet been established when this episode was filmed, so there are still some surprises in Columbo&#39;s methods. Of course, Falk, Robert Culp and Ray Milland are the highest quality actors and it&#39;s a pleasure to watch them work. All men are familiar with many other roles, but they get lost in their characters here. In general, this entry in the Columbo series, and MANY of the others, are as well designed as a very good movie.']
