This is one of the best animated family movies of all time. In addition, practically all the serious rivals of this title come from the same creative mind of Hiyao Miyazaki and his Studio Ghibli. Specifically, other great movies include "My Neighbor Totoro" and "Kikki's Delivery Service." Spirited Away is pretty good, but a bit too spooky for the typical family meal, better for teens and adults. The only thing that differentiates "Laputa: Castillo en el cielo" from other Miyazaki films is that it is much more an adventure full of tension. <br /> <br /> Why is this movie so good? Because it is a complete package: the animation is very well made and the story is really attractive and attractive. <br /> <br /> The majority of Japanese anime is imaginative, but decidedly obscure or cynical or violent; and the animation itself is often uneven, stylized and youthful. None of these problems plagues the castle in the sky. It has imagination to burn, and the characters are well drawn, although they are slightly exaggerated versions of realistic people. (None of those posers who wear gabardine) There is a lot of adventure, but not blood and blood. The animation is smooth, detailed and allied cinematographic, not many shots flat. The backgrounds are wonderful. <br /> <br /> The voice acting in the dubbed version in English is first class, especially the two protagonists, Pazo (James Van der Beek) and Sheeta (Anna Paquin). The sound engineering is also great. Use the sound of your study, if you have it. <br /> <br /> One aspect that I particularly enjoyed is that much of the back story is left unexplained. Laputa was once inhabited, and now it is abandoned. Why? We never know We know everything we need to know, and then we have to accept the rest, which is easy to do because the invented world is fully realized. In fact, it is fair to say that the world is more fully realized than most secondary characters, who are mostly common one-dimensional characters (for example, gruff general, silly partner, former miner, etc.) Highly recommended For people from 6 to 60 years old!
