['One can only hope that there are many times when someone as powerful as Morgan Freeman can take the time to help someone who needs help. <br /><br /> It all comes down to loving people. As Will Rogers said, &quot;I never met a man I did not like.&quot; Of course, if you know Paz Vega, what is not like? That smile of hers can melt diamonds. She is so fantastic that I can see anything she is in. The same for Freeman. He is simply magical on the screen. <br /><br /> They both gave us a movie that was funny from beginning to end. From the Mexican supermarket to Lorraine and Bobby to Packy. She was tender, charming and just plain fun. <br /><br /> You gotta see This.']
