I saw the description of the film in TCM and I just let it run because I like both Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith, so I was pleasantly surprised to discover that I liked the film very much and it seemed quite exceptional. Of course, it's dated in earnest, but as a period piece, it's worth seeing it just for the subtle humor in understanding life and lifestyle almost forty years ago. Now the only problem is trying to find it on DVD to be able to see it more often. I was also impressed by the performances of Smith and Ustinov as protagonists, and by Karl Malden, Bob Newhart and the appearances of Robert Morley and Cesar Romero.
