Give this movie a 10/10 because it deserves a 10/10. Two of the best actors of his time: Walter Matthau and George Burns collaborate with Neil Simon and all the other actors that are in this film + the director Herbert Ross, and all that makes this adaptation to the stage come true. The Sunshine Boys is one of the best movies of the 70s. I love the kind of humor in this movie, it just makes me laugh a lot. <br /> <br /> I got it on VHS 3 days ago (yes, VHS because it was cheaper, only $ 3). I saw it as soon as I got home, but I had to see it again because I was missing some parts the first time. The second time I saw him, he felt much better, and I laughed a lot harder. I will definitely get this back on a DVD because I HAVE to see the special features. <br /> <br /> It's very funny how that happens. Two people work together as artists / actors / artists. They get along on stage, but they really argue offstage, they can not survive another minute, and then, about 15 years later, they want to get together for a TV special. You can find that in this movie. Matthau & Burns were great in this movie. It's a pity they died. George Burns deserved that Oscar. He gave a strong comedic performance. He was also 78 years old when this movie was filmed. So far, he is the oldest actor to receive a prize from the academy in old age. Jessica Tandy breaks the record as the oldest actress. Richard Benjamin was also fantastic in this. He won a Golden Globe for best supporting actor. He deserved that Golden Globe. Although many people might disagree with what I am going to say, everyone in this movie performed well. This comedy is an instant classic. I highly recommend it. One more thing: the one who hates this movie is a "Putz"
