I had to see this gem twice to really appreciate it. When a widowed father of two interrupts the sleep of his two children with a shocking revelation, they are divided between believing him and not. As the terrible events of this story unfold, we learn a lot about the father, his two children and their destinies. With a surprising twist after a surprising twist, this film never allows a pause in the plot. Bill Paxton plays the father, but the most notable performances are those of his eldest son, Fenton, played by Matthew O'Leary and his youngest son, Adam, played by Jeremy Sumpter. This is one of the best thrillers I've seen in a long time, and you'll want to watch it several times to appreciate every intricate aspect of the plot. I give this movie a 9/10.
