['A damn good movie! One that is seriously underestimated. The songs that the children sing in the film gave me a sense of their pain, but also of their hope for the future. Whoopi Goldberg has a good performance here, but the best performance in the whole movie is that of the actress who plays the main character. I wish I was in more movies. <br /><br /> This movie should have a higher rating. I give it a 10/10.']
