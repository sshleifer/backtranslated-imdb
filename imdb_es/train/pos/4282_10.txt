Superbly developed characters in many funny situations full of spirit, absurdity and Serbian mentality. The movie is a great comedy, enjoyable, interesting, unpredictable. Best point of a movie: characters, then humor, history and dialogues. Humor has 'internal development', rare in Serbian films. Therefore, it is a consequence of the characterization, it is well motivated, spontaneous and convincing. He is also sharp, intelligent and lucid. Most of the films, unfortunately, had created humor (devise a joke and put it in the mouth of a character) or comedy of common situation, burlesque, farce. Part of the 'artistic immortality' is incorporated in this film. Little masterpiece, barely achievable.
