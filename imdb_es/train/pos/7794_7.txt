Victor Núñez imbues this unsentimental story of the emotional journey of a young woman with a sense of poetry that is rarely seen in movies. By poetry I mean the sense in which the literary and the cinematographic come into play. There is something very literary about the film, almost as if a novel had adapted page by page to screen. In this sense, the film reaches depths that many can not; but it is also quite slow at other times, undermining the depths it once achieved in favor of ennui. The star of the movie Ashley Judd has not made a better movie than his debut here. She fits in the role of leader Ruby like a glove, almost as if she did not have to act. She has a true movie star presence in the movie, and has not really managed to convey the same charm in her later films, although she was impressive in Normal Life.
