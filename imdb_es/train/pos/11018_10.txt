This movie is really stressful! The Cliffhangin movie! Stallone was as good as ever! Michael Rooker had an amazing performance and John Lithgow played an excellent villain! The music is fantastic, especially the theme! The movie is full of action and it's never boring! A fan of Stallone then looks at Cliffhanger, you will not be disappointed!
