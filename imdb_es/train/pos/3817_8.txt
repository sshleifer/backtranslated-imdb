If you have had drama in your life, either on your own or by someone close to you, the stages of the pain that this woman (but, in my opinion, could have easily been a man) go through are very real. It is a film about not being able to cope with their pain, about not knowing what to do to help them overcome it. Obviously, it is also a film about not knowing how to help someone close to overcome their pain. It's a movie that makes you realize that everyone is alone in their suffering. It's a movie that could push someone to the limit ... which does not seem like a recommendation. I'm not sure to recommend someone to go see this movie, especially someone close to me, but for me ... it's a movie that puts things in perspective, that shows real pain and, therefore, is very important for to be alive. It makes you realize that hey, you or the person close to you have gone through the pain, hey, all the things that you care about now are so unimportant.
