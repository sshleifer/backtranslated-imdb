108: Tarzan and His Mate (1934) - published on 4/20/1934, seen on 8/6/08. <br /> <br /> John Dillinger escapes from prison and steals a bank in Iowa. Bonnie and Clyde kill two highway patrol cars in Texas. BIRTHS: Ralph Nader, Gloria Steinem, Alan Arkin, Richard Chamberlain. <br /> <br /> DOUG: After we were quite disappointed with the original 'Tarzan the Ape Man', we discovered among other users and historians that the second film "Tarzan and his partner" was the best of the series. It is true. I have a great kick out of this movie. Johnny Weismuller returns as the savage superhero of animal duo and vines duel, and Maureen O'Sullivan reprises his role as his fantastic lady Jane (who wears a two-piece suit for the first and last time here). In my review of 'Ape Man', I stepped on Jane pretty well because of her obsession with clothes and her incessant screaming, but here she has redeemed herself for me. Make no mistake: O'Sullivan is the star of this movie, and Jane is the most capable character in the entire cast. She acts as an ambassador between Holt and Tarzan, she can function perfectly in the jungle and get along with the animals, and she knows how to contain the furious pride of the lions when she runs out of bullets. She even has her own jungle cry now. The chemistry between Johnny and Maureen is irresistible. She has him totally trained. Cheeta is also quite charming, removing Martin's cigarette. The plot is mainly an excuse for Tarzan to fight with the most vicious animals in the jungle, especially lions, crocodiles and rhinos. The effects, although always visible, are much more dynamic and fresh and complement the action very well. Oh, and you can not talk about this movie without talking about the nude swimming scene. All I can say is: yes, she is naked. Very exciting things. <br /> <br /> KEVIN: Wow. Simply wow. When it comes to action / adventure pre-code low and dirty, nothing holds a candle for 'Tarzan and his partner'. The inevitable sequel to Tarzan, the monkey man, is an epic of violent and risky jungle. I doubt there's another Tarzan movie in the future that does not take prisoners like this. It would be difficult to find a complete scene in this film that was approved by the Code or approved for animal rights. The appalling violence does not even wait for the happy jungle couple to appear before pushing even the limits of today's adventure movies. And after T & J enters the picture, there is a lot of swimming early in the morning and swimming in the ass. See for yourself if you do not believe me. I love Maureen O'Sullivan especially in this movie. In the first film, Jane seemed a walking contradiction, as the writers of that time simply did not know how to represent such a character. But here is a great precursor of the females of the later cinema. Although she still needs Tarzan's help to get her out of most traffic jams, it does much more than just wait for her to be rescued. His personality is perfectly believable for a woman who has been living (relatively) comfortably in the jungle for a year. I saw this with my mom, and I enjoyed pointing out to her how much Jane has Tarzan "trained," as Jeff Foxworthy put it. She totally has the monkey man at her beck and call. Although there are a lot of obsolete optical effects throughout the film, there are still many Tarzan favorite battles against predators that are (mostly) true. That and the men dressed in overalls are much more convincing this time. ** SPOILER ** The film reaches its climax when the jungle erupts with a shocking orgy of violence from the animal kingdom that leaves Tarzan and Jane, the only two humans still breathing. Although the couple is going to sunset together and victorious, I can not help but imagine how this story will look on the next safari that will hear about the previous group of humans who went to find Tarzan and Jane and never heard from them again . . ** END SPOILER ** One of the things that still bothers me is the smooth and hairless body of Johnny Weissmuller and a too stylized cap. Apart from that, this is an action adventure prior to the Code that can not be lost. <br /> <br /> Last movie: It happened one night (1934). Next film: Siglo XX (1934).
