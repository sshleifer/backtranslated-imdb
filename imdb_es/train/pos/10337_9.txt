This movie was extremely funny, I would like to own this for my vintage collection of the 70s. The film should see the list again, I know this cast of characters, they are people that I have known over the years and They ask me to look for this comedy. Unfortunately, this was never put on DVD or VHS. Redd Foxx is always a comedy clown, Pearl Baily a great match as his witty and daring wife, Norman, a son with a secret who is not sure he has a future if he is out, Dennis Dugan is a crazy madman. Miss Dobson bitch with heart and little conscience. Love, lust, strange family ties this film qualifies for a repetition, a comedy of situations with a combination of events, as this could and should find its way as a new version. I think finding the cast would be extremely difficult, maybe impossible, except Jerry. Seinfeld playing the role of Dennis Dugan, this marks a couple of episodes of Seinfeld that also returned me to Norman. It is impossible to keep them as close as possible, since it is impossible to reform the whore's girlfriend and the infidelity of a father. This movie was a wild tip for a taxi driver, remind me of the episode that Kramer advises his caddy about his lawyer. (Seinfeld episode) Parents have a moment of amazement, fun more than fun It's screaming to bring me back.
