"Holly" is a thematic film, but it is neither manipulative nor too sentimental. In the background is a film directed by the characters, which would not be so successful without the representations of Patrick (Ron Livingston), the lost soul with the consciousness that awakens gradually, and Holly (Thuy Nguyen), the young Vietnamese strong-willed , but ultimately, overcome. From vibrant places and photography to effective editing, everything is direct and well done. The classical contemporary score may take a while at first, but it is a first-rate composition and underlines the admirable restriction that is evident at all times. This film, which poses many problems but provides few clear answers, finally manages to raise awareness and compassion for Holly and the many who share her difficult situation. Congratulations to those who managed to do it.
