SPOILERS Many different comedy series today have experienced at one time or another the idea of ​​dark independence. In an early episode of the cartoon "Family Guy," the Griffin family finds that their home is a nation independent of the United States of America and the story progresses from there. However, in 1949, Ealing Studios produced a wonderful little movie with the same idea. <br /> <br /> After a child prank, the residents of Pimlico discover a small fortune in a treasure. In the investigation it is clear that the small area is a small outcrop of the lost state of Burgundy. By withdrawing from London and the rest of Britain, the residents of the small street experience the joys and problems of being an independent state. <br /> <br /> Based on a time when rationing was still in operation, this story is brilliantly said and equally inspiring. With performances by Stanley Holloway, Betty Warren, Philip Stainton and a young Charles Hawtrey, the film is well stocked with some of the best actors of his generation. These actors are also well helped by an excellent little script with some cracking lines. With a sense of recent freshness, despite being over 50 years old, the story never feels uncomfortable and always keeps the audience entertained. <br /> <br /> Ealing Studios was one of the best exporters of British films that exist. With movies like "Passport to Pimlico" it's not hard to see why. Fun from start to finish, the story is always fun and always worth seeing.
