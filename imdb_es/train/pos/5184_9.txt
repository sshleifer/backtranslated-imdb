Deeply humorous but honest comedy about a group of adults (Bill Paxton, Julie Warner, Kevin Pollak, Elizabeth Perkins, Vincent Spano, Matt Craven and Diane Lane) who are invited to spend a week in Tomawka, a camp in (Ontario) Canada by his former consuelo (Alan Arkin). The writer / director Mike Binder based his experience in the same field as the main source of creation of a soft and comprehensive thread that makes sense. In addition, the film has many fun moments, some of which are completely extravagant as my favorite, which involves the use of a masking tape. Newton Thomas Sigel ("The Usual Suspects", "Three Kings") offers the film some impressive shots of Canadian nature. Among the cast, Sam Raimi, director of the films "THE EVIL DEAD" and "The Gift", appears here as the awkward right hand of Arkin. One more thing, this movie assured me that a camp does not have to be a place of bloody murders.
