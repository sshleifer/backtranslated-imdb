This episode of the first season is slightly closer to the controversy with the whole angle of gender flex. I imagine there would have been a significant amount of editing before this was over to appease the censors. <br /> <br /> The story itself is original and well written and the direction is complemented by good acting. (Nicholas Lea makes his debut in X Files but not as Agent Krycek but as a victim named Michael) I especially enjoyed the preparation and the ending itself. <br /> <Br /> It's different but nice. Ignore all the negative criticisms you may hear. Observe them for yourself and then make a judgment.
