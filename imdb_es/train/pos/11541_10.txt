['Matthau and Lemmon are at their best in this, everyone else in the movie is great too. The Dialogue is excellent and very, very ingenious, and the scene in which the character of Lemmon tries to clean his breasts in a restaurant makes me roll on the floor with laughter every time I see him. Anyone who has seen the not-so-good sequel should not be rejected from the original. I recommend this wonderful movie to everyone, I love it. And the fact that Jack Lemmon plays his character so direct with tragic nuances only adds to the hilarity in my opinion. These two great guys made a series of movies together, but this is the best, no doubt.']
