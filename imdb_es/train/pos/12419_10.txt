I love this movie like no other. On another occasion I will try to explain its virtues to the uninitiated, but for now allow me to quote some of the pieces of the remarkable dialogue, which, please remember, is all nonsense. Aussies and Poms will understand, everyone else, okay? <br /> <br /> (title song lyrics) "He can have a beer, he can choose a queer, with his latest Bondi double-breasted team." <Br /> <br /> (another song lyrics) "All pommies are bastards, bastards, or worse, and England is the a ** e-hole of the universe". <br /> <br /> (during a television interview in an "artistic program"): Mr. Mackenzie, what artists have impressed you most since you were in England? (Answer by Barry) Flamin 'bull-artists! <br /> <br /> (while conversing with a naive young pom): Mr. Mackenzie, do you suppose you have hordes of Aboriginal servants in Australia? (Answer by Barry) Abos? I have never seen an Abo in my life. Mom makes most of the solid yacca (that is, hard work) in our place. <br /> <br /> This is just a sample of the hilarious farce of this busser Aussie flick. If you can get a copy, look and enjoy.
