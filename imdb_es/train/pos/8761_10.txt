I love Claire Danes, and Kate Beckinsale looks incredibly immature in her role. The film is defective only because it seems that the two accused appear to be in some monastery, working as monks on the grass and under strict martial arts discipline. The acting and the filmography and the amazing colors of what Thailand is supposed to be is striking, but Claire Daines steals the entire film and is unexpectedly deep in her learning of the hard lesson of life to the end, in one act. of amazing unheard-of and completely unexpected disinterest in the real world. The flaws are minimal and I recommend the movie, which seems sadly buried forever in rare TV shows. For my part, I want the film for my collection, a collection of only films rated "10". Look at it, you will be very moved.
