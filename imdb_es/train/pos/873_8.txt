I watched this movie without expecting much and without knowing much about it. I loved. A very good and tight plot, an intriguing hook in the form of the ugly, fat, deaf and ex-convict, and a rhythm that kept things flowing without rushing. <br /> <br /> A much, much better movie than De battre mon coeur s'est arreté by the same director, which was boring and incredible. <br /> <br /> The only thing that did not work at all. It was that the supposedly ugly and fat girl was neither ugly nor fat: solid, certainly, and far from being beautifully conventional, but with so much character in her face that she took the screen whenever she was in it. Magnificent. I wish I was in more movies, and better than in general. I've seen some of Gilles's wife and a little bit of The Mustache, and they both looked like garbage, and I've seen everyone from De Battre Mon Coeur S'est Arreté, and that's certainly garbage. She seems to have some to come, so I'll keep my fingers crossed.
