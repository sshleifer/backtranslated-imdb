Now, many would think to stay away from this movie just for the title. If you do not have the stomach for bloody movies, what are you doing reading this review? Anyway, I borrowed the video from a friend of mine and I fell in love with this movie immediately. This movie is full of wonderful gore, in addition to the other usual ingredients that make up a B movie that add to an incredible viewing experience. If you are a lover of good quality experiences, then look at this great movie!
