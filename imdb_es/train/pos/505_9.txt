A very good start. I was a little surprised to find that the machinery was not so advanced: it should have been more crude, to coincide with the original series. The cast is interesting, although Lady Vulkan seems too human. She needs to study at Spock, who, after all, is the model for this race. Too bad they could not have chosen Jeri Ryan. I like Miss Park, the Korean lady (?). The doctor has possibilities. I have not solved the other males, except for the black man. He is really nice. Bakula needs to find his niche: in QL, his strong point was his sense of humor and his willingness to try anything. He is, of course, big and strong enough for heroic acts. The heavy ones were fine, although I did not like her makeup.
