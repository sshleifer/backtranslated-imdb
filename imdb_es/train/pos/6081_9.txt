You do not get darker or tragic than "Othello" and this film captures the work quite well, with outstanding performances by Lawrence Fishburne and Irene Jacob. Fishburne's expresses to the viewer the torment of Othello when he falls prey to the lies of Iago in a very convincing way, even providing a realistic epileptic episode. Jacob is the loving and loyal wife who becomes the instrument of Iago's revenge against Othello or the object of his wrath (it is not clear what is the reason why Iago's behavior is offered). Although Kenneth Brannagh (sp?) Shows his usual talent for Shakespeare in this film, he is somewhat marginalized. The characters of Cassio and Emilia also enter and leave the scenes even though, like Iago, they seem more crucial to the plot. I have not compared the film with the work to see how many lines were cut, but I know that Shakespeare tends to develop his characters, even those that apparently are not important, very well. <br /> <br /> If I had any The criticism of the film would be that the story develops too quickly, and that the relationships between some of the characters are not exposed anymore. The director had a great cast, and nobody offered a bad performance. The relationship between Cassio and Othello and the relationship between Emilia and Desdemona must be developed later in the film. I have the feeling that they were closer to each other than the movie suggests, although you get an idea of ​​this very late in the movie. In addition, Othello and Desdemona need more time together. Although their anguish is convincing, the amount of interaction they have with each other makes it look like they just met. On the other hand, they may have met, like Romeo and Juliet. <br /> <br /> In summary: good performances, too short. <br /> <br />
