I remember seeing this for the first time, when I was 9 years old. I wanted to be one of the "barbarian brothers". This movie is still great. An original aspect was that the fight scenes were very short. Which implies that the "barbarian brothers" were so good that they killed their enemies quickly! Also, you have chases, a cage fight, a dragon, and yes, even a bar fight! <br /> <br /> Yes, the performance is bad, that's why it's not a ten, history has also received a lot of criticism. I think it's quite original. There are not many movies in their genre that have the same original story lines, or colorful dialogues. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend this movie.
