It made me wish that my own happy birds could talk. Tisk Tisk about the critic who concealed the film. A sweet story that people of all ages will enjoy. Paulie is a lovely little treasure. He has a few smart lines that really made me laugh. I especially loved the dance sequences during his stage in the show business. He can forgive the obvious clich√©s while encouraging him in his quest to meet Marie. A charming movie with two strong characters who really make friends with the small parrot separated from its young owner. He would have liked to see more the woman who becomes blind and must abandon their mutual trip. I liked his artistic and poetic inspirations, a pity he could not share Paulie's meeting. Bless Paulie in his new home, finally with Marie, perhaps accompanied by the kind young man who helped him defeat the antagonists to complete his trip.
