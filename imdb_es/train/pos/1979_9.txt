Annette, me and my girlfriend, we saw this together and we both discussed it. <br /> <br /> We both really enjoyed seeing this even though we took some liberties with Dicken's work. Many of Dicken's works are somewhat dark and sad (including Oliver Twist), but this movie changed all that. It was fun, colorful (both visually and musically), and the characters were more cheerful. <br /> <br /> TRAVIS: Normally, I'm not very interested in music and dance films, but the melodies in this production were sticky and lively, and the choreography was amazing. <br /> <br /> ANNETTE: That really says a lot about Travis. I can not emphasize enough how good the dance numbers really were. It can be said, for example, that these guys really worked hard so that the routines were reduced to perfection. <br /> <br /> TRAVIS: Three actors really stood out IMO; Nancy (Shani W.), Bill Sykes (Oliver Reed) and Artful Dodger (Jack Wild). Man, Oliver Reed can really be a good villain. That one scene where you see his eyes through the mail box gave me chills down the back ... AWESOME. And that boy Jack Wild was a perfect Artful Dodger. And Nancy was fantastic (man, I felt bad when they killed her). She can sing too! Congratulations to the casting department on their elections there. I hated the boy Oliver Twist. He was too whiny and weak for my taste. (I kept wanting Bill Sikes to drop him in the mud during the chase scene). And they should not have made him sing either. <br /> <br /> ANNETTE: Acting was really excellent. In addition to the three stars that Travis mentioned, I felt that Ron Moody (Fagin) did a tremendous job. It was so funny, and at the same time also slightly sinister. The supporting actors were also great. Harry Secombe took his role as Mr. Bumble extremely well. And he has a wonderful singing voice. I saw Mr. Secombe perform in another movie called "Davy" where he played an opera singer with pleasing results. The talented Harry Secombe should have been in many more movies. <br /> <br /> TRAVIS: As I mentioned earlier, the story is not entirely true to the book, but IMO was more solid. This movie was also not boring, as some musicals seem. And the continuity kept you moving along with the characters. The melodies did not affect the plot or put him to sleep for being too long. <br /> <br /> ANNETTE: Any musical film that Travis sees completely has to be a rare find. And this is in fact a rare find. It is a very easy to see production that takes the viewer smoothly and pleasantly to the end. On a day when all movies seem to be effects combined with pretty faces, this was a refreshing interlude. <br /> <br /> Our combined rating for this was 8.5 out of 10. (We will round up to 9 in this case.). <br /> <br /> TRAVIS: I rated this with a 7 mainly because the boy Oliver Twist (Mark L.) irritated me, and his songs were a torture to my overly sensitive ears. Otherwise, it was an exceptional movie. <br /> <br /> ANNETTE: My rating is 10. The movies are not much better than this. And it can be said that everyone involved in this production really worked hard to make it what it was ... a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Please, do not miss this one ... even if you usually do not like musicals It really is a weird treatment.
