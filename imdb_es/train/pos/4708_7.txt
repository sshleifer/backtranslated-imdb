Yes, Keaton seems to really enjoyed making this movie. With a jump in his step in his striped suits, he will remind you of Jimmy Cagney! Johnny (Keaton) is the young capo who only does it to pay for the expensive medical expenses of his mother and to send his younger brother (Griffin Dunne) to law school. No one knows that Johnny Kelly is Johnny Dangerously until later in the movie. Joe Piscopo is Vermin and he does not like Johnny a bit (and I do not like Vermin). Marilu Henner has a good singing / dancing routine while Johnny delights in it. I love the part when they are in the escape car that constantly changes! The cop who is "calling all the cars" is the Gilligan Island Patron! See this for the gangster laughs of 1930! The gags in this movie are hilarious, but you have to catch them or you'll lose them! Look at the bottom of each scene.
