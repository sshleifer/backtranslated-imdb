Robert De Niro, Cuba Gooding Jr., Hal Holbrook and the rest of the actors and actresses of "Men of Honor" have combined to make this a good movie. Mark Isham wrote the filmcore, so you know that music is also very good. <br /> <br /> But: after noticing a series of nonsense, gaps and pulses of dramatic strings from the beginning, I had to make a vow to ignore them and sit down to enjoy the movie. If you can do that, it's really good. <br /> <br /> The story of Carl Brashear, a real hero, is inspiring enough to last a lifetime. Look for it on the Internet ... The whole story is more surprising than the movie, as the Director admitted in his comments. There were only three African-American divers from the United States Navy in World War II. However, none reached the status of US Master Navy Diver. Carl Brashear was the first African-American diver in the United States Navy. And he was the first diver amputated to be certified or recertified as a diver in the United States Navy. (The applause resounds). <br /> <br /> On the negative side of the film's ledger: Should I tell you about just one of the many "loopholes"? Yes, I will mark this comment as containing "spoilers" and I will ... The primitive and crucial scene in which the helicopter hits the radio mast and sinks into the sea: they would never have had the time to adapt Mark V diver , even if it was the legendary Master Chief Billy Sunday, in time to be alone "... a couple of minutes late" saving the pilot. <br /> <br /> Therefore, for gaps, mistakes, and dramatization, I reduced "Men of Honor" from a perfect 10 to a 7. <br /> <br /> Ever Hollywood Will you realize that pure truth is much better than your dramatic approach to storytelling? ? I doubt it. Too!
