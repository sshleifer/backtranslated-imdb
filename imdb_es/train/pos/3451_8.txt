['First of all, this movie was not released in theaters (PROBADOS PERORMED SAY), I say that they thought that the story of crooked cops, politicians and dedicated journalists had been murdered, just send them DVD and cable TV and take the money and run . <br /><br /> That said, I usually like this type of movie, especially with this named cast. Morgan Freeman, Justin Timberlake, Kevin Spacey, <br /><br /> For example, J, Cary Elways, John Heard and on the side of the ruin, Piper Perabo and Roslyn Sanchez. <br /><br /> The plot and the story have been made to death, BUT the previous cast gives life to this violent film and it is really visible. <br /><br /> Justin Timberlake is good as the young reporter dedicated to a disposable newspaper edited by Morgan Freeman. The others are crooked cops and politicians or somewhat decent men. The two ladies are the friends of LL COOL J &amp; JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE what is required, it is quite violent, many murders, etc., not for children. By no means is it a great movie, BUT for what it is and the cast. It&#39;s definitely good, <br /><br /> Qualifications *** (of 4) 86 points (out of 100) IMDb 8 (out of 10)']
