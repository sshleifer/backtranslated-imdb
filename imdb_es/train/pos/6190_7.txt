Fay Grim is the continuation of a story that began ten years earlier with Henry Fool de Hartley. I have not seen the previous movie, and I do not know if that's a good thing or not. I can only consider the current movie on its own merits. <br /> <br /> For most people, Hal Hartley's film-making style is something you like or do not like. His combination of action, drama, absurdity and dry and ironic humor really resonates with me, and Fay Grim is no exception. It has an air of intelligent well-written parody that I had and many in the audience of the Melbourne International Film Festival laughing loudly. For the first half of the film, he was relentless and presented himself with an expressionless rectitude. It's a style of humor that sadly lacks cinemas and a welcome relief to the mindless teen comedies that Hollywood releases as pancakes. <br /> <br /> During the second half of the film, the mood begins to diminish as the film transforms. in an international espionage / conspiracy thriller. Whether this was Hartley's intention or if he ran out of ideas, it's unclear, but I think a little editing or rewriting to cut fifteen minutes of the movie would have kept the original momentum of the movie. <br /> <br /> The performances in general were good, particularly Parker Posey and Jeff Goldblum, who had more time on screen. Saffron Burrows, James Urbaniak, Carl Montgomery and Elina LÃ¶wensohn played a good supporting role. The images of the film were nice (set in New York, Paris, Berlin and Istanbul) and the music (also by Hartley) was good without being intrusive. The film is well written and I enjoyed it very much. If you like Hartley's previous work, you probably like this.
