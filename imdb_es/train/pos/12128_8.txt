I just watched "Of Human Bondage" for the first time a few days ago and WOW! What a mysterious and almost spooky movie. I loved how the music went with the rhythm of each step of Philip's feet. It gave me chills for some reason ... <br /> <br /> One of the best aspects of this movie is that you can see Bette Davis entering herself before your eyes. She's great, not necessarily because this is her best job, but because it was so out of the ordinary to be so vicious, stark and unbreakable as an actress in 1934 ... Bette was a risk taker, always wanting to be different and this It is just when she began to realize that she could be as nasty and daring as she wanted and people would love her for that. If you're a true lover of the movie, it's amazing to see that ... <br /> <br /> She just had a way to deliver a line that did the part, and the movie, in fact, belongs to her. Like "A mass of music and fire, it's me ... an old kazoo and some flares" or "But you're Blanche, you're in that chair!" or "WITH ALL MY HEART, I STILL LOVE THE MAN WHO KILLED!" ... Those are from some of your movies, but you understand my course. She was so brave, daring and exotic with those beautiful big eyes. After seeing this, I can not believe it was redone twice ... <br /> <br /> Leslie Howard was beautiful ... so calm and persistent, she needed to be loved. I thought she was adorable and could not understand how everyone was falling in love with him, but, again, they were all ... except Mildred. He did a great job ... <br /> <br /> The only thing I did not like was something that was common with writing in the first movies. They'll make a character so hateful that it's almost unbelievable that someone will fall in love with him in the first place. The performances were great, but in real life, Philip would never have been interested in Mildred. That is the simple truth ... See it!
