This is sad, this movie is the best, at least it should be in the 250 best movies here. This is still the best action movie ever made. Today's action movies are poorly made. The actors and the action directors do not know how to do it fighting and acrobando properly. Only some do not know how to do it, mainly from Hong Kong as Jackie Chan. The acrobatics are so smart and wild that I do not think we'll see the usual ones. The beginning in which Chan and his team go down the hill chasing cars through the hill town is simply amazing. The end of fight acrobatics are for me the best fight acrobatics that have been filmed. The final trick sliding down the pole that was crashing into Jackie's glass was badly hurt.
