A really sweet movie that has some similarities to the 2001 hit "My Sassy Girl", but which you can love most of the time. The biggest applause should go to the two protagonists. Ha-Neul Kim is sweet and peculiar at the same time, Sang-woo Kwon is attractive and rebellious. The chemistry between the two is very good. <br /> <br /> Director Kyeong-hyeong Kim uses some CG inserts to enhance the images and also offers impressive fighting scenes in which Sang-woo Kwon can shine. I liked it much more here than in the very overrated "Volcano High". And that boy has a future: those looks, those fighting techniques and a romantic protagonist. Not bad. <br /> <br /> Well, I can make it short: Nice movie. My rating: 7/10
