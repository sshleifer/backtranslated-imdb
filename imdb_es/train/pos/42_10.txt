Busy Phillips made a great performance, both comic and dramatic. Erika Christensen was good, but Busy stole the show. It was a nice touch after The Smokers, a movie starring Busy, which was not that great. If Busy does not get a nomination of any kind for this movie, it would be a disaster. Forget Mona Lisa's smile, go to Home Room.
