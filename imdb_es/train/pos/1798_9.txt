I saw this Saturday night at the Provincetown Film Festival, and it's a movie that sticks to your bones, it really stayed with me. Adapted very intelligently of what is probably an excellent novel, it is a round-trip drama in time with totally rounded characters, a serious reflection on the options of life and, I am not exaggerating. One of the best molds ever assembled in more than 100 years of making movies. Wonderful work for everyone, led by a luminous Vanessa Redgrave as a dying and deceived Newport thug, and Claire Danes as her much younger self. Meryl Streep's daughter, Mamie Gummer, is, like Mom, the real deal; Patrick Wilson looks like Paul Newman around 1958 and does not exaggerate the charm; and what a pleasure to see such excellent theater actors as Barry Bostwick and Eileen Atkins contributing with sharp and detailed cameos. Hugh Dancy, also from the stage, does not give much advantage to the clich√© role of an unhappy rich unhappy, and family problems are perhaps solved more clearly than real life would allow. But it is a visually beautiful meditation, deliberately developed, on real-life issues, and you can cry for it and feel that you are not being imprudently manipulated. Also, what a sumptuous car parade of the 40s and 50s.
