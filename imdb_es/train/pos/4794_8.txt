It takes patience to overcome the eccentric David Lynch, but, for a change, it is a chronicle that affirms the life of Alvin Straight's journey, but it goes on. Although he moves as slowly as John Deere of Straight, when he meets strangers on his pilgrimage, we learn a lot about the isolation of aging, the painful laments and secrets and, ultimately, the power of family and reconciliation. Richard Farnsworth leads his career with the most genuine performance of the year, sad and poetic, unusual and affectionate. And Sissy Spacek makes him match his "slow" daughter, Rose, who worries about her own private loss while caring for her father. Rarely has a modern movie preached so positively about the family.
