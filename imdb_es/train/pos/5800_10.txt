['THIS IS MUCH MORE THE FAVORITE MOVIE OF THE WORLD! I enjoyed it when I was 4 years old and I still enjoy it at 16! It is an absolute masterpiece! There is no complete video collection without her !!! I enjoy every second and not only does the film have great special effects, but it also sends a great message to the young people of the audience, which may sound sleazy, but in reality the film is very COOLY in reality! Although Michael Jackson has been in some movies now, people still do not see him as an actor. Actually, he&#39;s the most talented actor I know! He is so talented! He is incredible !!! MOONWALKER is a must see !!!!!!']
