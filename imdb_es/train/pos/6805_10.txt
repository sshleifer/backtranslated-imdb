I really liked that movie. It was so well done! Great acting and drama and historically accurate. I love the Romy Schneider movies. This rock is not as big as Sissi, but it's still a rock! <br /> <br /> And Scorpiolina, she commented and said French dubbing. Well, this is originally a German film, not French. So yes. Second, there was a plot, maybe you're not familiar with the story. Oh, and her mother played the role of her governess, not her teacher. And the plot was not really Cinderella, but Queen Victoria, maybe you missed that detail. <br /> <br /> But anyway ... yes, the story of this movie is great, I love historical movies and Queen Victoria is very fascinating. ! I love all the historical things. Like that guy who was trying to manipulate his mother. And when she ran away, she met her future husband and he showed her the "new kind of dance". When the waltzing was new, it was considered something outrageous because the couples danced so close. Yes, your governess was like, oh my God! <br /> <br /> And also the clothes, I love clothes. The styles are great, the hoop skirts are great. And, of course, Romy always looks very pretty.
