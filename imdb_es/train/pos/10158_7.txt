Johnny and June Carter Cash funded this film, which is a traditional representation of the Gospel stories. The music is great, it gives you a real idea of ​​what the world of Jesus was like (I've been there too), and June gets into Mary Magdalene's part with a passion. Cash's narrative is also good. <br /> <br /> But ... <br /> <br /> 1. The actor who played Jesus was a disaster. 2. There is no advantage in the story as Cash puts some of his music based on faith. 3. Because it is not convincing, I doubt that we will see it widely distributed again. <br /> <br /> I would love to buy the CD. <br /> <br /> Tom Paine Texas, USA UU
