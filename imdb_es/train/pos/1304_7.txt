Good. Yes, this was a very low budget movie with continuity errors (like the individual scenes, obviously filmed in sunlight and then in the shade and then mixed), and as much as I loved Nick Mancuso, it was often too good in the fire. -partly, and part of the supporting supporting cast was really bad (more at least one actor was used for two different but conspicuous roles). But come on Richard Grieco was hysterical (only his hair is worth it). Steven Ford was very nice. Mancuso had some great lines, while Nancy Allen, ironically, was completely insipid and uninteresting. Classic? No. Bad parts? Yes. Entertaining? Great yes. I would have loved to be on the set the day they decided what kind of hairstyle Grieco would have. "You are fast?" ... "You're not that fast."
