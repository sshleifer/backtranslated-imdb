At least for half an hour a week. I have not been interested in anything in the 3 big networks (ABC / CBS / NBC) in years. All lions are interesting, although sometimes Larry can become annoying. I really like the action figures of Middle Earth that they bring with Hunter. Most of the other characters are interesting too. The Siegfried and Roy show is also entertaining at times. The animation is top notch, and definitely the best CG that has been done on a weekly television show. Usually, when they hire big names to star in a program, they try to hide a script or deficient characters. However, it is not entirely true in this show, there are a couple of characters that were weak and improved by the voice acting, but in general the characters remain alone. <br /> <br /> This is definitely for 16 and more. However, here is nothing that most children have not heard before, and most of the jokes would probably fly over their heads. It's definitely not as raw and tense as South Park, but it brings something of the same "Bash of all" feeling. One example is that he makes fun of Dick Cheney and Barbara Streisand at the same time in an episode. <br /> <br /> The father of pride and other Dreamworks productions like Shrek also feel like the spiritual successors of Animaniacs, Pinky and the Brain and Freakazoid. It's the same kind of grown-up humor. It may not be as clever as Spielberg's classic television series, but it's still good. <br /> <br /> I hope it ends well this season and that it will be renewed for future seasons. Otherwise, you may never find a reason to see the big 3 again.
