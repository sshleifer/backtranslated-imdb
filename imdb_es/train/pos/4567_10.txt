My left foot is an exceptional epic film that explains the life and times of Christy Brown, who had cerebral palsy, a severe disability and only had the use of his left foot, but was defiant, he managed to become an artist and writer against all . the odds <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie many times and every time I see it, it seems just as bright each time. I wonder how this incredible movie did not win an Oscer for the best movie. It's a disaster for the academy awards. Jim Shirdan is for me one of the best directors in the world. The script, the music and anything else is excellent in this movie. As the movie progresses, you will almost feel that you are in the brown house as everything happens. Ray MacAnally and Brenda Fricker are amazing, since Cristies and Fiona Shaw's parents are equally as brilliant as Dr. Eileen Cole, who helps Christy in her challenge battle. br /> <br /> The Irish film industry had a lot to do with its name before my left foot. My left foot was the beginning of a wonderful period in Irish cinema. films as powerful and bright as the field, the game of crying, in the name of the father and Michael Collins followed my left foot. These Irish films were so well regarded all over the world and were nominated to multiple Oscers and won some. period for the Irish film. My left foot is a powerful outstanding film. <br /> <br /> Daniel day-lewis plays the paralyzed Christy Brown so well and so brilliantly, and the same goes for Hugh or Conner who plays the young Christy.To those two performances are two of the best performances of the story, especially that of Daniel day-Lewis, which I would consider as high as Antony Hopkins in the silence of the lambs. Daniel Day-Lewis has shown in his career that he is a great actor. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent masterpiece in cinema, look at it!
