After reading the comments of this movie and seeing the mixed reviews, I decided to add my ten cents to say that I thought the film was excellent, not only in visual beauty, writing, music, acting and direction. but by exposing the story of Joseph Smith and the path he traveled through a life of hardship and persecution for believing in God the way he felt and knew his way. I am very happy to have had a small part in telling the story of this remarkable man. I recommend everyone to see this when the opportunity presents itself, regardless of the religious path in which he or she is walking, this only inculcates one with more determination to live the life we ​​owe with the true values ​​of love and forgiveness, such as the Savior taught us. what to do.
