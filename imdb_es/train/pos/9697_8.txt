This is a very moving family movie. It has absolutely brilliant animal training and "acting" (if you can call it that) too (just think of the dog in "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" ... it was just a bad workout). The story of Paulie is very well done, well reproduced and, in general, the characters are also very elaborate. No more to say, except that this is a GREAT MOVIE! <br /> <br /> My qualifications: history 8.5 / 10, acting 7.5 / 10, animals + fx 8.5 / 10, cinematography 8/10. <br /> <br /> My overall rating: 8/10 - GREAT FAMILY MOVIE AND MUCH MORE VALUED!
