This is the best version (so far) that you will see and the one that is most faithful to Bronte's work. Dalton is a little hard to imagine as Rochester to whom Jane Eyre declared "not handsome". But her performance exceeds this and Zelah Clark, pretty as she is, is also a complete and credible Jane Eyre. This production is a long watch but it's worth it. Quite direct quotes from the book are in the script and, if you want the first true "romance" in literature, this is the way to look at it. I own every copy of this movie and have read and reread the original. Filming may seem a little outdated now, but there will never be another like this.
