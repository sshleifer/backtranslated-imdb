While listening to an audio book, Cambpell Scott is the reader. I was so excited to hear his voice and that brought me the disappointment that "Six Degrees" was canceled. It seems that they never keep good programs on the air long enough to capture an audience that can connect with the history of the programs. What a shame, and shame in the network for not giving this program a full season opportunity. This was an excellent show to watch with a great cast. The network gave "Men in Trees" a second chance that the witch is also a great show, but they removed "Invasion" and that was also something totally different from seeing, not the same old themes. Why can not networks do it well?
