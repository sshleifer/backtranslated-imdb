Tears of Kali is an original but flawed horror film that delves into the actions of a cult group in India composed of German psychologists who have learned to control their wills and bodies to the point where they can cause others to "heal "through radical techniques (which can trigger nightmarish hallucinations and physical pain and torture) to free the repressed demons inside. <br /> <br /> The film is shown as a series of vignettes about the Taylor-Eriksson group: the cult group mentioned above. The first segment is somewhat slower than the rest, but it serves to establish the premise for the rest of the movie. The rest unfolds like a mindf @ ck movie with some of the key staples thrown into the mix (full frontal nudity, some blood) to keep you happy. <br /> <br /> I say look at this. It may not be spectacular, but its concept is quite good and it is delivered in the right places. 8/10.
