It is a pity that Deliverance is known mainly as the film of the rape of Paleto and by Dueling Banjos. Even people who have seen the movie can not stop thinking about that rape scene. It's not as bad as the rape scene in Pulp Fiction. It's certainly not as bad as any female rape scene in almost any movie. People tend to lose the power of the movie that contains the infamous buggery scene. <br /> <br /> The acting, the plot, the cinematography and the soundtrack of Deliverance lend a hand to his charisma. The backcountry in which it was filmed is beautiful and is quite in contrast to the dark theme. The actors, both older and younger, make you feel like you are navigating along that river with them. <br /> <br /> What separates this film from others is the tangible sense of fear it inspires. There are not many movies that can make you feel so scared. In short: this movie is a classic. I really can not say much more than that.
