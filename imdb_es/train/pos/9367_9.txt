It is not often that a movie can literally make the audience laugh, and five minutes later they fill their eyes with tears. Many films try to do this, but few can offer the emotional impact that this film had. Adam Sandler practically drags you with his often violent outbursts, but it also makes you laugh when the shadow of his past is not knocking him down. I will not ruin anything, but there is a particular scene that should have teary eyes and trembling lips. Even the most macho men would have to be heartless bastards to not feel something while watching this movie. Don Cheadle gives another great performance, but Sandler highlights it. Liv Tyler and Jada Pinkett Smith give solid performances, but nothing in line with the two main roles. Sandler's humor is still present, what really saved this movie from being depressing. There are several laughs, but do not think you'll stay there for long, as it gets serious again without much warning. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on about how well this movie goes down in history. about all the emotions that the human body contains, but I'm going to cut this short. I feel there is no need to tell you anything else. Do yourself a favor and take the time to watch this movie. Even if you have to wait until it comes out on DVD, it's worth 100% time. A deeply moving film that will bring tears to your eyes and a smile on your face ... unless, of course, you are a soul without a heart.
