I have not seen any of Grudge's Japanese films, but I really enjoy this one. Rarely do they scare me when I watch movies. I can jump, if the effect and the sound are surprising enough, but being scared by a movie is a strange thing for me. But I got scared of Grudge. Maybe because I did not expect anything when I saw it. I did not expect to be afraid. I did not know anything about it either. It was probably a good thing. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that, apparently, you either love or hate. Most people seem to compare it with Grudge's Japanese films, but even though I have not seen them, I think it's not right to compare any movie, really. This movie stands on its own. <br /> <br /> The story is weak, most people say. I do not agree The story is minimalist, and it is done on purpose. The storytelling techniques used, the broken time frame, for example, are perfectly done. The director knows exactly what he is doing, and I think he got his vision just as he wanted it. <br /> <br /> I gave her this movie 8 out of 10. It is a movie that you will enjoy watching or hating. It's as simple as that.
