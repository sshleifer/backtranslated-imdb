Nick Nolte gives an excellent performance in Kurt Vonnegut's dark tale. Notle plays Howard W. Campbell, who was a double agent who worked in propaganda during World War II. After the war, he lives anonymously until competing factions wish to unearth his past. As with much of Vonnegut's work, this is a meditation on the absurdity of war and those who use propaganda for their own purposes. Nolte is fantastic: sure of himself and sure as the youngest Campbell, and then broken and tormented as the older man who is forced to atone for the sins of his past. (7 of 10)
