I've been waiting to see this movie for a long time. The promotions gave a clear idea about the content and, when I finally saw it, it really seemed very well done to me. Most conventional romantic movies end when the lovers finally get married or start a happy life after marriage, but really a great adaptation is needed for this transition from an old life to a new and new relationship. This is about this film about the period in which a newly-married couple, Fardeen and Esha, get married through an arranged marriage and begin their life with their honeymoon. The acting is really fascinating, although I think Esha was a little quiet and could have used some lines for herself. The story was well woven and the dialogues were more or less appropriate. The editing and the direction were also good, Meghna Gulzar really did a good job here. To summarize, I would say that it is a good cum romance drama, a true combination of what Bollywood can offer a clean entertainer.
