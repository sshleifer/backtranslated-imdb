This movie is wonderful. The writing, the direction, the performance of all are fantastic. Very clever and intelligent writing. Quality performances by the actors, Ally Sheedy is strong and dynamic and delightfully peculiar. Really original and movingly unpredictable. The scenes are alive with fresh energy and a really talented production.
