For a low budget project, the movie was a success. The story is interesting, and the actors were convincing. Eva Longoria, who now stars in the television show "Dragnet," is sexier than ever. The locations were ideal for the gangster plot, and the director shows his talent by taking on many roles for his project. Of course, this low budget movie could use better editing transitions and more special effects for weapon scenes, but the music keeps this script moving. Although this movie has many problems, such as continuity, I must say that I would rent the director's next film. If you are a film student, you could learn some things from the director's comment.
