CLASSIFICATION OF STARS: ***** Not to be missed **** Very good *** Good ** You could go out for a meal instead of doing it * Avoid at all costs <br /> <br /> Bitch Stuck Race Kate (Franka Potente) heads to the London Underground to take a train to take her to meet George Clooney. However, after a busy day of work, she falls asleep and wakes up to find herself alone on a deserted platform. However, as she moves away from a situation that leads her from a discouraging encounter to another, she learns that there is something far more malignant and malignant than waiting for her out there. <br /> <br /> In many ways, the British film industry is becoming a reality in itself, especially in the department of suspense and terror, with films like Creep and the successful 28 Days Later (which has a great echo in some parts). In terms of success in what he set out to do Creep skillfully creates (especially at the beginning) a feeling of isolation and tense fear. In his skilful runtime, he also (albeit inadvertently, I suspect) manages to pay homage to some of the pioneering horror films of the 70s that rely on shock and fear without really focusing too much on character development and such. <br /> <br /> From their weaknesses, some scenes are a bit predictable, but they do not make it any less frightening or effective in any way. I'm not sure if the end was made to make it come out as a game of morality and it's not exactly perfect, but it's certainly very effective and fulfills its basic function very well. ***
