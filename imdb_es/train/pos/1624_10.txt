The Old Mill Pond is more a tribute to the African-American artists of the 30s than any denigration of the entire race (despite the caricature of Stepin Fetchit). In addition to the ones I just mentioned, there are also frog or fish versions of Cab Calloway, Fats Waller, Joesphine Baker, Bill "Bojangles" Robinson and Louis Armstrong. This caricature of Happy Harmonies by Hugh Harmon and Rudolf Ising is very entertaining musically with perfect characterizations everywhere. They all look so much like the real thing that half of me thinks they could be. If not, they are certainly very flattering imitations. Even Fetchit's loose and unchanging characterization gets an exciting workout here when he is chased by a tiger while "Hold That Tiger" plays in the score. Highly recommended for the fans of the animation of the 30s and jazz music.
