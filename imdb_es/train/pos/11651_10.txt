WHEN FRIENDSHIP KILLS, in my opinion, it is a very moving and heartbreaking drama about the consequences of being anorexic or bulimic. Every time I vomited Lexi (Katie Wright) or Jennifer (Marley Shelton), I wanted to throw up. It's a bit difficult to explain why. If you ask me, they should have been more cooperative with things. However, I enjoyed watching them doing things together, as well as receiving lectures from their parents. Before finishing this, I would like to say: "If you ask me, WHEN FRIENDSHIP KILLING shows you how being anorexic or bulimic can affect a person's body". Now, in conclusion, I recommend this movie to everyone who has not seen it. A few tears await you and a good time, so the next time you're on TV, relax with a friend and look at it.
