In a few words, Oliver! It is one of the best musicals of all time. It is full of memorable songs: "Food Glorious Food", "Oliver!", "Consider Yourself" and "Oom-Pah-Pah" to name just a few, and equally memorable characters. <br /> <br /> The film is a musical adaptation of the classic novel by Charles Dickens and, like the story of Oliver Twist, is a perfect family movie. There are some frightening moments: the villain Bill Sykes played by Oliver Reed is quite scary on its own, but in general, the film will appeal to children of all ages and adults. <br /> <br /> The story, which almost everyone is already familiar with - is about a little orphan boy named Oliver and his life growing up in London. At first he lives in the house of work with the rest of his orphaned companions, but after daring to ask Mr. Bumble, the supervisor, he sells it to a family as a servant. <br /> <br /> After a series of setbacks and shaving, he meets the Artful Dodger, played superbly by a young Jack Wild, who gives it all on paper, and through him, the greedy Fagin (Ron Moody), who trains young children to pick up the pocket treasures he keeps for himself. <br /> <br /> The film was filmed only in studios and sound studios at Shepperton Film Studios, but this does not translate into film at all. The sets replicate perfectly in Victorian London, as do the costumes worn by the characters. A multi-Oscar winner and a huge success at launch, Oliver! he is a worthy candidate for the best musical of all time and will delight anyone who loves cinema.
