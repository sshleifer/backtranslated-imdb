This is the most controversial documentary I've seen. It was a simple and impressive view of a beautiful idea. Based on photographs of hidden industrial landscapes centered on China's modern industrial growth, Edward Burtynsky comes to life in the face of the problems we so easily choose to ignore. <br /> <br /> Without political aspects, this film is neutral. moving image of the realities on which our Western societies choose not to educate us: the byproducts of economic growth, the externalities paid by the citizens of less developed communities, the source of our comforts and the waste of our lifestyles of consumers . <br /> <br /> Incredible, heartbreaking, impossible to ignore. This is a challenging journey, but it is worth undertaking. Please stop being ignorant and at least see these pictures of the truth without feeling any pressure to take a position on these issues. 10/10 definitely!
