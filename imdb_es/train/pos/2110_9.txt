A lot has been written about the plot of the film, the wonderful performance of the performance, the script, the melancholy, the bittersweet atmosphere, the excellent direction, what can I add? Just watch one of the most touching, beautiful and moving scenes ever filmed. It's Christmas Eve and the character of Frank Morgan (the owner of the store, Mr. Matuschek) is recovering from his broken marriage and an attempted suicide. When each of his employees leaves, he invites them to a Christmas dinner. Each and every one of them rejects him politely. They all have plans for their own Christmas Eve. In this stage there is a deep sadness in this scene in movement. Frank Morgan gives the performance of his career and this scene makes me cry easily. Fortunately we have a happy ending to this special scene. The new employee, the errand boy, is the last to leave the store to a beautiful scene on a snowy street. Desperately, Mr. Matuschek approaches this boy and asks him how he would like to spend the night with him, will offer him all the wonderful Christmas food that this errand boy has probably never seen. The boy is overwhelmed, he is also obviously just like Mr. Matuschek and together they can have a wonderful Christmas meal. Every time I see this scene it moves me. If you can get the delicious DVD, watch the big trailer with Frank Morgan introducing himself as Mr. Matuschek and an appearance by the film's director, the talented Ernst Lubitsch. This movie is a joy from beginning to end.
