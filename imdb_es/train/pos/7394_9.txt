This Chinese film made me feel so many similarities with the members of a culture that I do not belong to and from which I am far away. In an almost Buddhist approach, the film helps us relate to each character and the happiness of doing simple routine things. <br /> <br /> All the actors are brilliant, and Xu Hzu exudes kindness and wisdom, but also vulnerable and petty Er Min, the retarded brother, shows us that intelligence and wisdom are not equal, and that wisdom it comes from the most disparate people in this universe. A different China, this is far from Chinese realism, however, it has a lot of humanity and realism of a different kind. <br /> <br /> Get it. You will not be disappointed.
