When I first read the plot of this drama, I assumed it was going to be like Sex and the City, however, this drama has nothing to do with it. The stories of the characters seem more real and empathized with the situations more. The concept of drama is similar, four women of 30 guide us through there friendship and relationships with problems and conflicts along the way. Katie the family doctor is a dark and melancholic character who is also difficult to relate and who is the best friend of Trudi, a widow. The character of Trudi is touching, since you can relate to the difficulties she is having and the fact that she is the only mother of the four. Jessica is the party girl very determined and knows what she wants and how to get it. She is a nice character and is closer to Siobhan, the newlywed, who, while loving her husband, can not stop her eyes from being diverted to her co-worker. Especially the drama is surprisingly addictive and if the BBC continues to produce the series, it could do well. It's unlike other female dramas like Sex and the city or Desperate Housewives. This if played well could be the next cold foot. Also, the male cast is not bad in the eyes too.
