A recent visualization of THAT IS ENTERTAINMENT has given me the need to see many of the classic MGM musicals of the forties and fifties. ANCHORS AWEIGH is certainly a movie smaller than ON THE TOWN. The songs are not so good, nor the chemistry between the characters. But the movie marvelously combines classic favorites, like Tchaikovsky. And the scene at the Hollywood Bowl, with Sinatra and Kelly coming out of the woods above, and then running up the stairs, while dozens of pianists play on the piano, is the best scene in the movie, despite the fact that scene in which Kelly dances with Jerry Mouse is more famous. The classical music enthusiasts will undoubtedly identify the music played by the pianists. Sinatra then sings: "I fall in love too easily", before having his epiphany about who he loves. The color is beautiful, Hollywood looks beautiful with its mountains and air pollution free (Can you imagine Hollywood in the twenties, let alone in the mid 40's?), And piano music is absolutely glorious. MGM certainly had a knack for creating lyrical moments like these.
