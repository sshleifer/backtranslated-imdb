This was provocative! I am an Iranian, and living in the 21st century, I did not know that such large tribes have been living in such conditions at the time of my grandfather! <br /> <br /> They see it today, or even in 1925, on one side of the world, a lady or a baby could have everything for him or her clean and on demand, but here 80 years ago, people ventured his life to go somewhere with more grass. It is really interesting that these Persians endure these difficulties to find pastures for their sheep, but they lose many sheep on their way. <br /> <br /> I praise the Americans who accompanied this tribe, they were as hard as the Bakhtiari people.
