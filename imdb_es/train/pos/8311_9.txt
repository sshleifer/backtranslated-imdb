I really liked this movie, it was good, and the actors were brilliant! Leon Robinson, who played Richard, and many other classical singers, is very good at his work. When you see it in a musical movie, you know it's going to be good! I would suggest that people see this moving, sad and special movie, if they want to know more about Richard! Exceptional! Cool!
