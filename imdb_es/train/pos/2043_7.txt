['I just watched this movie last night at the Toronto Film Festival, where it was played in the Midnight Madness section. To tell you the truth, the only reason I went to this movie was because he shared his name with the Radiohead song, and also because my friend had bought the tickets, so I really had no other choice: to be something like Silence of the lambs, but it turned out to be a semi-gore movie. Someone has already mentioned that none of the characters is nice, and that is absolutely correct. I really could not care less if Potente&#39;s character had his guts torn out by the Creep. I was encouraging homeless people to get out alive with the character of Powerful by getting their fair desserts. Christopher Smith has certainly done a great job with the visual aspect of the film. However, the story is quite weak, but again, the objective of the film was to scare you and did it quite effectively. The score of a Bristol band called The Insects was first class. That, more than anything, really scared me a lot. <br /><br /> The director was a really decent guy and was quite entertaining during the question and answer session. I really hope that I can make better movies in the future. <br /><br /> This is strictly for fans of the genre, but I would recommend non-fans to try this anyway. It was a fun trip.']
