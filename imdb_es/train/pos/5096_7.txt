This is an extensive remake (4 hours) of the story of Rider Haggard, with the usual female addition and a strange secondary plot with Russian soldiers looking for a "Power Stone" buried along with the treasure of King Solomon. It is very well filmed, which gives a vivid sense of the wide open spaces of Africa and is very well acted. Patrick Swayze is an excellent Alan Quatermain, and Allison Doody is attractive as Elizabeth Maitland, who hires Quatermain to help rescue her father. Sidede Onyulo as Umbopa, Gavin Hood as McNabb and the leader of the Russian soldiers (not mentioned in the IMDb list) are also memorable. For all that Hollywood can not leave only a good story when they adapt it, it is well told and, except that it is too long, I enjoyed it. 6/10.
