I love it or hate it, it's hard not to find Warren Beatty's version of "Dick Tracy," the 1990 film adaptation of Chester Gould's famous comic strip, nothing less than a classic of the genre. Superhero movies have been coming out of carpentry in recent years, and may soon become a genre on their own. <br /> <br /> Beatty's film generously uses Gould's source material to the maximum effect, filming on all six strips. primary colors and, therefore, give this unique but familiar world of happy mutant gangsters and seductive and loose women an exuberant visual style and tone. <br /> <br /> It can be affirmed that the strong visual aesthetics of the film is drastically short. Change the characters and their acting skills, which I do not think can be further from the truth. <br /> <br /> "Dick Tracy" enjoys his appearance and his awful characters, and Beatty himself, who plays the tenacious and incorruptible detective of the title, is appropriately stoic and is ready to end the bad guys at any cost. <br /> <br /> In addition to visual treats and Oscar-winning make-up, there is a plot, and Big Boy Caprice (Al Pacino, deliciously overdone in an Oscar-nominated performance), seeks to eliminate Tr Act√∫a in a single well planned movement, but also seeks to control all the criminal action in the city by uniting all the enemy bands that are under it. <br /> <br /> Tracy, meanwhile, juggles her relationship with Tess Trueheart (Glenne Headly, who as her name would have it, remains faithfully by her side and cares about The Kid (Charlie Korsmo), who finally find a father figure to admire in our hero of the bankruptcy of the crime.Tracy's faithfulness to Tess is proven by the tempting advances of Breathless Mahoney (Madonna), which is also Big Boy's main problem. this is declining, things heat up when a new criminal figure arrives in the city and decides to play against the medium on both sides. <br /> <br /> The performances are good, according to Beatty's approach in tense relations and Romance between each of the drivers becomes the center of the material, instead of concentrating only on the nonsensical action and the special effects.Pacino freely chews the stage in a role that really stands out from the rest. /> <br /> "Dick Tracy" is one of the best and most ignored of the comic book genre. I think that if Chester Gould were still alive, he would be proud of Warren Beatty's opinion of his beloved crime-fighting detective. <br /> <br /> 8/10
