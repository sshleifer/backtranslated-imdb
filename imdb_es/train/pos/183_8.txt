Exquisite comedy starring Marian Davies (with the affable William Haines). Young Peggy arrives in Hollywood looking for stardom. The cameo presentations show "all the stars in the MGM sky" in the famous police station scene, in addition to many classic details for the academician. Pic also captures for posterity Davies, the famous imitations of the main stars of the day (his Swanson is a beauty!). "Peggy" even surprises herself when she meets the famous Marian star. Davies in tennis, lifts his nose and says: "Oh, I do not like it!" <br /> <br /> My fingerprint was perfect. History, direction, acting an authentic charm and a duty for all silent afficinados.
