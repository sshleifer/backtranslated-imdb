I had seen the most series I could watch on television, but unfortunately, I started a job that allowed me to work at night. I managed to capture some recordings, at least ... and, of course, I bought the recently released DVD of the entire series. When watching the DVD, you can see that the animation was a bit more crude at the beginning, but they solved a good number of faults after the pilot was made. The voices adapt well to the characters, and the writing is excellent. It is quite refreshing to see how animation returns to its roots by reintroducing adult themes. What happens is that, in the way that society has arrived in the last century, you should be a little more cheeky about it according to current standards to be recognized as a show geared towards adults. The characters have very realistic personalities and are placed in situations that are parallel to what we often face in real life. In this sense, it is a typical comedy, but the humor is more similar to what would be expected from a late-night TV show like a talk show or Saturday Night Live ... when SNL was really fun. Good work, Dreamworks. You may need to work with one of the most liberal networks to maintain this series ... and also improve the commercialization of the merchandise so that the series helps to cover the high costs. However, it is a challenge to do this for a caricature of mature nature. Hmmm
