['This is for me a rather strange movie with a lot of humor. I would not say it&#39;s very scary, but I guess it&#39;s more fun. That if you like horror movies. The scarecrow reminded me of &quot;Children of corn&quot;, but not yet. If you compare these two movies, it&#39;s much more fun to watch them =)']
