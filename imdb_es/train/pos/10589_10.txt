I enjoyed Longstreet, who followed in the footsteps of Raymond Burr's hit TV series Ironside and was destined to give him competition. But this program was canceled after a season because it was decided, I think wrongly, that Longstreet could not compete with Mr. Burr's Ironside. <br /> <br /> I can add that the pilot of this program was Especially well done and very memorable. I hope a Longstreet set appears. <br /> <br /> Writers should keep in mind that this idea of ​​history was only briefly explored here and that much more could and should be done to show the play and interaction of disabilities on television. .
