From the beginning, you see that "Anchors Aweigh" is a great comedy. Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra make such a fun team! The songs they sing together are pure entertainment. Kathryn Grayson is beautiful and very sweet. Dean Stockwell is the cutest child actor I've ever seen. If you like the piano, you will be surprised by Jos√© Iturbi. This movie was the first to combine animation with real actors and it did wonderfully in an unforgettable dance number. Undoubtedly one of Kelly's funniest movies.
