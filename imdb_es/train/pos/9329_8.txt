I have seen The Perfect Son about three times. I do not see how this movie is a gay movie, I'm not even gay, but I do not see it as a gay movie. It's a movie with a gay character, I can not see why every movie with a gay character should be strictly a movie about being gay. It seems to me that the movie sympathizes with the study of death, the death of someone who is your relative. I think Theo turns his life around quite quickly after rehabilitation because he wants to and seeing his brother die in front of him makes him reevaluate his life. I found the dialogue on the scene when Theo tells Ryan that he's going to be a very moving father, Ryan says he does not want to know about the things he'll never see or share with anyone. Is not that horrible and sad? I highly recommend the movie.
