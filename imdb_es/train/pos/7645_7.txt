Belushi at its most exciting moment and Courtney Cox before Friends has a small role. I often think that Belushi is little used in Hollywood and this role of the film is one of his best. For those of you who watch your television show, this is a very different and nice character. The film itself does not break the earth, nor is the message new, but it is sweet and endearing. The cast of familiar faces and unknown names is a perfect balance, although Lovitz's whining can be exhausting, and Michael Caine's charming spiritual guide has a slightly sinister, if not well-intended, advantage. Hamilton, like Belushi's wife, unfortunately is two-dimensional and one wonders why he married her. In addition, Renee Russo is wasted and is not terribly convincing in the "dance queen" who escaped. However, a good way to spend two hours.
