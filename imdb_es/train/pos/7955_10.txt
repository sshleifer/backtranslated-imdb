This is one of the best children and pets movies ever created. I cry every time I see Shadow screaming "Wait, wait for me, Peter!" as the family car is moving away. This is a must see if you love the animals! The best movie in history! The lines in the movie are sometimes stupid. Like when Sassy tells Chance; "The rule of cat and dogs drool!" I could do without lines like this, but when I was six years old, I bet I loved that line. The story may seem hooked for some, but I like it. Shadow like the older dog that is preparing Chance to take care of him when he's gone really moves when you think about it. It reminded me of my childhood dog. I think everyone can find a part of themselves in "Homeward Bound."
