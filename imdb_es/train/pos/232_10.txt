What a lovely movie. The characters were not only animated, but also alive, reflecting everyday life and struggle within a family. Each character brought a unique personality to the story that the audience could easily associate with someone they know within their own family or circle of close friends. <br /> <br /> The story has a real flow that the viewer can assimilate and be part of the drama, laughter and tears as the plot of the film develops. The script does a good job of capturing the common emotions, actions and reactions of the characters to conflict, opinion and resolution. <br /> <br /> It is not an epic, but it is a very nice movie to see with your loved ones. A lot of knowledge of the head nods and 'ahhh' moments to share and enjoy.
