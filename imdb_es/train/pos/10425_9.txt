THE GREAT CARUSO was the world's biggest hit in 1951 and broke all box office records at the Radio City Music Hall in a year in which most "movement enthusiasts" stayed at home watching their new 7-inch TVs. "Motorola: Almost all the recent box office figures are false, because they can not adjust inflation." Obviously, today's $ 10 movies will dominate.In 1951 it cost from 90c to $ 1.60 in Radio City, from 44c to 75c. they played for the first time at the Loew Palace in Washington DC, or from 35c to 50c in neighborhood races, what counts is the number of people who respond to the image, not the unadjusted media tour of the box office. THE GREAT CARUSO was that the filmmakers took most of Enrico Caruso's real life (it's not really a great story), he threw it away, whereas 90% of the film's focus was on music. Therefore, MGM gave us the best EP singer was live MARIO LANZA making the music of the best historical opera singer ENRICO CARUSO. The result was a wonderful movie. Pity that LANZA kicked his life and career away from overeating. Too fat to interpret THE STUDENT PRINCIPLE, Edmund Purdom took his place --- with the voice of Lanza doubled, and with the previously handsome and not fat Lanza represented in advertising. If you want to watch THE GREAT CARUSO, it's almost always on eBay for $ 2.00 or less. Do not be discouraged by the low price, as it reflects only the easy availability of copies, not the quality of the film.
