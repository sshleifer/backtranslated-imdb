Both visually and musically impressive. A treat for both the eye and the ear. The Victorian element par excellence of the initial sequences was completely charming, helping to create a Christmas scene that Dickens himself would have been justifiably proud of. Technically, the production is visually stimulating and the special effects are imaginatively designed and achieved creatively in a traditional setting. The dance of many of the main artists is surprisingly good. Photography and lighting are first class and the sound recording is admirably adjusted to the high general level of technical skills employed. A great movie for the whole family at Christmas and a charming discovery that will support multiple visualization.
