A Chinese academic who harshly criticizes the arrogant nationalist and warmongering policies of the ruling clique around the emperor in pre-war Japan, is accused of being "communist" and imprisoned for life. His loving wife, who fully supports her husband and her ideas, is left alone to save her family from starvation. This movie is a huge statue erected to praise the role of the mother in the history of mankind. Sayuri Yoshinaga is no less than sublime in the title role and it was a monumental scandal that did not get an Asian Oscar for the best female role in 2009. It was for a young girl with very limited acting potential. <br /> <br /> This profoundly moving and more "human" characteristic is a must-see for all "true children" on earth.
