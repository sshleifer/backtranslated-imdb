This is the only full-length film about the world of the bridge. The first 10 minutes seemed a bit slow, but after that, the film is absolutely perfect to describe professional bridge players and how they earn their living. <br /> <br /> Some of the scenes are very funny. I do not think a player who is not a bridge player gets the charm of this movie. <br /> <br /> Some of the dresses are really beautiful, too bad that the film is black and white. I can only imagine how they would look in color. The way in which the media is portrayed is absolutely hilarious. There is no way that the bridge of the earth is like this. <br /> <br /> Look at it as soon as you can and tell your friends.
