['First things first, Edison Chen did a fantastic and credible job as a Cambodian hitman, born and raised in the garbage dumps and a ring of gladiators, where he perfected his trade as a wild battery to survive, living off the mantra of killing or being killed. In a role that had little dialogue, or at least some lines in Cambodian / Thai, its performance is convincing, probably what it should have been in Jet Li&#39;s vehicle, Danny the Dog, where a man is raised for the sole purpose to fight, and on someone else&#39;s leash. <br /><br /> Like Danny the Dog, the knuckle fight sequences, much talked about, are not choreographed stylistically, but are designed as normal and brutal fisticuffs, where everything goes. This probably brought a sense of realism and guts when you see the characters attacking others, defending their own lives and distancing them from others. It is a gloomy, gritty and dark film, both literally and figuratively, and this sets it apart from the usual production of police thrillers. <br /><br /> Edison plays a contracted weapon from Cambodia, which becomes a fugitive in Hong Kong, fleeing from the police when his truck went wrong. Leading the pursuit is the team led by Cheung Siu-Fai, who has to deal with the non-conformist member Inspector Ti (Sam Lee), whose inclusion and acceptance in the team had to do with his father&#39;s sins. Thus begins a game of cat and mouse in the dark tones and shadows of the most sordid side of Hong Kong. <br /><br /> The story itself works on multiple levels, especially in the character studies of the hit man and the policeman. On opposite sides of the law, we see inside each character, not the black and white, but the shades of gray. With the hit man, we see his affectionate side when he got hooked and developed feelings of love for a girl (Pei Pei), which gave him a sense of maturity, tenderness and revealed a heart of gold. The police, with questionable tactics and attitudes, makes you wonder how you would do things when you are willing to do whatever it takes to do the job. There are many interesting moments of moral questioning about how anti-hero and despicable strategies are adopted. You will ask what a man does and what beast, and if we have the tendency to change sides depending on the circumstances, do we have that dark inner fringe in all of us, transforming us from man to dog and from dog to dog? man? Dog Bite Dog catches you from the beginning and never lets go until the end, although there are halfway points that seemed to drag, especially in their tender moments, and also suffered for not knowing when to finish. If I must choose a favorite scene, it must be the food center of the market: extremely well controlled and delivered, a moment of suspense in your seat. Listen also to the musical score, and you&#39;re not dreaming if you hear dog grunts. <br /><br /> Highly recommended, especially if you think you&#39;ve seen almost everything in the genre of the police thriller.']
