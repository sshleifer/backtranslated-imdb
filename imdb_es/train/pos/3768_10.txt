I realize that many people hate this movie, but I must admit that it is one of my favorites. It turns out that I like it more than its predecessor and I like it more than many movies. <br /> <br /> First of all, I think people never give credit to history, like Back to the Future, Time Travel is hard to write, and in this film they included Journey in Time and a Spiritual Journey . <br /> <br /> I also feel that Keanu and Alex were in the best performances of this movie, they looked cooler, they acted more coolly. and said great things. <br /> <br /> The set design of this movie is also impressive. The sets are quite detailed and massive at times, and it may be hard to believe that these were created for a movie about two. teenage buds that can barely spell ... but it is not the genius of the entire franchise, making these two idiots are larger than the characters of life who are responsible for the entire utopian future of the earth. <br /> <br /> The design of the suit was impressive too. Bill and Ted look really cool in Bogus Journey, where as in Excellent Adventure they look pretty good, as they would say, FAGS !!! <br /> <br /> Even the music in this movie is awesome, the score especially. There is so much I can say about this movie, because I love it. But this is one of those movies that I grew up watching and each time I liked it more, so I can understand why people hate or just think that it is false compared to Excellent adventure (which I also love by the way). <br /> <br /> LOWER WITH YOUR BAD SELF !!!!
