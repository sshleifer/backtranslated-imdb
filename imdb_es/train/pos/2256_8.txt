['I did not know what to expect from Van Damme&#39;s partner and coach / trainer and his wrestling choreographer for most of his films. It was nice to see him act as &quot;TONG PO&quot; in &quot;Kickboxer and other Van Damme movies, now he is alone, he and his wife form a great team, in this case, Qissi is the action director and leader of the bad guys and is Well, really stingy, his wife was the writer, producer and director of most of the scenes that did not require action, he also did a good job editing the film, they did a great job, the story made sense, the scenes of The fight was well edited, the leaders were real fighters and they looked good together: history combined well, and if you can believe it ... there is no bad language, there is no sex, only action, a new one for me.']
