['The Legend of Zu, as I saw it, was a very interesting story. I think many of the people who did not like it did not see the underlying mythology behind the movie. They expected something similar to Star Wars, and it was not that. Joseph Campbell, I think, would have liked this movie. There was a series of metaphors and hidden meanings that an average viewer could have overlooked. We all have a mountain of swords inside us. We all have to enter our own blood cave at some point in our lives. We all have to face our own insomnia someday. It is true that part of the narration was a bit confusing, and sometimes the action became a bit clumsy, but I think other points of the film easily compensated. I would see it again. <br /><br /> I do not know if there is a difference between The Legend of Zu (which I saw in Mandarin with English subtitles) and Zu Warriors (the dubbed version of the US) It could have been stunned for the American public, which would have really detracted importance. this movie.']
