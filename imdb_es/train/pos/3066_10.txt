Everyone is loving or hating this movie. I'm going with love He's so well shot and so well acted. Beautiful. This movie is for people who appreciate making well-made movies. If you are not a fan of well made movies, of course you would hate this. But if you like acting, photography, history and development functions, look no further here.
