The title has many meanings: the boxing ring, where differences and grievances are fought, a wedding ring, where Mabel feels trapped and Jack feels that his problems will end and the cause of the problem, a ring-shaped bracelet that Bill gives to Mabel. Like a love chip. <br /> <br /> The former professional boxer, Danish Carl Brisson, had his start in the Alfred Hitchcock films in "The Ring". A very young Ian Hunter, who had such a long career in film, plays Bob Corby, who draws the attention of a beautiful girl, Mabel (Lillian Hall Davis) at a fun fair. She is committed to "One Round" Jack Sander (Carl Brisson) but that does not stop her flirting with Bob. Bob is convinced to go "a round" with Jack. He goes to several rounds and wins: he is a professional boxer and he and his manager have come to the fair to find out if Jack is a fighter as good as they have heard him. He offers to take Jack and Jack leaves, along with his rude coach (the great Gordon Harker) to make his fortune with plans to marry Mabel when he recovers. Jack wins his fight and marries Mabel the next day, but the deep attraction that she and Bob feel for each other is still there. Jack suspects and puts everything into his training so he can fight Bob for his wife. <br /> <br /> Finally, a boxing movie in which the hero does not get out of the way: Bob behaves and does everything he can. be a champion - if only Mabel acted in the same way! She has left it for Bob, and the fight at the end is very strong. It is intensely realistic: it occupies the last 20 minutes of the film. Jack, being raw and enthusiastic, is almost eliminated, then, between rounds, meeting with Mabel, gives him the courage to succeed. The question is, why would I want her to come back? From the beginning she did not think about starting an affair with Bob, why would not she do it again? <br /> <br /> The movie is loaded with symbolism. Jack, shaking hands with the promoter, switches to Mabel's hands accepting Bob's bracelet. When Jack puts the ring on Mabel's finger, Bob's bracelet slips down his arm. In the end, Jack sees Mabel's reflection in a bucket of water on the side of the ring and that gives him the confidence to continue. This is an excellent movie that will not disappoint you. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
