Charming, romantic, innovative and fun. The vision of this extraordinary film is almost incomparable, and surpasses the best known "romances of death", like Ghost. While we intuitively know that Peter and June will find maximum happiness at the end of that long, long staircase, joy is in the journey. The moral of the story, of course, is timeless: love conquers everything. But the struggle to achieve that victory is played in a celestial arena of radical vision and greatness. With more than 500 appropriately dressed extras portraying diverse ages and cultures, the directors' vision of the sky remains memorable six decades later, until the CGI era. <br /> <br /> However, despite all the cosmic scale, Powell and Pressburger knew An essential truth: the best story is told at the smallest level. The wonderful and decidedly romantic appearance of "Escalera" is captured with the utmost simplicity: the tear of June, preserved in a rose petal. <br /> <br /> This movie, like the story and the set itself, is one for the ages.
