['A charming mini movie, a musical short film based on three of Cole Porter&#39;s successful Broadway songs. Bob Hope&#39;s first accredited film is a delight! He plays an American millionaire playboy on vacation in Paris. The film begins with him sitting at a table in an outdoor cafe telling his friends about this breathtaking beauty. Suddenly he sees her a few meters away. He is so excited that his friends make fun of him and suggest &quot;just show him your bank book.&quot; But Hope says she can win it in less than 30 days with &quot;no&quot;! They bet the polo ponies on the subject and take all their money and their identifications. Hope follows her and, when they are alone, a proposal springs up that she does not believe he is sincere until he sings &quot;You do something to me&quot; by Cole Porter. But she must leave and he tries to earn money as a guide so that he can pursue it. But when she sees him showing another girl in the city, disillusioned, she wants to leave him. He continues to chase her and overtakes her and her family on a race track where he bets his slim winnings in the last race in hopes of winning enough to impress her. Through a series of events and large numbers of synchronized dance, he loses the winning ticket and she decides to marry him rich or poor. So he wins the girl, the race and the bet and sings two more songs!']
