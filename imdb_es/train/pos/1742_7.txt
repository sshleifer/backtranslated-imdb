['Perhaps, one of the most important and enjoyable Greek films I&#39;ve seen in the last ten years ... Excellent performances (especially Yiannis Zouganelis is great), well-written script and an effective direction from a very special level, by the very standards average of the Greeks. author A film, obviously influenced by the Straw Dogs of Sam Peckinpah, which could be a masterpiece if it avoided some situations and obvious and exaggerated symbolizations at the end. However, this is a film that deserves our attention and belongs to that rare category of Greek films that should be seen outside of Greece. It is a pity that in Greece it did not work commercially, in addition to other large false and superficial productions such as Politiki Kouzina.']
