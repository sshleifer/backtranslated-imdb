['Bravo for the Czechs, their film industry, which was once powerful, seems to awaken from the post-communist dream. <br /><br /> The Loners is a comedy made with all the elements that you would expect to see in a modern production of &quot;Hollywood&quot; minus the garbage that seems to be related to the genre in recent years. Excellent soundtrack, excellent visual editing, beautiful Prague cityscape, to mention just a few. <br /><br /> The story is actually composed of several sub-stories that often intertwine and overlap, and is essentially a collage of destinations, destinies, desires ... Follow a group of urban young people until the mid-thirties to through various situations. They range from everyday life and leisure activities to careers and obsessions. And it&#39;s hilarious. In fact, there is a point in the film in which the whole theater he was in (about 100 people in a small art gallery) laughed nonstop for about 40-50 seconds. How often do you experience that with modern Hollywood productions? <br /><br /> Although all the main cast is excellent (especially the next Macedonian star, Labina Mitevska in the role of an immigrant who faces such familiar difficulties), I have to highlight Jiri Machacek for his incredibly credible interpretation of Jakub, a bohemian constantly stoned. The brain is severely affected by the things you smoke and put it into a plethora of fun situations. <br /><br /> Conclusion: do not miss it! It has a lot to offer.']
