Everyone has already commented on the cinematography (from good to great), the personalities (bigger than life), the structure (chronological, with many references to the culture of surfing through time). What is lost is a more important question of sociological importance: looking at the main American culture for something more satisfying and rewarding. <br /> <br /> I was a surfer in the 1970s. We used to watch 16mm films at local high schools in SoCal. I remember the great feeling of surfing all day long until my skin radiated heat, I put on a Hawaiian shirt and shorts and went to see the last surf movie at night. Often, the narrator was the filmmaker himself, reading a script on sheets of paper. Sometimes a surf band or a proto-punk band would add music. I was never happier. Except for the shouting and shouting, seeing 'Riding Giants' made me go back in time. <br /> <br /> It also reinforced the feeling that living life to the limit, without worrying about money and social and corporate escalation. The staircase, without keeping up with the Joneses, striving physically and mentally for a fleeting moment of joy and jubilation, may be the answer to the question, "what is the purpose of life?" At least for those like Greg Noll, Laird Hamilton and the like, they seem to have found something that few of us are bold enough or honest enough with ourselves: to live life only on our own terms. Maybe society would fall apart if we all did exactly what we wanted in life, but it's wonderful to see the people who are really living their dreams. <br /> <br /> It was this message that really impressed me.
