I often wonder how much CASPER meant for children ... with all the problems that revolve around their identity (in this film we are led to believe that he is the spirit of a dead child, since his house is a plot of cemetery), as well as the disturbing message brought by this particular movie. Perhaps Casper was understood more as a work of morality, or Famous Studios felt that he was breaking new ground with the cartoons of "reality". <br /> <br /> THERE ARE GOOD POINTS OF THIS NIGHT is a well animated project, no doubt there. But, the development of the plot that involves the fox (which becomes Casper's friend, but has a tragic end) is a concern. <br /> <br /> Give credit to Famous Studios: they approach death with respect ... but, the raw The image of Casper's duel is quite graphic and disturbing for children (although the outcome offers a happy ending, but I will not reveal the end), and the violence is quite pronounced, even by the standards of 1940. <br /> <br /> This could be a good caricature for parents to use to explain death to children, but not I would insert it into the VCR for a happy cartoon pause.
