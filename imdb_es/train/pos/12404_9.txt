I was living Rawlins when this movie was made and I was lucky to be able to work on it. As much as extra and with Eddie Surkin in special effects. It was fun to see all the work behind the scenes, from Barbedwire bringing life to the electric chair through the guards' office floor. It was also fun to meet all the actors, from Viggo to Tiny. Also the door that was cut in the wall of the prison for the film was and continues to be called "Disney Gate" by locals. If someone is interested and always in Rawlins, most of the movie sets are still in place and can be seen during the self-guided tour. It was very fun to work for and with R. Harlin and I wished I had the opportunity to do it again.
