Wes Craven has created one of the best suspense and murder movies of all time. After watching your movies, you will find your new fears. People do not know which Wes Craven thriller is the best, because they are all different. <br /> <br /> In this movie, Lisa is terrified by a traveling companion. He forces her to kill and, if he does not do this, Jack will kill his father. Lisa is in the big mess, because what she chooses, will kill. <br /> <br /> Acting was unreal. Rachel McAdams and Cillian Murphy performed incredibly well. Emotions were in the right choice. The idea and the script of this movie are also great ... <br /> <br /> Sometimes it reminds of a "Scream", but it is definitely better than the two "Screams" after the sequels. <br /> <br /> And what can I say? This is the best killer thriller movie in the 21st century until now ...
