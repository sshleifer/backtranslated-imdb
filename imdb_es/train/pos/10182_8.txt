Good movie, good music, good background and an acceptable plot. But again the main point as their films tend to be, man is the best actor in Idia and can turn dust into gold. Nana Patekar This may be his second best performance after the parinda (others may disagree). Although other films are not left behind. A man who will never disappoint you. <br /> <br /> good movie although I think shahrukh was a luxury that this movie could have done without him. You can see in his films, others try hard to reach their heights and act outside their skins. but this man is really something elase. <br /> <br /> The film is great, the music and the direction are excellent, but the screen and the dialogue again are very good. a must see
