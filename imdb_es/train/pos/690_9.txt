I had no idea what this movie was, nor did I know it existed until about a month ago when I came across it when I was looking for other films starring Dominic Monaghan. I thought that this movie was a strange vision of the mind of the sleeper and what his mind may be going through in the hours they spend awake when the rest of the world around them is asleep, it was an interesting movie and one the good part was interpreted by Dom ....... I think that although this movie can not be bought anywhere (well, I've never seen it anywhere), you should see it if you ever have the opportunity because it will really think about people that surround us that they can not sleep and have to suffer night after night of not having been able to sleep or only sleeping approximately 1 hour every night, so in general it was an interesting film of good substance.
