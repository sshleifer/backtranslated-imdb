I decided to buy the DVD box for the first season and this first episode surprised me. The adventure of the first Enterprise, Captain Jonathan Archer, the magnificent T'Pol, Reed, Mayweather, Dr. Phlox, Hoshi and Trip is excellent, at least in this pilot. I have noticed in IMDb that this episode is actually divided into two parts, but in DVD they are only one, therefore, my review is valid for both. I did not like the theme of the score, which I found very annoying, but this was an exception in this great show. My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Broken Bow"
