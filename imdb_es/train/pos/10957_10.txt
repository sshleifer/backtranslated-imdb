This show probably will not attract everyone. Sarah does what she wants; She does not ask permission and she does not apologize. This is a comedy with zombies, robot dinosaurs, flying cars and a team of male cheerleaders who steal purses. The star of the show is not a hero, she is a spoiled and spoiled pervert. If you can not appreciate the unconventional humor it offers, the program probably is not for you. Everyone should at least give this show a chance. It brings together the comic style of Sarah Silverman, Brian Posehn (Comedy comedians), Jay Johnston (Mr. Show), Steve Agee ('Stay' of Bobcat Goldthwait) and the creative energies of Rob Schrab and Dan Harmon (Heat Vision & Jack, Monster House). It also shows the best talents of the growing online community, channel101.com. (If you like this program, keep an eye on "The Department of Acceptable Media" in vh1 this March, it will be drawn from the same group of talents). <br /> <br /> Watch the Sarah Silverman program. This kind of thing is the future of entertainment.
