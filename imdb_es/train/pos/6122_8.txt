This movie is absolutely hilarious. Basically, the plot revolves around a serial killer who somehow became a snowman through a chemical accident of a B-movie. He then heads to the city and begins to terrorize the locals. It is up to the local police chief and some other characters to try to stop him. It's done with a small budget and it certainly shows, but the good thing about this movie is that it knows it's garbage. The improvisations of polystyrene foam and polystyrene that mimic the gigantic murderous snowman are classic, and this is clearly the intention: it is one of the few films that has its budget as its main point of sale. Along with comedy, there are other great moments of comedy: hear from the beginning the voice of a father who is killing his children and the most fun rape scene that has ever been committed to film. fantastic sticky fun
