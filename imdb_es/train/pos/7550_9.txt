Wow. A really fantastic 'travel' movie that has tons of super surreal images, dark intentions and a rather strange black sense of how cartoon animals should see the world. It is populated by a very nice group of characters that bend and flow with deformed backgrounds. As with all fantasy, the wandering plot is secondary to the amazing visual effects and we follow a little cat and his zombie sister when they meet. Death, deluge, water elephants, samurai swordsmen and pigs that fish. I had never heard of that, but now I love it, probably because it reminded me of the surrealistic work of American cartoonists; Bill Plympton. It is a delight for fans of strange and beautiful things, and I had stuck to the screen for fear of losing something incredible. In a nutshell, it's 'Hello Kitty' without the 'o'.
