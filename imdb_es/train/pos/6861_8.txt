When you compare what Brian De Palma was doing in the 80s with what happens today for entertainment, his films continue to look better and better. "Dressed to kill", "Blow Out", "Body Double", "Scarface" and "Carlito's Way" are excellent works of a film artisan at the peak of his powers. The guy had a long list of better than average movies. This is pure Hitchcock with a hint of a creepy perversion of the '80s, a story affectionately told of lust and murder with a lot of twists, immense forms of style, an impressive Donaggio Pine score and a shoddy plot inspired by the giallo . The camera work and the bloodstained visual images help overcome the logical holes, while the fabulous performances of Dennis Franz, Keith Gordon (a good director in his own right), Nancy Allen (De Palma's wife at the time) and Michael Caine do everything possible. special scene. Let the virtuoso take you to a surreal, terrifying odyssey with an erotic charge, and enjoy each "Dressed To Kill" picture.
