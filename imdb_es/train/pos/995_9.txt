This movie surprised me. Some things were "clich√©" and some technological elements reminded me of the movie "Enemy of the State", starring Will Smith. But for the most part very entertaining, good mix with Jamie Foxx and comedian Mike Epps and the 2 aspiring thugs Julio and Ramundo (who provide comic relief). This is a movie you can watch again, say ... on a Wednesday night when nothing else is on. I gave him a 9 for entertainment value.
