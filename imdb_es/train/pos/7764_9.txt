Another classic study of the effects of wealth on a southern family is described with expertise in Written on the Wind. <br /> <br /> Kyle Hadley has it all. Wealth, an airplane, whatever. Kyle's best friend, Mitch, has always taken him out of the difficulty. Mitch finished college, Kyle was expelled. Mitch is not from a rich home. Kyle's family, with Hadley Oil, controls most of everything in the city. <br /> <br /> While in New York, Kyle meets the girl of his dreams, very well played by Lauren Bacall. After a whirlwind romance, he marries her and takes her home. There he meets his father-in-law, who warns him how difficult Kyle can be. Kyle sleeps with a gun under the pillow. The character of Bacall is with the sister of Kyle, Mary Lee, a vagabond, if ever there was, played to the fullest by Dorothy Malone, who was chosen as the best supporting actress. <br /> <br /> Rock Hudson plays Mitch, the faithful friend. <br /> <br /> A year of conjugal happiness for Kyle and his girlfriend ends when the doctor tells Kyle he can not have children. When his wife reveals to him that she is pregnant, Kyle, thinking that the girl is of Mitch, gets drunk and accidentally kills himself in a memorable scene. <br /> <br /> Mary Lee, who has always loved Mitch, tries, but she does not succeed in blaming Mitch for Kyle's death. In a memorable court scene, Malone did his best to finally admit that Kyle's death was an unfortunate accident. His Oscar was well deserved. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, Robert Stack, brilliant as Kyle Hadley, was nominated for best supporting actor and lost in a victory for Anthony Quinn, as Paul Gauguin, in Lust for Life. <br /> <br /> Douglas Sirk was the master of the telenovela movies of the fifties. Written in the wind is no exception. *** 1/2
