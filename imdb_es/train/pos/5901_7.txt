It is a repetition of many recent films, only that it has fewer stars, fewer complications and a more confused feeling. Abhay and Ritika (played by Fardeen Khan and Esha Deol, respectively) meet at a friend's wedding where their own marriage (not known to them) begins their organizing process. In a short time, the two strangers get married and are sent to a honeymoon camp where they meet other couples who make movements similar to theirs. As they spend time together, secrets are revealed, hearts are broken and / or arranged and love blossoms. <br /> <br /> If you have seen Honeymoon Private Limited and / or Salaam-e-Ishq, then you have seen this movie. The twists of the plot are the same, there is not a single element of surprise in the full two and a half hours of the movie. Everything is predictable. I only enjoyed it because I had seen 'Darling' (also starring Deol & Khan) at the beginning of the day and enjoyed its chemistry, so I said "why not" when my sister suggested we rent "Just married" too. <br /> <br /> Look at it: because Kirron Kher is a co-star and is his dearest person in it. <br /> <br /> Skip: because you've had enough of all this nonsense at festivals. ! <br /> <br /> C +
