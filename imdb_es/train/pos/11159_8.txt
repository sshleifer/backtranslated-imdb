This is a wonderful movie ... The first impressions of cynicism and rudeness are soon dispelled by a funny display of how the basic motivations of men and women diverge (Â¡Vive la diferencia!) <br /> <br /> You can love to people despite and sometimes because of their weaknesses. Humans are really a bit of garbage, but we have a big heart and we do everything possible, despite temptation. It's not our fault when sometimes you can not resist temptation, that's what we are. <br /> <br /> There is a consistent style from start to finish; Clear photography and sharp composition, very nice visualization when you add provocative content, appropriate music and laughs out loud. <br /> <br /> Beware of the very young "lonely voice" ... bright; The wisdom of innocence balances the comedy of the human condition.
