This has to be one of my favorite episodes of Twilight Zone, mainly because of the representation of two lonely souls in a post-apocalyptic environment. <br /> <br /> The cobwebbed stores and debris-filled streets are spooky in that particular way, Twilight Zone makes it better. <br /> <br /> While the parable may be a bit clumsy by today's standards of drama, it is excellent: use the configuration to make a statement relevant to the human experience, as well as the geopolitics, of a way that is timeless. All the drama is based solely on the shoulders of Mr. Bronson and Mrs. Montgomery, who do not disappoint. (Both of you rest in peace.) <br /> <br /> A true classic.
