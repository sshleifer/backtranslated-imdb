Of course, 65 years have passed since the last production of Thalberg was filmed. But fellow members of IMDB, come on, this movie is surely one of the masterpieces of the 30s! It's a 10. <br /> <br /> This was the first movie I saw at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, around 1970 (I was a teenager). Of expensive aspect even with scenes of so much poverty, photographed masterfully, often exciting and always attractive, for me it was the best movie of MGM. What did audiences feel when they saw a locust attack, the person-to-person destruction of a mansion, horrible poverty and then the splendor of wealth? <br /> <br /> Last week, those who watched the Academy Awards had a glimpse of the "senior" Oscar winner, Luise Rainer. How great it is to see an actress who could be said to have performed one of the most magisterial and disturbing performances in history who chose to return for a celebration. <br /> <br /> Ok, then I should not have won the previous year (Great Ziegfeld). But do not blame Luise. The talkies were only a decade old when it was published, and their dialogue was limited. But like Olan, his use of the visual and vocal is memorable. <br /> <br /> On a large scale and touching, what more could a lover of the film want!
