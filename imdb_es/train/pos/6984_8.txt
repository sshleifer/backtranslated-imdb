I was impressed with the recreated Battlestar Galactica, a program that always kept me guessing and made me cry on more than one occasion. As a science fiction fan, I like to think I can get the best out of BS, and this was good. <br /> <br /> As such, when I first heard the possibility of a series of prequels A few months ago I had a bad feeling in my stomach. I was afraid that the formula that made Battlestar so successful was reused in Caprica, which would not work at all. The story of BSG, of a group of ragged survivors, trapped on board decaying starships and guided by a prophetic vision and a sequence of pseudo miracles, was perfectly complemented by extraordinary music and a better cast of actors. <br /> <br /> Caprica feels different. Where BSG takes place after the fall of a great civilization, Caprica portrays that civilization in its cold and decadent apogee. The overall atmosphere I got from Caprica was similar to that of Minority Report, minus the excessive and counterproductive theatricality. In her true form of BSG, Caprica in her first hours of programming already addressed the problems of religious freedom, racism, the morality of playing God and the nature of the human soul. <br /> <br /> The casting for Caprica is also excellent Each character is unique and profound, from the obsessive and distant scientist turned entrepreneur, to his worried and stubborn daughter, each actor and actress join their respective roles. <br /> <br /> The music, which was used in such a way. Powerfully in BSG, it also plays an important role in Caprica. The powerful rotating drums of Battlestar and his sad duels served his subjects very well. Caprica uses a more orchestral sound, which gives the show its own feeling quite different from any of its predecessors. <br /> <br /> The new Caprica is definitely your own program, taking everything you need out of the Battlestar franchise. I look forward to the complete series.
