If any show in the last ten years deserves a 10, it is this rare gem. It allows us to escape to a time when things were simpler and funnier. Full of heart and laughter, this show keeps you laughing through the three decades of difference. Furniture was ugly, colorful clothes and even drugs were tolerable. The hair had feathers, the music was accompanied by skates and, in the words of Merle Haggard, "an articulation was a bad place to be". Take a trip back to the best time in the history of the United States. Fall in love with the characters and feel the good essence of the small town where people were more friendly with each other. This classic is both on television and in "Full House". Do not miss it, and always remember "Shake your rhythm!"
