Not only was I an extra in this movie, I was able to see it in Boston in a completely sold out movie theater. More than a thousand fans of the Red Sox / Farrelly of Boston got into a movie theater near Boston Common to watch a comedy ... about them ... Red Sox fans! Drew Barrymore and the star of Jimmy Fallon are this cute comedy about love and lust. Love is between the two young lovers. Lust is for the Red Sox to win the world series. Although Fallon is not a great actor, he is the best actor for the role. He is funny enough and gets the most laughs. Barrymore, on the other hand, is the same old Barrymore. Sometimes, I felt that supporting the actress Ione Skye would have been a better actor for the role. All in all, the Boston Red Sox fans will love this movie. For the rest of the world, this is just a funny movie.
