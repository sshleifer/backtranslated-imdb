I would not like to comment on how good the movie was or what the faults were, since I am not a professional film critic and I do not have enough knowledge of how to make films. What I do know is that making this kind of film in your first shot is a great achievement and I would like to congratulate the Director for that. However, in some reviews I have read, critics complained that Hiralal's relationship with his brothers did not stand out, and that his brothers were completely erased from the story. Now I would really like to raise a point here that, as the name of the film suggests, is not a film about Hiralal's brothers, it's a film about Mahatma Gandhi's relationship with his son Hiralal Gandhi, nothing more and nothing less. If we start complaining about some characters staying out of action in the movie, it would be a bit unfair because these characters do not fit the image, no matter how relevant they were in real life. So I think it would be better if we stick to the main idea and stop satisfying a critic in ourselves. <br /> <br /> Enjoy !!!!
