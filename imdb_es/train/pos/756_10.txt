['I have to say that although I despise this kind of spectacle, horrible horror, I am a girl, I feel that I have to express my opinion. I had seen Dirty Sanchez before I saw Jackass and I think he outdid Jackass in terms of creating programs. The story lines and the interviews are intertwined to create a more interesting show. The other night I saw a few minutes of the Jackass movie and I could not believe how bad everything was, all in an online joke without any relationship between them. It must have been the fastest and easiest to edit program, surprisingly amateur. While drinking alcohol is not my thing, in regards to a major entertainment program, Dirty Sanchez is out of the Jackass league.']
