As the summary of a line says, two films have left me such a comment when I left the theater. The one was "Stir of Echoes" with Kevin Bacon, and the second one was "Vanilla Sky". <br /> <br /> It's one of those movies where you sit on the theater seat and stop thinking about someone around you. stop wondering what the end of the movie will be and just leave the fast movie where you want ... Leaving the cinema was a bit strange, like the feeling you have when you're sick and I can not think of anything. One of those movies in which you become one with the boy, and you feel that nothing else moves around you than the things in the movie. <br /> <br /> One thing is certain. The actors are amazing, the soundtrack is excellent, and everything in the movie is 9+. <br /> <br /> Surely one of the best movies I've seen, and the movie that made the best and most shocking awakening. My life and my purpose in this world.
