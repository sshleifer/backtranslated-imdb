Ten of the 11 short films in this film are masterpieces (only the Egyptian seemed disappointing to me). Strategically, everyone, except the Mexican director, chose to portray the problems of individuals or groups in relation to September 11: Afghan refugees, deaf people, Palestinians, Srebrenica's widows, AIDS and poverty and corruption in Africa, the Pinochets coup and the consequent bloodbath. , suicide bombings in Israel, American Muslims persecuted by paranoia and persecuted by the state, elderly living alone and the consequences of the Second World War in the hearts of Asian soldiers. This could say something sad about the limits of empathy, in both senses: directors may feel that Americans ignore the pains of the rest of the world and only care about their own tragedies, while effectively doing the same with their short films. <br /> <br /> Surprising me, I found that Sean Penn's piece is one of the best in the collection, and *** SPOILER AHEAD *** I also think that his interpretation of Ernest Borgnine as a half-crazy old man goes back to the vegetation an apartment in New York that experiences the happiest moment of its life as a widow when the sun shines through its window after the WTC "collapsed", I suppose this could also be one of the most offensive as I would see the American public in general.
