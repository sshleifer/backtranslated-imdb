"The Lady in Question (1999)", starring Gene Wilder, is a mysterious drama that reminds me of the old black and white series by Raymond Burr Perry Mason. Both Perry and "Cash" kept me guessing until the end. There were many suspects with a motive for the murder, but I had no idea what character it would be. <br /> <br /> Gene Wilder has a special charming wit about him, even in his facial expressions and vocal inflections that make Him perfect for the part. The parts of the film in which the actors performed acted very well. I'm sure this is an additional challenge for the cast to get ahead. I'm not surprised to see that he did some of the writing for the movie. Even his singing was delightful. I like him in this role more than his "dumbest" roles like "The Young Frankenstein" and "Willy Wonka." I hope A & E continues this series. They should call it something like "The mysteries of A & E Gene Wilder." <br /> <br /> The music fits into the period. I enjoyed the cool live combo and the swing songs. At first it was not very clear if we were watching a flashback or if the action was taking place in that period of time. And I do not agree that the inclusion of blasphemy is necessary for the flow of the script. For me, that always distracts. <br /> <br /> In general, my wife and I very much enjoyed this second on a well-made start in what we hope will be many others, like one of our favorites: Raymond Berry Perry Mason.
