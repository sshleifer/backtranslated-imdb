['That movie is absolutely fantastic !! If you see it with your friends, it can be a very good day ... Obviously, you should know that the movie is stupid and very badly directed and performed (Tomba / Unziker, what a couple), and that is probably the worst movie in The World , but you can enjoy it a lot. We saw it at 19 and it was a very pleasant afternoon. The best scenes are the first, when the criminals kill Alex&#39;s friend, and he tries to act like a desperate one, and the result is a first-class comic scene ... And then, when he shows Leva (Antevleva, what? ) a name) the &quot;Palassio di giusstissia&quot;, and then the accident of Leva, which once went out of its way in the car, and a second later, the car is completely empty! What magic!']
