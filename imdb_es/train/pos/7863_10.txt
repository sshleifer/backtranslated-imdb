This film is a revelation for those who can only glamorous lifestyles of the stars. It tells you how people who want to do good can not do it. Also, the scene of the bomb explosion is very real. <br /> <br /> What you read and teach you does not happen! <br /> <br /> You can increase your BP level by 10% <br /> <br /> All the actors played their part very well. <br /> <br /> Some scenes could / could have been avoided to include teenagers. <br /> <br /> This movie is pretty adult by nature. <br /> <br /> It is not a movie that can be seen with the family. <br /> <br /> The casting is great !!!
