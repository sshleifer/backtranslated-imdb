"Dirty" Inspector Harry Callahan, once again, angers his superiors with his dissident approach to police work. By refusing to take a vacation, they give you a simple case that takes you out of San Francisco. However, he soon discovers a link between a recent murder in the city and a murder outside the city, which leads him to the trail of a murderer in revenge. <br /> <br /> As an entry in the Dirty Harry franchise the film begins with some very promising moments, including the legendary line "Go ahead, make my day" that Eastwood offers beautifully with clenched teeth before thwarting a break-in with one hand. Very rude and it's just what fans can expect from him. However, the film soon changes gears and focuses on the mysterious revenge killer. The problem is that this killer is not as mysterious as it is characterized as much as Harry. This really detracts from the presence of the main character who governed all his previous appearances in the film with, sorry for the pun, Magnum Force. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, this new story draws several parallels with Harry's unorthodox. Methods and gives his character a dramatic depth that was not there before, but fans who were looking for another exit from Harry will probably be somewhat disappointed. However, a tense climax ends the movie with an exciting note so if you do not mind something a little different, it's a good movie for the fans. --- 7/10 <br /> <br /> Classified R for violence and rape scene
