The first time I saw this movie was like a pre-teen, about the age when children begin to think about their identity. I was very affected by the scene of the man and the children he raised as his own. The older child has been mocked that his mother is a prostitute and that none of his brothers has the same biological father (what Kurosawa makes evident by having children who do not look alike). The man still persuades that child that he is his father by the only definition that counts. Man is acclaimed as a father by all children except one, who still prefers his brother. <br /> <br /> Each of the vignettes is also compelling for its own stories and conclusions. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie, even if it's not Kurosawa's best movie.
