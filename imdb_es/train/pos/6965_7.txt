This film answers the question, how does a relationship survive when your girlfriend is codependent, clinging, needy, jealous ... and has powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal women? <br /> <br /> Without spoiling the movie, I can assure you that it is not, but there is a lot of fun on the way. Uma Thurman is perfect as the mercurial super heroine, a super baby, mysteriously called G-Girl, who, unlike most of her sisters, is not always dedicated to truth, justice and American style. <br /> <br /> Thurman is also credible as the fool, but somehow she continues to attract, healer Jenny. When they leave her for a less gifted rival, but more emotionally and tightly adjusted, G-Girl becomes furious, and what follows is not pretty. It's funny, but it's not pretty ... <br /> <br /> It's a lovely premise, hell has no fury like a derogatory superhero, and those involved do not take it away, but it has its moments, and I think I'll get it the DVD. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie ...
