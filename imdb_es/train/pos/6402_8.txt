I thought that this movement was very good. There were some things that were less than perfect, but in general, I was quite surprised. The court scene at the end seemed a bit unrealistic, but it was real enough to entertain. I discovered that the film communicated the difficulties of going through military training and the sacrifices it entails. Being a military pilot I could relate to many of these parts.
