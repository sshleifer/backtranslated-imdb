I saw this movie in 1976, my first year living in New York. I continued to live there for the next 26 years, but I never saw anything as delicate and beautiful as this little television movie. It was part of a series of PBS as a souvenir, and I've never forgotten it. <br /> <br /> There are no sex scenes to talk about, only delicate, moving, extraordinarily moving moments, full of tension and emotion, all set in a conservative environment, Boston (I think), of the First World War where women played the role of a devoted wife awaiting the return of her husband from the war, and did not seek a career and financial independence. Frances Lee McCain is excellent in the role of a career photographer and I have spent the next 30 years impatiently looking for her in equally challenging roles, to no avail. <br /> <br /> Does there have to be a video of this movie? Are you sure it should be on DVD but at least one video?
