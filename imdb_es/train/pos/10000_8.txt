Homelessness (or lack of housing, as George Carlin said) has been a problem for years, but never a plan to help those on the street who once considered themselves human and who did everything possible to go to the school, work or vote for the matter. Most people think that the homeless are just a lost cause while they worry about things like racism, the war in Iraq, pressure on children to succeed, technology, elections, inflation, or the worry of if they are going to be the next to end up in the streets. . <br /> <br /> But what if you were given a bet to live on the streets for a month without the luxuries you once had in your home, the entertainment games, a bathroom, pictures on the wall, a computer , And everything you once treasure to see what it is like to be homeless? That is the lesson of Goddard Bolt. <br /> <br /> Mel Brooks (who runs) who plays Bolt as a rich man who has everything in the world until he decides to make a bet with a rival sissy (Jeffery Tambor) to see if he can live in the streets for thirty days without the luxuries; If Bolt is successful, he can do whatever he wants with a future project to build more buildings. The bet is on where Bolt is shot on the street with a bracelet on his leg to monitor each of his movements where he can not leave the sidewalk. He was given the nickname of Pepto by a vagabond after it is written on his forehead where Bolt meets other characters, including a woman named Molly (Lesley Ann Warren), a former dancer who divorced before losing her home and her friends Sailor (Howard Morris) and Fumes (Teddy Wilson) who are already used to the streets. They are survivors. Bolt is not. He is not used to reaching mutual agreements, as he once did when he was rich to fight or flee, kill or die. <br /> <br /> While the love connection between Molly and Bolt was not necessary to conspire, I discovered "Life sucks" to be one of Mel Brooks's watching movies, where before being a comedy, it shows a tender side compared to his slapstick work like Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein or Spaceballs, to show how valuable it is before losing it the next day or, on the other hand, making a stupid bet like all rich people do when they do not know what to do with your money. Maybe they should give it to the homeless instead of using it as monopoly money. <br /> <br /> Or maybe this movie will inspire you to help others.
