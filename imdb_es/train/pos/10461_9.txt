A Vow to Cherish is a wonderful movie. It is based on a novel of the same title, which was equally good, although different from the movie. It really made you think about how you would respond if you were in the skin of the characters. Recommended for anyone who has loved a parent, spouse or relative, in other words, EVERYONE! <br /> <br /> Although the production is not entirely Hollywood, there are no great special effects, even so, the values ​​and ideals represented more than compensate. And the cast did a wonderful job of capturing the emotional connections between family members, and the devastation that occurs when one of them gets sick. <br /> <br /> You will not want to miss this!
