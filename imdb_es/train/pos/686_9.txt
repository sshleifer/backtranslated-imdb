Ghost Story (TV Movie - 1972) was the pilot of the NBC series. The film was well written and performed well, and I thought that when the 1972-73 television season began, if the television series is half as good as the movie, then NBC has a winner. (I wish this movie was available on video!) The series was a colossal disappointment, even with William Castle as an executive. producer. However, if you have the opportunity to see the original TV movie, Ghost Story, take a look. You will not be disappointed.
