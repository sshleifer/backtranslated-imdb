It is hard to imagine that this film is based on a true story, and how Christy achieved the miracle is so moving. Daniel Day-Lewis is a chameleon, really hard to imagine how much effort he had made to create this disabled character. Seeing it on the screen is a stunning and impressive experience. <br /> <br /> The movie is not as pessimistic as I thought before, the story is something brilliant and intriguing. Christy is not despised by the normal, his life is also colorful and charming, although we can be aware of the loneliness and the painful lock through his eyes. <br /> <br /> An important factor in Christy's success is the support of her mother. what seems to be more touching, and the unknown actress Brenda Fricker also deserves her Oscar for this role, this fat middle-aged girl uses it all to make Christy's dream come true. What luck for Christy! And Hugh O'Conor is also excellent as young Christy, what a performance for a child! Christy's love story is very well done, trusting. Christy wants love and nothing can derive it from the right to love, in love with the beautiful Dr. Eileen Cole (played surprisingly by Fiona Shaw, I am deeply impressed with her role in the Harry Potter series, the bored Aunt Petunia, so her appearance in this role it is really beyond my mind, but anyway, any woman has her own youth ...) is paranoid and offensive, I have sympathy for him, love is a two-edged sword, happiness and agony They are next to each one. other. <br /> <br /> By the way, Jim Sheridan's works are all good (IN America, THE BOXER, etc.), except GET RICH OR DEAD, God knows why he chose to direct that garbage! Really a career stain for him, what a pity!
