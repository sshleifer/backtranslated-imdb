['Previously I thought that this movie was the most vile of the Muppet films. I would now like to retract that statement. In my opinion, now, the most unusual movie of MUppet was the television movie &quot;It&#39;s a very happy Christmas&quot;. I am a WONDERFUL scam that was really terrible. MUPPETS TAKE MANHATTAN is nothing special, but more pleasant miles than MERRY MUPPET Christmas. <br /><br /> The best songs are the song &quot;You can not take no for an answer&quot;, the song that the Muppet Babies sing and the songs for the grand finale itself. Since I loved the Muppet Babies TV show, I loved the Muppet Babies sequence here (I was told that it was what inspired the Muppet Babies program) <br /><br /> The MANHATTAN MELODIES show itself was the real showtopper, with the Sesame Street Muppets even showing up for the wedding. As Kermit puts it in his final line &quot;What better way could something end?&quot; But I wish that what was between the beginning and the end was a little more entertaining. There are cute Cameos by Brooke Shields and Gregory Hines and a great dance sequence by Rizzo and the Rats (choreographed by the late great Jim Henson) and the film certainly entertains. However, I must say that MUPPET MOVIE, GREAT MUPPET CAPER and MUPPET Christmas CAROL are the three definitive films of MUppet.']
