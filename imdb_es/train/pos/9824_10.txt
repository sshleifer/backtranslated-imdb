This movie is an excellent example of the state of the erotic B movies: bad porn movies without hardcore sex. The plot in this is not as bad as these things go; It is a lawyer trying to prove that her lover is innocent of killing his wife. The rest of the movie, however, leaves something to be desired. Bad acting, bad direction, bad woman, bad scenes, bad photography, bad sound and bad sex scenes. Filmmakers should learn the difference between lascivious and erotic. They do not even have the common sense of having Gabriella Hall naked or in a love scene. <br /> <br /> How silly is that?
