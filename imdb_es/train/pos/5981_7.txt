TRICK OR TREAT is a good example of Hollywood jumping in the "backward metal music messages" car that Tipper Gore and his Washington Wives started in the mid-80s (other less successful entries in this mini-genre include the horrible BLACK ROSES AND THE DOOR). I was a sophomore in high school when TRICK OR TREATMENT came out and I could not wait to see it. It seemed to disappear from the video stores in the late 80's, but recently I got a DVD copy at an affordable price and it gave me back many nice metallic memories. Any teen metal nerd could relate to the judgments of Eddie "Ragman" Weinbauer (Marc Price of "Family Ties") in this film, as he is chased by the "beautiful" people of his high school for his heavy metal fashion and his musical taste . Eddie's favorite rock star is Sammi Curr (who looks a lot like Tommy Lee of Motley Crue), who died in a hotel fire at the beginning of the movie. Eddie is inconsolable until he receives a test of Sammi's last unreleased album from a radio DJ (Gene Simmons of Kiss in a short cameo). Eddie soon discovers that this LP, when played backwards, allows him to communicate with the undead spirit of Sammi Curr himself! Soon, Sammi is giving advice to Eddie on how to match his tormentors, but when the messages increase alarmingly ("Waste'em ALL ... no false Metal!") Eddie tries to destroy the album, which makes Sammi I am back. to life through Eddie's stereo speakers. Sammi breaks into the big dance at Eddie's high school and takes the stage to shake the crowd and disintegrate some unfortunate "false metalheads" before Eddie arrives to save the day and the girl of his dreams. (SIGH) No, it's not very scary in 2006, it was not even scary in 1986, but TRICK OR TREAT is a movie that will make any 80s metalist smile and have a courtesy soundtrack courtesy of the Fastway cult band . It's worth looking up if you've ever hit your head or if you like grade B horror movies (or both, like me).
