What is wrong with you, if you were not dragged by the sequences of action cars and the hot body of Jessica Simpsons, then they are very screwed in the head. Of course, the film is not a masterpiece, I do not think it was its goal. It was fun and fun, I never saw the show when I was younger, I only recently saw an episode, and when I saw the movie, I felt that it had the same kind of atmosphere. The seats of the film practically trembled, and the sequences of cars were good because they did not bore me and they lengthened like some of the scenes of 2fast 2furious. and Jessica Simpson is simply sexy, I just wish she had been more used in the action sequences. In general, I spent a lot of time watching this, I would see it again soon and I will buy it on DVD. People, enjoy it for what it is.
