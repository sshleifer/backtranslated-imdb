From the first scene, I was very excited. "I can say that this is going to be amazing!" I thought. The performance was so good that I felt like I was spying on these people's lives. The music was also exquisitely disturbing. The plot began with a sudden event and then veered forward (one might feel) towards an irrevocable fate. The construction was slow, but I personally love that kind of thing, as long as the silent tension stays on track and does not derail before it is ready to bear fruit. <br /> <br /> So everything is fine, and then the fireworks start, and before you know it, the credits are rolling. "WHAT?!!!" It was everything that I and my partner at the movie night could say. If you understand the intentions of the director, the overwhelming ending makes sense (for those of you who have already seen the movie, see the fascinating and hilarious interview with Larry Fessenden on filmcritic.com), but I can not help but say it. It was not done correctly. <br /> <br /> This could probably have been solved with just ten more minutes of material before the climax. In any case, it is very bad. Those ten minutes could have made all the difference in the world. (But for those of you who do not write or make films, you should know that making an arc of the story with the proper timing is a BIG pain in the ass, and I'm certainly not making this criticism from any kind of pedestal!) < br /> <br /> It seems to me that Wendigo is a masterpiece that was abandoned before it was finished. But, hello, I would take a dull masterpiece any day on a piece of overproduced dog-poo overcompensated with too many digital effects (like most horror movies these days). <br /> <br /> Another comment. Some of the monster scenes left me confused as to whether I should be afraid or laughing. I do not know how to explain it, but there was a distinct feeling of Monty Python about this monster in its most flagrant forms of "monster". Although this may sound like a terrible critique for a horror movie, I do not know, it still worked for me in a crooked way. I will never look at the antlers of the deer in the same way again! :)
