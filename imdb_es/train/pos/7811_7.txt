Steve Biko was a black activist who tried to resist the white minority who ruled South Africa in the same way that Gandhi tried to resist the colonialism of the British empire in India. Richard Attenborough's film, Cry Freedom, is not about Biko or Apartheid, but about Donald Woods, the editor of the white liberal newspaper who risked his life trying to tell Biko's story. The film has a change of discordant point of view after Biko dies in prison for torturous behavior at the hands of the South African "police". Woods, played by Kevin Kline, must choose whether to do the right thing and flee the country to publish books about Biko or allow his wife, played by Penelope Wilton, to press him to forget the books. In that case, Biko dies in vain. What begins as a life-changing friendship between Biko and Woods degenerates into a standard by the numbers that slip over the border thread after Biko's death. Oscar nominee Denzel Washington is good only in his fourth film as Biko, but something is wrong in a film that tries to describe Apartheid struggles by focusing more on the judgments of a white family for more than half the movie. Attenborough would have served her theme better by focusing on Biko's rise to prominence instead of where Biko first became friends with Woods. Maybe a black actor in a lead role in a 2 1/2 hour movie was not exactly conducive to a big box office, but the movie was a tremendous box-office failure anyway. Leaving aside film politics, the film still entertains and sends one or two messages, though in a sanitized manner. *** of 4 stars.
