As someone else commented, this is a movie to feel good about. It has a glorious scenery and Luciano's voice full of wonders! I've seen this movie many times and I've seen it again this afternoon. I forgot how much I miss the Pavarotti song by Nessun Dorma and I need to take out the CD! It is a great movie to spend the afternoon absorbed in fun and dreaming. Eddie Albert is a great agent and a bit exaggerated, but all the agents are just that. The Italian countryside is beautiful, but nothing beats the balloon ride for the perfect view. If you need an Olivier proportion performance, this movie is not for you. If you just want a flight of fantasy and wonderful music, watch this movie. Just enjoy!
