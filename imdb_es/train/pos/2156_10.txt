This movie is one of my favorite foreign films, some of the others are Amilee and My Life As a Dog. The similarities with those films and with so many great foreign films, is that it takes a part of the mundane life and transforms it into a profound and sincere lesson. <br /> <br /> In Japan, a man who is bored with his mundane life and the routine of his married life, sees a beautiful Japanese woman looking out the window of a dance studio. The instant he takes his train to pass, he is captivated by it. But is it just because of its beauty, because of its distant look, or a connection that both will discover that they share? <br /> <br /> Shall We Dance has wonderful memorable characters who have to deal with painful realities by transcending them through the world of dance. Breaking traditional molds and stereo types of Japanese society, they risk everyone for happiness and find that joy is not far away. It is one of those films that is so magical and meaningful and, in itself, transcends the mundane by showing the true magic and the miracle that life can be.
