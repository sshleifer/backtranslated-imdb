What would happen when a depressed policeman works with a reduction in probation? It can be very funny ... This film establishes a point of reference in the comedy / action genre of Argentine cinema. Unpleasant characters, probable history and a rhythm that between laughs has some emotion. I recommended it for a pleasant moment of entertainment. Peretti and Luque join forces to fight against a cold and audacious enemy at a time when it is difficult to trust someone. This movie will surprise you, on the other side of the coin of "Anal√≠ceme", but not equally, with nothing to envy. And if you like to know Bs.AS there are few scenes of the center and the center of the city.
