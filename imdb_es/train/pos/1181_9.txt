Rachel Griffiths writes and directs this award-winning short film. A moving story about how to deal with pain and care for the memory of those we have loved and lost. Although, with only 15 minutes, Griffiths manages to capture so much emotion and truth in the film in the short space of time. Bud Tingwell gives a poignant performance as Will, a widower who struggles to cope with the death of his wife. Will faces the harsh reality of loneliness and helplessness as he goes to take care of Ruth's pet cow, Tulip. The film shows the pain and responsibility one feels for those they loved and lost. Good cinematography, great direction, and superbly acted. It will bring tears to all those who have lost a loved one and have survived.
