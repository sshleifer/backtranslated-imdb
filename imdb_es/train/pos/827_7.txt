['Perspective is a good thing. Since the release of &quot;Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace&quot;, the affirmations and considerations of how Episode II and III will develop have made the &quot;original&quot; Star Wars films become part of a cohesive whole. instead of segregating old and new movies in separate trilogies. What the new films have done is to allow new perspectives to be placed in older films. This new perspective allows us to better appreciate what has often been considered the weakest of the original trilogy: &quot;The Return of the Jedi.&quot; Often ridiculed for its &quot;cute&quot; factor, ROTJ is in some ways as strong as the original and only slightly less impressive than the almost perfect &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;. In fact, the &quot;cute&quot; element of ROTJ, that is, the Ewoks, remains a weak link in the whole series. Did George Lucas put the furry dwarves in the movie just because of the marketing possibilities? Only he can answer that question. <br /><br /> Leaving aside this nice factor, the film is a brilliant full circle And the evolution of the saga. After the conclusion of &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) follows his friends from the Rebel Alliance to Tatooine, his home planet, to rescue Han Solo (Harrison Ford), the space pirate turned rebel hero that he was captured by Jabba the Hutt for past due debts. <br /><br /> Skywalker is a man changed since he left Tatooine with Ben &#39;Obi Wan&#39; Kenobi (Alec Guiness) to fight the evil Empire. Now wrapped in black, Lucas&#39; discovery of his origins has left him confused and torn. Its psychological composition is not as strong as its external appearance suggests. While he may aspire to always help his Rebel friends, he longs to have another chance to face the evil Darth Vader again, despite not being sure if he will destroy him or eventually turn to the Dark Side and join Vader next to the Emperor. <br /><br /> The first scenes on Tatooine are impressive, from Jabba&#39;s lair, to his floating palace and the &quot;almighty Sarlac,&quot; a work of art that lives in the sand. Lucas&#39;s CGI enhancements to the film in 1997 actually worsened Sarlac&#39;s overall effect, making it look fake and exaggerated. <br /><br /> The battle scene on Tatooine is exceptional, and is one of the most memorable in the series. Luke almost singlehandedly annihilates Jabba and his friends, which shows that his skill as a Jedi is almost complete. <br /><br /> When Luke returns to the Degobah system to visit Yoda sick one more time, the viewer is discouraged by Yoda&#39;s clear lack of screen time. Undoubtedly, the star of &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, Yoda is almost erased from the story as the progression of Luke&#39;s fate is played on the screen. <br /><br /> ROTJ really is Luke&#39;s movie, maybe even more than the original. His journey takes the film as he approaches his confrontation with Darth Vader and his destiny. The other rebellious characters certainly work in its shadow. The romance between Leia (Carrie Fisher) and Solo is almost nonexistent, unlike &quot;Empire.&quot; In fact, only the character of Leia develops in ROTJ, the character of Solo seems to fade away as the facets of his personality have become too familiar in the first two films. <br /><br /> Their roles are assigned to work with the rebels to destroy a completely new Death Star that is nearing its end. This time, the Emperor himself is overseeing the final stages of construction. The Empire intends to crush the Rebellion once and for all, while the Emperor himself plans to bring the now powerful Skywalker to his side to work alongside (or does that replace?) Darth Vader. The Emperor is a different kind of evil for this film, less cunning than Governor Tarkin (Peter Cushing) of &quot;Star Wars&quot;, more deeply psychologically dark than anything else. Played brilliantly by Ian McDiarmid, the Emperor is just one of those characters that you love to hate. <br /><br /> All the other actors are well rooted in their roles. Hamill surprises the wiser Luke, making the progression of his character from a weeping teenager, impatient student to enlightened warrior, one of the few developments of real characters in the series. The role of Ford is weakening, since all its charm and charisma were spent on the first two films: after all, it was the true star of the first film. Fisher&#39;s Leia is more of a support, at least until the end of the movie where she learns things about herself that she was never sure ... Add in favorites like Alec Guiness as Kenobi, Yoda and the adorable Chewbacca, C-3PO and R2D2 and the series are more like a family than a cast. <br /><br /> Despite the hard battle of the film involving the Ewoks and the Empire, it ends well and includes a three-way battle sequence: in Endor, in space and in the Death Star, each with very special effects. impressive The music, as always, is brilliant and captures the mood perfectly in each case. Just as the &#39;Blue Danube&#39; worked perfectly in &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, John Williams&#39; score is as much a part of the folklore of &quot;Star Wars&quot; as lightsabers and Force. <br /><br /> Lucas left the ending open to interpretation, which means there could have been more episodes done. In fact, science fiction fans have created their own versions of Episodes VII, VIII and IX in their heads over and over again. ROTJ works when given a chance, and cute furry animals aside is a good ending to the series. <br /><br /> When the six episodes are seen together, this saga could be the best that has been done. It is done? The addition of Episode I changed the panorama of the series. This is the reason why &quot;The Return of the Jedi&quot; can now be seen in a different light and can be given a new appreciation almost 20 years after its release.']
