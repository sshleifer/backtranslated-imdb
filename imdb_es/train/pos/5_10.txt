I entered the middle of this movie, so I had no idea of ​​any credit or its title until I looked it up here, where I see that it has received a mixed reception from its commentators. I'm on the positive side about this movie, but one thing really caught my eye when I saw it: the beautiful and sensitive score written in a Coplan American style. My surprise was great when I discovered that the score had been written by John Williams himself. It is true that he has written sensitive and moving scores, such as Schindler's List, but one often associates his name with bursts of stars like Star Wars. But in my opinion, what Williams has written for this film surpasses everything I've heard from him for his tenderness, sensitivity and beauty, in keeping with the tender and charming plot of the film. And another recent score of yours, Catch Me if you can, shows even more ingenuity and sophistication. As for Stanley and Iris, I like educational films like How Green was my Valley and Konrack, that one with John Voigt and his young African-American managers in South Carolina, and Renaissance Man, Danny DeVito, etc. They tell a necessary story of intellectuals and spiritual Awakening, a story that can not be told often enough. This is an excellent addition to that genre.
