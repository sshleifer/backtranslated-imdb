This film changed everything for me ... I heard about breakdance and hiphop, but I had never seen it professionally (I was an 11-year-old Dutch boy!) When I saw this movie, everything changed. I became actively involved in the hiphop movement in our city, started dancing and writing lyrics. <br /> <br /> To this day, I still consider that this movie is one of my favorites. Of course, the filming and the "cinematic" importance may not be so important. But who cares if the panning was shot badly or if you could see a microphone hanging over someone? It's what makes you personally what counts ...
