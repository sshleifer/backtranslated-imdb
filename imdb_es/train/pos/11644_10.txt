This show is amazing! I've been a fan since it was released, and it just keeps me watching ... I've seen some terrible things here, that I wish I had not done, BUT, it really shows you how addiction affects everyone involved, not just addicts. You can see all kinds of different addictions, from drugs and alcohol to the shopaholic, or the addict to the eating disorder. And really, it's really sad to see some of the famous faces that have also arrived. We have seen expert musicians, an NBA player, and even young people, who really need help. And since they started showing some follow-ups, that has also been incredible. Now, you can see how they are a long time after your EP was aired. If you have not checked it, please do it. It's in A & E, and it's amazing! The new eps are on Sunday nights at 10 p.m. EST, if I remember correctly ... so set up your TiVo!
