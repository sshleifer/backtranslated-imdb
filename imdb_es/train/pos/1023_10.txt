This show has been my escape from reality for the last ten years. Unfortunately I will miss him. Although Atlantis has filled the hole a bit. <br /> <br /> The last episode of SG1 (on television) was very well done. Robert wrote something that felt close to reality. As if I was trying to explain what it was like on the set of the show. (All those who work closely together for so long are linked to the ups and downs, but over the years they have become a family). I thought this was a wonderful way to end despite the criticism of anyone else. <br /> <br /> SG1 was something special and again and again it took me through thresholds of disbelief and amazement. The wonderful characters, stories, directors, writers. From the first episode I was hooked. The combination of action, science, drama and especially the comedy worked so well that it made me keep wanting more. <br /> <br /> There are no real words to fully express what this program meant to me. I can only thank those who kept the show so fresh and entertaining for so many years. It has inspired me to do many things that I thought were impossible. <br /> <br /> I look forward to the movies next year and I really hope there are several of them. I never want the show to die. <br /> <br /> Stargate SG1 - 1997 - 2007?
