"The Bourne Ultimatum" begins recklessly in the middle of the chase and, in an accelerated fashion, explodes from there when Jason Bourne (Matt Damon, absolutely magnificent) traces the masterminds behind the black operations of the CIA that made him the murderer perfect in a final attempt To know his true identity. David Strathairn, devastatingly frozen as the "man behind the curtain", is added to the cast of regulars, such as Joan Allen (excellent) and Julia Stiles (nonexistent). <br /> <br /> As the second entry in the series, I wished that Paul Greengrass's trembling handheld remained static for at least the few minutes of inactivity. However, that said, it's a perfect way to capture the tense and claustrophobic feel of intimate melee scenes and it works just as well in the chase scenes, which are mostly on foot and on the roofs with the occasional large number of cars -above. Part of the fun of the Bourne series is the constant shifting and manipulation of technology and communications that seem to defy the laws of physics and current capabilities. Bourne's films seem to exist in a kind of hyperreality full of technology-based magic. It does not make sense that everyone seems to be in the right place at the right time, but they will condemn me if it is not wonderful to see them arrive. <br /> <br /> With the absence of the writer Franka Potente, which involves the emotional and involved, tries to create an emotional connection between Damon and Stiles, but is an actress so inexpressive that never leads to anything. Even so, this can be forgiven, since unlike "Identity" and "Supremacy", this "Ultimatum" reveals everything and we finally learn the truth about Bourne's past. It's an entertaining and satisfying conclusion to the series, and if they have a good sense, and Damon gets his wish, this will be the perfect ending.
