This was a great movie, but it had the worst ending, I think I've seen it! The actors were great and showed a wonderful talent. The whole story was twisted and unexpected, which is what made it entertaining. As good as the movie was, the whole movie is judged by the end, it was terrible! Maybe a sequel could eliminate this final evil.
