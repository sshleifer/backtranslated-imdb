This movie was quite a surprise. I did not expect much, to be honest. The first Greta Garbo movie in Hollywood? And that? Probably something harsh and with the usual exaggerated movements and facial contortions that low-grade silent films show so often. <br /> <br /> Well, I was wrong. Greta Garbo must have surprised the studio people as much as I did, because this movie made her a star, and deservedly so. She instinctively understood the power of simply standing still, or simply of maintaining a meaningful expression for a long, long moment so that she could feel its effect and not just see it. I kept thinking, how did this modern actress get into a silent and squeaky movie? He only had years and years ahead of his time. <br /> <br /> The story is not so interesting, it is the usual story of love that is found and lost. It is only the performance of Garbo as Leonora, the poor girl from the village who becomes good in the big city and then returns to get the man who ran away, which gives her life. The co-protagonist Ricardo Cortez is useful, but his character is never really developed and his script degraded him at all times. At a certain moment, he is forced to wear Garbo's clothes, he leaves angry, then he returns in an ignominious way and returns it to him. And let's not even talk about his horrible final scenes with Garbo and then with his wife. Too ordinary, I did not have much career after this and I can understand why. But it is enough as the somewhat disconcerting object of Leonora's obsession. <br /> <br /> There is an absolutely fantastic line in this movie that simply says it all. "Leonora, you are becoming conspicuous." Yes, striking in fact. <br /> <br /> If you really want to know what it is all about without watching the whole movie, just watch the last 30 seconds or so. Garbo's gaze when she is sitting alone in her luxurious car says. all. "She must be so happy, she has everything she wants" - yes, Garbo's face says it all about that. I have to see this again, Garbo is simply amazing.
