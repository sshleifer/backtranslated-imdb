Meryl Streep is a genius. Well, at least as an actress. I know he's made fun of her for playing many accented roles, but she always does. Her performance as Lindy Chamberlain was inspiring. Ms. Chamberlain, as described here, was not particularly pleasant, nor so intelligent. But that only makes Streep's work even more remarkable. I think she has been worth half of the Oscar nominations. About the movie, well, there were a couple of interesting things. I do not know much about Australia, but the issue of religious fanaticism among the general public played an important role in the story. I had largely missed this when I saw the movie for the first time a few years ago, but yesterday it was heard loud and clear. And it seems that the Australian press is as skilled in the pursuit of misery and exaggerated as its American colleagues. A pretty good movie. A little different. Grade B
