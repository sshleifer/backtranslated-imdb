Is awesome! In Story mode, you go from punk to professional. You have to complete goals that involve skating, driving and walking. You create your own skater and give it a name, and it can make it look stupid or realistic. You are with your friend Eric throughout the game until he betrays you and expels you from the skateboarding team (you can choose a team to be) and then you start your own team! There are many levels, like New Jersey, Manhattan and even School II (although it is not part of the story mode) of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2. You can unlock secret skaters like Iron Man, Gene Simmons and another skater. You can create your own objectives like SKATE letters, COMBO letters, Tricktris, Gap and much more. You can create the pedestrian goal and write what they speak. If you get bored of doing that, you can achieve the prefabricated targets in the prefabricated parks. The only thing I did not like about this game was that sometimes it was difficult to drive the cars. 9/10.
