Excellent show Instead of watching the same old comedy shows where it is the same, just different "stars", this refreshing program provided an incredibly entertaining view of the office situations. We have been away from watching any TV for 2 years and, after returning, from all available programs, we hope to see this program in W. Shame in Global to disconnect this. I thought that this would be a winner. Let's be realistic about things, few Canadians show it. Everyone I talk to enjoys this show and I think it was foolish for Global to leave. I guess they want to keep the typical shows of the States instead of being behind a show made in Canada that had many promises. Do not get me wrong, I enjoy many shows on television, but, come on, people, let's keep the variety. This unique show provided a very comical vision of a realistic and slightly exaggerated side of the office's life and relationships, with unique characters that are not seen in any sitcoms today or in the past. Too bad the world has had to say no to this stupid mistake.
