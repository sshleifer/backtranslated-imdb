I could see this movie in its entirety and I was deeply moved. I was not sure if it was really a comedy or a drama, I had elements of both. Mary Tyler Moore and Valerie Harper looked wonderful: our image of 60-year-old women has certainly changed since Aunt Bee! They are vibrant, beautiful, sexy! The only drawback of this movie was that there was no mention of other characters in the "MTM" or "Rhoda" programs of the 1970s. I thought that since I settled in New York City (where I had settled "Rhoda ") she would have mentioned at least her sister Brenda or that Julie Kavner would have appeared, assuming that, of course, she was still in the Big Apple. <br /> <br /> I hope that ABC turns this series into a series and returns for the guest appearances in all the presentations of these shows. By the way, what went wrong with CBS when making this meeting, or a final series? Was not that the network that carried the "MTM" and "Rhoda" programs?
