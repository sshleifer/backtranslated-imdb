Second film by Woody Allen set in London. The Tha Tarot Card killer is killing prostitutes in London. Aspiring journalist Sondra Pransky (Scarlett Johansson) receives a suggestion that he may be Lord Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman). She begins to fall in love with him but quickly falls in love. She was helped by stage magician Sid Waterman (Woody Allen), who does not like what he sees. <br /> <br /> I like this more than last year's "Match Point". It was shorter and moved much faster. The plot is old, but I entertained myself and kept guessing until the end. It's not really a comedy, but a mystery with some very good comedy lines (all of Allen, of course). It's not one of Allen's best, but it's much better than the worst. <br /> <br /> The performance is, for the most part, very good. Allen is bad, but he has played this character a million times before and it has become boring. But Johansson and Jackman are simply great, they look fantastic and offer two incredible and attractive performances. Also Allen (surprisingly) works on his sexual appeal: there is a sequence in which both are in their swimsuits to show off their pretty bodies. The only real debit is that Allen is still not sure how to shoot London. However, it is not as bad as in "Match Point", maybe it will improve as it progresses. <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing. I give it an 8.
