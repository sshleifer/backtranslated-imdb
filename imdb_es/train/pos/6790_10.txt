['This game is one of the best RPGs. Fist: actually it is more fun than any other due to the battle system (damage the enemy depending on how you aim the attack, you can transform into a dragon, the special attack, magic ...). The script is very good. All the characters are charming and you do not have long dialogues to support, as it happened in several games of the Final Fintasy series. I got bored with those dialogues about the past, when you just want to continue with the story of the game. The setting is a jewel in this game, combining the fantasy of the Middle Ages with futuristic science fiction. It&#39;s remarkable that the animation effects are simply amazing, I like them more than others in other modern games (we can not remember that Legend of the Dragoon is 8 years old). So, the map is huge, there are all kinds of places to enemies. Finally, music is not the best muse of games I&#39;ve heard, but it&#39;s perfect for a game like this.']
