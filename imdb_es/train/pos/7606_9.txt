['The first series of Lost began with a bang ... literally and slowly slowed down. This may have discouraged some viewers and people who started looking halfway would get bored or simply confused. <br /><br /> I would recommend to new people in the world of Lost that they simply watch from the beginning and not get away with the slower episodes. The acting in everything is excellent, but why have planned 5 series ... WHY? All this means that there will be no answers for at least 4 years, well, I will continue to observe if it keeps tension and dialogue flowing.']
