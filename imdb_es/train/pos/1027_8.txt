I'm not very good at writing reviews, so I'm just going to express my opinions ... <br /> <br /> At first I loved this series. The adventure, the action, the comedy, the drama ... I thought everything was brilliant. Anderson, tapping, Shanks, judge, Davis ... I loved you all. Davis, apparently, was the fifth most important person in the cast. It is not a great deal. But when his character (General Hammond) left at the end of the seventh season, and the character of Anderson (Colonel O'Neill) moved from the field to the office, the quality of the series suddenly dropped. I do not know if it was because Hammond was more important than I had realized or why, but for some reason, after the seventh season, the series became ****. <br /> <br /> The first seven seasons, however, were impressive. The Stargate movie seemed mediocre the first time I saw it, but it turned out to be, even if this was not the original intention, a brilliant setup for the series. I recommend that you watch the movie first, then the first season of the television series, then see it again (the second time you will fully appreciate it, believe me) and then you will see the rest of the movie. TV series. <br /> <br /> The last three seasons of the series are not as good as the first seven, but that does not mean they are not good. It only means that they are a disappointment if you've been spoiled for the first seven seasons. <br /> <br /> Once you have finished this series, be sure to watch the spin off series, Stargate: Atlantis. It is a worthy successor to this brilliant series. <br /> <br /> EDIT 7-18-08: I just found out that Don S. Davis died a few weeks ago. Its a big lost.
