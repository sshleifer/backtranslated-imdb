In 1985 (year of my birth), Steven Spielberg directed an emotionally strong and unforgettable story of a young African-American Celie (Debut role for Whoopi Goldberg) whose life is followed in difficult times. The story begins in 1909 when Celie is only 14 years old. She has given birth to two children for her father. Celie has a younger sister, Nettie, with whom she is inseparable. A widower puts his eyes on Nettie, but his father hands her Celie. It is the beginning of an era of horrible abuse and constant control. Women are inferior to men and especially being African-American women, their rights are less than zero. The story of Celie is a true story of survival. <br /> <br /> "The Color Purple" is a masterpiece and an underestimated film by Spielberg. I should do more drama in which "The Color Purple" and "Schindler's List" are a good idea. <br /> <br /> The cast is incredible. Whoopi Goldberg is best known as an incredibly funny comedian, but the introductory role of Celie is a remarkable word that can really draw from the drama. Danny Glover was surprisingly unpleasant "Mister". I've never seen him in such an evil role. The talk show icon Oprah Winfrey is brilliant as a strong-willed Sofia. <br /> <br /> Warning! Get ready to carry a lot of tissues when you see this movie. You can really connect with the history of strong brotherhood. Especially if you have a close relationship with your brothers like the one I have with my sister. <br /> <br /> Great applause for Mr. Spielberg!
