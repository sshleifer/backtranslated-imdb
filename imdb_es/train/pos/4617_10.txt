I've been a fan of Jennifer Connelly since Phenomena, and after listening for about seven minutes in the sky, I saw it as soon as I could. The film is not just a comedy if you think that many of these things that most of us spent as children and that are currently happening was not only a fantastic movie directed by the phenomenal Jennifer Connelly, but it also captivated my attention about the fact that this movie was written in a spectacular way. and acted it was a good offer, I loved it and I've seen it again and again, and for those of you who enjoy a good laugh or love Jennifer Jenny, you can not postpone the opportunity to watch this movie.
