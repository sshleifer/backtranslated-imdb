As a fan of Paris Je'Taime, I went to see New York, I Love You with very high expectations. With pleasure I left with all my expectations fulfilled. It was fun, sweet, fast and entertaining. The movie starts with two taxis (Bradley Cooper and Justin Bartha) trying to get to the same area, but discussing which way to go. That was fun, and then the film presents some of the best skits I've seen in my life. There were four amazing of all the good ones. Of those four I'm going to start talking. A show to Shia LaBeouf as a bellhop in a hotel that finds love in an old woman. The following shows Orlando Bloom as a music creator who is doing business with a woman played by Christina Ricci. Another shows Anton Yelchin and Olivia Thirbly as two people going to the graduation party, and Thirbly's character is incapacitated. The best has Eli Wallach and Cloris Leachman as an elderly couple. I will call attention to the fact that Nataile Portman makes an impressive directorial debut, and writes a sketch about a caregiver, and Ethan Hawke and Maggie Q are excellent as a flirting man and a prostitute. New York, I Love You is definitely as good, if not better than the 2006 Je'Taime of Paris. The parodies are of good rhythm and the film shows how independent films should really be. The film, however, does not have as many famous directors as Paris Je'Taime, so it was fantastic to live up to its excellence. If you want to laugh, see some dramatic effects, watch a lot of great performances and just entertain you definitely go see New York, I love you.
