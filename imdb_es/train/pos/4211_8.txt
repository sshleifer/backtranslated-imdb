I saw it last night on television (HBO). I must admit that the tension in this film was not overcome by most of the other films of the FN era. I loved the way that Chip would be all calm in a moment and then VIOLENT the next moment. It was classic. Ahh yes The ladies, the villains, the cigars and the police thugs! Has it all. This movie gave me all the goods. I especially loved the way they mixed communism with the plot, very common in this era of the film. Very daring also since the black lists were popular in those days. I rate this movie as one of the best I've seen in the FN genre.
