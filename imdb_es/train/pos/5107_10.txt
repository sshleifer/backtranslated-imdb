What an overlooked soundtrack. I imagine that John Travolta sang some of the songs, but when he saw the film he seemed to embody everything that was 80's cheese. Clearly, films based on mechanical bulls, waiters and immature relationships were in fashion. The best was his bad Texas accent. Compare it with Friday Night Lights. I suggest watching Cocktail and Stir Crazy to really start getting into the numbness of the movie. Also, as a side note Made in America with Ted Danson and Whoopie Goldberg is an incredibly bad movie. I was so surprised to realize that I had never seen her. A more bizarre film of this genre would have to include Cadillac Man with Robin Williams. Just remember that all these BIG stars played a big role in these CHEESY movies. Tom Cruise, Richard Pryor, Robin Williams and John Travolta
