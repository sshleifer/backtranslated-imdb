Seeing "Moonstruck" after so many years is a reminder of how sweet and sensationally funny this movie was when it first appeared. Who knew that Cher could act? Who had heard of Olympia Dukakis? Nicholas Cage was the beginning of his career, and Vincent Gardenia and Danny Aiello were not known for their comedic talent, nor was Norman Jewison the director. <br /> <br /> The only really flat note in this splendid work is "When The Moon Hits Your Eye Like a Big Pizza Pie, that's Amore," a song that is sung too many times in the movie (once it's too much) and that he had a long life after death in popular music. <br /> <br /> Cher is, forgive me, sensational as Loretta Castorini, a widow who wants to get married and does not have to be in love with the groom. Aielo (Johny Cammareri) agrees to propose it, offering her pinky ring as a substitute for an engagement ring, then hurries to Sicily to be with her dying mother. She accuses Loretta of making sure her brother, Ronny, attends the wedding. Loretta confronts Ronny and quickly falls in love with him. Meanwhile, his father (Vincent Gardenia) is cheating on his mother (Olympia Dukakis), which Loretta accidentally discovers when Ronny invites her to the Metropolitan Opera. <br /> <br /> Everything works in the end, as is inevitable. In films of this genre. Meanwhile, all the actors behave admirably and the audience has fun. In its own way, "Moonstruck" is the way Hollywood used to be at its best: entertaining entertainment with no social meaning at all. If only they had lost "Amore" on the road, it would have been perfect.
