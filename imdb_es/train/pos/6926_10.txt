The narrative affirms the classical image of good versus evil in the form of a brother-against-brother struggle. The main character, Lin Macadam, played by James Stewart, represents justice and righteousness. His brother, who operates under the personality of Dutchman Henry Brown, played by Stephen McNally, represents the classic stage coach who steals the Western outlaw, pursued by his brother for killing his father. The world in which the story unfolds is the classic dystopian west, where the only way to prevent its inhabitants from killing each other is to take their arms off as soon as they enter the city, and the man responsible for maintaining this law and the order is the western classic. the lawyer Wyat Earp. <br /> <br /> Also present are such flat characters typical of the West, such as the murderous Indian warrior, the beleaguered cavalry soldier and the damsel dressed in a distressed cap. <br /> <br /> Another important archetype in this film, which gives the film its name, is a custom-made Winchester rifle. The weapon can be seen as an allegory of the rewards given to those who do things with honor. Once it is stolen from its rightful owner, it brings tragedy to everyone who comes into contact with it. In this sense, it resembles other icons such as the holy grail in Raiders of the Lost Ark, and the bloodstained lyrics in Saving Private Ryan. This gives the film an element of surrealism that is generally absent in westerns, a genre not known for esoteric themes and symbols. <br /> <br /> Being essentially a revenge movie, it shares this element with many other examples of the genre, such as Jack Arnold's No Name on the Bullet, and Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven. <br /> <br /> There is also a tacit rape issue at Winchester '73. Waco Johnny Dean, one of the villains of the film played very effectively by Dan Duryea, kidnaps a woman after killing her husband. The volatile cowboy plays with the tender husband, and dismisses it as a caricature of a cat playing with an insect before tearing off its head. Waco Johnny Dean finally gets what he gets after coming into contact with the sinister Winchester rifle. <br /> <br /> The main story of Winchester '73 recalls Jason's mythological story and his search for the golden hair, as told in Apollonius's Argonautica. Both stories are about the acquisition of a sacred object that has some kind of intangible quality. Like Jason, Stewart's character jumps from one adventure to the next in search of a unique prize. Another theme in Winchester '73 that is similar to a mythical story is the struggle between brothers. Several stories of antiquity deal with this subject, such as the account of the Hebrew Bible about Cain and Abel, and the vulgar story of Romulus and Remus. <br /> <br /> Regarding the topic of kidnapping and rape present in Anthony Mann's film, it is present in many mythological works, such as the rape of Europe told by Ovid in his Metamorphoses. <br /> <br /> Winchester '73 is a good example of the Western genre, and acts as the correlative objective of many ancient Western American and mythological classic themes.
