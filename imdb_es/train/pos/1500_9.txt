Nowadays, most people do not watch classic movies, like this one. Most friends only watch movies from the 90s to the present. That is a bit stingy. <br /> <br /> Most old movies like this one are masterpieces, unique in their own way. Just because, when these films were thought and made, that was when the ideas were fresh. Now people try to think of new ideas. <br /> <br /> Anyway, to the movie. For true fans of classic horror. This is for you. The film is based on a researcher from Scotland Yard who investigates the disappearance of a film actor, and runs into three other strange occurrences with residents of the past in the same house. <br /> <br /> I will not say it anymore, because I will ruin the movie more than I have already done. But it's a great movie, as old as it is. And I would not mind seeing it again!
