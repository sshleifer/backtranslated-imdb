I have never seen many movies online in most of my life, but if I chose any of them, I would choose Spatula Madness, an intelligent reference to most movies like Star Trooper (etc.), using a camera, and Ingenio de Steel, Jason Steele mastered the art of turning a normal image into a painting, and then unite everything with frame-by-frame animation to get a world inhabited by spatulas. The story begins in the middle, how do the directors love it? then, half is at the beginning, and so on, when I saw her for the first time, I expected a bold look, but Jason, like me, loves, so I took every detail to the fullest. although I do not recommend it for children, or anyone else I would like, but, please, look it up on the net (it's a short film, look for a movie), its style reminds me of South Park, but less violent. 10 for the appearance, 6 for the laughs and 6 for the story, it's all about 10/10, good work. <br /> <br /> Jason Steele, I'm looking forward to seeing the movie.
