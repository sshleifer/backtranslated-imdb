The story of the FBI, told from Agent Stewart's point of view through flashbacks, interwoven with his personal life story. Stewart and Miles (as his wife) are pretty good, as is Hamilton as a serious agent. The problem is that the episodic nature of the story makes it difficult to get involved. It's like seeing fragments of a dozen different movies when we glimpse a who's who of the mobsters. Some of the episodes are too long, others too short, and some simply look out of place (school sequence by Stewart's daughter). In general, it goes too long. However, it is worth looking at its attractive production values.
