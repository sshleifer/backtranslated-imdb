If you are investigating facts about UFOs, then this video is very important. The 'meat' of the video are the comments made by Buzz Aldrin. It is without a doubt the best of America. Trained to be objective, honest and objective in your reports. Many American astronauts of all ages have reported some type of contact, or UFO observance, and there are videos of some of those missions. At a minimum, something has happened that requires a greater research objective in progress. I believe that this testimony of Buzz Aldrin shows that it is possible that other worlds are interested in our progress. Like all supposed video documentary, this may be inclined, but contains more information and opinions of an accomplished American hero. These do not come every day. Therefore, the fact that some people are not interested in the details should not deviate from the viewing of this video. If nothing else, it's interesting and I recommend you look with an open mind.
