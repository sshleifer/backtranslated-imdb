This movie is really FUN! If you want to rest your brain for an hour, then go see it. It's called blonde and wonder, so do not expect deep and meaningful jokes. What this movie and enjoy all the stereotypes we have about two blondes. It's just a fun movie to see on a date or with a company of friends (especially if you're not too sober.) Lol) Pamela and Denise are still very good girls. It is a mistake to judge this film as a work of art. Come on, this movie is about BLONDES! It is supposed to be light, fun and superficial. One more thing, I do not think girls appreciate and like this movie, but the boy will definitely do it.
