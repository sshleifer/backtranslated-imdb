My comment is usually limited to the first season, 1959-60. <br /> <br /> This magnificent series was one of the first televised in color, and was very influential in persuading Americans that they had to buy a color TV, which was approximately $ 800 in 1959, the equivalent to more than $ 3,000 at present. How many of us would pay so much for the privilege of watching a program transmitted by a cathode ray tube on a 17-inch screen? I was eleven years old when the series began, and I saw it from the beginning. <br /> <br /> When I see it now, 50 years later, several things come to my mind. First, many of the story lines involve the Comstock Lode and the heyday of silver mining, dating back to 1859. By 1859, weapons and clothing are not, for the most part, authentic. (The haircuts are out of the discussion). That is basically a problem. <br /> <br /> And, for Ben it would have been impossible to have reached the Lake Tahoe area in 1839 and to have accumulated 100%. Square mile ranch in the next twenty years. The pioneers were still trying to solve the Sierra Nevada problem in 1847, and the Gold Rush did not begin until two years later. <br /> <br /> The Indians are not played by Native American actors. John Ford was using Native American actors in the 1920s. The producers of Bonanza could easily have done it thirty years later. That is a big problem for me. <br /> <br /> There are other timeline issues. In season 1, Mark Twain appears, and he is represented as a middle-aged man. Mark Twain was 24 years old in 1859. The stories also vacillate between 1859-1860 (before the Civil War) and what was most suitable for a time frame of 1880. There are continuity problems, again and again. <br /> <br /> It is also a bit unpleasant that there are so many murders in the first season. Over time, the killing was reduced. <br /> <br /> Many of the episodes adopt a socially liberal attitude, which would be hard to believe, given the timeline, but they give credit to writers for anticipating seismic changes in the attitudes of the Nation to Having said all that, the acting is good, and in my last years I came to the conclusion that Adam's character was better than anyone else's. I do not think Pernell Roberts received the credit he deserved. In addition, season 1 reinforces the fact that Dan Blocker (Hoss) was a good actor. <br /> <br /> Many of the stories trace real historical events. The guest stars were interesting. <br /> <br /> This was a great family entertainment, and the series stands out very well in any measure.
