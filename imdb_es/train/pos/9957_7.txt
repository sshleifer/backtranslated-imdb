This movie is surprisingly underestimated in IMDb. Like so many movies, this is not Shawshank. But it's a reasonably good, if predictable, dance / personal growth movie. If you want to spend an hour and a half watching a kind of 8 miles per dancer, I think you'll like it. <br /> <br /> Judging by the ratings of IMDb, I guess this The film was approaching the top 250, and it was "bombarded with many", as is the case with many movies that are not about the mafia, have no effects specials or include characters that are not white or not straight. <br /> <br /> It's an American movie, but it's not an American movie. Located mainly in Toronto, the signs are subtle, and some audiences may think that it is completely set in the United States just because the final competition is in the border city of Detroit. <br /> <br /> I liked the music. I liked the dance (but I'm not convinced it's worth $ 50,000 ... but what do I know)? The characters were easy for the eyes. <br /> <br /> I agree that the title stinks. I do not remember anyone in the movie saying those words, and I should have an "s". (No, it is not a foreign language). <br /> <br /> There is not much to hate for this movie (and, to be honest, a vote of 1 means you hated it), so I can only assume that it is a hate expression for the kind of people who There is in him, and that is sad.
