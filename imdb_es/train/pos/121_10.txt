Critics need to review what they classify as a quality film. I think critics have seen too many action movies and have succumbed to the matrix style of the movies. Europe is a breath of fresh air, a film with so many layers that a single vision is not enough to understand or appreciate this exceptional film. Lars von Trier shows that old film styles can produce a wonderful cinema and create drama and tension. The backward projection effect that you use during the movie awakens and enhances the characters, and the focus of the conversation they are having. Other effects he uses, such as color and black and white in a scene, such as Hitchcock and the girl in the red coat, draw attention and enhance the drama and meaning of the scene. The commentary is excellent and has a hypnotic effect, again maintaining the focus on the central characters of the scene and their actions. <br /> <br /> I could talk about the effects more, but I think everyone would agree that they push this. film in a category of its own, and really enhance the drama of the film. A movie to buy if you still do not have it and another to see if you do not have one. <br /> <br /> 10/10 Do not miss this artistic film by one of the great film directors.
