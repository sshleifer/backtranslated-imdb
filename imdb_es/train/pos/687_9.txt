['This is a very entertaining film, considering the budget and its duration. The story is almost never played in the world of cinema, so it also brought a sense of novelty. The performance was excellent (P&#39;z to Dom) and the cinematography was also very well done. I recommend this movie for anyone who is interested in thrillers, you will not be disappointed!']
