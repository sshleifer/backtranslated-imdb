I just watched this movie on DVD and I thought the performance was very good, but the general story left a lot to be desired. This movie has the same texture and appearance as Panic in Needle Park or Drugstore Cowboy. It is hard to believe that human beings can live this kind of lifestyle; in the most vulnerable part of society, in which its total existence is based on the use of serious drugs, crime, violence, sex and a total lack of self-esteem by any person or thing, including themselves. <br /> <br /> Val Kilmore is outstanding in her role as the former "burned" porn star John Holmes. The cast is equally good. However, this is a dark, dark, disturbing and depressing movie. The murder was brutal, but the daily life of these people was also brutal. Unless you have an interest in these murders or were a "fanatic" of John Holmes, this really is not a movie to watch. If you want to see a documentary about the murder, In Cold Blood, by Truman Capote, starring Scott Wilson and Robert Blake, it's much better.
