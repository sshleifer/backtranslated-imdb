I have not seen this movie! At least not in its entirety. I have seen some disturbing clips that have left me gagged to see everything. A sequence remains in my memory until today. A spaceship (very convincing looking) is orbiting the dark side of the moon. The pilot launches a flash device to photograph the surface hidden beneath it. The moon flashes in visibility. . . . And for a few seconds there it is. Parallel lines, squares, could be ... then the light fades and the brief flash of ... what ... is gone and it's time for the spacecraft to return to Earth. Wonderful. I have also seen some other clips, but I would LOVE to get the full movie.
