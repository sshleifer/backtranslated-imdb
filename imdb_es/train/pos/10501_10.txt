Super Mario 64 is, without doubt, the best game ever created. It is so addictive that you can play for hours and hours without stopping for a break. I won the game 4 times, but I never got the 120 stars ... (I got 111) ... but I hope to achieve them eventually. Although I did not officially play this game until I turned seven, I loved watching my sisters play it. Now I'm 13 and I'm still playing this, erasing games and starting over. <br /> <br /> The graphics are incredible for an early N64 game. The gameplay is addictive. The controls are great. The levels are hard, but not impossible. Bowser's fights are challenging. <br /> <br /> I'd like to tell you more, but why do not you get it just for you? Save the X-BOX 360, the PS3 and the Wii and go find a Nintendo 64 and play this amazing and wonderful game.
