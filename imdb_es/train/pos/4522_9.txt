This took me by surprise because Adri√°n Pasdar had often disappointed me in the past, but he found the perfect balance in this performance, avoiding both farce and pathos while offering humor and real emotions. The always wonderful Julie Waters is great here, and anyone who has not seen her in Educating Rita in 1983 should rent it immediately (wonderful movie). The rest of the supporting characters are also well-interpreted, many wonderfully eccentric without overstepping. This is fun
