This movie consists of a great emotion, especially with its exceptional soundtrack that matches the film. Tom Cruise is one of my favorite actors because of his enthusiasm for making movies and entertaining. This movie was not the best the first time I saw it, but after about 3 times more, I decided that this is one of the best movies I've seen in my life. It takes place in New York and progresses through your lifestyle. Discover a delimma in his life with his girlfriend (Diaz). He goes through a state of depression and then a mixture of outgoing imagination. This movie exceeded my expectations and is one of the best Cruise movies!
