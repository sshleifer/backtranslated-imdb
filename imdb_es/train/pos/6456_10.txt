My expectations were quite high for this movie. Everyone I know who saw this movie at the cinema told me that everyone was left with the credits because they were very excited. My expectations could not have been higher, anything less wonderful would have disappointed me. <br /> <br /> This movie has disappointed me. I loved how he tackled difficult issues without going through the usual steps that usually include a Hollywood movie. In this film, the characters worked through the problems they had had for decades, worked through prejudice, learned to open up. But it was not easy, and not just singing a song or two. It was painful, he took arguments, he took confrontations. I felt like in real life. <br /> <br /> A scene that really stuck with me was the scene in which Gabriella sings her song. Helen Sj√∂holm is one of my favorite singers, her voice is charming and it could be said that she was not only synchronizing her lips with a previous recording during filming (which I often find in other films), she really sang with all her body and soul. You could feel what Gabriella was feeling in that scene. If this movie had been made in Hollywood, her song would have probably been sung towards the end, and she would have made her husband open his eyes and see the error of his ways, as well as make the other people in the village aware of something. . or two. Instead, it reached the middle and did not provide any solution. Her husband did not feel overwhelmed and realized what he was doing, and that did not seem to make anyone else in the village more open-minded. He was beautiful, he was pure and he was touching, but he did not magically solve all his problems. That seemed real to me, that's probably what would have happened in real life. The whole movie felt like a real life to me, nothing well wrapped, but all with a sense of joy and happiness. Rarely do you find a movie that seems so realistic. <br /> <br /> There were some things that bothered me, but well, no film is perfect. If you have not already done so, you should go to see "As is in heaven" and feel full of joy for life, the feeling of hope and the feeling that you have been touched on a level that movies rarely reach. You will be sad, sore, happy and with a dozen other emotions. <br /> <br /> Someone once said that if all the people of the world sang in a chorus there would be no more wars. Having seen this movie I might have to agree.
