... in our house. Like everyone else who has commented on this movie, my brothers (7 and 4 years old at the time) and I (10) watched this movie over and over again. We all loved Star Wars, but we always came back to this because of the great songs and the adventure. We all love the camel and we sing with him during the song. There are some slow moments (the time we spent with King Koo-Koo in his court) and we usually get bored after The Knight song ("The reason why I {the sound effect} is because I love you"), but we loved the trip. to rescue Babbette and in the end, and everyone was a little scared by the image of King Koo-Koo floating there dominating the entire horizon, laughing like a maniac at the end. Still today I sing "Hurray for me! Babbette of gay Paris!" around my friends (now I am 33) who only look at me as if I had lost my mind; However, when I sing it, I am 10 years old again, remembering the wonderful year of Star Wars.
