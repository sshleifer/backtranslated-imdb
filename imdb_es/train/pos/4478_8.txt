['In general, this is a lovely, happy, romantic musical comedy. I guess you could make a small case so that the film is too long. But I&#39;m not sure what you would cut. The singing that Kelly and Sinatra do? No. The fabulous dance that Kelly does? No. How long does the movie take to develop the story line and develop the relationships of the characters? No (that seems to be a common complaint many times that the most recent films do not develop the characters). <br /><br /> Some comment that Iturbi did not contribute much to the film, but this gives us the opportunity to see and listen to a great talent of the 1040s. And what if he was not an actor? He was an important part of the film since the basic plot was to get Grayson an audition with him. <br /><br /> Originally, Katherine Grayson wanted to be an opera star. Louis B. Mayer took her to MGM for a screen test that included an aria. During his audition in the movie, there is a picture of MGM brass nodding and smiling. You can imagine what it was like when she had done her real screen test years before. <br /><br /> This movie is so full of life that it is difficult to reach all the highlights. Great use was made of color and lighting throughout the film. You can see why Frank Sinatra became the star he made. A good point of counterattack in the film is how Sinatra (a man of ladies even then) played the role of wanting to find an appointment while on leave. You will feel good after watching this movie. 7/10']
