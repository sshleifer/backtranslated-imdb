This impossible story is that of a witch chasing a mortal man in a mortal world. His "community" is open among its members, but conceals his witchcraft to mortals. Hmmmm ... this is starting to sound familiar. Hahaha It's not your typical movie. The very "campy" performances of Jack Lemmon and Ernie Kovacs prevent things from becoming boring. Kim Novak is always a pleasure on the screen, but it seemed to me that her partner with James Stewart was unusual (but not fatal to the story). <br /> <br /> With a renewed interest in all the witches and dark things, this film deserves to be discovered and rediscovered by old and new audiences ... IT'S STILL A YEAR!
