Hypnotizing, impressive and horrifying, this fascinatingly beautiful film is the "Apocalypse now" without fiction. Slow in its rhythm, calm in its state of mind, it gives a good look at the poisoned patches of Earth that may well be signs of an inevitable fate. <br /> <br /> There is no doubt in my mind: nature is plagued and we are the disease. Greed, the very essence of humanity that drives evolution and progress, has turned us into something like cancer, on its way to consume the guest and die with him ... <br /> <br /> Man-made landscapes are an unforgettable sight experience - at least I will never again consider my toaster and iron in the same way.
