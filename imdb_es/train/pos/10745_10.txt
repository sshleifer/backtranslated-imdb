Let me get the bad out of the way first, James Hanlon is absolutely terrible at trying to interpret what was happening with the rookie training and the events of the day. It really is in a clear contract with the other firefighters without acting aspirations that are natural in their delivery. <br /> <br /> That said, it's an incredible movie that is impossible to see without tears in my eyes. I am an English boy from London, but I love New York and have visited many times before and after September 11th. It is a second home for me and I can not help feeling devastated by the loss of life, but also the destruction of part of a city so beautiful and amazing. This is the real deal, in the firefighters with everything collapsed around them. I am very happy that there is a recording that shows people what that day was like. It is a pity that they did not use images of people jumping from the buildings because the friends who were there tell me that this is a very important part of their memory, which should be included to show future generations how terrible it really was. <br /> <br /> Conspiracy theorists can go to hell by the way.
