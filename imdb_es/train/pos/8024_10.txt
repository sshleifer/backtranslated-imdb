When I saw this movie for the first time in the 1980s, I was in my mid teens and somewhat reluctant to see it, as I considered myself to have grown up and come out of the "Sesame Street / Muppets" era. Honestly I do not remember if I liked it at that moment or not. However, somewhere in the university I went back to see this movie, and ended up going (and staying) in my personal collection of Best Films Ever. <br /> <br /> This movie is LOADED with humor that goes far beyond what one would have expected from the Muppets. I mean, obviously, the Muppets have always attracted adults and children because there is a humor oriented towards both generations. But come on ... Janice is accidentally heard telling someone "I do not take my clothes off to anyone, even if it's artistic" ... there's a joke from a father to a son that says if the son in love with Kermit the frog, then the father does not want to listen to him ... Gonzo saves a hen with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation (sp?) and then says "I think we are engaged now" ... these and many other moments in the film had me rolling. Add to that very clever dialogue, the wink-wink humor from New York / Broadway very smart, the usual large number of famous cameos and some really nice songs that are not limited to "cheesy at the child level" at all ... this movie is a masterpiece! I do not throw "10" on a regular basis ... but this one deserves it. More than 20 years later, this film is fully supported, perhaps even more. The Muppets never were and never will be again, as funny and intelligent and simply brilliant as it was and it is this movie. --- Q
