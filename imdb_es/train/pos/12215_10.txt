I loved this movie from the opening sequence to the end. The director / actor's style of addressing me directly to the audience was very attractive. <br /> <br /> What I found most exciting and refreshing about this film was his ignorance, and therefore a challenge, of gender and class stereotypes. . The idiosyncrasies of the characters are represented as strengths, and the absence of judgment (and the acceptance of the characters of themselves and others) allowed me to embrace them and allow me to be dragged into their world. Without preaching, and with intelligence and soft and loving humor, this film has the power to open us to new possibilities and offers hope for a world in which people see and accept themselves as unique and precious individuals. I look forward to more offers from this creative and talented director.
