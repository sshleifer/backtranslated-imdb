Really ... and an incredible movie that, although it is not very popular ... extremely moving and that almost changed the life ... at least it was for me. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing and buying ... Added to my list of favorite movies ... now it's number one ... <br /> <br /> This is a very moving movie that all people should see ... <br /> <br /> The Man in the moon ..... let's go it's just incredible Now it's my favorite movie and I only saw it today and I would recommend it to anyone over 15 years, as long as you're a bit mature ... If you really do not try to feel the emotions of the characters, then 'I'll never get the true meaning and value of this movie ... But it's really amazing ... just look at it because it will change the way some people see life ... it's worth seeing 5/5
