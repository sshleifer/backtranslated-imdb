<br /> <br /> If you like rap or hip-hop, watch this movie, although it's funny if you do not get the references, like a direct comedy. <br /> <br /> I have not seen much of the highly touted CB4, but what I saw did not have the heart that this little Stormer has. <br /> <br /> I have not heard from the people involved since then, which is a surprise. The movie is very similar to Spinal Tap, which is not bad, and I think a lot of the dialogue, although priceless on Tap, is more fun here, probably because I like rap more than rock these days, so My own trial does. The cloud of that point. <br /> <br /> The rap songs are fun, and it's basically the reference for most of the movie, not all of them are on your face, which means physical comedy and the one-line ones have priority about the takeoffs. <br /> <br /> Very funny, one to see twice if there ever was a movie.
