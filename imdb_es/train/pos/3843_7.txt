The first time I saw this film in the theater at a foreign film festival, I thought it was intriguing, fascinating, the sensitive bi-sexual artist. Very European, very Dutch! I recently rented it for a second visit and I could barely avoid laughing at that overloaded issue of the crazy writer's work with a persecution complex of religious sexual orientation. Hold on! This guy is a free player, who lives in society. I suspect that the real reason she is having these fantasy nightmares about the "spider woman" is that her guilt complex is being activated after a year of ignoring the mother's advice about getting into a car (and lying down) With strangers! Not only are you making scandalous sums of (probably without taxes) booty to invent stories (trip of lying guilt) but it's too cheap to pay for a haircut, therefore, treat the owner of the beauty salon. Then he has the nerve to complain about the account! But I also suspect that the world has changed a lot since this movie was made. On a serious note, it was entertaining to see Jan de Bont's camera work and one of Paul Verhoeven's previous films. Hmmm, maybe the world has not changed much after all?
