This movie has Wild Bill Hickok, Calamity Jane, Buffalo Bill and General Custer all together. Gary Cooper plays Wild Bill and Jean Arthur plays Calamity Jane and Charles Bickford plays the bad guy who sells guns to the Indians and you can barely recognize him. This was the first time that Cecil B. DeMille and Gary Cooper worked together and the next movie that was made was basically the same, but set at a different time. This movie begins with the murder of Lincoln and also deals with an Indian war. Calamity Jane is in love with Wild Bill and Buffalo Bill has been married and now wants to stay at home. This film is also about the latest version of Custer and is far from accurate. Gary Cooper is as good as ever and I do not usually like Jean Arthur, but I liked her here.
