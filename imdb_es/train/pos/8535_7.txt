This work is a bold look at the mentality of men who are in wheelchairs. This film never tries to soften it, cotton candy or soft soap, anguish, confusion and pain of what these guys live. I think that is his strength. <br /> <br /> But even more, the performances are fantastic, with dialogues well conceived and delivered, that attract you and make you feel part of the experience. The characters never try to block the audience so they do not know what they think, what is in their hearts. <br /> <br /> I found it heavy, but nice. <br /> <br /> Rate at 6.6 / 10 of ... <br /> <br /> the Devil :.
