This movie was one of the most fun I've seen in years and the laughter of the audience support me. Not since My Big Fat Greek Wedding (2002) has laughter been so spontaneous and intense. Easily intricate as Mr. and Mrs. Smith (2005) last year in the use of parody (espionage in Mr. and Mrs. Smith and sex in My Super Ex-Girlfriend). Ivan Reitman's balance between comedy and drama, between the crazy and the absolutely ridiculous is great. Never the commotion and the dramatic gravity break the comedy rule. At the same time, this predictable romantic comedy never loses its poignant emotional elements, even if the ending is conveyed in advance. In a way, it's so obvious that it's great to see how it develops. As in real life, sometimes the truth is so obvious that one can not really see it. Easily, eight out of ten stars are located up there with Tootsie (1982). Possibly a nine (depends on how it appears in a second visualization).
