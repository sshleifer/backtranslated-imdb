['This was a very stimulating movie, especially for 1973. At that time it was a great blockbuster. After the 1970s, it seemed to have been forgotten, but its central messages were too important to disappear completely. In fact, at least fifteen years before his time ... no one had heard of the &quot;greenhouse effect&quot; before 1985, and the controversial issue of euthanasia was rarely mentioned. <br /><br /> The sets and special effects may seem a little outdated, but a lot of money for science fiction movies was a bet in that period. If you look closely, you&#39;ll see that everything usually makes sense. This is a message movie, not for Star Wars fans who can not go through a minute of mental stimulation unless it contains a million dollars in explosions. <br /><br /> This was also the last good movie of Hestons, the end of his famous dystopian science fiction trilogy. After that, everything was an epic of exaggerated disasters and a great multitude of big budgets that pleased the garbage. This may not be the funniest two-hour movie ever made, and the ending could be creepy and depressing, but it&#39;s hard to find a gutsy film producer who tackles a subject like this.']
