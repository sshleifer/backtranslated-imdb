Purple rain ... what else can I say? The title speaks for itself. But I think all the actors were well chosen. The movie had a great story. I loved! Since I saw that movie, I was stuck in the eighties, and I'm only 13 years old! My favorite part of the movie was when his father died and he was collecting all his musical compositions, and Apollonia was sitting on the stairs with her ear in her hand. Critics say it's a drama, but I think it's more of a romance. Murphy Brown also did a great job in the movie, he actually acted like himself. I am so happy to have seen this movie. The song Purple Rain, beautifully sung, was so sincere. I cried more than once.
