This is a visual adaptation of the manga with very little dialogue. the dialogue that appears there appears in word balloons as it would in the manga. The plot of this exists, but it is only vaguely explained. There is a manga theme in which is available in English in the collection of explosions books, 'underground comics japan', and has a dialogue with subtitles that explains the plot a little more than here. I recommend reviewing that volume if you liked this, as it explains some of the "argument" of the movie, which is otherwise inexplicable. As for animation, this is pretty decent, good non-intrusive use of computers and images are mostly done well. Jump in and out of the episodes, while the characters, a cat and his older sister, brain dead, enter and leave a series of strange images: a ship, a circus, a desert. for a half hour, they go through a series of plots and settings, which leads me to believe that the director chose a series of long-sleeve manga themes to adapt to randomly, but was selected primarily visually. knowing what is happening could increase the appreciation a little. This reminds me above all of the kind of things they used to play in the mtv show, the cartoon sushi, in particular, a pair of shorts that show a cat chasing a man torn apart by the house. only in this case, the cats are more like hello kitty and their adventure is extended to include death and reincarnation and a series of other themes [although it is not so easy to know what is happening]. The DVD of this has comments from the director and a series of "making of", but I can not comment on that because I did not know them. I give this an 8/10 for now, there is not much here to compare it with the anime, and I expect more like this.
