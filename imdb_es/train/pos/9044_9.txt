I've recently seen this movie because of Jake's recent success with Brokeback Mountain. I thought I would see the movies I missed. I had no expectation of entering the movie, so I was surprised that I missed this movie. It is an exciting story of father and son, and it is also a story of non-favorites. I even shed a tear at the end of this wonderful story. This film attracts all ages. The only reason I give it a 9 out of 10 is that it slows down a bit in the middle, but in the end it comes back strongly. The performance was great, the story magnificent and the cinematography captivated by the stage of the film. Go see this movie! Rent it, buy it, look at it, I LOVE IT I know I did it!
