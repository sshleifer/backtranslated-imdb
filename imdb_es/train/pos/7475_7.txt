After reading some pretty negative points of view for this film, I was not sure if I should disburse some money to rent it. However, it was a pleasant surprise. I have not seen the original movie, but if it's better than this, I would be in heaven. <br /> <br /> Tom Cruise gives a great performance as the seemingly unstable David, convincing me that he is more than a smile on his legs (for the third time in his career, the other examples were Magnolia and Born on the Fourth of July ). Penelope Cruz is a little light but satisfies the demands of her role, like Diaz. The only disappointment is the little bland Kurt Russell. In the film, however, it is not the performance that really impresses, it is the cinema. <br /> <br /> Cameron Crowe excels in the role of the director, giving him a change of pace from his usual routine. The growing madness of the film is perfectly executed by Crowe (the short sequence in which Cruise travels through an empty Time Square is incredibly effective). The soundtrack (a distinctive feature of a Crowe movie) is also sublime. <br /> <br /> You will be impacted and challenged as a spectator. The plot seems a bit artificial, but the problems that are explored behind it are endlessly debatable. The movie is not perfect, but it's a welcome change of pace for Cruise and Crowe, and for those raised on a Hollywood glitter diet, it should be a revelation.
