Recently I bought the very underestimated Dreamcast and went to the city to look for some games to use them. I bought Soul Calibur (a classic) and then crossed the domain of Resident Evil Code Veronica. I have Resident Evil 1 and 2, and I have played in Res Evil 3 on numerous occasions, and I have been impressed by all, especially number 1, which has to go down in history, it has a classic. <br /> <br /> But none of them comes close to the Dreamcast attempt of Brilliant Gory Gameplay. If it's just to buy a dream game for this game, it's worth every moment of your time and effort, I've never felt so captivated by a computer game in the way that this has captivated me. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the story continues from the second story in which Claire Redfield looks for her Sister (Chris - from the first story), who presumably disappeared under the conspiracy of the dreaded umbrella corporation. Little is known about this corporation, except the fact that although it destroyed them 3 times in the previous stories. <br /> <br /> Helping Claire, with assistant super brat Steve, must discover the truth of reality. location of your brother. The 2nd CD allows you to control Chris, that is if you manage to get that far without running out of the room in fear. <br /> <br /> The control is very ingenious and the movement of the characters is magnificently realistic, when the character notices danger, it faces the direction from where it comes. PURE GENIUS !! <br /> <br /> In general, I gave this game 10/10 because it is simply the game of the year, the game of the decade and the best game in the world. Please, buy this game as soon as possible.
