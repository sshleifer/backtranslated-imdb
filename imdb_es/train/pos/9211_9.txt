['The director of action, terror, science fiction and exploitation Fred Olen Ray shows that he has a certain talent as a director. The character actor William Smith is one of the best rude and bad guys in the industry. He treats the viewer with the best acting performance of his career. As for Randy Travis, he gives his best impression of Lee Van Cleef. It&#39;s not bad in the movie. Smith and Travis make the movie. As for the rest of the cast, none of them really stands out. Ray did a great job directing this film, Smith and Travis were good, I would give this B western on a scale of one to ten (ten being the best) a seven.']
