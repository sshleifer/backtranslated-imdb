The Teta i la Luna (Mom and the Moon) describes the life of a 9 to 10 year old boy named Tete who is obsessed with the breasts that grow in Catalonia. I love this movie because the characters are very honest and very human, like all the characters in the movies of Bigas Luna (also director of Jamon, Jamon). Tete reminded me how intriguing and exciting life can be at that age. Also being from Catalonia (northeastern Spain) it brought back many memories to my mind. This film shows how beautiful Catalunya is, nice people, good life and especially a lot of people who are not tense.
