Everyone should totally see this movie! It's scary, but it does not appeal to "things that jump out of what is just to surprise you and pass you off as fear." It really is great. See this incredible amazing movie! The director is Stanley Kubrick, easily the best director that ever existed. Each and every one of his films are masterpieces, including this one. The Shining is about this family that goes to a hotel in the Colorado Rockies as caretakers of the winters, and receives snow. Well, the house is haunted. The child is psychic. The husband is easily affected by the evil hotels and, well, ... THE HILARITY FINDS !!!! Not really. It becomes this thrilling thriller in which things are thrown at the viewer from all directions and becomes frightening. Not just the classic, "Here's Johnny". It's memorable, but you can not talk for all the movies. It's one of those things where words do not explain it properly, and you just have to see it. So go to Netflix, and get it! GEEEEEETTTTTTTT ITTTTTTTTT !!!!!!!
