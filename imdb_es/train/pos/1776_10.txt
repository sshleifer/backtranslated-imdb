I hated so much the first episode of this program ('Protesting Hippies') in 1999 that I rejected the rest. However, when he appeared on 'The Paramount Comedy Channel', I saw it in its entirety and, to my surprise, I found it absolutely hilarious (Motto: never judge a series of comedy in its first week). <br /> <br /> In 1969, 'Hippies' plays Simon Pegg as 'Ray Purbbs', editor of a clandestine magazine 'Oz' called 'Mouth'. Her friends are the feminist Jill, the relaxed Alex and the enthusiastic Hugo. At the end of the 60s, there was a feeling of incredible optimism among young people, that they could change the world through the printing of magazines that nobody read. Instead of mocking the naivety of the hippies, the "hippies" are affectionate with her. The scripts of Arthur Mathews coldly parody a series of icons of that era: 'Hair', 'Woodstock', 'The Graduate', even the infamous' Oz 'obscenity trial of the early' 70s. Excellent performances by the cast; The 'Alex' by Julian Rhind-Tutt made me think of the character of Richard O'Sullivan from 'Man About The House'. It's a shame that there is never a second series, possibly by people like me. If you missed 'Hippies', try it. Once you pass the first game, a whim awaits you!
