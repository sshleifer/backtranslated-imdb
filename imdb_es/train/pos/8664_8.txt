The staunch and powerful supreme gangster Frankie Diomede (the always brilliant Lee Van Cleef in his robust and fine form) was arrested and sent to prison so that he can eliminate a traitorous companion without his detection. He also stopped Fawning Goofball Small Time Hood and Wiseguy wannabe Tony Breda (a nice portrait of Tony Lo Bianco). Frank and Tony form an unlikely friendship behind bars. Tony helps Frank out of the place and helps him in his quest to take revenge on a rival group of mafiosi led by the ruthless Louis Annunziata (played without problems by Jean Rochefort). The director Michele Lupo, who works with an absorbing script by Sergio Donati and Luciano Vincenzoni, tells the story with a constant and energetic rhythm, maintains a properly rough but occasionally happy tone, and presents the pieces of the action of awakening with a considerable snorting. (A fight over the shower in jail and a prolonged car chase rate from Mondo Derrto as the definitive emotional climaxes). Van Cleef and Lo Bianco show a pleasant, loose and attractive chemistry on the screen; The relationship between his characters is alternately funny and moving. The dazzling Edwige Fenech unfortunately does not have much to do like Tony's whining girlfriend, Orchidea, but at least manages to strip her incredibly beautiful and voluptuous body in a much-loved free nude shower scene. Riz Ortolani's wonderful rhythm / syncopation rhythm / funk pulse certainly hits the touchingly touching point. The polished cinematography of Joe D'Amato and Aldo Tonti is equally impressive. A really ingenious and entertaining little winner.
