This is as good as the original 101 if not better. Of course, Cruella steals the show with her atrocious behavior and costume, and the movie was probably made because the audience wanted to see more of Cruella. We see a lot more of her this time. I also like Ioan Gruffudd as Kevin, the clumsiest male leader. Using Paris as the climax of the film was a smart idea. It's worth watching the movie, whatever your age, as long as you like animals.
