Cheryl (a solid and sympathetic performance by the lovely Virginia Bryant), her husband Tom (the friendly Paolo Serra) and her son Bobby (very well played by Patrizio Vinci) go to a remote castle located in the countryside for summer vacations. Local legend affirms that the area is cursed. Cheryl discovers a creepy, hairy and unpleasant ogre (the big David Flosi in a surprisingly frightening suit) who lives in the basement. Cheryl has to overcome the fear of the beast of childhood, deeply rooted, to be able to defeat the evil find. The director / co-writer Lamberto Bava does an expert job of creating and maintaining a disturbing and disconcerting nightmarish mood. In addition, Bava avoids the routine of the Blood'n'guts fear film in favor of creating a convincing and provocative adult fairytale fable about how the best way to overcome what scares us is to confront the source head on. Robust turns of support from Sabrina Ferilli as a teacher friend of the school Anna, Stefania Montorsi as the sexy nanny Maria and Alex Serra as the crazy painter Dario. The satin cinematography of Gianfranco Transunto has some fluid tracking shots and a lot of excellent atmospheric lighting. The gnarly make-up of Fabrizio Sforza, the splendid and spooky splendor of Simon Boswell, and the set of wet, dark and cobwebbed cellars, reached the point of wrinkles. Well worth seeing.
