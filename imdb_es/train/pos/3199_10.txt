Okay, I really do not think Trailer Park Boys has bad story lines, because they kick. They just ... conflict with each other. <br /> <br /> For example: near the end of the movie, it shows Ricky and Julian that they tell "Patrick Lewis" to leave the dog and walk away. Then, in the end, he shows Ricky and Julian saying they have been in jail for 2 years. In the pilot television series, the first clip they show is the same clip from Ricky and Julian who shout at "Patrick Lewis". But in the television series, supposedly they've only been in jail for 18 months. <br /> <br /> In addition, we get the impression that the story line of the film and the TV series line are connected (due to the scene screaming among the guys). But some actors portray totally different characters. Of course, Patrick Roach plays "Patrick Lewis" in the movie, but in the series he plays Randy. Sam Tarasco plays one of the guys who pays Ricky for an extermination, and then plays Sam Losco in the series. <br /> <br /> Also (again ... I know, I have a lot to say), in The Movie, the boys snort coca cola instead of smoking hashish. The point is that, in reality, they never confirm that the two lines of the story are connected anyway, apart from the scene of the scream. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to keep talking.
