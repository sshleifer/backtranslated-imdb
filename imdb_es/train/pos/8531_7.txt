Even though the plot was a bit sad at times, and VERY hasty at the end, as if the director had run out of allotted time and had to hurry up and finish the story, in general it was good enough for Made-For-Backwoods - Genre of cable television. <br /> <br /> However, the actress who played the nanny, Mariana Klaveno, was very good! I hope to see more of her in the cinema land. The music was also well made, getting all the possible cold of the accumulations of tension based on music of the dah-DUH-dah-DUH type (I think "JAWS"). <br /> <br /> I do not think I'd want to see "While the Children Sleep" again, but if I did, it would be to focus on the performance of the talented Klaveno.
