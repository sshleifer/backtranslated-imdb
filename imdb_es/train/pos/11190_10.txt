One of the best (if not the best) of Stephen King's screenings. Dark as it may be dark, surprising end not Hollywood, terrifying atmosphere, incredible adaptation to the book, outstanding cast, educational (do not play with the afterlife), in short: all an excellent horror should be ... <br /> <br /> My favorite horror movie, directly 10+.
