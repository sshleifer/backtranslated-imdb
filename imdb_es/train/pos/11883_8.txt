I saw this movie about a week ago and I still think about it. I was very touched by this movie. I found the characters very believable and pleasant almost failing. As in real life, although sometimes people disappoint, as was the case with Leo, who, although I liked his character, could not have been more disappointed when he was willing to have unprotected sex although he was aware of his condition. HIV I was also disappointed that Leo rejected the medicine he had at his disposal, and the horrible way he treated Marcel when he decided to send him back home on the train. I think this movie showed in a very real way why HIV numbers are rising in young gay men. This is not meant to hit homosexuals in any way (I'm gay) and the movie could have been done very well on a young, straight person who makes bad decisions and does not seem to realize the consequences for himself and others. The only part of the film that I could not understand was why the (gay friendly) family was not willing to include Marcel in Leo's disease to the point of not allowing him to go to the funeral. <br /> <br /> I think The biggest message of this film is that if it's gay or straight, it DOES NOT HAVE SEX UNPROTECTED!
