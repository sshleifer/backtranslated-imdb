The rawhide was a wonderful Western television series. Focusing on a band of trackers led by trail chief Gil Favor. Most of the episodes, especially the first 3 seasons, were really character studies of Favor and his men. Guest stars came and went, but unlike Wagon Train, they rarely dominated the episodes in which they appeared. Rawhide was a true and gritty western and Gil Favor stood out as a memorable character that he would never forget. Thanks to the performance of Eric Fleming, the show became a massive success. Of course, he was ably supported by a wonderful cast of good actors: Clint Eastwood, Sheb Wooley, Paul Brinegar, Steve Raines, James Murdoch, Rocky Shahan, Robert Cabal. All these actors left their mark on a piece of television history. The rawhide captured the flavor of that western time that no other series has achieved for me, and even so, it has managed to do it. Subsequent seasons tended to divide the clues and give them individual story lines. For me, some of the time this did not work: the cattle collection and the regulars provided the best stories. However, there were still some classic stories and Rawhide was still a top-notch affair. The black and white photography added to a sombre and realistic feeling that other Western series seldom captured. Rustlers, Indians, commancheroes, beautiful damsels in distress, serial killers, all appeared to give trouble to our heroes. The final came quietly for the series when the final season was reduced to less than half. The reason - Eric Fleming was gone and Rawhide was now a disembodied head - the harsh realism was gone, Gil Favor had respect and exuded authority - he was never infallible and this made it all the more interesting. We will not see your partner again. Watch an episode whenever you can, rarely disappoint.
