The film reaches the bowels of tension between a son and a father. <br /> <br /> The brilliant dialogue, the charming landscape and the good acting serve as an excellent way to present the onion that continues to peel layers. <Br /> <br /> The central themes of parenting, communication and manhood are explored indirectly. <br /> <br /> In funny ways the curtain is removed, the masks slide a little and the truths are revealed. <br /> <br /> All this happens in the middle of a road trip format. The backdrop is the rural state of New York in early fall, just as the trees change color. WOOHOO!
