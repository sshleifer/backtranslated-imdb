Shamefully, before watching this movie, I was not familiar with Helena Bonham Carter. <br /> <br /> I had to do some research to make sure that I was not really distressed, just like her character, with (good?), with which she was distressed. I was absolutely amazed at this beautiful lady. She took it out of perfection. <br /> <br /> Who would have thought that the sexually explicit circumstances involving the final wishes and needs of a single young woman could be interpreted as tender and romantic? Well, they can be, when the correct interpreters present them in the right way, as they did in this wonderful movie. I forgot to mention how dynamically beautiful Miss Carter looked in this movie. I have often said that she was the most beautiful creature that had ever graced the face of our earth, but she seemed to have made herself in this particular movie. <br /> <br /> I hope any of you who watch this movie Enjoy it as much as I do. Thanks for letting me express my opinion.
