It's cheesy, it's creepy, it's disgusting, but that's what makes it so fun. He has overcome the superior melodramatic moments that are simply ridiculous. This movie is great to make fun of. Rent it to laugh. <br /> <br /> The film focuses on three news, for a time before cell phones. They go to a small town to cover a festival, but they can not get a room to spend the night. And that's when they meet Ernest Keller. It is creepy in a kind of psycho. And he offers to let them stay at home. But it does not tell them the truth about who lives there. <br /> <br /> The performance of Stephen Furst is as amazing as "The Unseen", which really takes this film. Most of the movie is a little boring, although discovering the truth about Ernest's family is quite interesting. <br /> <br /> The mere fact of seeing this cast in these scenes makes it worth seeing. Barbara Bach and Doug Barr make a nice candy for the eyes. <br /> <br /> I consider the film an ancient gem, hard to find and worth seeing.
