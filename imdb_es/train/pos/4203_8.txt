This is another stark and compelling film directed by Sam Fuller in the early fifties. This minimalist and fast working director has something unusual in his previous films: a cast with some stars. Richard Widmark, Jean Peters and Richard Kiley star in this film about a group of communist agents trying to sneak out of the United States, and stop at nothing to succeed. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with Peters in a subway car guarded by federal agents. They know that she is a link in a long chain of espionage. Unknown to everyone is the wild card in the equation: a pickpocket (Widmark) is also on the train and manages to steal the secrets that Peters carries. Widmark believes that it is just another bag he has looted, but later realizes the seriousness of what he has stolen. Now it's Widmark on its own, with Commies and the FBI at the forefront. <br /> <br /> Widmark and the rest are exceptional and the film is exciting from beginning to end. Even though you did not get the best billing, you must make a special mention of Thelma Ritter. This supporting actress perhaps had the performance of her life as a dove. She was rarely given this great opportunity to act and I was impressed by her ability to play a sad and desolate old woman. <br /> <br /> As far as the script and the direction are concerned, they are very good - but with one small exception. At first, I loved the way Widmark and Peters interacted. It's one of the few times in the movie that you'll see a woman hit in the mouth! Now that is hard. Later, inexplicably, they become incredibly close, too close to be credible. Still, with as much drama and a film as effective as Noir's, this can be overlooked. Watch this movie.
