This movie played very well in 1932 and probably would not work so well today because its style is a little outdated and artificial. However, if you are the kind of person, like me, who loves old Hollywood movies, cut the film a bit and you can enjoy it for what it is: an interesting soap. <br /> <br /> The movie is in a problematic pregnancy room. In this large room there are about half a dozen beds in which women are waiting to give birth, but doctors worry about possible complications (for example, a room like that would really traumatize mothers!). And, as in an episode of "Love Boat" or "Fantasy Island," each mother has her own special story. With so many extreme and crazy stories, you have to suspend disbelief. I could and I enjoyed the movie a lot. <br /> <br /> Here are some of the stories: One involves a father. You do not see the mother, but he is a very, very nervous father and is included for comic relief. However, it was wonderful here, very touching. <br /> <br /> Loretta Young and Eric Linden are a sad case. Loretta is sent to the hospital from prison, apparently she killed a horrible guy. You do not know exactly what happened, but you suppose he was trying to force himself on her! However, they gave her a sentence of 20 years, and her husband is dedicated to her and is by her side as much as possible. <br /> <br /> Glenda Farrell is a horrible person. She has the maternal instincts of a hamster: a very, very bad and alcoholic hamster! It's pretty funny and it's worth watching for most of the movie. I loved that he drank from a bottle of hot water full of gin and that he got angry when he finds out that he can not make money selling his twins! At the end of the movie, she has a typical Hollywood-style change of heart that was supposed to be poignant: I found it contrived. <br /> <br /> There is a woman who has given birth to a baby born dead. . Surprisingly, after that, they put the lady back in the same room as the women waiting to give birth! A crazy woman, who assumed you lost a baby some time ago, moves away from the psychiatric unit. She insists that she is having a baby. Later, he escapes again and takes one of the children! <br /> <br /> There are more stories than this one, but the ones I mentioned are the main ones. As I said, it's a kind of soap opera and it's very entertaining, and quite sad in the case of several of the stories. The ending, in particular, is heartbreaking and exceptionally well done. There were some particularly good performances, especially Farrell and Aline MacMahon as the head nurse. In short, a very good movie, and I have no idea why they felt they had to redo the movie a few years later (which was typical of Warner Brothers).
