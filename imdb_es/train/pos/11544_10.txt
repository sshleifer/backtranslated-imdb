['Some of the best films that are classified as &quot;comedies&quot; are actually confused between comedy and drama. &quot;The Graduate&quot; and &quot;Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid,&quot; which were also created in the late 1960s, are perfect examples. Are comedies with dramatic overtones or dramas with lots of humor? In many aspects, &quot;The Odd Couple&quot; falls into the same category of being comedy and, at the same time, very dramatic with deep foundations on human nature. Much of what happens can be fun for the public, but the characters do not laugh. <br /><br /> Despite the rather cheerful television show of the 1970s, the original &quot;Odd Couple&quot; is not just about a neat guy and a messy guy who are forced to live together because of their marital status. It is really about two opposites that must face why their marriages collapsed and how their damaging idiosyncrasies are revealed outside of their marriage. The neatness, the characteristic of Felix Ungar (Jack Lemon perfectly fused) and the disorder, the characteristic of Oscar Madison (Walter Matthau), are only the beginning and somewhat superficial. As the story unfolds, we discover that there is much more to these men than simple cleansing instead of clutter. <br /><br /> Briefly, the story is really about Felix Ungar, who has to face an imminent divorce from his wife Francis, whom we never know but is an important character in the whole story. On the verge of suicide, Ungar goes to the only place he knows: Oscar Madison&#39;s apartment, where a group of poker friends meet from time to time. We learn that Ungar is not only a member of this &quot;poker club&quot;, but that the group knows what is happening to him and, ineptly, tries to help him. Madison believes that the best way to help Ungar is to let him move in with him until his suicidal tendencies disappear. <br /><br /> Unfortunately for Madison, she does not know what she is getting into. Madison is a carefree, carefree, carefree bum whose refrigerator was last cleaned, probably when Herbert Hoover was still in the White House. Madison&#39;s idea of serving sandwiches is to grab moldy cheese and stick it between two pieces of bread, and then toss the contents of a bag of potato chips on the table. On the other hand, he likes alcohol and women, in short, have a good time. <br /><br /> Ungar is not only completely different, it is diametrically opposed. Not only is he an obsessive fan who finds more joy in disinfecting the apartment than meeting women, but he knows more than most women about cooking and eating well. At one point, he calls his ex-wife, not to talk about reconciliation, but to get her meatloaf recipe. At another time, Ungar was going to spend the rest of the afternoon cutting cabbage for coleslaw. When Madison does not seem impressed, Ungar finally confesses that he was only doing it for his roommate because he can not stand the cabbage salad. Who is this boy? But it has another attractive feature: Felix is also a hypochondriac. He becomes obsessed with his health to the point where he makes strange noises in public places saying that he is helping his sinuses. He seems to have all the health conditions in the book. And if more were invented, Felix would probably have them. Ultimately, he is too absorbed in himself. <br /><br /> Running throughout the film there are references to marriage. At a time when Madison tries to convince Ungar to move, he says: &quot;What do you want, a wedding ring?&quot; But little does he know that he is not the good guy who can not deal with the messy guy, but the other way around. Their friendship becomes a hellish and inadvertent relationship. And the climax occurs when Oscar invites two lonely British sisters to a meeting with comical and tragic results. This is one of the best comedies of its kind ever written and should not be missed, with superlative performances by Walter Matthau and Jack Lemon in roles that are difficult to imagine that others can interpret better. It is unfortunate that writing of this caliber is sadly absent from most of the comedies that are produced today.']
