Recently, when I was shopping, I saw the Americian Gothic box, and I thought: 'I remember it!' I used to set my alarm to go back up and see this when I was on CH 4 in 1996 at 1.30 am (I was 14 years old). I remember it mostly because it was really scary and weird, no person could be as scary as Lucas Buck (with a B!) Nobody went anyway. <br /> <br /> What bothered me was that they did the same with the box as on the television. Episodes in funny order, I kept thinking about when Dr. Matt is leaving ??? - They made it so confusing. <br /> <br /> However, this is not the fault of the writers, the producers or the producers (the people of the television in the fund the manufacturers of money They continue doing the same thing: only watch programs like Carnivale and Farscape that they do not like the originality in the studios) !!!!!) <br /> <br /> To finish: if you have not seen this and your name is Fantasy of science fiction, Terror, supernatural drama ... Fan = YOU MUST . They even said the same thing in SFX when reviewing the set of boxes.
