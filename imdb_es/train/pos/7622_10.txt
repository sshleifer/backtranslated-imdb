I love this program! It's like watching a mini movie every week! The first episode was so exciting and scary ... as well as part 2 of the pilot ... I will definitely continue tuning into this show! This is the true survivor! I've seen some of the other comments and I can see that after only one or two episodes, the imbeciles here are already crying wolf ... I'm sorry if it's not another reality show, kids! Once upon a time there was ... now get ready! Real television programs! And this is really good, unlike most of today's shit comedy comedies or the carbon copy of ump-teenth from the Law & Order or NYPD Blue or CSI series that are dealing ... Look at this yourself to form your own opinion, do not take one of the boneheads here!
