I'm not a big fan of Tim Matheson, but I must admit that I liked this movie. It was dark and a bit annoying with some scenes a bit nervous, I do not know if classifying this movie is a bit safe and a little horror Slash Thriller. I saw it at about 2am on my local channel, there was nothing else on, so I decided to watch it. If you have not seen this identification of the movie, it's not that bad, the characters are interesting enough, but I did not really explore to their full potential, which could have made this film even better. I do not know if this movie went to the movies, but it looked like it was made for television or went directly to a video. If it's on a DVD, it fits well with my film type and has a bit of X-FILES history attached to it. Government companies or smart corporations involved in unclear deals. In general, a good movie.
