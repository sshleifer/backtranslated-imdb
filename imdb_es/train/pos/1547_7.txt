['Like almost everyone else who has commented on this movie, I can only wonder why this never appeared in the video. <br /><br /> I remember seeing him around the age of 12 on &quot;The Late Show&quot;, around 1972. I also remember the attack with poisonous gas and strangely dressed horses. (I do not remember the most horrible fragments I have seen described here, probably were eliminated for the television audience). But the scenes that I really liked were those that involved the death of Lord Kitchener aboard HMS Hampshire, almost exactly 90 years ago. The scenes of the doomed cruiser approaching the minefield in the storm were really chilling, I remember. <br /><br /> I do not remember the musical score, but the comments of others now make me curious. Take this one out on video!']
