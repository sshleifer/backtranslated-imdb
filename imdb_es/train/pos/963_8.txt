Takashi Miike is one of my favorite directors and I was worried that he would make a film for children, because I would hate to see him start from his films. I came to love: Visitor Q, Gozu, Izo, Ichi, the murderer and Black Socioty Trilogy. Lately he seems to be exploring new territories and I think he is succeeding. Still, this was the first of her films that had seen him take that direction, so I was nervous. From the rough, I bought it without seeing it and I was glad I did it. <br /> <br /> The Great Yokai War is a perfect movie for children and adults should like it too. The whole movie reminded me of many of the films I loved as a child: endless story, Labyrinth, Return to Oz, etc. I enjoyed those movies because they did not treat the children as if they were stupid and this is not either. . The underlying dark moral is there, but it is also as stupid as any children's film should be. Personally I was not bothered by the CGI and the prostheses. I feel that they fit well and I do not think the children realize it. <br /> <br /> If you are a Takashi Miike fan, you will not like it, you will not like it. But, I suggest giving it a try. It shows that Miike is as diverse and talented as he suspected he is. He also continues to make his signature films Miike out of these, which is very reassuring. <br /> <br /> For those people who are new to Takashi Miike and want something light or dramatic like this, I suggest these other Miike films: 'Zebraman' 'The happiness of the Katakuris'' Sabu 'and' The bird village in China. ' <br /> <br /> Good job Takashi Miike! 8/10 stars.
