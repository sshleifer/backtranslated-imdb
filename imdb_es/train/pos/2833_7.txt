I just saw this movie again after thirty-seven years. I was eleven years old and I captured this movie in South Beach at Cinema Cinema on Washington Avenue. In 1969, I thought Where is it? It was a very good movie. Now, however, after almost forty years, it is not as good as it was. Times have changed, and this movie is now an old and tired re-hash of the war between generations. However, he caught a place in time that is just a memory. It's really interesting to see modern fashions, old Vegas, a slender Don Rickles, chain smoking and an opening song. The performance was decent, the script somewhat antiquated, but the memories were still fresh. Where it is, it may not be for you, but for me, it was still a pleasant and entertaining trip in my memory.
