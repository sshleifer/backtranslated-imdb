Why on earth should you explore the fascinating documentary of nature "Earth"? How much time do you have on earth so I can explain this to you? Okay, I will not extend my exploration of the "Earth" review to infinity, but I must defend my reason why this is a "must see". The documentary takes a tour of nature through the migration routes in three animal families: a female polar bear and her puppies with the secondary story of the real life of the bear father who dares to hunt to find food on his isolated path, a whale mother with her baby whale taking a whale from a migratory trip for prey, and a mother elephant with her small (maybe not so small, they are elephants) that migrate to Africa. Directors Alastair Forthegill and Mark Linfield did a job "off this earth" by also capturing the survival skills of many other animal species in addition to the magnetic shots of our three protagonists of the animal family. Richard Brooks Burton's cinematographic expert team, Mike Holding, Adam Ravetch and Andrew Shillabeer were camera animals that photographed the wonderful natural sites and instinctive behaviors of animals; Not to mention, shots of slow-motion animal prey were made. "The Earth" is also a lesson to learn about the effect of global warming on animals; The polar bear of dad in the document is the child of the poster on that consequence. So fellow Earthlings, it's time to take the documentary trip to visit "Earth" today! **** Good
