"The Brak Show" is good. It is probably not at the same level as "Aqua Teen Hunger" or "Space Ghost Coast to Coast", but it definitely has many brilliant moments. It basically follows the life of Zorak and Brak who have normal lives. and go to school, living in a neighborhood like the 50's comedies. The humor and animation of this show is very similar to "Aqua Teen Hunger" (and in an episode Meatwad could be seen) with strange situations and strange characters. But it's good, it has fun parts. Some of the songs are great, others not much, but I like this program. The funniest character is Brak's father. (that's a human, nobody knows why)
