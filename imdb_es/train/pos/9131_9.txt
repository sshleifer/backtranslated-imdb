"I just wanted to see you laughing in the Purple Rain." This is an excellent movie. It should have been reevaluated to PG-13. But anyway, Prince's first film and the biggest one. The pursuit sucked. But I have not seen it in years, so this is what I can remember about it. The Kid (Prince) has to juggle the love of her life, Apollonia (herself), keep her band together (The Revolution as herself) and the tension in her family. But his rival gang (The Time as they themselves) is ruining his life. As Morris (himself) is trying to steal Apollonia from The Kid. Like the Saturday Night Fever, Flashdance and 8 Mile. Really good. Rent it, laugh and cry and if you like it, buy it.
