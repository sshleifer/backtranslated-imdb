This is a very strange movie of HK in many ways. First, many of the action sequences are not really that fun. The first battle of arms that took place in the film was nonsense. It's not great silly, not even funny, but silly. That does not mean there are not some great action scenes, but most of them just do not quite reach the level of some of the other movies I've seen. The opposite side is that this movie actually has CHARACTERS, not just people. All the main characters are interesting (except for the head head, which is flat like a pool table) and most are pretty good. All the protagonists of this movie are fun to watch. The dialogue is quite ingenious and does not seem to lose much in translation. It is worth watching this movie, but I hope that the uninitiated American public does not think that this is the best that HK has to offer.
