This star of Alec Guinness is a very funny political satire of the corporate industry, and also a slightly eccentric character study. <br /> <br /> The pace is a bit slow for a comedy, and none of that is really dynamic. Funny on the floor, except maybe the sound effects for the experiments. But he has his funny moments, and he is very skilled in his execution. The segment of large explosions is probably the most ridiculous element. <br /> <br /> The procedures of the union are quite funny, very similar to those of I'M ALL RIGHT JACK; especially the female socialist with a slight romantic infatuation in the Guinness character. Political machinations actually carry the story. Ernest Thesigner is very remarkable as heavy. <br /> <br /> I do not think this works as well as THE LADYKILLERS, or KIND HEARTS AND CORONETS; But even Ealing's light comedy is better than nothing.
