The idea of ​​making a film about the Beatles sounds damned, since no production can capture the idea of ​​the real historical Beatles. So maybe it's better not to try to recreate the past, but to produce an illustration that works better with the other available material of the Beatles. This is exactly what 'Birth of the Beatles' offers us, the simple story we know without any extravagance. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS here at *** <br /> <br /> Be warned that not everything is as accurate as some Beatles graduates might expect. The Beatles are seen performing songs that were almost not composed at that time. The Beatles interpret "Ask Me Why", "P.S. I Love You" and even "Do not Bother Me". Beatles graduates should see that if the Beatles in the film only perform songs they actually made in Hamburg, the younger viewers will no longer recognize the Beatles who learned to know them. Of that original Hamburg repertoire only "Johnny B. Goode" and "Love Me Tender" by Stu Sutcliffe are retained. <br /> <br /> The guys who play the Beatles in this production just look like the originals, but the rest of the movie can still be seen well, since the movie is pretty accurate for the rest. The guy who plays Lennon does it well and the rest of the band is not bad either. Brian Epstein is great and the moment he banishes Pete Best from the group is probably the most memorable scene in the whole movie. Also as a bonus you can see the original Cavern club in the movie.
