['I saw it in an elegant cinema where the public is usually white, educated and urban. The sample that I attended had a large number of African-Americans, which made the difference in audience reaction between the two groups a wonderful social commentary on the state of race relations in this country. Basically, the whites were AFFIRMED of laughing or laughing nervously at the funny fragments, and there are many! - because they would be &quot;laughing at the blacks&quot;, while the blacks also remained quite quiet because many could not laugh at themselves in front of the whites. <br /><br /> I, on the other hand, being Asian (and therefore do not belong to any group), had a good time watching this satire of rap culture and its egos / traps / values / pseudo-philosophies. The cast is talented and does a great job becoming the characters portrayed. The songs are too funny to be believed. <br /><br /> This film is one of the best pseudo-documentaries that have appeared, including &quot;A Mighty Wind&quot;']
