After Watergate, several conspiracy films appeared, like this one, written by the late Adam Kennedy (based on his novel). <br /> <br /> Gene Hackman plays former Vietnam veteran 'Roy Tucker', a loser who ended up in jail. He receives visits from Marvin Tagge (Richard Widmark), who claims to represent an organization designed to help unjustly convicted people. They offer him freedom and, despite distrusting Tagge, he accepts. But he brings with him a cellmate named Spiventa (Mickey Rooney). Exactly why it's hard to see, since Spiventa is an irritating little man who drives Tucker crazy with persistent conversations about sex, not what you want to hear when you're behind bars. <br /> <br /> Tagge's benefactors kill Spiventa before Tucker eyes with amazement He met with wife Ellie (Candice Bergen) and was given a new identity (oddly, he does not try to change his appearance. mustache with cheese would have been a start), he establishes himself, but discovers that there is a problem - Tagge wants Tucker to do nothing less than assassinate the president of the United States. He refuses, so Tagge has kidnapped Ellie ... <br /> <br /> I'll leave the synopsis here, but I'm sure you can guess the rest for yourself. The script has enough holes to make you want to read the book (that's a good trick!). The people that Tagge represents are never revealed. The allusions to the murder of J.F.K. They are unmistakable. Despite the findings of the Warren Commission, the question of whether Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone persists to this day. <br /> <br /> This was Stanley Kramer's first film in years, and although it's not a turkey, it lacks control. Say "The Manchurian Candidate" by John Frankenheimer or "The Parallax View" by Alan J. Pakula. Being a left-wing conspiracy film, it tends to surround its subject instead of facing it. I prefer the right ones, they are more fun! 'Domino' has the appearance of a product made for TV. Film, and boasts of what should be the easiest jail break in film history, not to mention the end of Michael Caine's classic "Get Carter." <br /> <br /> What makes it visible are Gene Hackman and Richard Widmark. The latter, who unfortunately died earlier this year, is magnificent as the mysterious Tagge, which initially seems to be behind the operation until he is also ruthlessly eliminated, beginning a chain of deaths designed to eliminate all traces of evidence one by one . The perpetrators of this evil plot fall, as do the dominoes. As Tucker, the innocent pawn, Hackman is wonderful. However, you have to ask yourself why you chose to hide in such an obvious place. In his shoes, I would have fled to the other side of the world, to any place to get away from these fanatics. Hackman's love scenes with Bergen slow down the plot, and it's almost a relief when they catch her. Presumably the producers also thought about it, which explains why it opens with a strange prologue in which the whole premise of the film, expressed by the British actor Patrick Allen, which warns the public that "they" is exposed they are out there and that "they" are coming. we. Comedian Les Dawson later simulated this opening at his B.B.C. show 'The Dawson Watch'. <br /> <br /> Mickey Rooney had previously worked with Kramer on 'Its A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World'. His "death" scene here looks like a revelation of that image, with the actor as if he had been stung by a wasp instead of shot to death. <br /> <br /> Conspiracy movies used to be made only by the left, but now the ones on the right are getting into the act too. Last year, 'Taking Liberties', an absurd mixture of lies and half-truths about Tony Blair's government turned out to be Britain's response to 'Reefer Madness'. At least, 'Domino' had the lovely Candice Bergen. The best film that Chris Atkins could offer was Anne Widdecombe! <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, 'The Domino Principle' was created by Sir Lew Grade, the legendary British television mogul behind 'The Saint', 'Jesus Of Nazareth' and 'The Muppet Show'. He worked with Adam Kennedy again in 1980 on 'Raise The Titanic!', Whose failure was so great that it plunged Grade's ambitions to be the new Louis B. Meyer. Being something open-minded, I would not rule out the possibility of a conspiracy.
