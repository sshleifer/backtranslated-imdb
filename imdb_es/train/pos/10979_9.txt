['This documentary follows the lives of Big and Little Edie Beale, mother and daughter, who lived as inmates in their family mansion in East Hampton, NY, from the mid-50s to the late 70s. By the time the filmmakers find them, the The mansion is falling apart and the women, one of 78 and another of 56, share a miserable room. Major Edie Beale is the aunt of Jackie Kennedy Onassis and the youngest is her first cousin. The women were originally going to be evicted from the house because of their decrepit condition, but Jackie sent them money for repairs so they could continue living there. <br /><br /> Sometimes, this movie may seem exploitative, since none of the women has the best mental health, but at other times, it is difficult to look away from the film. &quot;The little one&quot; Edie blames her mother for her current state, and her mother replies that Edie would never be the success she believed she was. The &quot;little&quot; Edie often seems to be stuck in the past, focused on the decisions she made decades ago, and loves to show images of her youth, where she was clearly a beautiful debutante. Her mother seems more resigned to her destiny, to living the rest of her life in terrible conditions. There are definite hints of the glamorous life that both women once brought, from the images that show a happy family, to the great portrait of the older Edie by her bed. From what we see of the house, most of the rooms are empty, the walls crack and crumble, and &quot;Little&quot; Edie leaves food in the attic so the raccoons can feast. And of course there are numerous cats running. <br /><br /> In his heart, this documentary is incredibly sad. While none of the women seems particularly depressed by their lot in life, the misery in which they live is absolutely horrible. It is not particularly clear if there is even running water in the house, and gives the impression that they have essentially been abandoned by their family. <br /><br /> However, as a documentary, the film is a marvel to behold, and it is highly recommended.']
