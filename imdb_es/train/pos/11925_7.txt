It happened that I caught this movie by cable one afternoon. I must admit that I have never been a big baseball fan, but sometimes I can get into a good movie related to sports. What I found most interesting was the representation of the host family system. As a therapist who has seen the good and the bad of mental health and the host system of the community, I thought it was quite comforting to see a film that showed the ups and downs of this system: people who jump from family to family, biological Parents they do not always take an active part, and transitions can be heartbreaking and heartbreaking. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Danny Glover are the presenter of this film, and both provide very credible performances. Maybe it was just my emotional state, but I found myself shedding a tear at the end of the movie.
