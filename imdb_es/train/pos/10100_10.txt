I came across this (Act-I) by sheer luck and this was more than a decade ago. This was not what the label on the cover mentioned on the tape. I was surprised He intimidated me. I was surprised Eventually I forgot and almost a decade later, I thought about it again. Then they went and bought both acts. They were even better than what I had experienced at the beginning. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is that while the Tank Police continues and continues to talk about being at war with the crime, guaranteeing tanks and heavy artillery, it would seem as if they were really having difficulties with the criminals. That never shows or is simply a lie, since it seems that they take it easy most of the time. If that part of being in a state of war was really propaganda, it certainly has not been shown as such. <br /> <br /> I do not think the original Japanese version could have been as good as the Americanized version. version of this. But with respect to the story, some proper explanations in the translation have certainly been lost, but it can be justified.
