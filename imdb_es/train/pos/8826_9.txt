If you enjoy the straight-faced events that are logical in a certain illogical situation, you will enjoy this fantastic 8-minute Spanish film. <br /> <br /> A woman enters a small cafe. The scene seems normal, but the accountant, the clients and two musicians seem somehow strangely moderate. <br /> <br /> Suddenly, the musicians play and a man begins to sing the title song, dancing at the tables with a musical comedy. Gestures Clients, at first immobile, at intervals of ringing (bad but not wanting) with phrases of the song, read the pieces of paper in their palms. From time to time they jump and dance (awkwardly but seriously) with choreographic movements, like supporting singers. <br /> <br /> But why? the woman asks. The answer is revealed when the solo jacket opens and she sees what is tied to her chest, just before the explosive climax ... Even if you do not get the lyrics of the song (probably ironic ), Perfect presentations of the situation should give you a smile and a giggle ... I would love to see you again!
