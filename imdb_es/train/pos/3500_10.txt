This movie works because it feels so genuine. The story is simple and realistic, which perfectly captures the joys and anxieties of the love and sexuality of the adolescents that most / all of us experience during our adolescence. <br /> <br /> The actors are as natural as figures in a documentary but they are as convincing and as charismatic as experienced artists. The dialogue is fresh and honest ... and, fortunately, it is not filled to the brim with pop culture references. In addition, the cinematography is both harsh and beautiful, and gives life to the Lower East Side stage in a very tangible way. <br /> <br /> On an artistic level, I love this movie because it reminds me of a great Italian neo. -The films of realism such as The Bicycle Thief and La Strada. Movies rarely feel as "real" as they do ... or as Bicycle Thief did. And the only other movie I've seen that deals with adolescent sexuality with the same level of seriousness is Splendor in the Grass by Elia Kazan. The writer / director Peter Sollett deserves great praise. This movie is quite an achievement. <br /> <br /> On a personal level, I am always pleased to see a film that treats members of ethnic America with love and respect. As an Italian-American, I hate the way my own people go to the movies (like criminal, feminine and racist geniuses in the irritatingly popular epics), and my aggravation in this sense makes me very sensitive to other groups and their horrible silver screen . representations Hispanics and Asians, in particular, seem cursed to play villains in action movies and westerns. (Fortunately, Gong Li did not try to make himself famous in the United States!) <br /> <br /> Of course, thanks in large part to the rise of indie images and the influence of Miramax, we are seeing some more pictures about characters ethnicities here and there ... but Raising Victor Vargas is easily one of the best. While I really like My Big Fat Greek Wedding, it's a refreshing change that Raising Victor Vargas plays directly (with less exaggerated characters and more characters) while still very fun in its own right. Finally! Latin characters worthy of mention. I have the feeling that this is a movie that will be remembered. <br /> <br /> Of course, now that you have made this wonderful photo about a family from the Dominican Republic, I hope that Peter Sollett will make a film about the Italians soon! :) - Marc DiPaolo
