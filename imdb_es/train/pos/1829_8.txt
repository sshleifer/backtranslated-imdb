What a funny movie is St. Ives. It reminds me of the type of film made during the 40s. Classic story, rounded by characters and a plot that is neither too dramatic nor overtly complicated. In fact it is not about anything. The story of Robert Lewis Stevenson, here adapted for the screen, reads like Jane Austen for men. We have a story that has a romance in his heart, but there is also a lot of fun: battle scenes (escapes), prison escapes, mistaken identities, sword games and the funniest phrase I've heard in years: "Only in Scotland is would announce the guests by name in a masked ball. " There is a lot of hilarity, difficulties, and not a little anguish when St. Ives tries to fight and find his way back to a family and a life he barely knew. <br /> <br /> The cast is absolutely stellar with infrequently seen Jean Marc Barr quite perfect in the title role. Anna Friel is a refreshing delight, as Flora and Miranda Richardson almost walk away with the film as wise and worldly, they have been there and have seen everything, Aunt Susan. Richard Grant provides comic relief at the highest level. <br /> <br /> This will not be the best movie anyone has ever seen, but its charms are undeniable and the whole movie is replete with an energy that explodes in life. .
