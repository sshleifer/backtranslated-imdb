It was at 7:30 am, very close to the school to see her very often. Animation and computer graphics were spectacular for the time. The idea that cowboys and ordinary people casually launched space vehicles and robots was incredible. Maybe it inspired Treasure Planet. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it's really boring in the DVD format. The shows are basically identical. When viewing non-sequential episodes on a DVD, disc # 3 stoned him. By today's standards, the animation is irregular. We no longer notice the graphics on the computer and focus on how corny the characters are instead. <br /> <br /> The bright spots are the characters of the heroine. They were much more credible, they took themselves more seriously than modern heroines, and they were not corny. In fact they saved the men.
