This movie was a rather entertaining comedy about Murphy's law that applies to home ownership and construction. If today a film like this were made, the family would undoubtedly be dysfunctional. Since it was established in the 'simplest' years, we get what is supposed to be a typical family of the time. Of course, Grant perfectly combines the comic and dramatic elements and works with a more than competent supporting cast highlighted by Loy and Douglas. Their shenanigans make a solid 90 minutes of entertainment, 7/10.
