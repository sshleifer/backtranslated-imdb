Unlike some comments, mine is positive. This film wraps the dinner table with a group of friends, some like you, some do not. Some are related: mother, daughter, son. Their stories are not easy, happy with everyone and everything, the kind of life, like real life. Some lines of history do not evolve, they just happen. But like true families and good friends, they stay together. Those who want to be parents who are buying a baby are like a hole! You are happy for the end. Poor Delmar is trapped between a rock and a rock, taking care of herself, her mother, her son and trying to keep all their lives together. This does not end with a sunset walk or a house in the suburbs and everyone is living in a world of dreams, but it is a real life portrait of the people who live day to day, month after month. In general, this is a good story and a great movie !!
