At that moment I remember being quite surprised and amused by this movie. I referred to it as the most important movie I had seen in ten years, and I came across people who said similar things. <br /> <br /> Bernhard has a notebook of unusually perceptive behavior. And she has shaped the bitter adolescent personality that we all had, in a corrosive and adult worldview. The two together provide a surprising mix that may be too aggressive for some viewers. (Hi, Skip, I wish you were not my brother so I could fuck you!) <br /> <br /> Bernhards looks for herself after returning to Los Angeles from New York, resulting in immersive testing of several characters (all of which are poorly adjusted) for our fun, but enough of them involve acting to appeal to a "black imperative" value system that the true barometer of their resituation is whether the black culture accepts it. (It's been a while, Nina Simone comes to mind, and she has an impressive black lover of solid construction in the film) A beautiful black girl attends the shows and seems to be authorizing Sandra's false blackness, but finally rejects her . <br /> <br /> Just as Catholics consider themselves fortunate to suffer for Christ, here Sandra represents herself suffering at the hands of a black culture in which she longs for a place; as if he appreciated his dignity and his rejection. It is the only value system involved in the world of cinema, apart from the artistic confusion of Bernhards. <br /> <br /> For a nation whose main problems are racism and money, it is comforting to see one of the 2 topics treated atypically. path.
