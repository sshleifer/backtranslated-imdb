Although the target audience has already passed, I have always had a weakness for YA fiction, so naturally I was intrigued by the return of Nancy Drew to the screen. <br /> <br /> This is not a bad movie. The central mystery that involves a dead actress has long been presented in simple and simple terms, with leaps of danger for young detectives. Nancy and her friends never take the threats seriously, so the young people in the audience will not be upset. <br /> <br /> What I really appreciated about the story was that the final results were quite serious and significant, and Nancy seemed to understand and grow. Of the experience. <br /> <br /> Emma Roberts is great as Nancy Drew and we hope we see her again in another mystery.
