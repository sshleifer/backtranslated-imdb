Marion Davies stars in this extraordinary comedy "Show People," released by MGM in 1928. Davies plays an actor from Savannah, Georgia, who arrives in Hollywood with his father (Dell Henderson). The jalopy in which they arrive is a hoot, as is the scandalous southern suit of Davies. Davies gets a job in the slapstick comedy, not what she wants, but it brings her success. She meets her fellow slapstick star William Haines, who is immediately beaten with her. Well, Davies then gets a job in a more prestigious studio ("High Art Studios") and gets a job in suffocating period periods. A handsome but fake actor (Andre Telefair) shows him the ropes of how to be the typical pretentious Hollywood star. Davies abandons his friend and slapstick father for the good life, but of course he learns that he is not who he really is. Marion Davies is wonderful at all times, because, scandalously, she has the range of emotions that are required of a "serious" actress. William Haines is his wonderful comic character, and there are cameos by Charles Chaplin, John Gilbert and other famous stars of the day, including the director of the film, King Vidor. This is a silent movie with some "sound effects", since the sound images started to appear. A treasure of a movie.
