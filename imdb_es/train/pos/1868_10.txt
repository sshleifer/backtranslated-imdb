['This film describes the life of someone who grew up in the worst circumstances, but unlike many people, he actually grew up to be a respectable person. What&#39;s more is that this is a true story. <br /><br /> Antwone Fisher is so innocent and, nevertheless, he was mistreated because he was not white. Antwone Fisher has been married to the same women for ten years and never played with women, coca, cigars, herbs, alcohol or any of those things that are very popular in the places where he grew up. <br /><br /> There&#39;s not much more to say about this movie, it&#39;s excellent. The only qualification I can give is a 10/10.']
