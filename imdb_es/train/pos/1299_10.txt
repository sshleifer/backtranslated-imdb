I caught a bit of this concert on public television and I knew I had to have it. The boys give everyone at the Royal Albert an excellent, often exciting performance in every way. Pure, too: no synthesizer, no lasers and strobe lights wrapped in smoke, no grand entrance (and a serious, serious and grateful audience, all of whom left their rockets at home). <br /> <br /> If you're a Cream fan (or if you've only heard of them); if you're a blues fan; if you are a fan of rock and roll; You will not be disappointed when you see and hear this DVD. Also, you will never lose this DVD because you will never lend it to anyone. (This DVD justifies selfishness! Tell them to get their own!) It's too good and reproducible; You will want to keep it at your fingertips.
