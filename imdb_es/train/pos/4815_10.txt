This is on my main list of favorite movies of all time! It is a fantastic and insightful movie. It was historically interesting and great to see! I thought that the performance of Emily Blunt was fantastic and Rupert Friend was a fantastic Albert, the best actor was chosen for Albert. The costumes were beautiful and the scenes and scenes like the opera house were amazing and detailed. I love all! I loved the childhood scenes where John Conroy "harassed" her. And where her mother says she has to walk stairs with an adult. Once again the writers have done it! They produced this fantastic script! <br /> <br /> He deserves the awards they got. (Oscar and BAFTA won Sandy Powell for costume design, BAFTA for best makeup and hair, Oscar for Best Achievement in Art Direction, Best Achievement in Costume Design, Best Achievement in Makeup. The Broadcast Film Critics Association Awards for Best Costume Design, also nominated for Best Actress Emily Blunt, CDG for Excellence in Costume Design for Film - Period, Hampton's International Film Awards for an Audience Award for Best Narrative Film, PFCS at Best Costume Design.Sudbury Cinefest, does not say what.VFCC for best actress, Emily Blunt.) In total 10 wins and 11 nominations! That's pretty good! http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0962736/awards Take a look yourself, it's really interesting! Personally, Rupert Friend should have won a prize.
