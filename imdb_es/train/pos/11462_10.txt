SPOILER ALERT! This movie, Zero Day, gives an inside look at the lives of two students, Andre and Calvin, who feel resentment and hatred for anyone and anything related to the school. <br /> <br /> They go in a series of self-sufficient. I thought of "Missions" all before the huge mission, which is day zero. The contents of Zero Days are not specified until the middle of the film. The spectator knows that he is serious and full of hate, but he is never quite sure until the end. <br /> <br /> Now we all know, if the movie is based on the Columbine massacre, the ending is pretty obvious. And the ending is no different from any other film about the attack, they go and kill many of their fellow students at the end. <br /> <br /> I have seen many movies about this attack, and this movie by Far is my favorite, and the most respected. It gives the viewer and a look inside the life of these two teenagers who hate life, and honestly gives the viewer some understanding and a close in the horrible event. <br /> <br /> Only 7 when the events took place, I never knew the severity of the shots, until my English class was assigned to an essay or story about a defining moment in our generation. Well, I knew everyone was going to choose the twin towers, but I wanted to be different, because, of course, the twin towers were tragic and very defining, but I did not think it was the right choice for me because there really was no way. To relate to that because I was only in 3rd grade and I had no idea what it all meant. But the shootings left and effect. I remember the interviews, the views of the school sky, and the pain and terror in the eyes of thousands of people. <br /> <br /> This movie is a compelling, realistic and horrible masterpiece, and I would recommend it to anyone.
