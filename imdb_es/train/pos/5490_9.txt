This is really an amazing movie. It not only documents the eternal struggle of indigenous and marginalized peoples to obtain their legitimate voice, but also shows the United States for its dishonesty, subterfuge and blatant disregard for human rights and self-determination. Chávez is shown as a very brave and charismatic leader who fights against what can only be characterized as a despicable elite without any sense of proportion or justice. These filmmakers have recorded a coup that has not been seen before. <br /> <br /> And in the grid we see the USA. UU., Once again, pulling the strings and erasing all sense of reality. It is disconcerting to see the initial stages of the revolt knowing very well that the subversion of democracy that we are witnessing is a tool that successive US governments and their seemingly flickering citizens have used for a long time. The images make it clear that this is not a manipulation of TV or generic images, but an active documentation of a people and their government fighting for their future. Truly a moving experience for anyone with conscience. These Irish filmmakers deserve our gratitude. Long live Chávez. <br /> <br /> We have to enshrine the notion that each country should be allowed to choose its government and develop itself in such a way that the majority considers it appropriate. The first phase of this process is the need to know what the realities of the situation are, and this documentary does a great job in doing just that.
