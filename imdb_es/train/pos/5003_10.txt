['I was not going to see this show. But, I&#39;m glad I did it. Critics of this simply do not understand it! It&#39;s one of the funniest and most entertaining things on TV at the moment! However, when the interviews were done with ordinary people, they probably seemed useless; but, put them in the mouths of animals and insects, and it is a racket of laughter. I laughed so much I had tears in my eyes. The pig with the babies suckling and their mother is priceless. The birds of the husband and the wife talking about health problems, and the male bird that goes crazy after the wife said she was constipated, broke me completely! Creature Comforts is the most imaginative show I have seen in a long time! With luck, he will return next summer when this race ends.']
