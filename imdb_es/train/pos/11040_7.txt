I watched this French horror movie last night and I liked it a lot. The entire film takes place in a prison cell with basically three prisoners who find a handwritten newspaper on a wall of a serial killer who had escaped from prison 20 years earlier, somehow without leaving his cell. As they look at the newspaper, they discover that it delves into the arts and the black commands that could be their exit from the cell and freedom. What they discover is something completely different and horrifying, to say the least. I like low budget horror films, which deliver the products in a pretty good way and tell a good story. This movie does just that, despite taking a while to get going. The result and the horror that they unleashed are very interesting for me, and I enjoyed the trip. Not much gore, but that would not fit in the story, although the gore it has is pretty good.
