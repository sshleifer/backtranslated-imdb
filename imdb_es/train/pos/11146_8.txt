Fascinatingly disappointing about a presumed con man in New York City forced to live in a condemned building with a crippled cripple. Extremely bleak examination of modern moral and social decline, very well directed by John Schlesinger (who never got over his work here) and acted excellently for Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman. The packages are quite shocking in general, but the "fantasy" scenes, some of which are reproduced by a giggle, are somewhat intrusive, as is the "mod" drug party. The relationship that develops between the two men is sentimental, however, the filmmakers are careful not to get muddy, and this gives the image an advantage that it might not have had with a director less than Schlesinger. Originally rated X in 1969, and the Oscar winner for Best Picture; Screenwriter Waldo Salt (who adapted the book by James Leo Herilhy) and Schlesinger also won statues. *** 1/2 of ****
