As a "rebound" of the best 100 films of the AFI, the British Film Institute produced a documentary with Martin Scorsese. <br /> <br /> Now. I'm a big movie fan and I'm proud to have seen many, many movies. But, now I am in comparison with my idol. In this fantastic documentary (albeit long), Scorsese guides the viewer through several stages of the History of the United States in a film. This is divided into several sections, including the Western movie, the Gangster movie and the Noir. Full of enthusiasm, Martin Scorsese is a great tour guide and a fantastic teacher.
