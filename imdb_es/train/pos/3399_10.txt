This was the 101st film of Eddie Robinson and the last one, and he died of cancer nine days after completing the filming. All of which makes his key scene in the film even more moving. <br /> <br /> Although some of the styles of hair and clothes are a little outdated (also note the video game that is shown in the movie), but the theme of the film is quite timeless. Heston said he had wanted to make the film for a while because he really believed in the dangers of overpopulation. <br /> <br /> Several things make this movie a classic. The story is solid. <br /> <br /> The performance is top-notch, especially the interaction between Heston and Robinson, with good performances also by Cotten and Peters. <br /> <br /> The music is absolutely perfect. The mix of Beethoven, Grieg and Tchaikovsky combined with visual pastoral elements make up really moving scenes. This was the icing on the cake for the movie. <br /> <br /> And the theme (or the "point") of the film is significant. Yes, it is a film about overpopulation, but on a more important note it is a warning story about what can go wrong with the administration of the Earth by Man. It is in the subtext that the real message of the film is found. Pay attention to what Sol says about the "old days" of the past (which is our present), and observe how Thorn is unable to understand what Sol is saying. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of my main sci-fi movies of all time.
