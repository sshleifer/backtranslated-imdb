This is the story of the Australian commandos who are captured without uniforms after a raid. Since they are out of uniform, they are, rightly, treated as spies. As such, they are judged, condemned and condemned to death. The Japanese court martial, by admiration for its heroism, authorizes the death of a warrior. Of course, under the Bushido code, this means that they must be beheaded. A destination for which, as Westerners, they are not prepared.
