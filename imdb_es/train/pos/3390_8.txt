Time is the future and for many who do not know it, that day is now. In this final film for the legendary actor Edward G. Robinson, "Solent Green" becomes a reference classic. Many movie buffs and environmentalists believe that this is our final story. The film is taken from the novel titled "Make space, make space", but the work title was changed to "Solent Green". History refers to the Earth as it evolves into the future and the environmental problems of the world become nothing short of catastrophic. The planet's natural resources have been depleted and basic foods have been reduced to simple basic foods. They come in a variety of colors, such as Solent Yellow, Solent Red and now 'Solent Green'. However, there are those who know the "real" ingredient in Solent Green and are ashamed of their own guilt and fear divine punishment. The first is a food executive named William R. Simonson (Joseph Cotton). After his death, a dedicated police detective named Robert Thorn (Charleston Heston) seeks the truth behind his apparent suicide. Although corruption reaches the top, it begins with Simonsons bodyguard, Tad Fielding (Chuck Connors) and security chief Donnovan (Roy Jenson), who point to Thorn for a waste factory. Thorn's boss, Lieutenant Hatcher (Brock Peters) believes in his suspicions, but warns him of those 'Higher and hotter' who want the case closed, but Thorn will not risk his "Job" for an easy way out. What Thorn discovers marks him to death, but like the movie, he waits for a final warning. ****
