I love playing football and I thought that this movie was great because it contained a lot of football. This was a good Hollywood / Bollywood movie and I'm glad you won 17 awards. Parminder Nagra and Kiera Knightley were good, as was Archie Punjabi. Jonathon Rheyes Meyers was great playing as a coach. Jazz (Parminder Nagra) loves to play soccer, but her parents want her to learn to cook and marry. When Jazz starts playing for a soccer team, he meets Juliet (Kiera Knightlety) and Joe (Jonathon Rhyes Meyers), who is his coach. When her parents find out about problems, her father lets her play the big game at the wedding of her sister Pinky (Archie Punjabi). In the end, her parents realize how much she likes football and let her go to play abroad.
