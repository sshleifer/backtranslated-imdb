Hood of the Living Dead had a lot to accomplish even before the opening credits began. First, any work on "... of the undead" invokes His Holiness Mr. Romero and instantaneously establishes a high level that many films can not afford to aspire to. And second, my movie-watching partner claimed to have doubts that any urban horror movie would surpass the seminal Leprechaun In the Hood. Skeptics, we settled ourselves to look. <br /> <br /> We were rewarded with a surprisingly sincere and kind-hearted zombie movie. Oh, certainly the budget is low and, of course, the amateurs friends of the directors populate the cast, but Hood of the Living Dead loves zombie movies. Cheap? Yes. But when it's so cheap, you can clearly see where LOVE holds you together. <br /> <br /> Ricky works in a lab during the day and as a substitute father for his younger brother at night. He dreams of moving out of Oakland. Before this planned escape, however, his brother is shot dead in a drive-by. The enthusiastic scientific mind of Ricky presents a superior option to CPR or 911: injections of the experimental regenerative formula of his laboratory. Sadly, the little brother wakes up in an ambulance like a bloodthirsty zombie from Oakland. Chaos and chaos! I think it's cheaper to eat your enemies than to take revenge on a drive-by, but, again, I'm a bad judge of the complexities of urban life. (How poor is a judge?) In response to a bloody scene involving four men, I said "Ah, ha, white shirts for everyone, that's how the blood comes in. I used the same technique in my own movie. low budget terror "Jordan replied:" No, that's a gang dress. "As a result, white shirts were banned from New Orleans bars." Oh.) <br /> <br /> Much of the movie It is set in someone's movie. living room, so there's a lot of hanging out and waiting for the zombies. But the characters are nice and the film is sincere: it exceeds your budget in spirit. <br /> <br /> Explanation of the zombie: When man plays with God, zombies emerge! Or maybe: Follow the test rules approved by the FDA before human experimentation! <br /> <br /> Contribution to the canon of zombies: this is the first zombie movie I've seen with a shooting from a car. When it comes to real zombies, the infection spreads with a bite as usual, but unusually the head shots do not work, it is the shots to the heart that kill. Zombies have pulses, whose absence demonstrates true death. And these zombies make very good jaguar-growl noises. <br /> <br /> Free zombie movie in jest: A mercenary named Romero. Groan. <br /> <br /> Favorite Zombie: Jaguar-little zombie brother with noise, of course!
