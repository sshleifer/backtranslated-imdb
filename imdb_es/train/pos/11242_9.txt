Anyone interested in pop music, and who is not familiar with the trends of British music in the late seventies, should be sure to see Breaking Glass at least once. The film, about the search for a young woman to make her mark in the world of music, captures the times to perfection, from open sexism, difficult economic times, social upheaval, to change in the pop culture of the world. punk brutal and terribly fey and pretentious futurism / new romanticism. The styles of music and fashion created daily in Britain in the late seventies are still being rediscovered and recycled (since 1980 there has been nothing new). This was a dazzling moment, and Breaking Glass tells a very personal story, examines the cultural scene and does it extremely well.
