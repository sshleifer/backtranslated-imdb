This particular episode of Smallville is probably the best episode to air since the meeting. This is for many reasons. For example, take the series to some of its roots. He welcomes Lionel from a supposedly long absence, with the office of Luthorcorp Square in Metropolis. This room has not been in Smallville for a long time, and seeing it again brings back many memories of Smallville's past. Not to mention, Lionels conversations with Lex are always admirable. <br /> <br /> Another nice comeback is, well you guessed it, Bart Allen (also known as Impulse), AC (also known as Aquaman) and Victor Stone (also known as Cyborg). Steven Deknight not only brings together the former judges of justice, but combines them with the Smallville formula in such a unique way, that it seems to be a feature film. <br /> <br /> From there you will get the basic story, Green Arrow forms the league, try to fly 33.1, Bart is captured, Clark saves him, and the installation is transferred to the realm com. Everything is good and elegant, with a good combination of stealth, action, rhythm and suspense. Oh, and Cyborg has some new and great improvements for the Justice League character :) <br /> <br /> The music is probably what makes this episode work so well. If you remember correctly, the first episode that Steven Deknight directed was Agless from season 4. This was a mediocre episode, but something felt out of place. Maybe it was the music, or the performance, or the fact that Clark says at the end: "We did not find you, you found us", it made people lose faith in the formula. But, fortunately, Steve Deknight redeemed himself in this episode of Justice. <br /> <br /> I had some doubts about Justice that did not reach at 10. First, the too cheesy departure from the Justice League of The Pipeline of the Ridge facility. I mean, it would have been much cooler if, for example, Green Arrow and Cyborg took off Oliver's bike (rememeber from the episode of arrow). Clark and Impulse obviously should have run, and the aquaman should have swum by another route. But that was incredibly cheesy, 2 points out of the total of 10 was eliminated. <br /> <br /> Secondly, another corny moment, not as bad as the first, but when Green Arrow says "let's save the world" . That made me tremble. In general, judging from the performances, the music, the direction and the production values, the professionals outweigh the cons, and this remains one of the best episodes in the history of Smallville, and perhaps the second best episode of the season 6. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 ...
