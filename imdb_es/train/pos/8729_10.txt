A Bug's Life is a very good animated feature. This movie is for younger children, but it's also a great movie for people my age. The story is about an ant called Flik. He wreaked havoc on his colony when he destroyed the food they were for the higher grasshoppers. He is banished and must find bigger mistakes to fix the mess. This movie is a classic because it's a good movie and it's a Pixar movie. The animation is great especially for the late 90's. The story is good, but a little more detail would suffice. The voice acting is good as with most animation movies. The music is nice to listen to. Nothing special, but he got a nomination for one of the music categories. In general, I found this movie astonished. This is a good movie for all families. I rate this movie 10/10.
