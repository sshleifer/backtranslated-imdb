It takes a while to get used to Nick Nolte's Nebraskan locutions before we can easily accept him as a famous intercontinental playwright. Once you pass the bar, it becomes the fascinating story of a man who loses everything while trying to do good. <br /> <br /> Nolte, an American, moves to Germany, marries a famous actress and is a successful success in every respect until the war is about to explode. He was visited by an American jovial, John Goodman, who convinces him to accept a job as an anti-Semitic radio announcer for the Nazis. Nolte does not have politics, but believes that it is a challenge to write a paper that is almost impossible and then play it himself. Another US secret agent will modify Nolte's radio scripts (inserting a cough here, a sneeze there) that will serve as a code for the transmission of intelligence to the Allies. However, there is a trap. No one will know about Nolte's true role as an American agent, except Goodman, Donovan and Roosevelt. If you ever find out, Americans will reject it. <br /> <br /> Nolte launches forward and her fiery transmissions are very popular in Germany. His beloved wife, Sheryl Lee, knows nothing of what is going on, nor does she care. Nolte and Lee live in what he repeatedly mentions as "a nation of two." The war ends and the problem begins. He is captured by Americans who are embittered by his betrayal. They hit him and leave him in the mud. He is rescued by Goodman, his "fairy godmother", who sends him to an anonymous existence in Greenwich Village and sends him a little money from time to time. <br /> <br /> In 1960, he manages to cultivate a friendship with his neighbor, the painter Alan Arkin, who also lost his family and affirms that the two now belong to a secret brotherhood. But its location and identity are somehow filtered and more or less adopted by a group of ancient Aryan racists, led by a dentist and a priest. The front of his house and the mailbox are painted with swastikas and accusations. He is defeated nonsense by an ex-GI. But, miraculously, his former wife is returned to him by the ancient Aryans. Another problem: later, it turns out that it is not his wife, but his younger sister who has loved him since adolescence. <br /> <br /> The end has him writing his memoirs in an Israeli jail in 1967 before his trial for crimes against humanity. It is not a happy ending. <br /> <br /> Nolte can talk to, but not see, the occupant of the cell that is over him in prison. It's Adolf Eichmann. Eichmann seems quite nice. He advises Nolte that it is a bad habit to write for fifteen hours in a row. "It's important to relax, you must learn to relax." Nolte laughs out loud and shouts: "This is how I HAVE here." The movie is full of such ironies. In a moment of his relaxed conversations, Arkin tells him that "despite everything, I still believe that people are good at heart." I do not know if the movie was a commercial success, but if it was not, that's the kind of thing that could have torpedoed it for a younger audience of theatergoers who may never have heard of Anne Frank, let alone supposedly that is definitive. statement in his diary. <br /> <br /> The fact is that it is a film for adults, and adult patients. History advances slowly, there is very little violence, there are no car chases, no gunshots, and people do not seem to be subject to the manic pressure of the speech. Many of them will probably go unnoticed by viewers who do not open up to their deliberate approach. Nolte refers to the wartime relationship between him and his wife as "a nation of two." This is a pretty compact phrase. No doubt, anyone could have a simplistic definition, but it requires a little concentration to understand its emotional importance. <br /> <br /> It is the story of a man who loses everything: his ability to write, his identity, his identity. wife (twice), his only friend, his country, his self-esteem. At one point, he stops walking down a busy New York street and simply stays there until it gets dark, when he is moved by a curious policeman. The reason he stopped is that he simply has nowhere to go. What Vonnegut is describing is much more than depression. I do not pretend to be patronizing, but it is the kind of feeling that is difficult to understand in your youth. Teenagers would like to THINK that they know what has Nolte in that place, but this really requires maturity and the sense of finitude that only maturity can bring. <br /> <br /> Remember that Robert Frost's line on the home is the place where when you go there you have to take it? Well, no place will take Nolte.
