This film is proof that Film Noire is a durable style and extremely worth living. For me, it is the best example of black cinema from Chinatown. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, you will never get the recognition you deserve. It was never promoted properly when it was first launched and had to create its fan group in places like Vanguard Cinema and word of mouth rental recommendations. <br /> <br /> I recommend to people who are looking for something more than meaningless. Entertainment rents this film and delves into its very complicated plot.
