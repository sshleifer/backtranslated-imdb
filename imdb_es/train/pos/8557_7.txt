I have to hand it to the creative team behind these "American Pie" movies. "Direct to DVD" is usually synonymous with making cheap and incompetent movies. However, last year I was pleasantly surprised when I found myself enjoying the sequel to the DVD "The Naked Mile". The filmmakers took the opportunity to offer a funny but fun little movie. This year they offer follow-up, "Beta House". This is the honest truth, "Beta House" makes the first "American Pie" movies look like "The Little Mermaid." <br /> <br /> This is not a stagnant, insipid, laughing fun. Sure, the story is a bit thin, but that's the beauty of the whole thing. In the first 10 minutes, we meet all the main characters, the new secondary characters, we will get a handful of jokes, we will meet the villains and we will establish the general plot. With all that out of the way, the film becomes a race without limits. The gags are a lot, and they were not contained in this. I'm talking about male semen, urine, dildos, chickens with dicks, sex with sheep, orgazim females and much more. Not to mention the fact that not a minute goes by without breasts or a sex scene. <br /> <br /> Upon returning from "The Naked Mile" there are John White, Jake Siegel, Steve Talley and Eugene Levy (in a supporting role as the last films). The whole cast does a good job. Steve Talley (Dwight Stifler), in particular, has a great presence of energy and screen. I predict good things for him. The film is also loaded with great movie references for those who keep their eyes open. By far the biggest laugh of the movie for me was the parody of "The Deerhunter." Classic. <br /> <br /> The conclusion is that, if you are a fan of the series, you will feel at home with "Beta House". It really pushes the boundaries of good taste, but in the end it's pretty fun.
