I never saw the program 'Next Action Hero', and until I read the other comments here, I did not know that this movie was the 'prize' of that competition. I was changing the channel and I found this, and I found myself watching, daring with enthusiasm, until the end. <br /> <br /> Yes, the plot has been made (The most dangerous game, etc.) but I expected, and almost received, the 'gotcha', how the protagonist was going to defeat the hunter at the end. I think the high tech was exaggerated (GPS) and it gave me flashbacks of the cold sweat of Night Rider, but nevertheless I was not overly exaggerated. <br /> <br /> The basic problem I had with this movie was the degree of SOD (Suspension of disbelief) that was required of the viewer. Do we really think that someone flying in a helicopter could throw countless incendiary grenades on a public bridge and NO COPS will be presented to investigate? Could a limousine make countless donuts at a Las Vegas intersection and will not COPS appear? Please Too much of that kind of thing: fun to watch, but at least be plausible, thank you very much. <br /> <br /> The final solution was good, but the ending was disappointing, with the subsequent taste of a bad episode of Star Trek. At least now I understand why the performance was so corny, except for Zane, who does not come as close to work as he deserves, in my humble opinion, they were winners of a reality show. <br /> <br /> Knock me out.
