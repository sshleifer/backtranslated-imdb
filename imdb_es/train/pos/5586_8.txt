Eva (Hedy Lamarr) has just married an older man and on the honeymoon, she realizes that her husband does not want her. Her disappointment with marriage and deprivation of love, makes Eva return to her father's house on a farm, leaving her husband. One afternoon, while bathing in a lake, his horse escapes with his clothes and a young worker retrieves it and returns it to Eva. They fall in love and become lovers. Later, her husband misses her and tries to get Eva back home. Eva refuses, and fortune takes the trio to the same place, ending the matter in a tragic way. I just watched "Extase" for the first time, and the first comment I have is about the horrible quality of VHS released in Brazil by the Brazilian distributor Video Network: the movie is only 75 minutes long, and it seems that different reels were used of film. There are some parts totally damaged, and other parts very damaged. Therefore, the beauty of the images is not achieved by the Brazilian viewer, if you have the opportunity to find this rare VHS in a rental or for sale. The film is practically a silent film, the story is very old and has only a few lines. Consequently, the characters are poorly developed. However, this film is also very daring, with the exposure of the beautiful breasts of Hedy Lamarr and his naked body and fat for the current standards of beauty. Another fantastic point is the poetic and metaphorical use of flowers, which symbolizes the exchange between Eva and her lover. The way the director directs the scenes to show the needs and deprivations of Eva is very clear. The inconclusive ending is also very unusual for a 1933 film. I liked this movie, but I hope that one day I will have the opportunity to see a restored version of 87 minutes. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "ÃŠxtase" ("Ecstasy")
