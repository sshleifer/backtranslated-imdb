I would just like to say that, no matter how low the budget of the film, the point of these films should be shown in this whole world. We do not read much anymore, instead, people want to watch movies. Having this series on DVD, has made me want to read the whole series, and I want more. Please do all 8 movies. Please, do not change any of the characters, it ruins the effect. Because I've grown up loving the actors who have played the characters. Please do all 8 movies. I want to see the message and see the message that these books and now the movies are here to portray. We do not have enough. AWESOME JOB!!!
