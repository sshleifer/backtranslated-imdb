['Based on St. Louis, by Robert Louis Stevenson, the film tells the story of a young and outgoing French Hussar captain (Jean Marc Barr) during the Napoleonic Wars. Captured in battle, he is sent to a prisoner of war camp in the Scottish Highlands, led by Major Farquhar (Richard E Grant). He soon falls in love with a local girl (Anna Friel), establishes a friendship with the commander. And discover that his long-lost grandfather, who fled France during the revolution, lives on the same street! The animated performances of the whole cast and some memorable lines make this an above-average offer.']
