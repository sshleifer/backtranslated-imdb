['This was undoubtedly the best of the &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; series. From the opening credits, you&#39;re stuck in a story of revenge that hits hard and is deeply fascinating. Sondra Locke is perfect in the role of a traumatized woman seeking revenge. Eastwood has many sequences &quot;aside&quot; that have nothing to do with the plot, but show Harry in his best version. Loaded with unforgettable characters in minor roles, this movie is fantastic and should serve as the standard for detective / action movies. This is the only Dirty Harry movie that is raw and without any &quot;fluff&quot;. I can see this again and again (well, not in a single session) because it is a rewarding spin &quot;in search of revenge&quot;. The pace is fast and several of the scenes are unforgettable. &quot;Go ahead, make me the day ... Do you feel lucky, Punk? ...&quot; Eastwood classic as only Eastwood, with his anguished and elastic expressions, and his whispering and threatening voice can do it.']
