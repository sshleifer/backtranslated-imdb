['Two adventurous teenagers, best friends, travel to Thailand for a last experience before separating and going to college. It seems like a fun time to travel an exotic land, until they meet a strange stranger who seduces them to travel to Hong Kong and put the drugs in their luggage. The local police catch them and find that justice in Asia is very different from justice in the US. UU <br /><br /> This is the main storyline of &quot;Brokedown Palace&quot; and it was a good one. The film does a good job of portraying the arbitrary and corrupt justice systems of third world nations. Actually, the portrait was quite smooth, since prison conditions are often much worse than what is shown. It serves as a reminder that no matter how badly we think our justice system is, it is pristine compared to much of the rest of the world. <br /><br /> Unfortunately, there were too many artificial situations in the movie that made history difficult. The whole escape attempt was a false fantasy. To think that friends could smuggle money for a bribe in prison with a padded bra, and not be discovered by the guards who were systematically reviewing everything the visitors brought, assumes that the guards or the spectators are fools. <br /><br /> The story also fails to put an end to the annoying question of how the drugs came to Alice&#39;s backpack (Claire Danes). Did she really agree to transport the drugs? We have to guess. It was intriguing that they kept guessing the innocence of the girls throughout the movie, but we ended the movie without really knowing if one or both girls could be guilty. Except for this considerable defect, the end was excellent and the results unexpected. <br /><br /> The performance of Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale was very solid and well done. The Danes, who have been oversold and exaggerated, arrived as actors in this film. Although his interpretation was often immature (like his character), it improved as the film progressed and the circumstances became more terrible. Beckinsale, in contrast, has been flying under the radar throughout his brief career and shines like the one of the two shoes that is suddenly in prison. She was the best performance in the movie. <br /><br /> Bill Pullman was a bad lawyer as the lawyer. His ironic and timid style is an asset in films like &quot;While You Were Sleeping&quot;, but as a lawyer in a third world country on a crusade to free two innocent girls from injustice, he had the wrong personality. <br /><br /> The tourist&#39;s look at Thailand was interesting, but it did not make me want to go there. <br /><br /> In general, an entertaining movie made unlikely in parts by the insertion of some ridiculous scenes. I gave him a 7/10.']
