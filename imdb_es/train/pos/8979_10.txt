I loved this movie, at first, the polished graphics seemed strange with the grainy recording, but I quickly got into it. There must have been thousands of hours of filming and I really admire the work done to reduce it. If you are easily surprised by drugs or violence, it may not be the movie for you, but here are some great characters (and some real throwers). Technically I also liked it very much, they should have used a new deinterlacing algorithm or maybe it was that the images looked so dark anyway, but I was not bothered by the usual artifacts seen in the video for movie transfers. (Open Water made me crazy, mainly because now there are cheap and progressive cameras available and I do not see any excuse not to shoot them if you intend to project in the cinema). I'm sorry, it's my own little rant. I definitely recommend this movie if you've ever been involved with the music scene, it has some tragic moments, but most of it is hilarious, I could be accused of laughing at the misfortune of others, but it's a classic piece.
