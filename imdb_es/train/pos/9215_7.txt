What does the Marquis de Sade have to do with Egyptian archeology and mermaid worship cults? Tobe Hooper tries to answer that question in a strange little movie. <br /> <br /> Genie is a young girl who visits her nerdy archeology father in Alexandria, Egypt. Genie is trapped by a mysterious prostitute (and a flagrant lesbian) who serves dad on the side. Dad is sent back to the site, where he discovers a grave with what appears to be a siren. Genie meets a descendant of the Marquis de Sade and falls in love with an Egyptian Hungarian (providing the hottest scenes in the film). Finally, Genie discovers that she will be a sacrifice and the prolonged and bloody climax sets in motion. Wrapped around this story is the video of the Marquis de Sade in prison, which tells of a portrait of what Genie seems to be. <br /> <br /> Robert Englund is fantastic as much as the Marquis as his descendant. His acting skills have always been erased by his makeup requirements, so he is allowed to shine here. His best performance is still in "Killer Tongue", if you have not seen him yet. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast, including young Genie, is pretty and average. The script, however, is problematic. You will quickly learn that the Marquis scenes are completely unnecessary, except that maybe the filmmakers had access to the great ensemble. The mermaid cult that eventually saves Genie makes no sense. The siren is never explained, and its link with Christianity (which is promoted throughout the film) is nothing. The film is very anti-Christian, since the archaeologist is a father who speaks with the Bible, but likes to be tied by the local prostitute. There are many scenes of depravity and violence, but Hooper probably had little idea of ​​what the writers were trying to say. I know I have no idea <br /> <br /> So, why do I recommend this movie? Is rare. There is a scene of extended sex. For the ladies, Egyptian hunky rides a completely naked horse. Englund is wonderful. You like snake's? This movie is full of them. This is like Roger Corman with a bigger budget. Knowing that Hooper somehow came up with "Crocodile" after this is pretty sad. "Night Terrors" is not perfect, but it's definitely worth a wink, an unserious look. <br /> <br /> This is qualified (R) for physical violence, sexual violence, gore, blasphemy, female nudity, male nudity, sexual content, sexual references and drug abuse. <br /> <br />
