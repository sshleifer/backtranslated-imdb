"Domino" has been widely condemned on this site for its frantic editing style and "disgusting" photography. His detractors cite his superficiality and criticize his display of "style over substance". I could not disagree more. I think "Domino" represents the absolute height of Tony Scott's film career. <br /> <br /> Having created the dominant Hollywood action movie style in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Tony Scott has progressively moved towards a more subjective cinema style. Already in "Crimson Tide", Scott used his stylistic talent to portray the internal worlds of his characters: the claustrophobia and drama inherent in the conflict aboard a nuclear submarine was reflected in the excellent use of long lenses combined with a framing of angles . This was later taken to "Enemy Of The State" and "Spy Game", which visually represented the worlds of surveillance and espionage respectively. <br /> <br /> "Man On Fire" was an extreme exit, a movement towards a more expressionist pictorial aesthetic. Here Scott used an old-fashioned crank camera and flash frames to express his character's explosive fury. Although he was not entirely successful, he introduced the techniques to find his full expression in "Domino." <br /> <br /> Snuggled in the framing device of an FBI interrogation. "Domino" presents the life of the infamous bounty hunter through his narration. Unconnected fragments of memory. Grab the memories as we all do, in fragments, flashes and brief fragments. While Domino verbally transmits his story, Scott transmits it visually, illustrating not only the events he describes, but also the point of view that guides them. She has "traces of mescaline" in her system, but her individual vision is, anyway, unusual: that of a woman who avoided luxury living for bounty hunting. <br /> <br /> It's when Domino begins to relate the events that led her to her captivity when Scott really lets go. Along with cinematographer Dan Mindel and composer Harry-Gregson Williams Scott, he organizes a postmodern canvas of contemporary Americana. Little by little we began to realize that, although it is unusual, Domino is not more disconnected than the culture "90210" that he rejected. While going through this cultural mix, Scott makes his viewer more aware of the innocence that he destroys through the disadvantaged children that the narrative introduces. Ultimately, Scott describes his salvation as the only escape we have from this surrealist journey. <br /> <br /> Criticizing this film for being too stylized is like criticizing a Picasso or a Pollock for not representing what is clearly human. Like any great painting, the meaning in "Domino" is on the surface and the surface is everything. <br /> <br /> I am not associated in any way with Scott Free, but I have always been and will continue to be a great admirer of Tony Scott's work.
