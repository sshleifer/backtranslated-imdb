"Atlantis" is a new and correct step for a Disney feature. It is a good option to make a movie of a legend as mysterious as "Atlantis". I had no expectations for this film, but after watching it, I do not understand very well why this film received such bad reviews. Even in my country, the critics were not positive. <br /> <br /> "Atlantis" is not a perfect movie, but it's still one of Disney's best, I even doubt that this film has ever had the reputation of "Disney classic". Well, that's another case. It's funny to think that this science fiction movie was directed by the same directors as "Beauty and the Beast" and "The Hunchback" (so Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale are trying to get away from the reputation of their monster movies. I'm kidding). <br /> <br /> Well, enough nonsense. "Atlantis" is an observable, exciting and very pleasant movie. Even this movie is an action function with PG rating, it is also suitable for children, in my opinion (parents who want to say otherwise, do not kill me for writing this, he). <br /> <br /> The story is a bit predictable, but it does not ruin the movie. The animation inspired by the comics is suitable for the film and the scenario is a departure from the usual Disney style. It is colorful, dark and detailed. The sequences of Deep Canvas are quite impressive. The movie is also fun at times, I even laughed more than I laughed through the movie. (SPOILERS) The characters in this movie are also very nice, but unfortunately there is not enough screen time to get to know everyone, so some characters are left behind (SPOILERS). <br /> <br /> James Newton Howard's score is absolutely great. It is bold and exotic. (SPOILER) The most impressive thing about this movie is how they make the Atlantean language look very natural, ethnic and authentic. It's really amazing (SPOILERS OVER) <br /> <br /> The script is tight and well written, but there are still some unanswered questions in the story. But, fortunately, there is not much of them. <br /> <br /> So do yourself a favor, do not listen to the critics and look at "Atlantis", because it's waiting for you ...
