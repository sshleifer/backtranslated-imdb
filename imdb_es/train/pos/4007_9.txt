A fierce and surprisingly intelligent work by the talented British writer Hanif Kureishi, who wrote "My Beautiful Laundrette" (this is the best he has done since then). These are smart people whose lives do not add up much. They have squandered what they have been given and they are largely empty containers. The only character on the screen who is alive is the mother of the title, but she feels dead inside until a maintenance staff shows her some affection and awakens her to the joys of sex. He has his own motives, but Kureishi treats him with great compassion. This is a film in which people and places feel familiar, where the characters exist beyond the limits of the screen. In some ways it's a bit like "Sunday, Bloody Sunday," but it's a harder job. The director, Roger Michell, allows the scenes to be built instinctively. And she is beautifully acted. <br /> <br /> When the mother of the same name Anne Reid betrays her life wasted in every gesture. There is not a false note in his extraordinarily vivid performance, and that very good actor Daniel Craig shows shadows in his character that not even Kureishi has taken advantage of. If the film touches a false note, it may be in the character of the untalented daughter, trapped in a messy affair with the man her mother seduces (or should be the other way around) and even more disordered life, but that's the way it is. so well played by Cathryn Bradshaw that it hooks you though. The film is also extremely beautiful to watch (DoP Alwin Kuchler) and should be classified, without hesitation, as the best British film of the year.
