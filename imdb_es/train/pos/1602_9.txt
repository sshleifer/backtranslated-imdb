I bought the video quite late in my compilation and probably would have saved a lot of money if I had bought it before. It invariably replaces anything else on those "Cosmo moon" nights. Cher and Olympia certainly deserve their awards, but this is really an impeccable joint performance of a magnificent script. What? Do not you know what a "Cosmo moon" is?
