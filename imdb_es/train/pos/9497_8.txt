['Absolutely fantastic garbage ... this has it all: nudity, good fight scenes, gore, action, explosions, etc. It is also starring the wonderful Belinda Mayne as Ingrid, not as Olga as the other critic pointed out, although Olga becomes Ingrid later in the film (you&#39;ll have to see her to see what I mean). <br /><br /> I will not bother to enter the story because it is too long and not very interesting. The relationship between Ingrid and her brother Bo (Robert Ginty) is interesting: watch the scene of the theft of towels to see what I mean. <br /><br /> The fight scenes were both quite good and then they were spoiled by some really bad quality gore effects that seemed to have been made by the team that made City of the Walking Dead (ie, blood of a strange color sprouting from the neck injuries). <br /><br /> I advise fans of low-budget garbage to check it if they can track a copy, although it&#39;s pretty weird and I can not see anyone bothering to throw it back so it gets rarer in a few. years. <br /><br /> Anyway, I would recommend it only for the great nude scenes of Belinda Mayne. That lady is a fox!']
