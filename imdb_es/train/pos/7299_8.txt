Poor cast, terrible script full of holes, hot blonde is eaten alive, the evil scientist has a very nasty mustache, a man takes a platoon of trained gunmen and comes out victorious, terrible special effects, they fix the problem by blowing the head out of the monster. .. Awesome. The only thing missing was an unnecessary graphic sex scene during one of the murders. LOL. Good fun packed with predictable twists and laughable liners. I enjoyed this movie very much, but before seeing it, make sure you're going to laugh. I recommend this movie to people who can watch a movie and not take it so seriously. I can not, in my sane mind, think that this movie was made for people to take it seriously. However, if you can see it and relax and just enjoy it, I really believe that you can enjoy this movie the way it was meant to be enjoyed. Very simple. So get some popcorn and a couple of beers and have a fun night with some friends and this movie. It brought a little joy to my life.
