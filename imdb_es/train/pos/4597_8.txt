Having first achieved fame with Drunken Master, Jackie Chan was again the center of attention with Project A of 1983, a hugely enjoyable pirate movie that re-established him as a great star. By the time Police Story was released two years later, the extraordinary exaggeration surrounding Jackie was reaching its peak, and the crowd flocked to see this frantic mix of incredible tricks, scenes of brutal fights and questionable comedy. It broke numerous box office records and inspired a 50% increase in the number of police recruits, but, seen 20 years later, is it good? <br /> <br /> Like an action movie, Police Story, without a doubt, stands up. There are several fabulous fight scenes, some stunt scenes that recall the best of Chan's hero, Buster Keaton, and an exciting and violent climatic fight. Jackie's performance is also very strong, and while the frequent incursions in comedy work diminish a little the impact of the film, her charisma carries it out. In addition, by presenting our hero as a limit psychopath whose recklessness puts others in danger, Jackie took great risks ... although no one in the event seems to have noticed! When praising Police Story as a simple 'Good vs. Evil ', the battle critics played down the ambiguity of tone of the film, and although they are not the Brothers Karamazov, in describing such uncertainty, the film represented a remarkable and praiseworthy change of conventional ideas. > <br /> In short, this is still a quality movie "popcorn" * (although you can empty your stomach while many villains are pushed or deposited in showcases in the final scene of the movie) - a powerful action movie and boisterously entertaining that is among the best of his period.
