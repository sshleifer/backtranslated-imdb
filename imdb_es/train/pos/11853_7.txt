['Life Pod is one of those movies that you only look at and try not to analyze too much. The acting is quite amateur, at best. The special effects are obviously low budget, but not so bad. The story line is quite common, but with an interesting twist. The computer works in a disorderly way, but it is not exactly a computer, and the execution of it is very understandable when the truth is revealed. Still, the film has its moments and is quite visible. For me, at least part of the charm of this movie is the prominent role of Kristine DeBell. She may not be the best actress in the world, but as a former playmate of the month, she&#39;s cute enough. In general, Life Pod is very similar to other low-budget science fiction films of the 1980s and somewhat predictable. <br /><br /> The White White Lines bit is cute, if it is completely inaccurate. The last of the shares of White Star Lines Company was purchased by Cunard Lines 1947 and the last ship to sail under the colors of White Star was the Britannic (not the sister of Titanic) that was sold as scrap in 1960.']
