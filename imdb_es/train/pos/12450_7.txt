['We rented and saw this short work (&lt;90 minutes). It is by far the best treatment that Modesty has received in the film, and its creator, Peter O&#39;Donnell, agrees to participate as a &quot;Creative Consultant&quot;. The character, and we who love her, are treated with respect. Spiegel&#39;s address is the best he has done to date, and the casting was very well done. Alexandra Staden is almost physically perfect as a complement to the original illustrations of Jim Holdaway&#39;s Modest. A great discovery by whoever has thrown it! Raymond Cruz as a young Rafael Garc√≠a was also excellent. I hope that Tarantino &amp; co. It will continue to earn more in the series. I&#39;m especially interested in seeing who they would choose to be the incomparable Willie Garvin!']
