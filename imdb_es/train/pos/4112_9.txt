The title is onomatopoeic, the sound of a tram that hits the rails. It is metaphorical for everything that the people who live in the dumpster can not have. The misery of these people is illustrated in the passing tram, which represents the relatively unattainable rich life of the middle class. The pathos of the little boy and his beloved but sadly insane father is very touching. This was Kurosawa's first color film and uses beautifully stunning tones, colors that can only be seen in dreams. The film is surreal and surpasses in beauty. Compassion for humanity is the underlying force, but as always, Kurosawa focuses on capturing the beauty of the film. It is a masterpiece of a film genius.
