Sabrina the Teenage Witch was one of my favorite television shows of life: V used to watch consecutive episodes every day when he got home from school. So far I think I've seen all the episodes at least once and the whole series 3 or 4 times. Melissa Joan Hart plays the perfect teen / witch with normal teenage problems that we can all relate to. It's fun, smart, outgoing, witty and much more. Caroline Rhea and Beth Broderick fit very well in the role of Sabrina's aunts. Zelda, the intelligent scientist, and Hilda the crazy, crazy, make a perfect balance in the life of Sabrina. Although I must admit that the college years are not as good as those in high school, but that does not mean they were not good yet. I think the ending was amazing, although it was not what I expected, it made sense and I loved it anyway. :)
