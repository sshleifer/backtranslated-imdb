Contrary to popular belief, this title, at least for me, is not that bad. In fact. I consider it as a favorite movie of all time. The welding of stories was not structured too well when considering the differences between the series, however, despite all this, it can be seen with enough joy. For a feature film of its time, the scenes are well proportioned and the characters remain consistently credible. <br /> <br /> The sound / audio track is one of my personal favorites. Almost everything has a correct sound effect and many of the voices adapt to the characters much better than their counterparts in the United States, which are now badly fused. The timing is perfect with every shot. I had some problems with the casting for the "extraterrestrial" voices (excuse the raw names, it's been a while since I've seen it). Otherwise, however, the cast seemed perfectly balanced. I feel and believe in the characters in this movie. Copies are often a subject with which I have rarely agreed for so long. I loved the OSD of that time, but the castings often disappoint the series. <br /> <br /> At this point, I would like to add that this was one of the first anime I saw in my life. I have a historical value for me, but even after seeing the original Megazone 23, it remained stronger and more seen in my collection. <br /> <br /> As far as I know, the title only came to the US. UU In Texas. Personally I think it's a great shame. If the correct audience had been subject to it, I think Robotech the movie would have been accepted and would not have tarnished over the years. I'm involved with the anime every day of my life and everyone I've shown this movie thought it was a very well done title. <br /> <br /> Watching the movie after its separate components will allow the viewer to notice the obvious plot holes between shows. However, without seeing the originals, a viewer would not really notice. Since the animation is identical in style, there was no reason to question it in its day. The United Kingdom had very limited access to anime. Laser discs were the most productive means. Personally I like the way Carl had the balls to at least push the genre. I mean, Harmony was not going to put cash in for the series to be published. <br /> <br /> Despite the few delicate flaws that people have had with this movie, the feeling of the eighties keeps me in love. If you look at Megazone 23 now, to its original audio in Japanese, or to the new dub, I think you'll be very disappointed with the OSD. Refocus on the original soundtrack of Bubblegum Crisis Dub and imagine a new audio from the eighties in E.V.E. <br /> <br /> Saying all this. The popularity of this movie today is very likely due to its rarity in the open market. Personally, he created a collection for me. Now I am traveling the world in search of merchandise of the three components that invented it and if I ever get to know Carl Macek, I will give him my hand for the effort and I will buy him a pint or a box to get into the anime.
