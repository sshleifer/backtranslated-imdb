What would happen if a GI platoon of the Japanese army was sent in time 400 years right in the middle of the feudal wars that led to the formation of the Tokugawa Shogunate? Great launch, right? The film does exactly what it says on the tin. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the writers did not bother to explain the, usually laughable in science fiction movies, the scientific mumbo of time transport. Not how or why. They just did it. However, the transport sequence of time itself is trippy as hell and quite beautiful, if not a little outdated. It is not as silly as one could imagine. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film follows the premise of a T. But while it loses a bit of steam with the various subplots that follow the arrival of the GIs in medieval Japan, it picks up with a devastating battle sequence. Without a doubt it is the main order of the day. The whole concept and, by extension, the film itself, probably originated from this simple launch: what would happen if the GIs equipped with the latest in modern war fought against the samurai? And the boy does it. <br /> <br /> The main battle sequence that spans more than half an hour is probably one of the best of its kind in the action / war movies of the 70s. Not only is it relentless and tiring in terms of rhythm and length, it is also a combination of excellent styles and techniques that only has unique premises like GI Samurai can deliver. I mean, where else would you have the opportunity to present tanks, complete ninjas with shuriikens, a helicopter and samurai in the same photo? The G.I. The platoon led by Lieutenant Iba literally tears hundreds of extras, firing them with machine guns, mortars, grenades and tanks. <br /> <br /> This mix of styles is with one foot firmly rooted in the extensive jidai- Kagemusha epic of Kurosawa or Samurai Banners by Hiroshi Inagaki, while the other is in western action and war movies. There are stylistic touches (like the wonderful shots in slow motion and bloody violence) that remind Sam Peckinpah or Enzo G. Castellari circa Keoma. Japanese cinema has always been influenced by westerns and other works of Hollywood and vice versa, and G.I. Samurai effortlessly converts this East-West-West melting pot into an exciting movie. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers fortunately take the whole thing seriously and the film greatly benefits from it. It's not that the ironic mentality is completely absent, it's just that it does not try to please audiences that are so bad that they're good at laughing at their movies. The budget was probably high, as is evident in the hundreds of extras, elaborate costumes (very decent for a production that is not a traditional jidai-geki) and special effects. The work and editing of the camera are top-notch, almost better than a film without higher artistic ambitions deserves. <br /> <br /> It is not exempt from flaws either, of course. There are many scenes of "songs", where all kinds of Japanese songs of rock, disco and country of the 70s play on montages (there is a bonding scene, a scene of amorous interest, a scene of "war is hell", etc.). The songs themselves are pretty lame and cheesy and detract from the whole thing. Even though his watch is 140 minutes long, it flies like a bullet for the most part. Still some scenes, flashbacks and subtopics in the first half could have been cut to a more strict effect. <br /> <br /> The cast also deserves a mention, with such prominent names as Sonny Chiba, Isao Natsuyagi (Goyokin, Samurai Wolf), Tsunehiko Watase (The Yakuza Papers) and Hiroyuki Sanada, all of them hitting the right notes.
