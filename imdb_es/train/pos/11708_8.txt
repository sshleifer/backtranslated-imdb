The reason why people say that this movie scared them is because they did it! That means that the purpose of the film was felt by a few who saw it. The first time I saw this movie scared me and made me think about life and religion. This is not a bloody and bloody movie, but it's the kind you'd think might happen to the way the movie was written. Of course, non-believers will say it's just a science fiction movie. The truth is that this movie is a must for your suspense collection, even if you have a religious vision. If you are a fan of classic thrillers (Omen..etc) this is one of them and you should have it. I never saw the sequel (Distant Thunder), but I think it takes up where this movie ends.
