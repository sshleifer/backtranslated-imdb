A fairly normal but courageous film by Mrs. Hawn to promote this vehicle as an executive producer and as a protagonist vehicle. Although she ends up vindicated, she is willing to present herself as the silly queer. How many other actresses on the A list have had butt injury problems since this movie? Not many Does this mean that the female ass can not be funny? Goldie surpasses other actresses because she has maintained a screen image and ventures into projects that others do not. Sandra Bullock occasionally goes there, for example, Miss Sympathy, but Nicole Kidman would never manage. A wonderful interpreter. It's great to see some of my favorite actors, Chris Sarandon and Cliff DeYoung in particular.
