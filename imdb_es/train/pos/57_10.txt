I have to say that this is one of the best movies I've seen! I got bored and watched on television. and I found "Home Room" and it was already in about 5 minutes, but I was hooked. It was so interesting and touching. It shows what can happen in anyone's life. I give it a 10, more if possible. The director / writer and the actors did an incredible job. I think teenagers should watch this movie and learn from it. It was great, drama, mystery, and more. I cried for hours! I think the director / writer should write more movies like this. I loved! I did not even know about this movie, which is sad because it was very good. I wish I could go to the cinema so that more people see it.
