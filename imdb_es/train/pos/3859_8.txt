De Vierde Man by Paul Verhoeven (The Fourth Man) is one of the most fascinating thrillers I've ever seen. It really was a pleasant surprise. The story refers to the bi-sexual writer Gerard (Jeroen Krabbe), as he is attracted to a relationship with the beautiful hairdresser Christine (Ren√©e Soutendijk), but in Gerard's twisted mind there could be more in history. Verhoeven and the director of photography Jan De Bont create a beautiful and thick atmosphere full of surreal and disgusting sexual images, this really pushes you towards the story, you do not want to see it, but you can not get away. This is, by far, the best Verhoeven movie (maybe surpassed only by Robocop) True The Fourth Man is not for everyone, some of the sex scenes are quite free (just ignore them, but trust me, if you look during less ten minutes you'll be hooked in. This is one of those movies you need To know how it ends, a true whodunit in the tradition of Hitchcock, convincing, controversial and exciting, I even like the metaphor of the spider. <br /> <br / > 8/10
