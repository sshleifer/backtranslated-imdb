This is out there There's not much to be said about it, except that it's a song rarely played in bestiality movies. I can see why this movie was banned for so long, the issues discussed within the film are still a small taboo because most of the world will say that the eroticism in the film is well deserved and fits the mood of the film. It is a good film that is well acted and has a purpose ... to surprise the viewer and cross the boundaries that we do not see often in the movies. I found this movie on the network that I thought I could review. I enjoyed the movie because it is stimulating and at the same time erotic. Something you rarely see in today's movies.
