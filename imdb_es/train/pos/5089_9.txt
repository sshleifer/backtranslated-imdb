It is true that he does not follow the book very closely, but it is still a very entertaining version of the story. Swayze was much better in the role than I expected. And Doody avoided the representation of the "silly woman out of her depth in the desert" that most of us probably expected (see Kate Capshaw in "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Destiny"). <br /> <br /> In any case, it's incredibly better than Richard Chamberlain's horrible pair of Quatermain movies. <br /> <br /> It is very reminiscent of a western in many aspects. The only thing that did not matter to me was all mysticism, but I suppose that is an integral part of the genre. Like "how can you have a story of African adventures without doctresses witches and preternaturally wise wandering tribes?" Heh
