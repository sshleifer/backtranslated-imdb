First of all, I do not like almost all of Neil Simon's films. But there is something about this that is unique, that attracts me, and I would say that it is one of the most entertaining comedies I've seen. The second time I saw it, the connection was clear. When did Neil Simon meet my grandmothers? <br /> <br /> Ah, they fear they could sue, so they became men. And how boring it would be if they were just housewives, showing stars is more fun. Well, this is a personal review, and my grandmother still lives at 97 (she even survived Walter Matthau's magnificent imitation of her!) I would deny it, but some of you must find resonance in these characters. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I have little tolerance with George Burns, but somehow it became one of the best supporting performances I can remember (and my late grandmother even enjoyed it, although she did not recognize the notables similarities that he shared with the character in the film). br /> <br /> Very ethnic taste, and above, or you will laugh and laugh or you will turn this off. For me, the pleasure lasts.
