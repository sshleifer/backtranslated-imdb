This is one of the best movies out there and says a lot that it was for television. I really wish it was in d.v.d. <br /> <br /> Helen Hunt gave such a raw performance. She played a rookie cop thrown in the case of serial killer perfectly. When she falls apart because he kills another child it was amazing. She is so alone, so he arrives at her. When she talks about her mother! WOW! <br /> <br /> Steven Weber as the serial killer was so shocking! He really brought her into his dark world. He was worthy of Oscar When he talks about killing children, it's scary! When he realizes who she really is! What a scene !! <br /> <br /> They really do not do it that way anymore. It was a true thriller without being bloody.
