A film that dramatized an understandable reluctance to face the imminent arrival of the Second World War, when a Spanish Republican, sent by his soon overthrown government, (Charles Boyer) infiltrated England seeking support for his cause in trying to Influence the rich owners of the mines so that they do not sell coal to the fascists in Spain. He annoys the locals, being convincingly beaten in a scene and, later, in the film, he confronts a crowd of angry miners who see him as another threat to their unstable lives. Despite the socio-economic hierarchy, xenophobia and world politics, this film delves into a dark intrigue and suspense involving infidel compatriots played by Katina Paxinou and Peter Lorre, and is expertly shot in numerous dark lighting scenes in a gloomy hotel by James Wong. Howe, and he manages more than once to get under your skin.
