It should not be confused with the British black comedy of the same name that came out in 1994. But this shallow grave is a worthy addition to the slasher of the 80s. <br /> <br /> The plot is = 4 girls of a brotherhood of a The convent is planning the spring break of her life in Florida, but her plans are suspended when one of them witnesses how a man murders a local woman, and when he realizes that they saw him, well, let's say that It becomes a mortal fact. The game of cat and mouse, and things get even worse when it turns out to be the local sheriff. <br /> <br /> The superficial tomb in my opinion is one of the nicest jokes that emerged in the 80s, especially in recent years. The 80s, which was when the slashers went down a bit, this was one of the few that did not and this movie should be better known, it's a shame it is not. This is a movie that really confuses stereotypes (just try to guess who the final girl will be, I totally misunderstood it). The main cast is nice and it's one of those movies that you expect to escape, which of course they do not. This, coupled with the softness of the first half-hour jars of the film (in a good way) with some flashes of real evil (the second murder is a real shake) and some unexpected sleaze (although this is not a High I did not wait for the topless scene in which a woman is strangled with her own bra (accompanied by a hysterical and religious radio), in a movie of the late 80s. <br /> <br /> There is one or two Bad things about this movie, well, not only bad, like the secondary plot with the two teenagers that do not go anywhere and the ending that was stupid and more the inability of the Deputy to follow the logic There is no sharp implement in SHALLOW SERIOUS but, in my opinion, at least, it is a slasher movement.The scenes in which the malevolent Sheriff pursues the girls in the forest are tense and exciting. <br /> <br /> In general, a very nice killer and that it's worth it, with excellent performances e the four main girls and that psychopath. sheriff.
