['They probably could have skipped something from the beginning. I&#39;m not sure why this starts in the Asian part of Turkey. If it were because starting in the Mediterranean, they could have come closer from modern Lebanon. <br /><br /> One of the cameras and equipment arrives at the Bakhtyari tribe, it is the beginning of an incredible 48 day trip. 50,000 people with approximately 250,000 goats, camels, cattle and horses make this incredible trek through what appears to be a fast moving Karun river. They use rafts that stay afloat when inflating goat skins; You can see where the head and legs were removed. The other &quot;bank&quot; of the river was very steep, I guess there will be an increase of 60 degrees. <br /><br /> Seeing that was incredible, but there was much more to come. To reach the pastures, they also had to cross an important mountain that had about 4 feet of snow, if not more. Being able to climb this mountain was quite surprising in itself, but they (and all the animals) climbed this mountain barefoot! Yes, barefoot. <br /><br /> The only drawback of this documentary were some of the intertitles with bad humor attempts. <br /><br /> If you want to see a documentary of the silent era, or the incredible challenges that this tribe not only faces, but conquest. This is just an incredible document from a little-known group of people facing all kinds of challenges.']
