I remember seeing this movie at the West End theater in Louisville, Kentucky, when I was a kid. The scene in which Dr. Carmus finds the gardener's coffin and the corpse that is breathed in it was the most terrifying part of the film for me, only intensified by the darkness of the film. I also wondered about the people hanging from the trees at the end, until I recognized the part of the film in which the name of the Blackwood family of Blackblood was changed, due to the fact that in the family history there was a character He was known for his many hangings of several people. Sir Thomas Blackwood seemed to take advantage of the deaths caused by his family. I also noticed that when Foster enters the cemetery door for the first time, he is careful to notice the sharp object of the door, where he finds his end. I would not hesitate to recommend this movie to horror movie lovers.
