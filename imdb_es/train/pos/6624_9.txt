I highly recommend this movie. Set in the future of Bladerunner-esquire de Paris in 2054, it is, in most cases, a classic black film script: a lady in danger, a sister who tries to find her, an honest policeman who fights against everyone. Luckily, avoid being stereotyped and combine a pretty good story with interesting and innovative images. The film may remind Sin City in appearance, but it has an even sharper and more graphic look that I found really compelling. Each frame, each sequence seems that it could have been extracted from the desktop of an expert graphic designer. In terms of history and works of art, you can find winks that go back to the forties (or even before with the classic views of the Eiffel Tower and Sacre Couer) and movies like Casablanca, as well as a bleak future where our Destinations. governed by corporations. Make any excuse you need to watch this movie.
