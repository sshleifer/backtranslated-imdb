The idea is a very short film with a lot of information. Interesting, entertaining and leaves the viewer wanting more. The producer has produced a short film of excellent quality that can not be compared to any other short film he has seen. I rated this movie in the highest possible grade. I also recommend showing it to office managers and business people in any establishment. What emerges from this is the fact that people with ideas are never heard, their voice is never heard. It is a lesson that any office that wants to move forward must learn. I hope that what is produced will produce a second part of this "idea". I hope to see the sequence. Once again, congratulations to the Halaqah media for producing a film of excellence and quality with a lesson in mind.
