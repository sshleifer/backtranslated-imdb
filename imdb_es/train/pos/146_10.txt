I came to the end of this and almost shouted "No, no, no, NO! It can not end here! There are too many unanswered questions!" The commitment of the dishwashers? The disappearance of Mona? The arrival of Helmer? The "zombie"? Small brother saved by his father? And what about the head ??????? "ARGH !! Then I read that at least two of the cast members had passed away and I have to say that I know I probably would not be true to Lars von Trier's vision, but I would gladly look at the substitute actors to see the ending I had. planned! Of course, it would be difficult to find someone to play Helmer as the character deserves. Helmer, the doctor you love to hate! I think I still have to see on the screen a more selfish, alien and just character! But, I could ignore a change in the actors ... I just have to know how it ends!
