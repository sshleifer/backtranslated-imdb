I was short to give "Mr. Blandings builds the house of his dreams" 10/10 due to an aspect that makes us tremble a little in the 21st century: the fact that a black person is the faithful servant (something that reminds us to Stepin Fetchit). But other than that, the movie is a hoot. Portraying the middle class couple from New York, Jim (Cary Grant) and Muriel Blandings (Myrna Loy), trying to build a house in Connecticut, this movie has something for everyone. <br /> <br /> Grant is his usual personality, while Loy does quite well as merely a wife. But Melvyn Douglas adds some real laughs when Jim and Muriel's lawyer, Bill Cole, seems to have more plans than he makes clear. As for the house itself ... throughout most of the movie, you probably feel ambiguous about whether you want to live there or not. Builders, contractors and others also offer their fair share of laughter. <br /> <br /> In general, a comedy classic. Also starring Louise Beavers, Reginald Denny, Sharyn Moffett, Connie Marshall and Jason Robards Sr.
