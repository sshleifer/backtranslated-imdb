When my 14-year-old daughter and her friends get together for movie night, there's a movie they insist on seeing again and again: You guessed it, K-911, the third installment of the successful K-9 franchise starring all Dad favorite of television, Jim Belushi. <br /> <br /> Friends, I knew it was possible to use a VHS tape, but a DVD ?! This has been played so often that it is starting to jump; it is not a joke! But, of course, you'll have that when you have such a lovely, brilliant movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, we must thank the one and only Tom Hanks for introducing us to the beloved Cop-Dog genre. with Turner and Hooch; however, even that film does not live up to the excellence presented in the three K-9 movies. <br /> <br /> Some nay-sayers say that Belushi fainted with this third film of the series. Poppycock, I say. While you may suspect that a third installment, direct to the video, does not seem to be something worth seeing, it would prove to be wrong after watching this quality film. <br /> <br /> I will not. Give the plot, but I'll say that Belushi and his panting partner give their best performance so far, one that will make you howl with laughter! It is a pity that John Belushi is not alive to see the great advances that his brother has made in the world of acting. <br /> <br /> I recommend that your teenage daughter present this movie to her BFF at her next slumber party. Do not forget the puppy chow!
