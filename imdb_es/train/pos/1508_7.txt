This movie is good for what it is, and unpretentious; However, I would not see it twice: I'm a Peter Cushing completista and that's why I saw it. The best asset of this film is: BREVITY and EFFECTIVENESS. Compared to other similar films, it is NOT dragged forever, since each of the four segments (plus one) lasts less than 30 minutes, and the last one is less than 10. Good vibration extraordinary. In the first segment, the horror writer who suffers from the "writer's block" moves to an old isolated house in search of inspiration. He finds even too much when he begins to visualize one of his fictitious fools. Conspiracy of the plot similar to PREMATURE BURIAL. Good use of the turn of the point of view: if the writer is mentally ill ... or (as the end shows) his trophy wife wants her lover to play with the husband's phobias to drive him crazy and secure his properties. But will the ingenious Bimbo survive to enjoy the fruit of her ingenious plan? <br /> <br /> In the second segment, two friends lost a long time ago meet in the same secluded house, but it seems that they can not help visiting a strange horror. Museum with the wax statue of the lost love of his youth, which had once separated them. From the guardian of the Gothic museum, they learn that the portrayed woman is a dead ax holding a murderer ... or was it? <br /> <br /> The third segment was the least interesting for me. <br /> <br /> The fourth shows a horror movie actor, who believes he is the best of all, sunk in the depths of low-budget films. Looking for a disguise to give more credibility to his fictitious vampire, he gets the real deal. This segment also lacks the solidity of the first two. <br /> <br /> Acting is fair, with the 2 initial segments that contribute the most. Good movie, taken with a grain of salt. It's not the best Cushing, or Lee ... but it's worth seeing.
