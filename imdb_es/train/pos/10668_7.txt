As many critics have pointed out here, the film's version differs quite a bit from the scenic version of the story. I have never seen the theatrical version of the story and, therefore, I have a film review more favorable than many other reviews. Maybe Richard Attenborough was not the best choice for the director of the film, but the film is still an entertaining story of several dancers trying to make it big on the choreographer Michael Douglas' show. The film works well by not selecting any famous actor or actor to end up in the final test group. In this way, our focus is on the movements of the dancers and on individual stories and struggles as they unfold during a marathon of tests. Douglas probably is not the best option for paper either. Apparently, some songs were cut in favor of a new one, and the clich√© story was added between a dancer and the choreographer. I must say with all justice that this was the weakest part of the film. The repeated intrusions that Cassie made during the tests seem to reflect the almost desperate pleas that one often has to make when engaging in artistic professions in the absence of talent and / or luck. However, this aspect of the film has been killed in the past, and it is curious to see this tired old shoe kick its heel once again. The revelations of the dancers themselves began quite promising with the number "I can do that", but then advanced a little at several points while the dancers told their stories. Frankly, their stories differed little from real-life people who never have an opportunity like this. *** of 4 stars.
