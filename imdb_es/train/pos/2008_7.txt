The original Vampire (1998) is one of my favorites. I was curious to see how a sequel would work considering that they did not use any of the original characters. I was quite surprised how this developed. As a general rule, the sequels are never as good as the original ones, with some exceptions. Although this was not a great movie, the writer did well to keep the main themes and the vampire tradition of the first one in contact. Jon Bon Jovi was initially an inconvenience, but he proved to be a decent half Slayer. However, I doubt that anyone can beat James Wood's performance in the first one, unless you bring Buffy. <br /> <br /> In general, this was a decent clock and I would see it again. <Br /> <br /> I was left with two questions, however ... what happened to Jack Crow and how Derek Bliss became a murderer? I guess we'll have to leave that to the imagination.
