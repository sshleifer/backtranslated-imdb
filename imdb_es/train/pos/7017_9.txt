You spend most of this two-hour movie asking "What is the main character's story?" <br /> <br /> Will Smith, like a low profile "Ben Thomas" will keep you guessing. The last 20-25 minutes are when you discover it, and it's a shock ... but you knew something dramatic was going to be revealed. Until then, Smith plays it mysterious, almost harassing people. You know he has a good reason to do it, but it is never really explained, once again, so that we can continue to guess until the end. <br /> <br /> Everything, included again and again but playing the romance with Rosario Dawkins ("Emily Posa") can make some viewers feel frustrated or want to leave this movie ... but not because The final long segment gathers all the pieces of this puzzle. <br /> <br /> This is a two-hour movie and not the typical macho, action-packed Will Smith movie. In fact, the most striking aspect could be seeing the sad and drawn face of Smith throughout this story. He almost does not look like him in several shots. It seems he has lost weight and is sick. Smith does a great job of portraying a man carrying a lot of sadness. <br /> <br /> As it often makes a good movie, this movie will leave you thinking long after the end credits.
