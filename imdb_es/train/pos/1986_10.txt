['A tour of strength! OK, the child who plays Oliver is a little too sweet! Starting with the great cinematography, the color, the costumes and the most impressive performances, this is a must-see movie. I have seen several adaptations of this great novel, but this is above all and is a musical to boot! He is a masterful Fagan, he never abandons his character to make a song. You never really know if you like it or not, the same feeling I got in the book. In other versions you hate it from beginning to end. Bill Sykes ... when you read the book it&#39;s bad, and then he&#39;s in this movie. Oliver Reed was a teacher. His wife directed this masterpiece. I went and saw his latest movie, Gladiator, based on his many excellent performances, not to see the main ones. The music adjusts to the times and the mood. Who will buy this beautiful movie? You should!']
