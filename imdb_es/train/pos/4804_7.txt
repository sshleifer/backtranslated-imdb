I've seen this movie on DVD a couple of times, the first time, the second half after the hour and then I went back to the first hour. an entertaining and entertaining film, thank God not kiera knightley, refreshing and gives us all a genuine vision of the difficult life of Queen Victoria and the difficult decisions she had to make. There is nothing wrong with the movie, no really bad language or anything of a sexual nature that offends the family. It might encourage children to do a little research about Queen Victoria and perhaps lesser-known characters like Conroy and Lord Melbourne
