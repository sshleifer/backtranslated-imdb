Perhaps the most polished and accomplished Indian film: Pakeezah does not fall into any of the pitfalls commonly associated with Bollywood film (ie, stickiness, farce, wholesale and unsuccessful imitation of Western movie themes / genres). Pakeezah is indigenous in the Subcontinent and authentic, almost like Madam Butterfly in its plot. The characters are well developed, in direction, although sometimes they are not refined by current standards, they are perceptive and convincing. The Urdu-speaking media at the time of Pakeezah were masters of underestimation and how dialogue conveys the subtleties of the era! The performance (in particular, the 'aspect' and the dynamics between the characters) is a delight, although the nuances can be lost in the contemporary spectators or those who do not know the customs and customs of Muslim India. <br /> <br />, with a captivating script is a beautiful musical score, enhanced by the protagonist who shows an eminent domain of Indian classical dance (kathak). As with most romantic tragedies, the heroine must die, but she does not say goodbye to the audience without the viewer feeling that she has been part of a truly memorable film experience. Pakeezah is surely the highlight of what Indian cinema has produced and is unlikely to have parallelism.
