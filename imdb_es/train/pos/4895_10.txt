It's weird that I sit in front of the TV specifically to watch a particular show. It's even weirder when I really enjoy the show at the end, but Last of the Blonde Bombshells was one of the best movies I think I've seen. <br /> <br /> A remarkable cast, led by Dame Judi Dench and Ian Holm, and an excellent, witty and moving combo script to make it a truly rewarding experience. I really can not express how good I thought it was, so I will not try it, I'll just say, if you have the opportunity, SEE IT !!!! I just hope it comes out on video.
