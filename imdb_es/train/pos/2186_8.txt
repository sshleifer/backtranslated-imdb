and what combo Two of the great singers of the century star in this underestimated musical. He writes music, she writes song lyrics, and both work for Basil Rathbone, who can not write either because his wife died (she actually got fat!). The best scene is the number of the pawnshop where Bing sings an improvised number while the swing band pulls their instruments out of the hock. Simply wonderful. And this is a rare starring role for Broadway legend, Mary Martin, and she's pretty good. Charley Grapewin, John Scott Trotter, William Frawley, Oscar Levant (once again the maniac pianist), Charles Lane and Helen Bertram as co-star. And who knew that Rathbone could be fun?
