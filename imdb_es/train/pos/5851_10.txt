['* SPOILERS * <br /><br /> This is only the second pay per view I have given a perfect 10, the first is the Royal Rumble 1991. It was full of exciting games that were not memorable, only disposable fun. And that&#39;s why I love it. <br /><br /> The first match between Razor and DiBiase, as well as Ludvig Borga against Marty Jannetty were the only low points. They were fine, but DiBiase deserved better in his last pay-per-view game. These days, a match like this would have friction and a bigger climax for Razor&#39;s first major boost. And Jannetty, just out of a race for the Intercontinental title, could have had a better game with Borga. But I do not think anyone cared. They just needed a push from Borga on pay-per-view television. <br /><br /> IRS and The Kid were great, just like Michaels and Perfect. I wish Perfect could have won, but Michaels does not sleep for anyone. Notice how right after this, he left the WWF to not have to work for Razor. Bret Hart had two big fights with Doink (note that the best match of all is against Hit-man) and then Lawler. Their rivalry was a classic; that&#39;s why Feud of the Year that year was a no-brainer. How often do you see two legends winning Feud of the Year so late in their careers? <br /><br /> The Steiners-Heavenly Bodies match was one of the best of the year. Who knew that the Corps could defend against one of the best teams in history? <br /><br /> Many say that the Undertaker-Giant Gonzalez match was a waste of time. But I loved it. Remember, what made the old WWF (as in, pre-WWE) great was the mix of athletics and an abnormal show. Is there a soul out there that did not like Akeem? <br /><br /> The main event was not bad, although at no time was close to the state of the year. They put Lex Luger right, but they made a wise decision in making Yokozuna keep the belt. It was the first heel from Superstar Graham to keep the belt for more than two months. Today, heels are champions all the time. But from the beginning of the WWWF to the WWF of the 90s, if it blinked, a reign of the title of the heel was lost. <br /><br /> As a fan of the old school fight, this and SummerSlam &#39;88 are my favorites.']
