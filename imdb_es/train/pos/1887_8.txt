Arthur is a middle-aged rich "child" who drinks like a fish. Arthur does what he feels and says what comes to mind. He likes to boast of his wealth and knows that he is a spoiled brat. He spends money on people he does not know and finds everything funny. Arthur must marry a high class girl to inherit a great fortune, but falls in love with a poor waitress Liza Minnelli (looks very rare). <br /> <br /> This is a very funny movie. I saw this movie because a very famous Indian film 'Sharabee' is based on the character of Arthur. Although 'Sharabee' is definitely inspired by 'Arthur', I think they are two different films. 'Arthur' is just fun. It is very corny at times. There are so many fantastic lines in the movie. It's not a fuss of laughter but it has some fantastic moments. My favorite scene is when Arthur meets his boyfriend's father and he keeps talking about the 'moose'. Duddley Moore sure has some comical moment. He is very good with words and body language. I loved the scene where he talks standing with a couple sitting in the hotel about a "small" country and he keeps talking to his husband and wife in two different directions. John Gielgud got an Oscar for this movie. I do not know that actor. I do not think he did a great job, but maybe if I see more of his work I can agree on the future. The movie has some flat patches but not very long ones. Waiting to see the sequel.
