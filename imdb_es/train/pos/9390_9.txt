This movie started me with a kick from Nick Cage. It is a story full of twists and turns, a movie of motives and movements. Of course, Dennis Hopper was a ham, but J.T. Walsh and Laura Flyyn Boyle are the perfect match to catch the unsuspecting man who has fallen into his net. Everything about this film is good: cinematography, rhythm of the story and, above all, the ending. Cage stands out for what he does best: it is not being an action hero but being a man caught in the traps of life.
