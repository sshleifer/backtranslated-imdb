Just to mention one more thing about the gentleman Jim. I agree with all the evaluations that do this among the best exits of Errol Flynn in a race of great exits. I would think that this role of boxer Jim Corbett is more like his real personality than fans like he was typecast. Flynn looked like a party animal from his memories and was a guy whose real life was more exciting than his screen life. What I most wanted to point out is to notice the great montages, transitions and even insertions that mark the film. Although the director was Raoul Walsh, a frequent contributor to Flynn, with director of photography Sid Hickox, the montages were created by an emerging publisher named Don Siegel. I never knew that Siegel had gone so far, but he's included in the credits. He would continue a great career as an action director.
