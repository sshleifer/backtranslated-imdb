Let me be the first non-Australian to comment on this :) I got the movie for Hugo Weaving and saw it until the end. It is one of those "drama of life" movies, as my mother used to say to a movie that represents a real life story without extraordinary events and that is mostly descriptive. <br /> <br /> I liked the light and the girls. The rest was without much fault, but without much merit either. He longed for something like The interview, or at least some villainous element of the matrix here and there, but nothing out of the ordinary. The story teaches one about how to face one's destiny and free oneself from the environment that others create for you, but this happens when the peach factory that gives life in the area is about to close, so it does not take much effort to change things. <br /> <br /> The "intelligent" song of American Beauty like a sound in the background could have been part of a larger soundtrack, but only once again became annoying after 100 minutes of film. <br /> <br /> In the end, I think it fulfilled its function of presenting a part of Australian life, but for me it did not seem specifically Australian (it could have been placed anywhere) and it did not seem attractive as a story. <br /> <br /> I suppose one must be in a certain mood to like the movie.
