The invisible man is a spectacle that everyone should love! It reminds me of the old school 80 series (one team, airwolf, knightrider). The special effects are small but very effective! But the most important thing is the fun they had when shooting this series. It really shows! The whole cast fits perfectly into the roles and it seems that they can do whatever they want! Especially Paul Ben Victor and Vincent Ventresca. Ventresca really shines in this one! for me it is incredible that an actor with so much sarcasm is his style of acting. He does not get a chance in a big movie (Mr. Tarantino, this was the show he should have directed! Instead of that big boring danger (csi)) Get this show if you can, it's well worth it !!!
