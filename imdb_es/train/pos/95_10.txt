Yes, I have a copy on VHS without cuts and in excellent condition that I transferred to DVD and if someone wants to recover the memories of a Christmas classic, please em√©rmelo at dmd2222@verizon.net.i I searched everywhere and did not find anything in this and I thought that I can not be the only one on this planet that has this classic engraving, there have to be other people and, if they do, I fit in, very few who have this classic, so I consider myself lucky and I have all the muppets of Christmas, except one that John Denver did with the muppets again. I think it's called mountain holidays with smoke, I'm not sure, but it's close.
