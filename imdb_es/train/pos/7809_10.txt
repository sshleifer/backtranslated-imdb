This film moved me beyond comprehension, is and will remain my favorite movie of all time, mainly because it has almost all the emotions accumulated in its 157 minutes. What is more difficult for me is that every time I want to listen to the incredible music and songs of the film, I have to put them on my DVD player, so I wonder if someone somewhere knows who sings the songs of the movie . and where you can find them, since I have searched everywhere and I can think sporadically in the last 5 years. My favorite quote from the movie is when in court the lawyer says: "But your own words call for a direct confrontation, is not that a direct call to violence?" Biko responds: "Well, you and I are in confrontation now, but I do not see violence!" <br /> <br /> CRAIG ROBERTSON Fife, Scotland
