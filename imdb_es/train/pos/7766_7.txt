After playing a nymphomaniac in WRITTEN ON THE WIND, Dorothy Malone finally said goodbye to the roles of her sweet sister / wife and demonstrated the ability to play with the best of all. She and Gloria Grahame played the same type of vagabonds, and for their efforts in a very manipulative role, Malone won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. <br /> <br /> The film he's in does not live up to Oscar standards, but it's a pretty strong melodrama under Douglas Sirk's capable hands. The opening scene has an almost nebulous appearance and sets the tone for the rest of the fireworks in a story that has as protagonists ROCK HUDSON, LAUREN BACALL, ROBERT STACK and DOROTHY MALONE. <br /> <br /> Domestic disputes between the residents of a wealthy family with a history of oil are the main focus of the drama, with the emphasis on strong support players, Stack and Malone. Both took the opportunity with both hands and Stack, too, should have been awarded for his excellent work as the weak, alcoholic brother driven to despair by his own savage motives. <br /> <br /> Nominal stars have less impressive work to do, but do it with your usual skill and conviction: Hudson and Bacall. They play their most compassionate roles with silent authority and understanding. <br /> <br /> The use of color is particularly surprising (as is often the case in a Sirk film) and yet it does not prevent me from thinking about the film. like a Technicolor film in the sense of LEAVE HER TO HEAVEN. <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing with some interesting performances from the whole cast.
