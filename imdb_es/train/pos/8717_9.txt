I have to admit that from the beginning I'm not a big fan of "family" movies these days. Most of them, IMHO, are sentimental trash. But this one, like TOY STORY, Pixar's previous movie, is very funny. The two main characters maybe were a bit too bland (especially compared to the two leaders in ANTZ, but this movie is better), but the rest of the movie made up for it. The animation looked great, the humor, though broad, was consistently good (I especially liked Hopper's line "If I had not promised my mother on her deathbed that I would not kill you, I would kill you!"), And the actors do the voices, except the two tracks, it was fantastic (Denis Leary is making an animated movie, what a concept). And like everyone else, I loved the shots! I hope the video has the new ones.
