I agree with "Jerry." It is a very underestimated space movie (of course, how many good good low budget are NOT underestimated?) If I remember correctly, the solution to the mystery was a kind of variation (but not "scam") of 2001. because the computer that controlled the spaceship had really been a man, which had somehow become a computer. And like HAL, they tried to disconnect their "mind", but not the mechanical parts of it, and as with HAL, it led to disaster. There is at least one fun moment. When the character of Christopher Cary, who can not find any food, finds the abandoned pet bird, there is a kind of sinister moment, but the obvious does not happen after all.
