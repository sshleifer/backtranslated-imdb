Like other people who commented "Fr√§ulein Doktor", I stumbled by chance with this little gem on nightly television without having heard of it before. The strange mixture of a fictional story about the pulp on a sexy but unscrupulous anti-heroine, on the one hand, and a realistic and well researched portrait of the war in the trenches, on the other hand, hooked me from the beginning. <br /> <br /> For me, this is one of the five best movies about WWI (the others are "All Quiet On The Western Front", "Paths Of Glory", "Gallipoli" and the postwar period "La vie et rien d'autre "). And the scene with the poisonous gas attack is really creepy; Horses and men appear as riders of the apocalypse with their gas masks. <br /> <br /> I just wish I had recorded the movie.
