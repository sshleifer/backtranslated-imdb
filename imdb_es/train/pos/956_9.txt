The simple handheld camera brings an almost documentary feel to this film, and is also related to dogma movies. <br /> <br /> Did you ever get bored with those Hollywood-style cop movies with muscular guys who have james bond assignments? would be envious of Fed up with the single married police, the divorced but familiar man, the personified don and the hard hunter? Have you ever wondered what real police work is like? <br /> <br /> Well, for Germany, this movie shows you. Located in the north, between the west of Germany and the east of Germany, the former DDR, a postal worker fired, begins her work, recently admitted to the police school. He quickly finds his way around the regulars and gets used to life as a policewoman ... but this is not very fun. <br /> <br /> Other German criminal movies like Derrick, Der Alte, etc., have dignified officers Speaking quietly with the suspects. These policemen have to deal with the lowest in the social scale. Good dialogue and realism make this an interesting vision, even more if they know a little about that part of Germany.
