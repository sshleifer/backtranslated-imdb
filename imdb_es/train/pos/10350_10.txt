I think they told the truth all the time ... I can not trust anything in nature ... His family went through hell. Those poor kids, too young to understand what was going on around them. But I still have to deal with the rumors. As well as dealing with the loss of his little sister. I can not believe that this case has lasted so long. It seems that the jury could not see the truth, even if it bit them in the ass. I'm sorry for this family, and if I could let them know I hate what happened. them, I would do it. I have no idea what happened, I can not even imagine it. After seeing this movie, I was crying and had to check my little girl in bed ... I think everyone should see this.
