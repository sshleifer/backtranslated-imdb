Henry Thomas was "great". Your character caught my attention. I was so "stuck" in the story that I forgot it was not real. I wanted him to stay with the baby and see what a special person he was. The other people in the story were essential in the composition of his character. The way they came together to help each other was truly inspiring. I love movies that show the real side of human emotions without having to hit you in the head, since you're not smart enough to solve things for yourself.
