You can call it a mystery, maybe a little thriller or a smart movie. <br /> <br /> History takes you through the life of a person who has lost his life and is looking to recover it. <Br /> <br /> I have to say I was quite surprised that I really enjoyed this movie. Normally it is not the genre that matters to me, however, the characters quickly became people for me and I wanted to know what it was about and what was going to happen to them. <br /> <br /> Like many French films in English. In fact, we can learn much more about the character and the effect of their environment on their person. This movie is directed by the characters and you will not be disappointed!
