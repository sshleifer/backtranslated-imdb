(contains slight spoilers) <br /> <br /> It's interesting how Anthony Mann uses James Stewart here. Stewart is, of course, remembered by many as George Bailey from Frank Capra's "It's a Wonderful Life," so it's easy to find parallels between the two films. In "It's a wonderful life", Bailey comes to see the world as he would have been if he had never been born. In "The Far Country," Jeff Webster of Stewart, by not getting involved in helping anyone (except himself), manages to see essentially the same thing: a world in which he (for all practical matters) does not exist. <Br /> <br /> By not getting involved (and trying not to worry about anyone), Webster is forced to see those he can not help, but who care about hurting, pushing and even killing while he is he is by his side and does nothing. This reminds the viewer that George Bailey observes a world that has turned inside out because he has also decided not to get involved by never being born. <br /> <br /> Both films end with the same image: a close-up of a bell that rings. Stewart, by turning around his philosophy of not getting involved, it seems, has earned his "wings."
