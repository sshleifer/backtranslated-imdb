Dominion Tank Police is, without a doubt, one of the most incredible shows ever produced, but not only in the field of animation. While the first part (Acts 1 and 2) consists mainly of action and fun, the second part is more serious and one should not treat the second part in the same way as the first part. The subtleties are really out of this world and the characterization is beyond the bright. He must have an extra degree of intelligence to appreciate the complexities of the second Part (Acts-3 and 4). Although I have some complaints. In the first part, Tank Bonaparte literally jumps on a tank cover and does not make any sense at all. One could also question the possibility that Bonaparte jumps in the wing of Helicopter Gunship even though it was great. Buaku rules.
