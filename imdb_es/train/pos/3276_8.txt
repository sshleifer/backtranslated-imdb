49. PAPERHOUSE (thriller / horror, 1988) Sick in bed with fever Anna (Charlotte Burke), 11, has only her drawings to keep her company. His health progressively worsens as a series of mysterious 'blackouts' grab her. In each of these episodes, she dreams of a house in a desolate field, with only one sickly disabled child named Marc (Elliot Spiers) who inhabits it. When a dark and unknown danger threatens his idyllic "paper house", Marc's life is put in danger. Your life is also in danger as these dreams reflect your own state of health. <br /> <br /> Review: Haunting, first feature film by British director Bernard Rose. Taken from a fable ("Marianne Dreams") by Catherine Storr, she leaves many other "original" fantasy pieces in her wake. When a story is about dreams and nightmares, it is difficult to give the mixture of fable and reality to work in the form of a movie. Principal Rose successfully captures the look of the children's fantasy world, along with a darkness that seeks to usurp them. <br /> <br /> Feverally scored by Phillip Glass, Rose knows how to use music intelligently with an expert and timed "jump of her seat". moments Most thrillers are very careless in this important aspect of frightening the audience so they do not know what the next scene will bring. I also like the way he captures the suspense and never lets it go or hesitates slowly in the next sequence of events. In addition, his mastery of the placement of objects within the frame (as in his work image photos) gives the cinematography an additional dimension that it would otherwise seem to lack. Only in Europe will you find places with such a sinister aspect as those presented here: the lonely house, the fields, the coastal cities, the watchtower, etc. <br /> <br /> Rose would follow this movie with "Candyman" (1992), a true horror gem of "thinking person" and an authentic cult horror favorite.
