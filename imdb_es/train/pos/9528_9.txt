Frankly, this movie has overlooked most of its detractors. <br /> <br /> The opposite of perdition (loss) is salvation (salvation) and this film is one of the very few to deal with those two concepts. The film also explores the love and disappointments that accompany the father-son relationship. It should be noted from the beginning that none of these are currently fashionable themes. <br /> <br /> The premise is that parents on the move, hit man Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) and crime boss John Rooney (Paul Newman), love their children and do anything to protect them. But Rooney's son, Connor, is even more evil than the rest. Kill one of Rooney's loyal soldiers to cover up his own theft of his father. When Connor learns that Michael, Sullivan's son, witnessed it, he mistakenly kills Sullivan's other son (and Sullivan's wife) in an attempt to silence the witnesses. <br /> <br /> Sullivan decides he wants revenge at any price, even at the terribly high price of perdition. Rooney, who in one scene curses the day Connor was born, refuses to give up his son Connor to Sullivan, and hires a hit man named Maguire (Jude Law) to kill Sullivan and his son. So Rooney joins his son Connor on the Road to Perdition. <br /> <br /> For the rest of the film, accompanied by his surviving son, young Michael, Sullivan chases Connor Rooney down the Road to Perdition, and Maguire chases Sullivan. When Sullivan confronts Rooney in a basement of the Church and demands that he renounce Connor because Connor murdered his family, Rooney says: "Michael, there are only murderers in this room, ..., and there is only one guarantee, none of us will see it. As the film ends, in a somewhat predictable way, one character is saved and another repents. <br /> <br /> I'm not a big fan of Tom Hanks, but he goes out of character to play Sullivan convincingly. Giving a subtle and laconic performance. Newman does well as the old Irish gangster Rooney, showing a hardness in his face and attitude, his eyes obsessed by Connor's evil deeds. Jude Law plays Maguire in a suitably spooky way. Tyler Hoechlin plays young Michael naturally and unaffected. <br /> <br /> Cinematography always reproduces the light of darkness, echoing the themes of salvation and perdition. The camera drew from a palette of greens and grays. The grays belonged to the parents and urban landscapes of the time of the depression in Illinois. The greens belonged to the minor children and the rural plains of that state. The exuberant, sonorous and disturbing music of Thomas Newman had weak Irish connotations and was executed in arrangements similar to those of Copland. The sets were authentic urban Midwestern: factories, churches. The houses shone with bright woodwork. <br /> <br /> The excellence of the film lies in its generation of a unique feeling from its deep themes, its distinctive interpretation and its enveloping music and cinematography. The only negative aspect was a slight anti-weapon message that slid into the script, the film's only nod to political correctness. <br /> <br /> I give this movie a10 out of 10; Over time it will be recognized as a great movie.
