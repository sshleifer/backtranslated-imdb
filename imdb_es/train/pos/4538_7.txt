I did not even want to see this movie after reading the review of Maltin and the rating of 1 1/2 stars. I saw it anyway on the advice of my son and I found it much better than I expected. I would give 2 1/2 stars to a 4 star system. You have to watch the movie more than once to understand everything. If you do not know much about religion, you will miss a lot. I graduated from high school the year the movie was made, so maybe I can relate better to her. Yes, there is some pretension in the film and it is strange to some extent, but that was in the 70s, so what are you waiting for? I can see why people do not like the movie; However, I can not understand that people say it's boring. The movie is anything but boring. You will hate it or you will love it. If you find it boring, you're probably brain dead.
