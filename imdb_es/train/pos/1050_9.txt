This amazing documentary gives us a glimpse into the lives of brave women in the Cameroon judicial system: policewomen, lawyers and judges. Despite the tremendous difficulties, the lack of means, the desperate poverty of the people, the multiple languages ​​and the multiple legal precedents according to the region of the country and the religious / ethnic origin of the plaintiffs and the defendants, these brave and strong women They are making a difference. <br /> <br /> This is something weird: a really inspiring movie that restores some faith in humanity. Despite the atrocities we see in the film, justice is served thanks to these passionate and hardworking women. <br /> <br /> I just hope this movie has a great release in the United States. The more people see this movie, the better.
