This is an intelligent drama about lifestyle in a Texas honky tonk in the early 80's. John Travolta and Debra Winger are two very credible performances as Bud and Sissy Davis. This film really opens the scene of country music and helped introduce the mechanical bull to America. If you love a good romantic movie, then you will love this movie.
