Why did not the producers give that program a chance? Of all the junk on television, why did not the producers give Six Degrees a chance? Will the series be released on video? I'd love to see how it ends. Put the first season on video and sell it. I was a faithful fan of Six Degrees and awaited his return. I put my recorder to record all the shows. Thank God for that. I just found out that the program was canceled and I broke my heart. I wish I knew it was going to be canceled, why did not they tell us? I thought that the show was only developing some depth in the characters. The writing was pretty good too. Steven (Campbell Scott) is my favorite of all time. I'm so sorry to see you go!
