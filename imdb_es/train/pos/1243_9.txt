Every once in a while, Eddie Murphy will surprise you. <br /> <br /> In a movie like "The golden boy", especially. This is a movie that you would imagine that Harrison Ford or Kurt Russell or someone might star. But Eddie really works; He is smart, funny, brave, kind, courteous, thrifty, clean and everything a hero should be. <br /> <br /> Having been chosen to insure a mystic child who holds the key to protecting the world from its complete evil (embodied perfectly by Dance), Eddie goes from California to Nepal and returns, while the beautiful Kee Nang (Lewis) wonders if he is everything he says he is and an old crazy saint (Wong, perfect as always) knows who He is. <br /> <br /> It's exciting, impressive in places, shocking and, of course, fun. Eddie is the only action hero I know who could start a movie making rude comments behind a guy who reads a porn magazine and will end up with clever comments about Ed McMahon. <br /> <br /> No problem with this "Child": it is a "golden" finding. <br /> <br /> Nine stars. Long live Nepal!
