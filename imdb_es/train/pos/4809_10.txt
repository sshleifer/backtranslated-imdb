With all the recent films, which are about the British monarchy, is it really time for another? Answer: BETS! The Young Victoria is another contribution to the British film wave related to the royal family. In this case, it is about the early life of Princess Victoria, and the events that led to the coronation of her conversion into the queen of all England, as well as her romance and eventual wedding with Prince Albert. The film also deals with the stormy lives and careers of both the Queen and the Prince of England, as well as other events that happen (political turmoil, etc.). Emily Blunt plays a radiant Victoria in her youth, while Rupert Friend is her beloved and best friend, Prince Albert. The rest of the cast is completed by the likes of Miranda Richardson, like Dutchess of Kent, and the always welcome on screen, Jim Broadbent as King William, as well as a cast of others who shine on the screen. Jean Marc Vallee (C.R.A.Z.Y., Loser Love), directs a winning script for Jullian Fellowes (Vanity Fair, Gosford Park, Separate Lies). I absolutely went out of my head for the visual aspect of the film (by cinematographer Hagen Bogdansker), who gave each picture of the film a pictorial look (with the help of the production designer, Patrice Vermette), as well as some tight editions (by Jill Bilcock & Matt Garner). What I also appreciated in the Fellowes script is the use of a game of Chess, as a metaphor for some of the political motivations of the film (the characters in the film move like pieces on a Chess board). This is an intelligent entertainment, well written, directed, filmed, edited and acted (and clarification) that makes it a good night at the movies. Classified as PG by the MPAA for a few scenes of sensuality, a bit of violence (a bit bloody, but nothing too bloody), a rude outburst of language and some on the smoking screen
