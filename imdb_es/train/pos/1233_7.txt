A strange role for Eddie Murphy at the height of his career. While there is much of the "Eddie Murphy character", he plays a truly decent person. The rest of the cast is good, particularly the lovely Charlotte Lewis. The beauty and serenity of his character prevented the tone of the film from being too Murphy.
