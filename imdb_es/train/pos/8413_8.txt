A stupid young man becomes obsessed with a woman, so obsessed that she loses perspective and common sense. An evil wizard approaches him and informs him that he can give him a great wealth that he can use to win the lady's heart, if he agrees to give him whatever he wants inside his room. The fool agrees and the magician steals the man's reflection in the mirror, and bad things happen as a result. <br /> <br /> If this movie had been made just a decade later, I'm sure it would not. I have not been so charitable in reviewing and scoring this movie. After all, the plot of the film is a bit vague in some points and the acting is, at times, a bit forced. However, when one considers that in 1913 the "complete" movies were rare, and often they only lasted between 20 and 30 minutes! In addition, the idea of ​​a complex story like the one that is included in this film is very unusual, since the stories were very short and broad-ranging. Then, given the limitations of the time, this movie is quite good and is one of the previous known horror films.
