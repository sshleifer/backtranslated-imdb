This mystery of murder with musical numbers is long in atmosphere and character, but rather short in suspense and plausibility. Based on a play by Broadway showman Earl Carroll and others, it combines a research plot with a backstage atmosphere (a homicide investigation takes place on opening night at the theater, where a music magazine is presented) . <br /> <br /> The cast is impressive and varied: VÃ­ctor McLaglen is a mocker as the police officer who leads the investigation and never stops looking idiotically at any showgirl in sight; Jack Oakie (the crier Jack Lemmon or was Jack Lemmon the jackass Jack Oakie?) Like the harassed director who must coordinate the stage performance and the chaos behind the scenes; the always homey Jessie Ralph as a wardrobe teacher with deep and dark secrets; Dorothy Stickney, who has an impressive close-up monologue near the end, like the tremulous maid madly in love with the male protagonist; Carl Brisson, the Danish star, like that very masculine protagonist, distorted the classic "Cocktails for Two" not once but twice; Kitty Carlisle, operatively delivering "Where they come from and where they are going" and other songs by Johnston-Coslow; the glorious Gertrude Michael, who separated from us too soon, like a malicious dancer whose love for Brisson is rejected; the usually ridiculous Toby Wing, who here, at least, is the center of a joke of laughter. <br /> <br /> When the complications of the plot get out of control, there is always an interesting artist or a fun and melodious musical number to distract the viewer. The most famous sequence of the film is the number "Marahuana", led by Michaels, but apart from its controversial story, it is really one of the less important musical offers. All the songs here are represented as if they could really fit into a standard proscenium theater space, unlike the cinematic fantasy setting of the Busby Berkeley style.
