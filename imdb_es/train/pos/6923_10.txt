CONTAINS SPOILER With the possible exception of John Wayne, no other actor sat higher on the chair in Westerns than James Stewart, and this film proves it. This magnificent story of revenge centered on a Winchester rifle has only one weak point I can think of: the release of Will Geer as a very unmatched Wyatt Earp. The distribution of the villains was good: Stephen McNally, the surly Henry Henry, Dan Duryea as Waco Johnny Dean and John McIntire (versatile to play both the good guys and the bad guys) as a cunning broker of arms. The clash between Stewart and McNally on the cliffs is great! I would stack this Western against all the westerns crop made today. They would not have a chance!
