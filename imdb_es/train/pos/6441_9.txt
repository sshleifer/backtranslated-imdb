As it is in the sky (SPOILER WARNING) <br /> <br /> This was a great human drama that stimulated my emotions and my imagination. <br /> <br /> This is a parable that reviews the life and death of Christ. Daniel is a gifted superior musician, who is physically and mentally exhausted from his career, and has to give it up. When he joins an ecclesiastical choir as a singer, he produces a transformation in the lives of choristers, just as Jesus did with society in the first century of Palestine. They laugh, they begin to speak openly and sincerely, they expose their faults, they accept themselves, they love each other, they become a vital community. They include the young person with mental disability (? Tore), such is their inclusivity. <br /> <br /> The pastor, Stig enjoyed authority by imposing a suffocating morality on the congregation, and that is gradually rejected by the choristers. When Stig fires Daniel, there is a revolt, and Stig is crushed. Stig represents the Jewish authorities of the days of Jesus, whose insistence on obedience to Jewish law provided a stark contrast to the new life by the "golden rule" brought by Jesus. <br /> <br /> In a dramatic scene, someone declares "the church invented sin". Throughout the film, there is this contrast between moralism and being vital. <br /> <br /> True to the story of Christ, Daniel is killed by Conny, when he hits him, he leaves him to drown. in the river. In the next scene, we can hardly believe it when Daniel's body (resurrected!) Is dragged to his room (the tomb) wrapped in a white linen sheet (the shroud!), By three women (three women watched over foot of the cross) in the gospel). <br /> <br /> Daniel is attracted to Lena, a warm and beautiful young woman who has been betrayed by a man she loved and who is now promiscuous (Jesus developed a close relationship with Maria Magdalena Lena, who was probably a courtesan / high class prostitute). Through Lena, Daniel learns to love, something that he has longed for, and now he finds satisfaction. <br /> <br /> The solo sung by Gabriella, composed by Daniel, has to do with living a full life, in contrast to moral correctness. that leads to concern for sin, and what is right and what is wrong. <br /> <br /> The final scene shows the chorus all singing / buzzing in harmony, like a mantra, attracting the large audience, exemplifying the harmony and interconnectedness that is our true human destiny.
