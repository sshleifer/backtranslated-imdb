Burlinson and Thornton give an outstanding performance in this film, along with Dennehy. Although at the beginning it is thought that it is only about love, in reality it is much deeper than that. The beauty of nature captures this film, placing it among one of the best I've seen. The scenes of the horses are absolutely fantastic! Any horse lover will love this movie! <br /> <br />
