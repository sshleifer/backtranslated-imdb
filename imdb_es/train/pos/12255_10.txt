From the avalanche of Austen films of the 1990s, this is my favorite, even more than "Persuasion", which was what made me Austenian. Before seeing this "Emma", I had seen two previous versions, but in one, Emma seemed to be wrong, more like Lady Teazle, and in the other, she was half mistaken, as a possible impostor, while here she seemed fair, young and silly and stubborn In general, I thought that the attitude and the atmosphere of the production transmitted the charm of the novel extremely well; In fact, it is one of the sweetest and happiest things I have seen, rather in the nature of a Christmas gift. The script is unusually well formed, and the additions of the adapter, like the beam of light that reveals Harriet to Emma in the church, are kept up to date. Mark Strong as Knightley is not what I would have expected, but I enjoyed it very much: he strongly emphasizes the practical and spoken side of the character, in contrast to Emma's affectations, and his angry outbursts against Frank Churchill are quite funny. . Bernard Hepton makes Mr. Woodhouse an almost absurd figure of Carrollian; Samantha Morton, as Emma's protege, is exactly as smooth and as firm as she should be. And as in the same producers "Pride and prejudice", care is taken that eventual couplings of characters can be believed, only in some cases. For me this production was and still is a delight.
