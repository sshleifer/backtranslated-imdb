While this film has many flaws, it's actually a fun movie from the 80s. Eddie Murphy peaks during his 80s movies here. While his character is indistinguishable from previous films, his time is almost impeccable with peers and perfect companions. <br /> <br /> Combine this with the hypnotic beauty of Charlotte Lewis, this makes for a fun action comedy movie on a rainy day. <br /> <br />
