This film could well have been one of those common "soaps" that relate the daily events of half a dozen families whose lives are interrelated ... broken relationships, making new friendships, street clashes, near accidents, hopes and dreams and even The discovery of a discarded baby under some bushes! What a mix of events! <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the filmmaker goes beyond those daily events and raises questions to consider, although there are no satisfactory answers. He asks: in this chaotic world, things just happen, it's just luck when things go well or, having a fatalistic vision, is a person predestined to be in a certain place at a particular time and, therefore, participate in the event. And your future takes a new perspective? Most of us have had this strange experience. <br /> <br /> Is it our super ego that makes us believe that we are so important? As a character says ?? Once he sat on the edge of the Grand Canyon and realized how infinitely small it was. <br /> <br /> This is not one of my favorite movies, but it is a good study of human relationships. Danny Glover is outstanding in a friendly role.
