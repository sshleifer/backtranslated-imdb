This film contradicts the first one regarding the origins of Care Bears and Care Bear Cousins. I will not deny it. However, if you look at "Part II" as a separate movie, then it is a very good movie. I remember seeing this in the early 80's (and fitting into your specific demographic audience at that time), and I loved it so much more than the first movie (not that I did not like that too, it's just that this one seemed to have an extra something for it). Of course it is also darker than the first, but maybe that's why it's so good. And it's also dark in a more subtle and profound way (children may not fully understand it, but they might still be a little scared because of the atmosphere it gives off, and the adults who see it will surely get faster since I'm now watching this movie again in my twenties) where you basically have a girl who makes a deal with a demon / evil spirit in exchange for something else. Get the image? But just watching him as a child, I'm sure, as I said, it may have been a little scary, but nothing traumatic. In fact, in any case, he gave me another fantasy game that I could play when I was that age. I can not tell you how many times I used to pretend that Dark Heart wanted to imprison me, to help me capture the Care Bears, to try to get me back to their dark side, and other things like that, etc. The movie was also good for my imagination. And it also has great emotional depth. I used to see him at least once a week. <br /> <br /> Hadley Kay was also the perfect choice for the voice of Dark Heart (I always thought about it and always will). <br /> <br /> Now it is a pity that they have never made a soundtrack available. Sometimes I just want to listen to Growing Up without seeing the movie, as good as it is. <br /> <br /> "What is the use of love and care if you can not save it?"
