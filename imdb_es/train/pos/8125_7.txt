Things to Come is that rarity of rarities, a movie about ideas. Many films present a vision of the future, but few try to show us how that future took place. The first part of the film, when the war reaches Everytown, is short but powerful. (Ironically, cinematic audiences in their opening year laughed at reports that enemy planes were attacking England - appeasement was at its peak, Wells' prediction was confirmed too soon). Couple working model, is the most effective. The explanatory titles are very reminiscent of German expressionist graphic design. The art director was the great William Cameron Menzies, and his sets of the ruins of Everytown are among his best works. Margaretta Scott is very seductive as the Boss's mistress. The Everytown of the 21st century is an equally striking design. The performance in the history of the 21st century is not convincing, perhaps it was a failed attempt to contrast the technocratic rationality of this era with the barbarism of 1970. Unfortunately, the model work, which represents angry crowds running through high corridors, is ridiculously bad and could have done much better, even with 30s technology. This is particularly annoying since the scenes of the giant airplanes are very convincing. This is redeemed by the magnificent speech by Raymond Massey that concludes the film; The ideal of scientific progress has rarely been expressed so well. Massey's last question is more relevant now than ever, in an era of severely reduced manned space flights. The scene is aided by the touching music of Sir Arthur Bliss, whose last name I share with pride. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the VHS versions of this movie are absolutely horrible, with serious technical problems. Most of the versions have published a very interesting assembly of workers and futuristic machines that takes us from 1970 to 2038. I hope there is a good DVD of the whole movie.
