Back to the roots with "how are you in heaven", what are the real values ​​of life? These Swedes produce a message that attracts all hearts. Now we have seen it twice in a cinema filled to the last seat: pure love and joy within the music of a choir that is simple, but full of power once everyone finds their inner tone. <br /> <br /> From the shine of fame to the school of his youth, now empty and ready to be adapted as his new home after collapsing on stage, Daniel wants to start listening and is dragged to the lives of the simple, warm and tough people of the North. <br /> <br /> He earns hearts with music and gains the ability to love and be loved unconditionally. <br /> <br /> Do not go to see it if you have been normalized to Hollywood. This does not contain any extras, only your laughter, your compassion, your tears!
