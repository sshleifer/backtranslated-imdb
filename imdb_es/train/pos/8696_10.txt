One of the forgotten jewels of the 1980s, Escenas ... presents a satire of great clarity and outstanding performances by Arnetia Walker (why did not she get a lot of roles after this?) And Wallace Shawn. It's a delicious class war effort and the people in those classes. The writing is hilarious and the characters, although not subtle, are nuanced. And, I'm sorry, but Asian gangs (if you can call a gang one of the Japanese who extorts one of the other characters) were not considered "sociological value" as another review indicates they should be. The value here lies in what the movie is making fun of and in the incredibly perverse way it does it. I found it creative, fun and idiosyncratic.
