I saw this movie today and I have to say it was much better than I expected it to be about a couple of hours before going to see it. Personally I had some prejudices due to the language of it, but it totally changed my idea. The film was surprisingly good in most cases with the great actor and the actress. It was a story about a child who had a dream and who did everything possible to achieve it. This really moved me and as a movie, which is based on a true story, it convinced me. A new school, a director of psychopaths and a child who know each other with a new teacher, a little different from the others and about the fight for things, even if they do not seem to work. He showed how small things can make big changes in many things, and how difference can sometimes cause difficult situations. I also think that the selections of actors have had a perfect success. I really felt that you had been a person watching the episodes as a stranger when they happened. Before spoiling this film with praise, I must admit that there were some things and situations that did not seem or felt realistic ... like the one in which the school principal beat Frits, also known. Martin at the head of the class, at the end of the movie. They really hit him badly, but the only thing that caused him was some blood coming out of his nose when he compared that to the first beating in the beginning, when Frits received some points ... well, I think every movie has its own flaws . ... I have to say, if I ever find a DVD in the store, I'm sure I'll take it with me.
