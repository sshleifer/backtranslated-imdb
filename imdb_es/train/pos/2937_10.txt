I know it's crass, and I know it's not PC at all, but it's a lot of fun. If you can put it in perspective, it is from the early 80's and has all the stereotypes of the time, and the film still makes you laugh, which really is a good comedy. Following the tradition of what comedies have been for thousands of years, the theme of this film is exaggerated. If you can suspend your political correctness for an hour and a half, just by laughing, do not hesitate to see this. <br /> <br /> P.S. Could someone put this on DVD? It is very difficult to find it on VHS.
