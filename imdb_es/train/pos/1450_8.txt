Excellent political thriller, played much more calm and slow than other films of greater rank in this genre. When people talk about Pacino and Cusack, how do they manage to skip these incredible performances of professional success? A story of friendships, father-son relationships, corruption and deception. The two actors get together incredibly well together, and the supports of Aiello and Fonda are equally impressive, although Aiello is brilliant, especially when the papers are printed. Instead of focusing on an overly complex corruption scandal, he creates wonderful characters that show the human side of failure as a political bribe. The final scenes with each of the main characters are beautifully written and performed.
