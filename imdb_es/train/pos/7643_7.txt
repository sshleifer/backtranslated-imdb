['Spoiler !!! This movie is based on the concept of What If? Of course, Mr. Destiny will be able to answer this question. The main character goes through a bad day, like many of us, and asks this question. The theory of chaos states that a butterfly in China could have an effect on someone here by a chain reaction. The focus of this film is based on an event during a baseball game. This event sets one&#39;s Destiny in motion; Like Ashton in &quot;The Butterfly Effect&quot;, except Mr. Destiny uses comedy about drama. The results make a fresh film, something original. If the philosophical ones are in tune with &quot;The butterfly effect&quot;, we are likely to enjoy Mr. Destiny. I give it a 7 out of 10. Unbelievable because I saw the first half of this movie 3 times and finally saw the end in TBS.']
