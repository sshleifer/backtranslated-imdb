Of course, this movie is not historically accurate but it is a great entertainment. Most of DeMille's images, especially the later epics, are slow and heavy, but the action here moves in a clip. The story is basically a series of peaks with very quiet moments. The action takes us from an Indian raid on a cabin; One of the best parts of the film with Jean Arthur excellent when trying to appease the native painted war. This is followed by her and Cooper taken to the war camp and tortured. Later comes a prolonged battle with the Cheyenne. Everything is ridiculous but very funny and entertaining from beginning to end. Jean Arthur is one of the best actresses of this era and she shines here.
