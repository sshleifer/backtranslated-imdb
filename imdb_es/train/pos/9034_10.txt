This movie was absolutely BRILLIANT !! Each performance in this movie is excellent, especially Jake Gyllenhaal and Chris Cooper. It seems that Mr. Gyllenhaal will have a HUGE film career if this is something to go through. I thought Joe Johnston was a strange choice as a director, since it is usually associated with big budget blockbusters (Jumanji, Honey, I cringed the kids). He pulls each scene with pure class. My favorite scene was where Homer came down the well of the mine and looked at the sky, down, as all his dreams were, it was beautiful. Joe Johnston should direct more of these brilliant films, which act as an actor, as well as his great big budget success, which is also excellent. PRESTIGE!! To everyone involved in this masterpiece!
