This musical is decidedly mixed, and none of the elements really fit, but somehow it manages to be more enjoyable. The plot contains some of the elements of Wodehouse's novel, but none of its virtues, although he co-wrote the script. The songs, while charming, have nothing to do with this particular movie, and are unusually crudely squeezed into the plot, even by pre-Oklahoma standards. Burns and Allen do their usual trick quite competently, but lose the tone of the rest of the movie by about forty intelligence points. <br /> <br /> There are some high points. Reginald Gardiner does a good job when he remembers that this is a talkie, and he stops raiding like a silent actor. And there are some pieces of writing that could only have been written by Wodehouse, although most of the film looks like the production of one of the Hollywood meetings that he later parodied.
