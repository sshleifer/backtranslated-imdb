She looks here and there, and then goes to her room and the photo appears: 'Ah! another girl? that two-stroke evil and yes, in fact, he's two times with her, but this time he's a guy. And I say "Brilliant!" <br /> <br /> END OF SPOILERS (The previous scene is not really a spoiler ... but for me it was so I did not want to take a chance) <br /> <br /> When asked how this movie was, my friend replied "oh, it's just an exhibition of the people of P3", which made me believe that I'll be watching a stupid movie, if not more. When I went to the theater, I thought: '' I'd better take a pen and a paper to write down the bad things about this movie, '' but it proved to be completely wrong. and then some because I could only collect the goods. This movie was great. Great, not because it's unconventional and not commercial film, but because of the cunning of the script and how this film tells you how to handle a movie brilliantly, what could have been a silly and meaningless film if it had been in the hands wrong. /> <br /> Konkona Sen Sharma is grace. She is so beautiful that she has perfectly defined her role as if she had been born to play this role. One of the most charming actresses I've seen in my life. But this is not the only performance that is good in the film, there is Sandhya Mridul, Boman Irani and Atul Kulkarni. Particularly Sandhya Mridul who just turned on the screen. (And guess what even the accented Tara Sharma speaks normally) <br /> <br /> The movies start with some silly parties from celebrities in the film industry and others, and give you an idea of ​​what happens. The movie will be about. And for about half an hour through the movie you feel almost the same. But then, the film takes up the rhythm of a good story and never abandons it. Does Boman Irani even agree with that statement? 'It was a good story, Madhvi'. (Thank you). The good thing is that it addresses the issue of how silly these people are with style and does not succeed, and also addresses social problems and does not make them bored. In the end, everything is a roller coaster and Madhvi informs us that with just smiling at all these people. Just the reason why I love watching movies. The making of ecstatic films. The script is beautiful, intelligent and witty.
