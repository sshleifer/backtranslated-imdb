I was one of many who expected to see a glorious, dandy-Yankee-scribbled portrait of a day that (as it is said, quoted) should live in infamy, instead of glory. How wrong I was. These guys were there, right in the middle, and the photos they returned are amazing and heartbreaking. And yet, everything happened on a casual trip to the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. <br /> <br /> Two French filmmakers were compiling a documentary about life as a firefighter from New York, particularly from the perspective of a young novice. Climbing through the rows. At the beginning we see many of these images, just to remind us that we did not think about producing a film about terrorism. It was intended to be a movie about normal people who earn their living honestly by helping others, and the beauty of the film is that it never loses this advantage. <br /> <br /> When investigating a suspicious gas line (I think, my memory is a little confusing in that), suddenly we heard a plane flying overhead. The camera approaches to reveal a commercial jet that torpedoes in one of the towers. What must the cameraman have been thinking at this moment? By recognizing the importance of the archival material in which the camera remains and, possibly, realizing the same, the FDNY allows the camera to follow them to the building. <br /> <br /> What follows is a real view from the front lines. We see the commitment of the FDNY, their reactions (the stunned silence after hearing the first person die is chilling), as well as the collapse of one of the buildings from the inside, while a second camera captures the events from the inside. outside. <br /> <br /> If it were not for the horrible event they were covering, the video would only be the dream of any young documentary maker. Quite simply, the images deserve to be preserved forever. But what really sets this film apart is the genuine humanity it brings to the viewer. We see firefighters attacking without hesitation, people of different races help each other to escape a wave of debris and even the filmmakers' concern for others (they are brothers), since they can not be reached in confusion. There are amazing images, as well as incredible human stories in this movie, something that Hollywood could never duplicate (even though it is trying). <br /> <br /> 9/11 is not a film about politics. Nor is it a film about religion, nationality or even jihad. September 11 is a film about people and a true indication of the best and worst of what we are capable of. 9/11 is just one of the most important movies I've seen in my life, and it would be the only movie that would be born of this event if it were for me. You can not duplicate this.
