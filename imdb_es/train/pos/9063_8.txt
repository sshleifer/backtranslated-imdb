It is a strange feeling to sit alone in a theater occupied by parents and their fun children. I felt that instead of a ticket to the cinema, I should have been given a NAMBLA membership. <br /> <br /> Based on the well-respected Thomas Rockwell Book, How To Eat Fried Worms begins as the story of any child: moving to a new city. The new boy, the fifth grade student, Billy Forrester, was once popular, but has to start over. Making friends is never easy, especially when the only prospect is Poindexter Adam. Or Erica, who at 4 1/2 feet, is a giant. <br /> <br /> What complicates things even more is Joe the bully. His freckled face and sleeveless shirts are discouraging. He antagonizes the children with the Ring of Death: a ring of Crackerjack that is rumored to kill you if they hit you with it. But not immediately. No, the ring of death unleashes a poison that kills you in the eighth grade. <br /> <br /> Joe and his axis of evil welcome Billy by smuggling a handful of slimy worms into his thermos. Once discovered, Billy plays it well, swearing he eats worms all the time. Then he throws them in Joe's face. Ewww! To win them, Billy reluctantly bets that he can eat 10 worms. Fried, boiled, marinated in hot sauce, crushed and spread on a peanut butter sandwich. Each meal is nicknamed as an exotic name like "Radioactive Slime Delight", in which children finally live their dream of microwave cooking a living organism. <br /> <br /> If you have ever met me, you will know that I have an uncontrollably friendly laugh. I felt like a creep erupting into a small child whimpering that his "dilly dick" hurts. But Fried Worms is wonderfully disgusting. As in a Farrelly brothers film, with G rating, it is both vomit and delicious. <br /> <br /> Writer / writer Bob Dolman is also an intelligent storyteller. To increase the bets, the worms should be consumed at 7 pm. In addition, Billy keeps a dark secret: he has an ultra-sensitive stomach. <br /> <br /> Dolman also has a keen sense of perspective. With such precision, he resorts to the insecurities of children and the tendency to exaggerate worldly dilemmas. <br /> <br /> If you were to hyperbolize this movie the way children do their dilemmas, you will see that it is essentially about war. The freedom fighter and the enemy of freedom use pubescent children as pawns in power struggles, only to learn a valuable lesson in unity. International leaders can learn one or two things about the maintenance of the global peace of Fried Worms. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, I felt comforted when two chaperone mothers behind me, looked at each other in amazement and agreed, "That was a great movie." Great, now I will not have to register in any legal database.
