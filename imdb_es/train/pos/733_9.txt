How can you make mistakes with the incredible Ramones? What a crime that two of them are already dead. It reminds me of Dennis Leary's joke about great musicians who die in kitchen fires while the useless live forever. Paraphrasing here, but the idea comes to mind. <br /> <br /> ROCK AND ROLL HIGH SCHOOL tells the story of a group of marginalized children struggling against the oppressive management of their high school. It is an extremely silly thing, but there is an optimism about that which is refreshing (even if they resort to flying the building). Who knew that this would become a concern for students around the world? ROCK AND ROLL HIGH SCHOOL is a time capsule of an era in which people still believed that music mattered and could make a difference for society in general. It is full of children who know that authority does not have the right answers. Rather, rock and roll is the only thing they can trust. <br /> <br /> But most importantly, this is pure exploitation. <br /> <br /> Do not take anything seriously. Just come in and have a good time. If this were not what life was like in high school in the seventies, then it should have been like that.
