The fifth feature film by Mitchell Leisen as a director, and shows his versatility in directing a musical, after his previous films were heavy dramas. He also plays a cameo as a conductor. <br /> <br /> It can be said that it is a film with previous code, and that nothing similar was done in the USA. UU For quite some time (more than 30 years). Leisen recorded the musical numbers so that they were like what the public would see: panoramic screen shots were not taken nor from the top wing Busby Berkeley. What I find funny or interesting is that you never actually see the public. <br /> <br /> As others have mentioned, the leads lack character, and Jack Oakie and Victor McLaghlan play their normal characters. Gertrude Michael, however, provides a bit of spark. <br /> <br /> The musical numbers are interesting and some good (the Rape of the Rhapsody in particular is fun) but the drama is not convincing and is false: three murders are too many and have minimal emotional impact on the characters. This is where this movie could have been much better.
