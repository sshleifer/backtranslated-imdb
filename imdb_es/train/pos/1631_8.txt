This movie has it all. Look gags, subtle jokes, play with words and verses. It is a group of boys of different ethnic and social classes who come together to defeat a common enemy. If you look at this more than once, you will see that you are quoting it as Animal House (and yes, I also love Animal House). I put in the 15 best movies funniest. The commander of a military academy for children is paranoid that all children are bad and want to cause problems (in this movie he is right). He is sadistic, carefree, cruel and must be overthrown. The group of boys who do not get along at the beginning, end up forming teams to survive and get rid of the Commander with a crazy plan that only Mad Magazine could write. You have to see it - you'll love it!
