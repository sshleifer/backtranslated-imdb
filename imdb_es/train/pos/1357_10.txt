What an episode! After seeing Mellisa last week making jokes about Annie and Brandi's friendship, I almost threw up. But that was nothing until I saw Mellisa's tirade after being fired. Seeing her walk around her plaster throwing obscenities and screaming for someone to buy her purse was absolutely the most hilarious thing that has ever been seen on a reality TV. He continued to shout to people that he was not on the set to put on "everyone's clothes" as if someone else was wearing one of his horrible clothes. Mellisa, are you like 40 years old and still feel tantrums? Then Joan starts calling Annie and Brandie all the names in the book, and gets up and leaves the program! Both Rivers are spoiled brats who only stayed in the program for so long to keep the ratings high. Mellisa crying and refusing to do an exit interview, only shows the United States what everyone thought: you're a spoiled baby. WAH WAH I can not get out of my way! I love how Annie told the cameras that she could manipulate Mellisa to think her way, and then she did exactly that. Mellisa is by far the smartest competitor and clearly deserves to win the whole game.
