This film had an elegant approach on the part of the director Vincenzo Natali with interesting camera angles and effective approaches. It was also comforting to see that Jeremy Northam and Lucy Liu received leading roles and expanded their range as interpreters. This film also included one of the most imaginative "escape" scenes of recent years. The efforts of the director and the actors were combined in an effective thriller. <br /> <br /> Although the plot of the film was complicated, the story moved very clearly as the layers of greed and skullduggery were revealed. <Br /> <br /> In 1949, George Orwell suggested in his famous novel "1984" that the future would be governed by the totalitarian state, that it would control minds and diminish human freedom. It was interesting that in this intriguing futuristic film, it was not the State, but the corporate world that controlled and devalued the human worker.
