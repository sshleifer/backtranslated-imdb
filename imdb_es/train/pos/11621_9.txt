One night I got bored and Red Eye was on and I thought why not. <br /> <br /> Red Eye is one of the best movies in a long time. <br /> <br /> I mean, I just got into The movie was so brilliant. <br /> <br /> The story is new and different. <br /> <br /> The film also has two main characters in the film with Rachel Mcadams as Lisa Reisert and Cillian Murphy as Jackson Rippner. <br /> <br /> The acting is simply brilliant and gives you the feeling of the people in the movie. <br /> <br /> The music is excellent, it gives you chills and it can also make you feel relaxed. <br /> <br /> I love how the movie was so well made and it never gets boring. <br /> <br /> Red Eye is simply phenomenal. Nothing more and nothing less. <br /> <br /> It's an excellent thriller. <br /> <br /> In general, I enjoy Red Eye so much that I can see it again and again. <br /> <br /> If you like red eyes, then I recommend Elektra and Cry Wolf. <br /> <br /> I give red eyes 9 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Great movie
