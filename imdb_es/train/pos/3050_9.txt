This is just the funniest movie I've seen in a long time. The bad acting, the bad script, the bad scenario, the bad disguises, the bad work with the camera and the bad special effects are so stupid that you find yourself staggering with laughter. <br /> <br /> So you're not going to win an Oscar, but you do. I have beer and friends out there, so you can not go wrong.
