['I saw both Bourne Identity and Bourne Supremacy on DVD before seeing this in the theater. I had been waiting for this since before they started filming. I was not disappointed. <br /><br /> Minor spoilers below <br /><br /> In general it was good, but it also lacked the continuity of the first two. Identity and supremacy flowed gracefully between the action of adrenaline and introspective drama. This movie felt choppy at times. The downtime of the construction of the plot was slightly too long. That made the next action feel too frantic. <br /><br /> Camera: Speaking of frantic, the trademark Greengrass shaky cam was present and it bothered me a lot. I know there has been talk / complained of nausea on the message board, but that does not mean it is not relevant. All the martial arts training that the actors went through was totally wasted. The ridiculous cuts of the camera and the movement of the camera ruined most of the combats in the film. It&#39;s a cheap trick of the student director to make the movie feel unstable. I hope those techniques are used in a horror movie made for high school kids, but not in this action series for adults with class. Too extreme close-up too. Make some framing. Get some interesting shots. The constant close-up feels like a lazy direction for me. <br /><br /> History: The story was very confusing at first. They throw new names and faces at you from the beginning. It gave me the feeling you have when you&#39;re late for a movie and you know you&#39;ve missed some crucial information. He felt rushed or compressed for reasons of time. After catching up, however, the story is pretty good. It&#39;s nice to follow tracks together with Bourne. HOWEVER, I did not care that the last Supremacy scene (Landy / Bourne on the phone) was in the middle of the Ultimatum issue. It basically makes the movie a half prequel. I thought that was uncomfortable. <br /><br /> Cast / Characters: The star of the movie is the action. Obviously there are only two originals left. Bourne and Nicky Parsons. The fact of forming a team was something strange to me. I think they just wanted to give Bourne someone to protect and trust. Unless I&#39;ve missed something completely, they do not even tell you why they joined. The other killers in the movie were pretty quiet. This felt like Gilroy / Greengrass / who wants to not leave the ends open. Understandable but disappointing. Seriously, Damon with Clive Owen in Identity and Marton Csokas in Supremacy. Those scenes were phenomenal. These killers are as uninteresting as Castel (the first fella Bourne fights in Identity). The cast in general has degraded as the series progressed. Clive Owen was practically a late occurrence. That is a measure of strength for that first throw. The second, they basically exchange Chris Cooper for Joan Allen ... It&#39;s not exactly the same. This one exchanges to Brian Cox and Franka Potente by 3 actors who will be named later. Nothing against David Strathairn, Scott Glenn or Albert Finney, but they are not the first names that come to mind for this type of series. Apart from a couple of pauses that seemed long, the performance was correct. <br /><br /> As a whole, it was a success. Although I felt that they wanted to end the series. If they had cut back or rearranged the slower parts, they would have removed Scott Glenn&#39;s part completely, they would have walked away, and if the victim&#39;s camera had been removed from the attack, it would have been perfect. <br /><br /> End of spoiler <br /><br /> I do not see why they leave Bourne alive at the end. It was my understanding that this was the conclusion. They clearly made reference to the beginning of the series with their silhouette floating motionless. I thought that was going to be that. A type of complete circle of completion. However, I liked that Nicky reacted to the news. <br /><br /> SPOILER SPECIFICATIONS WARNING - MOVIE DOWN QUOTATION <br /><br /> Bourne&#39;s last line at the end &quot;Look at this ... Look at what they make you give&quot;. Quoting the first killer he killed, I loved it. The final scene was great. (Except it was Vosen {Strathairn} who shot Bourne, why would he do that? Just for revenge? If he was angry enough to kill, why does not he shoot Pamela Landy after she fax your secret file - make sense.)']
