Reed Hadley is a better foppish Don Diego than a risky and daring fox, but that does not make sense because this series presents the best song of any series, the best version of the famous stagecoach Yakima Canutt trick. There are other good stunts, a lot of action, and a lot of end of episodes of suspensions, but if not for another reason, you should watch this movie to see the trick of the stagecoach and then return to see it in slow motion. It's amazing, and, despite the smaller budget for this chapter, Yak plays the trick better here than in the much more famous movie "Stagecoach." Indiana Jones, eat your heart: This is the real deal!
