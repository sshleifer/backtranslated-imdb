This movie is a new version of two films that were much better. The last one, Heaven Can Wait, was great, I suggest you see it. This is not so good. The last third of the movie is not that bad and Chris Rock begins to show some of the comic fun that took him to where he is today. However, I do not know what happened to the first two parts of this movie. It plays like a really bad "B" movie in which people seem to be in a bad series of television comedies. Situations are forced and it is as if they are trying to make the story end to be able to start the real movie. Everything seems really false and the editing is just bad. I do not know how they could release this movie like that. Anyway, the last part is not bad, so wait for the video and watch it.
