"A little nonsense from time to time, is appreciated by the wisest men." <br /> <br /> If you are too smart to watch this movie, then you are too smart to be alive. <br /> <br /> Wonderful puzzle, wonderful premise, vintage piece made with great attention to detail. <br /> <br /> Walter Matthau, Meg Ryan, Tim Robbins, and others, just wonderful! <br /> <br /> Rent it, sit down, relax, take it, smile a little. Have fun. <br /> <br /> Then, thank me.
