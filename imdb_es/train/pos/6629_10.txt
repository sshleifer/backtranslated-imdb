The best treasure island ever made. They just do not make movies anymore <br /> like this one, or never. Nobody makes movies like this. More <br /> <br /> than a novelty, this film is funny, frank and fascinating, but in a bad mood, <br /> <br /> mysterious and morose. This is one of my favorite photos. The director must have had some idea of ​​what it is, but he certainly leaves room for his own impressions and interpretations, while leaving little to the imagination. Why he <br /> <br /> has not made more movies like this, I have no idea. While <br /> <br /> reminds me of some of the best noir, it is unique in its class. But this <br /> <br /> is not for the lazy or simple.
