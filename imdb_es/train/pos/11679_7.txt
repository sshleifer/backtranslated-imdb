The beauty of Clara Bow and her wonderful appeal are the main reason to see this movie. "Hula" does not live up to Clara's best movies, but it's still nice. she dances, rides her horse and pursues the man she loves. This film lasts for just over an hour and was directed by future Oscar winner Oscar Victor Fleming (left with the wind). The movie moves quickly and Clara Bow has a lot of screen time. If you like clear, I would recommend "hula".
