['I came across this movie because I had a free new release from Blockbuster and needed to grab something quickly, since the store was preparing to close the night. The white cover and the title intrigued me. I am an &quot;old woman&quot; (relatively speaking) and my son is a young man of 30 years. I love movies that are pure entertainment, like The Sixth Sense, Interview with a vampire, Harry Potter and Beetlejuice. My son, on the other hand, graduated in film and enjoys highly specialized foreign films, such as those directed by Bergman or Hertzog. Usually, we hate each other&#39;s movie choices, HOWEVER, we both watched and LOVED the movie, NOTHING! It was different from any movie we had seen before. We are both types of cynical / critical personalities and, in general, we make movies while we see them, but in this case we just laugh and enjoy the film from beginning to end. In our opinion, if this movie had been promoted and shown in the main theaters in the United States, it would have done very well.']
