First of all, we know that Bruce Willis is a good actor, but if you take most of his films, you will see that the characters have these moments in which they are the same. Your character in this movie is way beyond everyone until now ... and counting. The story begins in the future (not so far) where a man is sent to the past to find the source of a virus that has swept most of humanity off the face of the earth. The story seems to go towards SF but I think it is closer to a drama due to the slow pace of the story. About it. Movies tend to be faster and slower at some points and develop more towards the end than at the beginning, but as you watch this movie, you will notice this constant rhythm of the story and the facts that do not accelerate or diminish speed. It's the same speed that flows smoothly and pretty good. But that does not mean that the end does not make you nervous, because it's pretty good. As for the address, it is prefect. Movies as such are easily destroyed with bad direction, but this has become much better. So, if you're getting ready to watch a science fiction movie or some action, you'll lose it. B There should be more movies like this one.
