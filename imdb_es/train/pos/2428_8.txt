As an old white housewife, I can still appreciate that Laurence Fishburne is one of our best actors. Anyone who appreciates their work as in Deep Cover could enjoy watching the incredible range of performance of this actor. Since I think this is his directorial debut, it could be even more interesting. All the acting is pretty good. If you can not take the junk worlds of Manhattan or the reality of the criminal life (not the glorified action action games), then this is not a movie you would enjoy. It is Mr. Fishburne's usual contribution to incredibly subtle relationships. I would love to see Larry and Anthony Hopkins face each other someday in a movie.
