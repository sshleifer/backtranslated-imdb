In the near future, Digicorp, a large corporation, hires a common man over any suspect in the suburb Morgan Sullivan (Jeremy Northam) to be assigned as a spy and steal secrets from its competitors, Sunways. Throughout his training, Morgan is brainwashed, assumes a new identity of Jack Thursby and travels to boring lectures. In one of them, he is approached by the beautiful and mysterious Rita Foster (Lucy Liu), who warns him that nothing is as it seems to be. Morgan recognizes a new reality, where he does not know who can be trusted. <br /> <br /> The unknown "Cypher" was a big surprise to me. This film has not been released in Brazil, but the interesting and attractive story is quite complex, with many plot points and with a great script, direction and performances. In the last turn, I remembered "Total Recall" by Arnold Schwarzenegger. This film certainly deserves to be seen more than once, and I really did not like the last scene, when the independent spy discards the disc in dispute at sea. I only know the director Vicenzo Natali from the fantastic "Cube", and this second work that I see is also impressive. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Not available
