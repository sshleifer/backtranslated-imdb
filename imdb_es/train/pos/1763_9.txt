This is one of the funniest movies I've seen. It had its raw moments, but they were full of charm. It's a pleasure to see Altmanesque's script, bright physical humor and relaxed friendships, and a part of life that most of us can relate to. and I can say with some honesty that I was afraid for Steve Carell's nipple ... it really was. Surprisingly, this is a comedy of good character, without entanglement, which essentially deals with love and the many relationships in which we can find ourselves on the road. Catherine Keener was great as Trish, and all Steve Carell's friends had faults but they were kind and very funny. The idea that they suspected Carell was a serial killer is a hilarious metaphor for a forty-year-old virgin. but the simple truth was that he wanted to be in love first. Original, charming, and very fun. highly recommended
