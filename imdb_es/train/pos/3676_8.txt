['I took my 19 year old daughter to see this interesting exercise in creating movies. It&#39;s always interesting for me to get views and opinions from a different generation in movies, especially because I&#39;m so cynical myself. It&#39;s good to get the opinion of someone who has not yet reached the &quot;have been there and done it&quot; approach in every movie he sees. I am pleased to say that we both enjoyed it very much and consider it a successful mother / daughter evening. Much, much better than going to see a &quot;movie for girls&quot; brain dead, which I guess is what we are supposed to enjoy, according to the demography. <br /><br /> Eighteen directors were asked to produce a short article about each of the districts of Paris, a city I have not visited in 20 years. But I wish I had done it. They are slightly linked by joining, and represent different approaches to love in the city considered popular culture as the romantic capital par excellence of the world. Some of the films work better than others, but, as other reviewers have said, they never descend too much towards kitsch. Some are funny, some sad, some intriguing and others simply disconcerting (I&#39;m still trying to discern a deep inner truth in the hairdressing salon &quot;Flying Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot;.) Some are just plain fun and maybe they should not be. assigned too much meaning (for example, the vampire and the tourist). Possibly my only criticism of the whole movie is that it makes Paris look too good. It can also be cold, wet, foggy, indifferent and miserable, or, in summer, bake hot and full of so many tourists that you feel like a sardine in a can standing in line for hours to see all the attractions. But I&#39;m picking nits. <br /><br /> My personal favorite was the Coen Brothers film shot at the Tuileries metro station, and starring Steve Buscemi, a perfect cast, like a confused tourist who, inadvertently, finds himself trapped in the lovers&#39; story. Absolutely perfect, and very, very funny, without Buscemi having to say a word. I also perversely enjoyed the piece about the two mime artists, which was probably the closest thing the movie was to being crazy, which certainly wobbled on the edge of kitsch, but remained on the right side. Rufus Sewell and Emily Mortimer getting a glimpse of an encounter with the tomb of Oscar Wilde left me quite indifferent, and Juliette Binoche, trying to deal with the death of her young son, made me feel very, very uncomfortable. I thought that both the Bob Hoskins / Fanny Ardent and the Ben Gazzara / Gena Rowlands pieces were a little flat, but Maggie Gyllenhaal was good (did she batter the drug market? Last week I saw Sherry Baby) <br /><br /> But I felt that the two pieces of &quot;social justice&quot; (for lack of a better way to express it) worked very well. With that, I am referring in the first place to the film about the young mother who leaves her own son in a nursery to go take care of another person&#39;s baby in the city. And then the film about the African migrant, who struggles to exist on the margins of an indifferent society, who is stabbed and dies on the street in front of a young new paramedic. Another statistic of murders, in a world in which thousands of migrants die in the struggle to achieve what they consider a better life, every year. I thought both pieces were very well observed. <br /><br /> The final film, 14th Arrondissement, in which Margo Martindale plays a Colorado postal worker and tells the story of her first trip to Paris, in a very accentuated French, to her French night school class, touched me. A perfect ending, for a good movie, intriguing, although not at all great. <br /><br /> Paris je t&#39;aime was an ambitious idea, but it works quite well.']
