The basic plot here is, Aditiya (Kumar) is the spoiled son of a millionaire, Ishwar (Bachan) who owns a toy industry, in the eyes of Ishwar his son Aditya can not do anything wrong, Aditya's mother, Sumitra ( Shefali Shah) warns Ishwar to bring His son is in the way responsible before it is too late, since Ishwar is a patient of lung cancer and is only 9 months old, when his son fled and married Mitali (Chopra), Ishwar easily forgives Aditya, but when the happy couple Aditya and Mitali returned from their honeymoon, Mitali is pregnant, and this forces Ishwar to expel Aditya from the house to make him more responsible, Aditya does not know that his father suffers from lung cancer, and he does not know that either. His father has thrown him out of the hose to make him more responsible, Ishwar can not tell Aditya that he is about to die, with a hungry and pregnant wife. it's a race against time, so Aditya does everything she can to prove her worth to her father, and the climax comes when Aditya gets her big break in the film industry and her father tells her she's about to die . <br /> <This film is absolutely brilliant, this is the breakthrough in Indian cinema that was needed for the Bollywood industry. Shah's direction is almost perfect, but what movie has no flaws? The best part if this movie is the father-son relationship, which is a tear. the interludes of the song are placed at the right time, the stage is good, the only part where this movie fails is where the jokes between Boman Irani and Rajpal Yadav are too long and then they are a bit annoying, but in general this is a brilliant movie, I advise anyone who reads this review to see it and see it independently of other criticisms. 9/10
