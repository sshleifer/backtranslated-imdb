After watching the trailer, I was surprised that this movie never made it to theaters, so I ordered the BluRay. I had a great time watching it and I have to say that this movie is better than some of the main animation movies out there. Of course, it has its flaws but I can still recommend it. The animation is well done, it is very entertaining and unique, and the story kept me watching it until the end. Some of the funds are simply beautiful and you can see the French talent behind them. I thought that Forest Whitaker's performance feels a little lifeless, but that's how the character of Lian-Chu is portrayed in this film. So, in general, I liked it a lot, I liked it a lot and I hope it is successful enough so that all the studios involved continue to make great films like this one. I would recommend giving it a try and be amazed at how great a movie with such a small budget can be. Only Hektor is worth watching the movie, since some of his moments are fun like Stitch's.
