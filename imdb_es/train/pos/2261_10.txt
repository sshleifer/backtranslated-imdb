I saw this movie, and the play, and I must add that this was the most moving story I had ever seen. Until I saw this movie, I did not realize how horrible life was and probably still is for the South African children and adults who lived and lived in that era. My eyes filled with tears and sadness in my heart that any human being should have to fight like this to stay alive, and to get the children out of the area and teach them to act and perform and turn them around so they can tell their own History is simply amazing. This simply exceeds five stars, I give it a ten. Thank you, Mr. Mbongeni Ngema, for such a surprising story. Although 12 years have passed since this story was told, it is still one that weighs in my heart. If there is a VHS, or a DVD on the work, please notify me as soon as possible. Thank you. PS: There was nothing wrong with the children wanting to draw the attention of other countries about their problems and conditions in the hope that someone would have a heart and offer help.
