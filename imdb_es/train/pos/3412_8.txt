DOCTEUR PETIOT, starring Michel Serrault, is a brutal story about a brutal man. A doctor who heals the sick in occupied France, even if his ability to compensate is not there. However, it takes advantage of the weakest among the population. The images and cinematography are excellent, and give an additional macabre feeling to this complex story. He is the perfect psychopath. Seductive and altruistic, intelligent and affectionate, calculating and murderous. A film that should not be forgotten by the spectator soon. Congratulations to Mr. Serrault, for his chilling interpretation.
