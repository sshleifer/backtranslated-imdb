From time to time, the conversation will become "favorite movies". I will mention the Titanic, and at least a couple of people will laugh. I do not listen to them because I know that five years ago, those same people were moved to tears with that same movie. And now they are too ashamed to admit it. <br /> <br /> I've just seen the Titanic for the first time in a long time. Hoping to simply enjoy the story again, I was surprised to discover that the film has not lost any of its power in these five years. I cried again ... in all the same places. It brought me to 1997, when I can remember how a movie that nobody thought had recovered became the most popular movie of all time. A film that bursts into the public consciousness like no other film that can remember (yes, even more than Star Wars). And today, many people do not even admit that they enjoyed it. Friends, let's clarify something: they do not look good when they speak badly about this movie. You seem like a cynic out of touch. <br /> <br /> No movie is perfect and this one has some flaws. Part of the dialogue is deflated, and part of the plot surrounding the two lovers meets too clearly. However, none of this is so annoying that it ruins the movie. <br /> <br /> Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are wonderful. Leo is one of the best actors of his generation. Wait until you see him in Gangs of New York before calling him anything but a pretty boy. Kate Winslet was so strong in this movie. The movie really was hers, and she kept it very well. <br /> <br /> James Cameron achieved what many believed was impossible by recreating a completely credible Titanic. The sinking scenes were horrible, just as they were that night. How someone can say that the effects were bad is beyond me. I was completely paralyzed. <br /> <br /> This movie is a memorable scene after another. Titanic leaving port in Southampton. Rose and Jack in the bow, "flying." "Iceberg, right in front!" The screws that hang incredibly from the ocean. The screams of the condemned after she went down. And that ending that made even the most mocking man in the theater cry. <br /> <br /> Music, which has also been a victim of the film's success, was a key ingredient. James Horner's score was simply perfect. And the subject of love was beautiful and tragic. Pity that the pop version of Celine Dion had to destroy this great part of the music for many. <br /> <br /> I confess that I am a Titanic aficionado. As such, I enjoyed the opportunity to see the boat as we could never see it, in all its beauty. Maybe seeing it sink affected me more than some because I've had a lot of interest in the boat all my life. However, I doubt that many of those I saw crying were fans of the Titanic. I applaud Cameron for bringing this story to the masses in a way that never degraded the tragedy. The movie was made with so much humanity. <br /> <br /> Another critic said it better than me: Open your hearts to the Titanic, and you will not be disappointed.
