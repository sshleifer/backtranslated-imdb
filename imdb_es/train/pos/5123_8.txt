A bachelor, 20-year-old (played by John Travolta) leaves the farm and goes to Houston, where he learns about life and love in a Texas honky-tonk. At first glance, it's a modern love story ... Texas style. There are lots of cowboy hats, pickups, neon beer signs and references to large belt buckles and rodeos. The music, if not native to Texas, is adapted to Texas, courtesy of the talents of Mickey Gilley, Johnny Lee and the Charlie Daniels band. And that touch of Texas ... "y'all". <br /> <br /> The story and the characters are as subtle as the taste of Texas five-bell peppers made with jalape√±o peppers. It is enough for civilized spectators to abort the film in favor of an elegant classic, starring Laurence Olivier or Ingrid Bergman, perhaps. "Hamlet" is not. But "Urban Cowboy" is spicy and explicit, and I like it. <br /> <br /> Technically, the movie is generally good. The dialogue, the design of the production and the costumes are all realistic; The edition is skillful. And both the casting and the acting are commendable, if they do not deserve Oscar. I would not have chosen Travolta in the role he plays, but he does a good job ... just like Debra Winger. Barry Corbin and Brooke Alderson, among others, are also good at supporting roles. But, the cinematography seemed weak. The copy of the film I saw was grainy and sometimes had a reddish / orange tint, a visual feature that I have noticed in other films of the same period of time. <br /> <br /> At first glance, the movie does not. It seems that they offer some social or political "message". But I would say that when "Urban Cowboy" was released twenty-five years ago, it had quite prophetic implications. In 1980, the USA UU They had all kinds of problems, among which were the American hostages held by Iran. In the minds of many people back then, the United States was being pushed and harassed. <br /> <br /> This film, along with others of its time, offered something that Americans wanted to see in their political leaders. .. tenacity. "Urban Cowboy" is a very physical movie. The characters may not be the brightest people on Earth. But they are difficult! <br /> <br /> Everything related to "Urban Cowboy" is anti-intellectual. As a vehicle for cultural expression, this 1980 film was one of several that augured a difficult new era for the US. UU It began in 1980 with the election of Reagan. And that era continues to this day, with a president who probably will not be remembered for his intellect, but will be remembered for his harshness and aggression, traits that Americans seem to gravitate as surely as Texans to five-alarm chili.
