['Girlfight is a story about a teenager with problems called Diana Guzman (Michelle Rodriguez). Diana is overwhelmed by the suicide of her mother and a sexist father who lives in a sexist community. A little bad temper and many things to light a fire, is about to be expelled from school for fighting. His brother, Tiny (Ray Santiago), is training with Hector (Jaime Tirelli) in boxing. To his father, Sandro (Paul Calder√≥n) tells Diana to hand over the payment for that week for Tiny&#39;s training. While Diana walks through the gym, she realizes that this is what she wants to do. She wants to box. Diana asks her father for money to train, but he refuses because she is a girl and should do more &quot;feminine&quot; things. All Diana wants is to be treated like any other man. Not underestimated because she is a woman. She steals money from her father to start training. <br /><br /> Great movie. Genius, pure genius &#39;effing&#39;. Recommend to anyone who needs to see a good clean movie without &#39;monkey business&#39;.']
