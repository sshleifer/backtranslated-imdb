"The Lady from Shanghai" is known as one of the most problematic productions in Hollywood. The original cut of Welles was removed by the producers and cut into strips. This made the already complicated mystery story even harder to follow. They published a good deal of their dialogue due to the density of the Irish accent, and the dubbing is too obvious and poorly done. The most disastrous of all, Welles and his protagonist on the screen and real-life lady Rita Hayworth were crumbling in their relationship, and their tumultuous chemistry appears on the screen. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, all this is simply overcome. The fantastic direction of Orson Welles is. It makes the film incredibly elegant and atmospheric: all the scenes seem to be breathing your back from the screen. In addition, the characters and scenes are so strange that they border on the oneiric and the surreal. This sense of rarity elevates the scenes that are often found in these movies, such as the court sequences in between. In general, the dramas in the courts seem boring, but the direction and extravagant touches of Welles make them as fascinating as everything else. The ending at the carnival reminds us of David Lynch almost. <br /> <br /> The performance here is also very good. Despite their failed relationship, Welles and Hayworth have a decent performance; however, their interactions are a little deficient. However, everyone else is superb and charming to watch, especially Everett Sloane and Glenn Anders. "The lady from Shanghai" obviously has her problems, but it's worth seeing her alone to see one of the masters of cinema at its best. (8/10)
