Others in the category do not do so. This story of a family with some real skeletons in their closet still qualifies as good fun, sometimes very funny. Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone are at their best as the Hadley brothers with problems, and they really took the roles and ran with them. Malone won an Oscar and Stack was nominated in the support categories, both honors are eminently well deserved. They offset the somewhat soft tips. Neither Bacall nor Hudson could be called bad actors, but both have had better roles and have interpreted them much more convincingly than here. It is a bit difficult for me to accept that Rock Hudson is a red blood heterosexual as he does here, but that is more a personal bias than anything else. But that does not take away from the overall entertainment value of the movie, which is considerable and this film is extremely visible. If you are awake some night and this movie comes, I would say that you look at it. Worth it.
