I had fun watching this movie, mainly because of Simon Pegg, who has quickly become a solid draw for talents for comedy movies. <br /> <br /> He is hired from his publication work in London by a great New York media shooter. Jeff Bridges, as a writer, for one of his celebrity rags. <br /> <br /> After paying his dues, he reaches the highest echelons of celebrity writing piracy (the "seventh room"), where he becomes a lesser celebrity himself. The story is very funny, and Gillian Anderson puts an impressive supporting role as a ruthless advertising agent. <br /> <br /> On the road to success, find the true meaning of love, etc. <br /> <Leaving aside the plot of the formula, the film was very funny, mainly due to Simon Pegg, Jeff Bridges and Gillian Anderson. Kirsten Dunst was as good as the love interest. The rest of the cast cast did their job well. <br /> <br /> This was a good comedy and it's worth taking a look at the theaters.
