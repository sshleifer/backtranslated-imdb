['One reviewer notes that it does not seem to matter what Welles actually says or does, it moves you. I agree. It was and remains a unique force in the cinema. More than a triple threat that could act, write and direct, had a genius especially suitable for filming. One can consider whether at an earlier age he would have been a painter. This movie definitely reinforces that impression. A musician, a theater actor, an heir to Shakespeare? It&#39;s hard to say, but I&#39;m very grateful that your time has gone with the movie and you&#39;ve captured it in the movie. I like the accent I like the face, the size, the style, the mind and the games. I love all his films and I wish there were more. In particular I love how other actors interacted with him in the movie. Many were never better or at least somehow different with him because he was there firmly. Even towards the end when his beauty was ruined, perhaps by his own intention, it was impossible to ignore him and he did all the scenes he was in. Rita was a beautiful blonde: a Lana Turner looked like, but maybe even more beautiful and even more beautiful. The eyes go to Welles and one wants another minute, another movie, another hour in his company. That is why we all wish we could find the lost remains of his films because we know, we all know, that there is not part of him that is not worthy of our time. Look at it and appreciate the opportunity.']
