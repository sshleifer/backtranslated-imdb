The New Batman Adventures (also called Gotham Knights) takes place 5 years after the final episodes of Batman: the animated series (B: TAS) and only aired for 24 episodes. This is not a horrible program, but it's not as good as the original Batman animated series. I will start with all the things I found that are not very good. <br /> <br /> First things first, the animation itself: long and sweet, Gotham is no longer dark, the sky is always bright red and orange, B: TAS did this too, but it was drawn in a dark palate, the color of the sky was more ominous, in this show, the color of the sky is too bright. Everything looks like any other children's show and does not seem unique like Batman: TAS did it with its cool and dark art style in Gotham. The artistic style is fine, but it does not remind me of Batman anymore. Each character is composed of straight lines, squares and triangles that make the characters seem less human. In the original series (B: TAS), the characters are more like drawn versions of real people. The animation may be more consistent here than in B: TAS, but it's definitely not that good. <br /> <br /> Below: some of the episodes seem too stupid and childish, but some of the themes are even stronger than in B: TAS. (Two faces trying to kill Tim Drake / Robin 2, and some villains get a pretty rough deal). This brings me to my next point. <br /> <br /> As this is supposed to take place in the future, as well as in the final episodes of the Batman Animated Universe, many villains meet their demise or leave forever. Poison ivy apparently drowns when a cruise explodes; Two-Face almost killed Penguin, Killer Croc and himself, so he moved to Arkham forever; Joker falls into the escape tower of an industrial plant (although he will return later in the animated series of the Justice League); Catwoman moves to France and leaves Batman, etc. Just because the series is ending does not mean they have to get rid of some great characters! The motives of the villains are also pretty bad. There are none! In B: TAS, we learn that these villains are mentally tormented and their lives are ruined, that's why they act as they do, in this show, the villains are committing crimes to make history progress. It's like Batman just does not care about saving the sanity that remains in the people he's fighting with, he just knocks them senseless. This Batman is a cooler and petty version of the character, but since he's been doing this work for years, I can see why he's so tough. <br /> <br /> Next, the redesigned character models: they're horrible. Gordon lost around 100 pounds ... is he sick? Many villains look STUPID (Joker, Riddler, Catwoman, Mr. Freeze, Mad Hatter and Killer Croc are among the worst). Although, I do believe that some characters look better (Bane, Scarecrow, Batgirl). Harley is almost the same, and Ivy (who's even sexier now) has a pale green skin. <br /> <br /> With the series with many faults, some episodes are great: Over the Edge, Mad Love, Beware the Creeper In my opinion, here are my favorites, Old Wounds, Legends of the Dark Knight and Never Fear . All the crosses with Batman in the Superman animated series were also great. <br /> <br /> The absolute WORST part of this program is how the creators say they love the animation of this series more than the original. In the DVD features of Batman's original animated series, they talk about how proud they were with the artistic style and how difficult they were to animate some characters, but finally they succeeded (the difficult animation needed to animate Clayface, for example ). In the DVD features of New Batman Adventures, the creators basically say "To Hell with B: TAS, this is a new and renewed vampire, it looks better and we love the way they CEREMENTLY CARRIED OUT THE SERIES". (All right, that's an exaggeration.) When the creators rejected the incredible artistic style of B: TAS, that really bothered me! <br /> <br /> It's not a bad show, but I still do not like it as much as the original animated series. At least, the program is not directed to your audience, so I still recommend it. Although some of the episodes of this new series are fantastic and worth seeing. <br /> <br /> Superman: the animated series and Justice League: the animated series are excellent tracking programs for Batman: the animated series and The New Batman Adventures, so also give them a watch.
