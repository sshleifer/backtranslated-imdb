['The first time I saw this movie, I loved it. It was different. <br /><br /> I am a Christian (believer in the Bible). I do not agree with the crowd of right-wing believers. I left that atmosphere. <br /><br /> For me, in their attempts to take over our government, they are doing what Judas tried to do. I call it the Judas Syndrome. <br /><br /> Judas did not understand it, although Jesus said that his Kingdom was not of this world. <br /><br /> This movie certainly showed some of that. <br /><br /> I also liked that Jesus enjoyed the simple pleasure of playing games and jokes with his disciples. <br /><br /> He was also a very beautiful Jesus. <br /><br /> It is a surveillance and repetition movie. <br /><br /> Very satisfying.']
