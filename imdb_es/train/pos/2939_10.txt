['Eddie Murphy is one of the funniest comedians of all time, probably THE most fun. Delirious is the best stand-up comedy I&#39;ve seen in my life and is a must-have for all who love laughter. I&#39;ve seen this movie hundreds of times and every time I see it, I&#39;m still having fun. This is definitely one for your video library. I guarantee you&#39;ll have to see it several times to hear all the jokes because you&#39;ll laugh so much, you&#39;ll miss half of them! Delirious is hilarious! <br /><br /> Although there are many funny comedians out there, after watching this comedy, most of them will look like second class citizens. If you&#39;ve never seen it, get it, look at it, and you&#39;ll love it! It will make you scream !!! :-)']
