Like a baseball movie, this film goes against what I expect in a sports movie: authentic-looking sports action, credible characters and an original story. While "Angels in the Outfield" fails miserably in the first category, it has a great success in the last two. "Angels" weaves the story of Roger and J.P., two Anaheim raise children in love with baseball, but looking for a family, with the Angels franchise, struggling to attract fans and win games. Pressed by the promise of his father, who was a dead man, that they would be a family only when the Angels won the pennant, Roger asks for heavenly help and obtains it in the form of spirits living in diamonds bent on reversing the downward spiral of the franchise. And, when manager George Knox (portrayed by Danny Glover) merged begins to believe in what Roger sees, the team suddenly hopes to change their season, and Roger and JP find something to believe in. the performance, and Tony Danza, who plays with a fallen pitcher, also does well, despite having a clear ZERO idea of ​​how to get out of the wind.
