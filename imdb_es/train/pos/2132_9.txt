The cast really helps make this a pleasant surprise and a cut above the romantic comedy / Hollywood comedy. Man / woman Discuss all the time, but without breath. <br /> Normally I do not like that kind of movie and that tedious story, but it was refreshing, fun to watch and it oozes with charm. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullavan play each other Another good and make a beautiful couple. The cast is outstanding, from the always friendly Felix Bressart to the villain Joseph Schildkraut. <br /> <br /> Frank Morgan also plays one of the most interesting characters I've seen in his career. Take the film and make it into a completely different mood for a while when something dramatic happens to it. That "turn" is another reason why this film rises above others of its kind. <br /> <br /> Once again, when a movie has a good combination of categories, it is generally successful. This is a great example of that. In this film, it's romance, comedy and drama and it's well done. I will take this on the new version "You have an email", any day. Without comparison.
