A strange and brilliant combination of talents between the director, Robert Siodmak and Ella Raines as secretary who tries to save her boss from the electric chair by tracking down a mysterious "ghost" woman, and Franchot Tone as a crazed and murderous sculptor. In addition, Elisha Cook Jr interprets fascinating and smaller parts as a drug addict, as well as the other characters that are part of the conspiracy. If you're used to seeing Raines in healthier parts, you can go overboard here, especially in your scenes with Cook. Franchot Tone also plays someone very different, and although he is not a convincing part, he acts phenomenally. While the conspiracy is too artificial, the film has a real atmosphere and is very interesting.
