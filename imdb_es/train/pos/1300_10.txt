The first time I saw a song on this DVD was at a high-fidelity show in November 2006 in London (I was not really into the cream until now!). It was through a high-end Arcam system, it sounded great with dts. I had to get this DVD. and I'll tell you that this is by far the most exciting music DVD I've ever seen. The interpretation of Cream at his age was incredible and the sound quality is the best I've heard on a music DVD. It does not matter that. type of music that you like, this will definitely grow in you. It is the absolute brilliance of his performance that will make you see it again and again. Even the new musicians do not cut the mustard these days, as these old rockers do.
