The first time I saw the movie when it landed on the EE cable. UU One year after its publication. It blew my mind, I was only 16 years old and it was the first new wave music I heard, being a strictly folk and classic child growing up. The music hypnotized me, as did the incredible appearance of Hazel O'Connor and the charismatic vocal performances, and Phil Daniels' hard but gentle Cockney manager stole my heart. But I think my favorite character was the drugged saxophonist Jonathan Pryce. He was so out of place in the band and so inoffensive and pathetic, that he simply begged for sympathy. Favorite scenes, the performance when the lights went out and the love scene on the train. <br /> <br /> Okay, then the movie is not the Rose! But it was really excellent because of its limited budget and its representation of the Great Britain of the early 1980s, exploiting with young rebels, looking for a way out of the unemployment line. I went to Britain only a couple of years later and discovered that the film reflected the atmosphere I encountered when I was there. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity, look at it. It's a great movie, with some wonderful performances, and the music will leave you impressed. <br /> <br />
