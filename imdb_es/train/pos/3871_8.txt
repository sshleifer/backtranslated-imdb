['Esther Kahn is a young Jewish woman who lives in a crowded Jewish ghetto in the 19th century in England. It is surrounded by a brick architecture that looms, oppressive, monotonous, monotonous and worn, sidewalks and narrow streets, darkened windows and multitudes of black and brown jackets. <br /><br /> She lives in a small apartment with her large family that operates a clothing store inside the apartment. When she was a child, she worked, she had no privacy, she wore colorless clothes, she shared a bed and she remained silent to avoid the mockery of her mother and her brothers, who ridiculed her for imitating them out of boredom. <br /><br /> As a young woman, her life remains the same: she has no privacy, she lives in a mental and physical state, and she has lethargy and inertia, she exudes a blank expression without distinctive features, she is dressed in simple and uncomplicated clothes, she is continually oppressed and dwarfed by the gray, mundane and imposing buildings, and the narrow streets, the narrow corridors and the narrow doors, and her mother and brothers of high voice, and the prosaic and banal lifestyle of her family. <br /><br /> Its only form of mental escape is the Yiddish theater. Sitting on the balcony, in the first row, leaning over the railing, there is a large space between her mind and the stage, a space that allows her to breathe, think, feel and yearn. <br /><br /> However, despite the freedom of thought, the open stage provides Esther, her face and body remain timidly drowsy, impassive, dispassionate. <br /><br /> The Summer Phoenix, simple and common in appearance, brilliantly conveys the emotionless behavior of Esther: Summer / Esther expresses no desire to want anything or anticipate anything. <br /><br /> After an unusual explosive confrontation with her mother, Esther finally decides to free herself from the dark life in which she is trapped. <br /><br /> Eventually, she is chosen in minor parts in some plays, and meets Nathan Quellen, played by the quintessential British actor, Ian Holm, who begins to teach Esther the technical ability to act. <br /><br /> From this point forward, Esther begins an exhausting dual journey of learning to act and learn to feel. <br /><br /> She begins to experience emotions that she has never felt before, and begins to acquire the experience she needs to understand and handle the technical aspects of acting. <br /><br /> Nathan accompanies her across the stage through the physical and emotional steps of surprise, hesitation, anger, disgust, self-hatred, etc. Then she begins to walk through those emotions in her personal life. <br /><br /> There are three truths, says Nathan: the truth of how a character reacts, the truth of how the actor would react and the truth that a character and an actor are not the same person. <br /><br /> These technical steps and three truths slowly deconstruct Esther&#39;s defenses and lead her to two edifying experiences in the outcome of the film that marks the beginning of her freedom of thought, movement and emotion. <br /><br /> Esther Kahn is a technically challenging film to watch because of her strange and narrow camera shots, a dazzling photographic direction that conveys the ghetto&#39;s dazzling realism, and the characteristic and insipid and unpleasant retreat of Summer Phoenix that brilliantly conveys mental and mental confusion of Kahn. and the lackluster nature. <br /><br /> A film that must be seen for people who want to learn the technical trade of acting and for people who appreciate minimalist films and character studies.']
