For a first film in a proposed series, he achieves the right balance. It is done with style and class that shows the first days of Modesto as a refugee and the beginning of his rise to power in the criminal world. I think it's a very honest / true representation of his character, exactly as the writer Peter O'Donnell intended. Alexandra Staden as Modesty is incredibly beautiful and an excellent choice. She acts very convincingly as the tough survivor with an exterior of coldness / intelligence / innocence. And a shock for Tarantino to choose an actress unknown to the role, much more credible than a new face creates the part. I'm looking forward to the next movie.
