I recently bought this movie and I do not regret having it at all, in fact, I am very happy to have this movie to add to my collection. Matt Manfredi and Phil Hay, film directors, took less than a month to film and spent around 1 million euros to produce this great film. This shows that not only large productions make great films. <br /> <br /> The title of this movie fits perfectly. In computer language, BUG means program error that causes reactions in the computer function. Our reactions can cause these negative side effects, but also great moments of beauty. The vertiginous events in this film begin with the death of a BUG. A man witnesses the "crime" on the other side of the road ... From then on, everything gets complicated ... <br /> <br /> I point out John Carrol Lynch ("Fargo"), Wallece, the man who He can not do everything right at all.
