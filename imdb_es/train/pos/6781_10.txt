When an actor has to play the role of actor, fictitious or factual, the task becomes much more difficult than playing a role. In A Double Life, Ronald Coleman surpassed himself as Anthony John, the tortured double character. He put in that character all his talent and sincerity. Facial expressions, gestures, gait and posture spoke eloquently of what Anthony John was going through while playing Othello on stage. Coleman also did extremely well as a Shakespearean actor in those short scenes like Othello that were part of this movie jewel. Approaches to the face of Coleman as Othello tortured by the doubts about the fidelity of Desdemona were in themselves scenes that were worth seeing. Add that, the desperation of his character offstage and only someone with the depth of perception of Coleman's performance can achieve it. It was like seeing Spenser Tracy as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, except that this double role was much deeper and more moving. Shelly Winters looked so sweet, vulnerable and beautiful at the same time and added her talent to the film. It is believed that Ronald Coleman liked his role in this film about all the others he played and won the Oscar for Best Actor in 1947. I would watch this film repeatedly and I would never get bored.
