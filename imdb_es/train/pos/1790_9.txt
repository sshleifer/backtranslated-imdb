I love this movie and it is a wonderful example of a family danger, a romantic love story and a very sad storyline. Everything was so perfect and excellent about this movie. It was a great mix of actors and actresses, and with some laughter and many shouts, this film deserves many awards. With the mention of a beautiful stage, and although I would relate this movie with The Notebook and The Family Stone, it was something more cunning, sad and brilliant than those films. The Evening tells a love story between an old woman who dreams of going back to her younger years, and her two daughters stay by her side while she is not well. The story that goes back is so told and wonderful that I was sitting on the edge of my seat. You really know all the characters and in the end, I wanted to see them again. This is an incredibly sad movie, with a vivid and traced performance that is really unique and that everyone should see because of how wonderful it is. All the performances are amazing and the film captures his attention from the beginning and never abandons it. I loved it, and I'm so glad I saw it because it was a really amazing movie ...
