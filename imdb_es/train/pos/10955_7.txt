Originally I scored Sarah's program with a good fat 8, but I have struggled a little with her mood of the last times and a slim 7 is what is accommodated. I will explain it. <br /> <br /> Anyone will like Sarah's humor, or you will not. If you do not, I doubt anyone can persuade you. You know who they are and it's perfectly fine, but they know that too. Continuing, the first season gave us fantastic details about Sarah, her friends and family, and her activities in life. In a memorable episode, Officer Jay, whom she meets for the first time, "stops" her. - "Do you know why I'm standing here?" he asks. "Why do you have all the C's in high school?" she responds with curiosity. It seemed to be a genuine question. - That's kind of funny in my book. Sarah can come to you from strange angles. In another episode, his relationship with God was remarkably fun. God being mean and jealous added wonderfully to the joke. It's smart, it's a twisted vision, but it would show us the truth with humor and we laugh. <br /> <br /> Then, the second season arrived. While not yet without a new and inventive comedy, it seems that we have slipped a little in poop and fart jokes, simply. I have good laughs here and there, but a lot seems to fill up while she and the writers struggle to promote original material. Sofomorico and tedious are the feelings I have for the episodes lately, but I've been destroying it for the gems I found (the turtle) and waiting for it to turn around. He was a fan of his "Jesus is Magic" routine and I would like to think that I understand what he is capable of. Let's go back to that.
