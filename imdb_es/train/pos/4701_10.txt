"Roman Troy Moronie" is my comment about the movie. What more is there to say? <br /> <br /> This character really brings out Moronie's imbecile. A tough gangster with an inability to pronounce profane words, well, it would have been frustrating to be tough and yet not be able to express himself intelligently. <br /> <br /> Roman Moronie will go down in the annals of film history as one of the best imbecile of all. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is a great comedy among the other characters. Michael Keaton is F.A.H. and so is Joe Piscipo. <br /> <br /> I like the fact that Moronie has kept the film with an "R" rating because she could not pronounce blasphemy.
