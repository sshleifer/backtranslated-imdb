I saw this movie a while ago and it is still at the top of my list of "favorite movies". It is amazingly organized and what really makes the film the little fragments of the tide (like the coffee box 'Cafe Bustelo' that is reused as a mug to wash the hair of your grandchildren) that people do not see because YOU DO NOT YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THIS MOVIE UNLESS YOU ARE HISPANIC. This is just one of those movies that is very specific and culturally specific. Please, do not hit this movie if you do not have prior knowledge of the foundations on which it is being built. I see completely what the writer / director was looking for, and he perfectly hit the target! This movie is highly worthy of a better rating.
