This episode of Twilight Zone combines a silent section (1890) with melodramatic action and visual gags, a tribute to Buster Keaton's first films. A lot of slapstick: Buster falling into a bulkhead door, falling into a puddle, running around the pants less. The invention of a Time Tilly helmet scientist, reminiscent of Flash Gordon's idea of ​​what the future would be like. Cheap prices, such as $ 1.95 for ladies' hats, or 17 cents per pound for beef, seem outrageously high for Buster. Even the world of 1890 is too much for Buster / Mulligan. How shocking when transported by mistake to the "modern" world of 1960! Buster was trying to go back! The "scientist" of that time wants to return to a calmer world, the 1890 that he has studied and admired. They are back together, and Buster / Mulligan is now happy and the "scientist" regrets not having electronic equipment, modern beds or an electric blanket. So Buster sends him back with the crazy helmet. <br /> <br /> This Twilight Zone does not have a heavy message. Since Buster Keaton died in 1966, it is one of his last efforts. That's enough. <br /> <br /> Another cute thing: the Maytag man used a short time, Jesse White, is a repairman who fixes the Helmet of Time: it presages his career as a washing machine.
