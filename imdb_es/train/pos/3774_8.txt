['In the aftermath of the brilliant adventure of Bill and Ted, Bill and Ted are threatened for the future, while the evil Chuck De Nomolos sends two evil robots, disguised as Bill and Ted to earth to kill the humans Bill and Ted, in order to change the future <br /><br /> In an excellent combination of comedy, Winter and Reeves stand out to bring delightful humor to the audience in this entertaining sequel. Although lacking the clarity of the first, Bogus Journey still has the great phrases and dialogues of the leading couple, not to mention the hilarious performance of William Sadler, who brings a comic side to the figure of depth, the grim reaper. Observe the sequences of games, the best moment of the whole movie, but one of the many excellent techniques that are used to justify the genre. <br /><br /> Although it is still full of humor, this film has a more dramatic film, with more serious bets and more risky situations. <br /><br /> This gives the movie a great dimension and another adorable feature. The creators also stretch the limits of the fantasy genre and the use of realism, with hell and heaven very symbolic and present in the plot. The fantasy genre is again successful with the use of that incredible time travel machine, although again it is somewhat confusing in the points with the use of time and the objects and situations that are placed before they occur in the present , as evidenced in the last pair of scenes <br /><br /> The first watch I hated this sequel, but the second time it was a real joy, since I appreciate the jokes and the story more, and although the jokes and the plot are not as strong as its predecessor, Bogus Journey has enough reasons to feel good, jokes and a fairly stable plot to make it a good family movie.']
