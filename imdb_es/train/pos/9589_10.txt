Growing up in New York City in the late 80's and early 90's, I can personally say that this is one of the most important documentaries made to cover that place in this period of time. Madonna did not come up with the idea of ​​Voguing, but that's where she got it from! Instead of eliminating violence from each other or in fights of malicious cats, voguing allowed people to "fight" within the limits of everything that was not touching (which would justify an automatic disqualification). Seeing this kind of extraordinarily talented / well-orchestrated "takedowns" in the clubs was nothing short of spectacular and all the great names of yesteryear are here ... Pepper La Beija, Paris Dupree, Xtragavaganza, etc ... all commemorated as pieces of the time like Malcom McLaren's song "Deep in Vogue" ... it did not matter who you were, or where you were from, because when you entered through those doors in this "magic kingdom" of By the way, you became part of something else great that you yourself / were important / and most importantly, in the creation of your own movements and imagination ... and anyone from anywhere could become King (or Queen) as the case may be. The words and wit were as sharp as the movements on the floor. All the tension, emotion and magic of that very urban New York energy are captured in this movie. SPARKLY!!! PLEASE LAUNCH ON DVD for the world to see! Thank you!
