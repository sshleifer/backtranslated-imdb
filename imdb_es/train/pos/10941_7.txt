The idea that Sarah Silverman had her own program worried me at first. The movies in which he has appeared were not very funny and his humor is a little off. However, I was very surprised to see how his true colors shone in this jewel of Comedy Central. Possibly I could put it on par with Amy Sedaris in Strangers with Candy - Sarah's character is a true sociopath, very comparable to Jerri Blank's Sedaris. <br /> <br /> The only disadvantage of this show is its cast of support. The character of his sister is good; Funny sometimes, but ultimately, the intention of not stealing Sarah's show. However, the rest of the cast is extremely low in comparison. <br /> <br /> However, I'm glad that Comedy Central has given Sarah the opportunity to show her unique and crazy sense of self and humor.
