Maybe the movie itself is not one of Jackie Chan's best films, but I think everyone will agree with me that the fight at the mall was one of the best fight scenes ever made. There were also some memorable tricks, which were so impressive that they made this movie an action classic. This film influenced many other action movies and I think that nowadays the creators of action movies should learn from this movie (as if they could remake that persecution scene, I think with modern technologies they could do even better). There were also some funny scenes that made this movie enjoyable even when Jackie was not fighting. Although I think they could put more fight scenes in this movie.
