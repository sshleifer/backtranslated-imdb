At that time, "My left foot" was the little movie I could. It was hugely popular, and everyone applauded the fact that such a small and independent film could make it to the Oscars. <br /> <br /> Since then, movies like "My Left Foot" are a dime a dozen. Therefore, in retrospect, it might be difficult to understand what all this fuss was about. It is certainly a well-made and competent film, but it is clear that most of its success falls on the shoulders of Daniel Day-Lewis, who immerses himself in the role of Cristy Brown, a man who lives with cerebral palsy. Day-Lewis performs the same acting trick that had earned him an Oscar to Dustin Hoffman the year before for playing a man with autism in "Rain Man," and the Academy did the same in giving Day-Lewis the same honor. <Br /> <br /> The only thing that really separates this movie from a Hollywood big-budget production is just that: your budget. In all other aspects, it is as formulated as any standard product. That does not mean it's not a good movie, but it's not a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Grade: A-
