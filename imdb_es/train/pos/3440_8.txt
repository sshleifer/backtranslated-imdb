Amor Rosario Dawson, I think she is one of the best actresses of the modern era. <br /> <br /> The descent seems to be more about self-empowerment than anything else. It is the consistent tone in everything in the movie. The dialogue is flat, the characters seemingly intentionally insipid and unilateral. The only coherence is the representation of self-empowerment in the characters and Rosario's journey of self-empowerment to the loss of empowerment and vice versa. <br /> <br /> Presenting this as a rape classic is not appropriate, and that is probably why. Many people do not enjoy the movie. The standard "rape" audience would not particularly like this movie, and maybe that's the point? The film asks more questions than answers and confronts its target audience, like it or not. There is a convincing relationship between the characters and the target audience, and although the film does not hit the audience with an honest audacity, it compromises the viewer for what may or may not be, all the wrong reasons. <Br /> <br /> The descent is a good movie whose IMHO is well below the rating.
