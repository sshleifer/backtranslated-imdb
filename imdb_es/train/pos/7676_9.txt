Sparkly! My wife and I joined the extensive line to see Holly at the Edinburgh Film Festival. After watching the movie, I can understand why there was such a long line. Holly is a moving story about an impossible connection between two people. She is a young girl, he is an exhausted Westerner. The movie captured all the bones of our body. There are no graphic scenes or anything that is difficult to see, it is the surrealism of normality that really makes you vibrate. The movie is very well shot. Among others, we loved the scene in which Patrick teaches Holly to ride a small motorcycle. The rawness of Thuy Ngoyen (I can not believe this is his first acting job) and the performance of Ron Livingston stayed with me for a couple of days. Highly recommended
