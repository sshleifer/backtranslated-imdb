Once again, I was browsing through the tray of discount videos and picked up this movie for $ 4.88. Fifty percent of the time that the films I find in the bin are pure trash (I mean horrible beyond belief), but half the time they turn out to be surprisingly good. This movie is much better than I expected. I found it very attractive, although it was obviously done by an amateur. <br /> <br /> Management is nothing special, but the story is intriguing with some good emotions. I expected it to be more of a comedy, but it did not disappoint me too much. <br /> <br /> For a thriller, this movie is surprisingly kind. There is no bloody violence, no profanity, no nudity, no sex. Generally, these films require all four of those elements. The PG rating is well deserved, not like "Sixteen Candles", where the word "f" is used twice and there is a brief free nude scene. <br /> <br /> I just wish the romance between Corey Haim and his love interest could have developed further. The movie tends to be a large plot, and potentially good subplots move to the side. Instead of developing a chemistry between the two, we ended up watching a sloppy three-minute montage of them in their romantic endeavors. They end up kissing at the end, but there is so little chemistry that it seems forced. <br /> <br /> "The Dream Machine" is not a gem, but it is clean and good entertainment. It's pretty easy to forget, especially with a cast of unknowns, except for Haim, but it's also much better than you'd expect. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (out of 10)
