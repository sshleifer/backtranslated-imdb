(spoilers) <br /> <br /> I was surprised by this movie. I've been renting in Movielink for a while, and I decided to watch this movie. Many of the boxing movies seem to exaggerate the blood. In this film, he shows it at the amateur level. Although I wish that maybe more attention has been paid to her, maybe to improve her grades. The film points out the problems that some families face with gender. <br /> <br /> I was a little worried about the end. But the end was not a disappointment either. <br /> <br /> I think it was pretty clear by the title that would win. What was unexpected was that the two were back together at the end. <br /> <br /> I loved the score of some of the scenes. Highly recommended <br /> <br /> 10/10 <br /> <br /> Quality: 9/10 <br /> <br /> Entertainment: 10/10 <br /> <br /> Playable: 10/10
