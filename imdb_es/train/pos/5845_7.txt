['I enjoyed this movie a lot more than I had anticipated; From reading other comments here, I suspect that it greatly benefits from being seen on a full-sized screen in the cinema, in the company of a cheerful and enthusiastic audience. I was lucky to have that experience, to be born of laughs from all over the world, and I had an immensely good time with this undemanding comedy. <br /><br /> Because it&#39;s like a comedy that shines, if it shines anywhere. Music is nothing special; in fact, I had not realized that * it * was * a musical, and I was very surprised when the assembled ancestors burst into lyrical lyrics, but I must admit that the half-threat, The half-promise of &#39;Oh, what I will do ... &#39;It has proven to be much more catchy than it seemed at the time, as it still goes round and round in my head! <br /><br /> The plot, as it is, revolves largely around the past history of the Francesca era, a portrait of the sixteenth century that sports a clearly anachronistic fur coat and coat. His idea of the sanctity of marriage does not match that of his distant descendant, Countess Angelina, and you can almost hear the crackle of history at the seams under the tension of the Production Code to ensure that the heroine arrives intact. in his double bed very delayed with the right man ... <br /><br /> The romance is hardly moving, and in fact, the first scenes, interpreted quite well, are on the verge of tedious. But where the script and the film really come to life is in the battle of the sexes that follows. The impudence of Douglas Fairbanks Jr&#39;s courtship of Betty Grable&#39;s married, Angelina, is matched only by Betty-Grable-as-Francesca&#39;s search for him, culminating in a complete reversal of roles in the hilarious fantasy sequence in the that she literally eliminates it. His feet. This is probably the comic climax of the plot, although the consequences of the Colonel&#39;s understandable confusion are resolved with a deft touch in the two remaining &quot;acts&quot; of the operetta structure, and the show of Fairbanks&#39; joyous and funny awakening is More or less worth the price of entry on your own. <br /><br /> Grable is totally convincing in establishing his two contrasting characters, wisely obtains almost all singing opportunities (limited) and shares the honors in regards to the ranges of quotable dialogues in the various verbal duels. But in the field of tacit reaction she is really overcome by her masculine clues of support; Fairbanks, in particular, is an absolute pleasure in a series of sequences without words whose configuration and humor are worthy of the silent screen. <br /><br /> This film has a style too unequal to be a classic, ranging from a bright spark to a tedium trite. But, at best, it&#39;s quite honest, and it brought a round of spontaneous applause and laughter throughout the auditorium at the end when the lights went on. Out of tune with their times, it may not have attracted contemporary audiences, but, in this show, it really did not deserve to be disowned by Grable and Preminger, the director (uncredited). This is not a masterpiece, but a minor job for entertainment, and for my part, I found myself smiling in memory all the way home.']
