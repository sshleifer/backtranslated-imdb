I just read the novel "La noche de la madre". I recently have the DVD and I see it from time to time. Few films that I've had and that I've seen have made me think and question as much as Mother Night has, I'm surprised by the brilliance not only of Vonnegut, but of the translation of his text to the screen. <br /> <br /> Do Do not rent or watch this movie on VHS, it must be done on DVD and must be accompanied by the director's comment about the film. To see how they took a fairly simple story, but complex in its content and dialogue, and made it work so well, I think any viewer will be surprised. <br /> <br /> The omissions in the film are few of the text, and it does not take long, the film could be the book, and it's the best adaptation I've seen. I recommend both the book and the film together, which is useless simply to say "Go see it". <br /> <br /> It will change if it does.
