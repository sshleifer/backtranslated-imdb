['All I hear is how bad the animation is made. It may not be up to what everyone expects, but look at it this way. Would you expect perfection in hell? It is my belief that the animation became dry and grit on purpose. It was great to see the transformation of his character in this movie, considering that it will probably be as close to the live action as we can get. I expect a sequel very soon. If we want live action, I think we could be better with Chastity or Purgatori. I do not think Lady Death would move well to the movies. But be that as it may, it is my personal belief that all those who say badly about this movie are DEAD. There is no wordplay.']
