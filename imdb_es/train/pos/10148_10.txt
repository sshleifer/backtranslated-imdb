I would have given this movie some stars, simply because it was a "for life" presentation filmed at the location represented in the story, here, in New York City. The majority on this channel, whether it is "placed" there, in the rural areas of Iowa, Oregon, Virginia, LA, etc., were filmed in Vancouver, Ottawa, Toronto or some other Canadian location. <br /> <br /> But if there was ever One that deserves the highest rating: 10 * on this site, it's this movie. Certainly not for the originality, since this story has been done many times, in many variations, with several very similar to this specific one. It has also been done quite often on the big screen, with mega-stars, past and present, by Cary Grant, James Garner, Harrison Ford, Tom Hanks and others, and Deborah Kerr, Doris Day, Meg Ryan and many more. I can think of at least 10-12 more, just prominent, past to present, out of my head, that could be added now, and there are probably many others that could be remembered. <br /> <Br /> Do not keep talking, but my point is that, in my opinion, this is by far one of the best of this genre I've seen. I caught it by chance at noon on Friday, at a time when I had the TV on just because it was taking me a couple of hours after a particularly hectic week. I had never encountered this film in the 8 years since it was made. And, although the two tracks have done enough to be known by the majority, they were completely unknown to me. The only two actors I met were Phyllis Newman (Anna's mother) whom I had seen in some things since her youth, and Michael Rispoli (Henry, Charlie's best friend) who stood out as "Gramma", the threatening loan of juice, difficult, street boy from "Rounders". <br /> <br /> The casual encounter and the coupling between the best friends of both potential clients, like a romance of sub-history, with the correlation that they are such that Anna and Charlie only reveal themselves to all later It is a usual practice. Trace art within the genre, but it makes no difference to the enjoyment here (in fact, it improves it). <br /> <br /> When checking out some other comments, I completely agree with those who are more positive. The main word that describes this movie is ENGAGING, in capital letters. This adjective describes the performers; the characters; the chemistry between and among all the characters, in the combination that is presented, and all the secondary and even secondary roles. <br /> <br /> I love movies with a "harder edge:" "Rounders"; the escapist Schwarzenegger / Stallone fare; "Good companions;" even the classics like "Casablanca", "Gone with the Wind", "Citizen Kane". But for a pure and uncomplicated enjoyment, this was exceptional. With a minimum fraction of their budgets, it was equal to the results obtained by "Has Have Mail" and "Sleepless in Seattle". And Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan could not have done better than Natasha Henstridge and Michael Vartan here; The co-stars and support staff here were equivalent to those of these mega-movies, too.
