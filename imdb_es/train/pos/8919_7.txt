Who would think that "Helen Crump" (Aneta Corsaut) by Andy Griffith had a Steve McQueen movie in his past? But that's just one of the many strange and wonderful things about the latest teen-to-the-battle-play movie of the 1950s, which could best be described as Rebel without cause because God knows what of outer space. The Rebel is Steven McQueen (who would shortly decide that "Steve" sounded less delicate), a good boy with enough wildness to be interesting; The very healthy but understanding bride is the aforementioned Aneta Corsaut. It was bad enough when his date was interrupted by hot teens, but they are much more baffled when they come across a gelatinous, man-eater, What Is It, who travels to earth on his own meteorite, and begins to engulf people from town. right and left. But will adults believe them? Of course not, what do they know, they are just children! <br /> <br /> The movie is a teenage madness in its best teenage version. The actors take the pretentious script very seriously, with a lot of moving looks, and the "adult" support cast probably says "Kids!" very third sentence more or less. But the real pleasure of the film is its creature, which is well imagined, well executed and often manages to generate a surprising degree of suspense. And while it's clearly on the cheap side (check out those miniature games, guys!), THE BLOB is actually a pretty well made movie, and there's a catchy little song that's included in a good measure. The audience of more than 40 years (including myself) will enjoy the movie as nostalgia, but that will not stop them from sounding at the same time as the youngest group in its 1950s sense of whole milk and white bread, and the film would be a great choice for a night of family movies or for a more sophisticated group "only for adults". Prepare enough jelly cubes to chop movies! Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
