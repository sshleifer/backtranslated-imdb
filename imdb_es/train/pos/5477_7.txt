An original, uncensored copy of this incredible film was discovered in 2004 at the Library of Congress and has been shown at some specialized theaters around the world in 2005. According to the current revisions that I have found online, the original has all the Dialogues more unpleasant and insinuations intact; Later, the studio eliminated them or re-shot completely before the initial release, to approve the censors of the state of New York. I also read that a DVD is "expected in 2006" and can only be expected! If we are really fortunate, it will include comparisons between the 2 versions. Note that the published censored version was originally available on Laserdisc, which I have seen. Stanwyck rules!
