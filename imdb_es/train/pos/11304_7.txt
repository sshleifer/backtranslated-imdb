I'm not sure under what circumstances Director Visconti decided to film James Cain's novel "The Postman Always Rings Twice" (I'm not even sure if Viscounti acquired the rights to the book), but the resulting film is definitely interesting. It is not the best version of Cain's story (I like the 1981 version more), but thanks to the excellent direction of Visconti and the casting of Clara Calamai and Massimo Girotti (a very sensual couple), it is a must for the Noir fans. Visconti mixes neorealism with noir sensibilities with great effect. However, the movie is not perfect. My main complaint is that the film is too long for its own good; the story moves at a very slow pace (I do not think Visconti was very good at editing his films). I think Film Noir works better with a short runtime. Fortunately, Calamai and Girotti are magnetic actors that keep the viewer interested. Anyway, as much as I like this movie and the remakes, I think nobody has made the definitive version of Cain's much-praised book.
