For my life, why did this movie receive a grade of R? While it's zombies that eat meat, believe it or not, it's actually a good movie for the whole family, at least if their children are 10 or older. Unlike traditional zombie movies, it has an excellent sense of humor and traditional values, albeit a bit crooked! Language is not a serious problem, there is no nudity and the style of the film is definitely geared towards children (like the old TV show "Eerie, Indiana"). However, some knuckles slapped a rating of R one! Believe me, most children have seen violence worse than this and it seems silly to make the public think that this is an adult-only movie. <br /> <br /> The story takes place in a parallel type world. While fashions, cars and customs appear around 1953, in this bizarre world there has been a recent and ferocious plague of zombies that resulted in the "war of zombies" and in massive changes in daily life. At school, the children are trained in armed combat and there is a nice scene at the end of the film where the father gives his son a gun and tells him to keep it in his backpack "just in case". As for life outside of school, it is also quite strange, since people have now learned that zombies are NOT such a bad thing. Demons, wearing collars and training, can become slaves who can do housework, clean streets, deliver milk or, in the case of a really sick guy, be their "special friend". <br /> <br /> This film is about a particular family who finally buys their first zombie slave (played by Billy Connally). Mom is excited and her son slowly becomes the zombie's friend. Dad, on the other hand, is not convinced, since he was forced years before to kill his own zombie father and has not yet overcome this. Fun, irreverent and unique: this film should be seen by a much wider audience.
