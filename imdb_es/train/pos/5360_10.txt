Between standard action movies of a line type, where action and logic are checked at the door, this movie is at the top of the class. If the person in charge of the cast had put "good" actors in this movie, it would have been worse (except for Richard Dawson, who acted well, if you can call "acting"). I love this movie! The ordinary man is, in all likelihood, God's gift to man (well, maybe only men). Definitely, the most quotable movie of our time, so I'll separate you from my favorite line: "It's part of the rich pattern of life, Brenda, and you'd better get used to it." Ahh, more people have been called "Brenda" for citing this movie than I can imagine.
