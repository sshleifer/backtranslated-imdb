The sensitive film lacks brilliance and, to some extent, narrative structure, but, nevertheless, it is magnificently filmed and made. However, the narrative structure is debatable. While it gives the impression of tying loose ends in the final scenes, and connects your thoughts with what the modern viewer might describe as a "story", I am skeptical about whether this sensation * needs * a "narrative structure" that it is defined and detectable. Inevitably, it will be compared with SOMERSAULT in the sense that its central protagonist (I'm not sure it's the right word!) Is a young and very young looking woman, whose newfound sexuality confuses and empowers her, although for Of course, Cate Shortland's film tackles this aspect better. But while there is a possibility that reckless viewers may dismiss this film as a clich√©, PEACHES is, in a way, much more ambitious than SOMERSAULT. Maybe that's where he does not succeed. It is certainly very different from the first feature of Monahan: THE INTERVIEW! I'm not quite sure how the sex scenes between Weaving and Lung were added to the story. Who knows, maybe they did it. Undoubtedly, they appropriated the compromised and defective nature of the character of Weaving, although I personally believe that this was achieved without the need for these scenes. <br /> <br /> ***** WE'LL SEE THE FILM ***** **** <br /> <br /> In a second visualization, I can see how some would dismiss it as a disguised telemobile of function. But I'm not sure how different these 'categories' are, or even if we should make that distinction. In any case, I think there are enough layers in the film to distinguish it from Hallmark's efforts. On the other hand, the structure of the film is very formal and its content is hardly challenging, at least in the way that SOMERSAULT, TOM WHITE, THREE DOLLARS, THE FAMILY ILLUSTRATED DOCTOR, LOOK BOTH WAYS and THE HUMAN TOUCH. The performances are all good, but I realized that the main reason I was enjoying the movie was because it fit the "Australian" genre, without necessarily adding anything ... and I can understand that this can be quite good. reason for someone else * NOT * to like it! In fact, it was not until Lung came into the room in his Vietnamese attire that the movie really started to hit. But that brings us to another debate: should we expect a movie to challenge us all the time? I certainly enjoy being challenged by a movie (or a book or other people), but is there no longer room for what is simply a good story? <br /> <br /> I have not deleted my initial publication in this Film, because I am well aware of the Orwellian nuances of such an act. But it would lower my initial rating from an 8 to perhaps a 6.5. <br /> <br /> Regarding the nominations for the Best Film of AFI, my votes go to THE HUMAN TOUCH, THREE DOLLARS and LOOK BOTH WAYS, and I believe that LOOK BOTH WAYS must win.
