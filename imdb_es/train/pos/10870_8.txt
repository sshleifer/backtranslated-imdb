Personally, I think the movie is a good watch. It outlines the actual situation of the triads in Hong Kong and gives the viewer a glimpse of how the triads are organized. <br /> <br /> Not only that, it also shows you how the Hong Kong police control the triad situation and why the police not only do everything possible to eliminate the triads. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is quite violent due to the methods of killing and torture in the neighborhoods. However, the film remains true to the real world, so the violence on the screen is only a reflection of what really happens. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to any Triad / Mafia fan. Another good watch would be Dragon Squad. That movie has more weapons than this one, since in this movie there are more knives than weapons (in fact, I do not remember having seen a single gun).
