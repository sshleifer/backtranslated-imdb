"Home Room" was a total surprise. Having no idea what it was, gave good results because it has no impact and what we see is how lives are changed by the act of a young discontent that decided to victimize their classmates, who are the innocent victims of his reckless actions. <br /> <br /> Paul Ryan, the director, who is working and editing his own material, is a talented man who is rewarded for the incredible performance of his cast. <br /> <br /> Alicia Browning is an older girl who is trying to graduate from high school. She has been away for a couple of years and does not seem to be in the same wave as the other students. On the one hand, she is a rebel with a punk look, a lot of makeup and a mouth that will cut off anyone who dares approach her orbit. Alicia was among the students in the living room of the house where nine students have died, allegedly murdered by her boyfriend. We realize that Alicia is a wounded child who has gone through a terrible experience in her life, but we are not given any clue about it. <br /> <br /> What follows is the consequence of the tragedy, since it focuses on a young woman who has survived it. Deanna Cartwright is a wealthy teenager who should not have been in school at all. When a bouncing bullet strikes her, she is hospitalized with more than one wound. She is trying to overcome this dark period in her mind, but nightmares do not let her forget. <br /> <br /> The director of the school forces Alicia to go to the hospital. Since she does not cooperate with the police, the school principal wants her to see Deanna in her terrible state and perhaps soften up and tell the authorities what she knows. Alicia does not like Deanna, but in a matter of days, both girls will make peace. We do not realize until the last sequence of what really happened that horrible day at school. <br /> <br /> Busy Phillips makes Alicia excellent and Erika Christiansen is just as good as Deanna. Victor Garber, James Pinkins, Taylor Holland and the rest of the cast are presented as a whole. <br /> <br /> The film has an intensity because it is not explicit in showing how the shots happened, which helps the tone that Mr. Ryan wanted to give him this movie.
