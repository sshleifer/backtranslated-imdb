The father of Who's alcoholic drummer, Keith Moon, was called Arthur. I found so many similarities between Dudley Moore and Keith Moon in this movie. Liza Minelli, who usually MAKE OVERPOINTS, did a good job in this case, and was able to put Dudley Moore in evidence every shift. Yes, I agree, Sir John stole absolutely all the scenes. It was a very "different" movie, which allowed the viewer to take a look at another life. We often try to capture a repeat of this movie on a satellite. God rests Dudley Moore; This was such a nice movie. Much satire and thumbs towards the rich and sumptuous / wealthy. The close friendship between Moore and Sir John is quite attractive.
