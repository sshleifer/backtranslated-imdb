This may be the most nostalgic journey back in time and time until childhood begins a journey towards reminiscences back and forth, forward and backward, up and down and to all sides. The child Jimmy, H.R. Puffinstuff, Dr.Blinky, Cling & Clang, Ludicrous Lion, and even the evil Witchie Poo too. The latest inspirations from Lidsville, "The Brady Kids Saturday Preview Special" Sigmund & the Sea Monsters, and Land of the Lost, the new and the old, are what this show saved the breach, as well as The Donny & Marie Show, The Brady Bunch Variety Hour, also known as Brady Bunch Hour and even the Halloween special by Paul Lynde. Maybe even other things between & Beyond the Buck continue and continue and exceed expectations, as well as unexpected limits. Now that we have updated ourselves in March of 2006, we know that Jack Wild has left and now they do. even more symbolic so that we become truly nostalgic. Including now in August of 2006, when the guest of Jack Wild stars Sigmund and The Sea Monsters, as well as when in a final episode, HRPuffinstuff also does it and to remember everything else. nostalgic travels of all Syd and Marty Kroft characters, such as the Goodtime Club HRPuffinstuff, the Donny and Marie Show, the Brady Group Variety Time also known as the Brady Bunch Hour, etc. Sincerely, Stephen "Steve" G. Baer a.k.a. "Ste" from Framingham, MA.USA.
