['This anime shook my socks seriously. When the anime opened for the first time, I felt it was too slow; History did not advance much, and Shirou was an unimpressive male leader. Once he learns more about tracking, and you learn more about Knowledge and the Holy Grail War itself, the story is resolved and you can see several facets of it moving together. It was fantastic. <br /><br /> In addition, I felt that the way in which the characters developed was very true to be formed with the way in which real people develop, in the real world. There was no stupid thing completely obvious; The development of Ilya and Rin was interesting to see, but I think the way in which Shirou and Saber grew in their personalities was interesting just to see all this. Some of the &quot;surprise&quot; people that appeared (Gilgamesh?) Seemed to be unique to the rest of the cast in one way or another, which means that we did not have to replace &quot;Bad-ass A generic&quot; with &quot;Generic Bad-ass B &quot;as soon as A died. <br /><br /> Anddd, I loved music. The opening music shook, and the final theme of the final episode simply ... Seriously pushed the theme of the last episode even more. Good job, Type-MOON!']
