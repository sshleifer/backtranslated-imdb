Saving Grace is a good movie to watch on a boring afternoon, when you're looking for something different from normal scripts and want to have fun. I mean, the whole idea of ​​this movie and all the marijuana in it is crazy! It was the first movie I saw with this theme (drugs / marijuana) that does not really criticize, just jokes about it. Grace Trevethyn is a widow, who lives in a small town in U.K. and has many financial problems due to her dead husband, who committed suicide because he was full of debts. The problem is that Grace, who imagined that she had some money saved for her, discovers that she needs to pay off all her husband's debts so as not to lose all her things, especially the house she loves so much. She never worked before, and is in a tragic situation until Matthew, her gardener, very skilled at smoking marijuana, decides to partner with her to sell marijuana on a large scale.
