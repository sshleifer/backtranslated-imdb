I saw this photo in 1940 for $ .11 and I would like to insure a DVD in 2006. The movie was the greatest adventure of the time and, like all epics, it is still a marvel of entertainment (B & W and everything). The real friendship in the chemistry between the actors and the performances of Sam Jaffe and Eduardo Cianelli is outstanding (this could not be done today.) I particularly liked the ending where the colonel recited the end of Kipling's poem about the body of Gunga Din and he says to the "Untouchable" "You're a better man than me, Gunga Din." They do not make films of this character today, the only cast member still alive today is Joan Fontaine
