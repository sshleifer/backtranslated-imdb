Think of Pierce Brosnan and think of James Bond, soft, elegant and intelligent. In this film, Brosnan plays against the guy and has a lot of fun doing it (like the audience). This is a movie about a hired killer who befriends a harried businessman ... and it works! <br /> <br /> This is a funny movie, with very good scenes (a fascinating, cutting-edge Brosnan and a good, obedient "off" -the Kinnear edge has some good lines). My only obstacle is that Hope Davis, who plays the wife so tolerant ("Can I see your gun?") Does not appear more often: it could have been a wonderful gift for these men. <br /> <br /> This movie is like a killer: play with the audience, while "going to kill". The ending is impressive because a story emerges (with a positive moral!): This is a frantic, frenetic and funny movie that deserves a wide audience.
