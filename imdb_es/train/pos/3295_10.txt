['A beauty film that is hard to describe. Maybe it&#39;s the absence of a superfluous dialogue, or maybe it&#39;s the absolutely stellar soundtrack, or maybe it&#39;s just Meena Mumari&#39;s feet, but it&#39;s a joy to see this movie over and over again. I have never seen another Indian movie that approaches him, and few of any country rival his perfection.']
