From the writer of "What happened to Baby Jane?" and "Silence ... Silence, sweet Charlotte", this end of the sixties horror cycle has some spooky fun and countryside. Micheal Macliamm√≥ir does Victor Buono a little bit, but all too often the film teeters dangerously close to a bad musical ... there is a particularly horrible children's recital in half. Debbie hits, tangos and cheats on a Harlow, while the religious fanatic of Winters has a lesbian touch for her. Agnes Moorehead is registered as an evangelist. Weaver has nothing to do, and he even has to pay a gigolo to dance with Debbie.
