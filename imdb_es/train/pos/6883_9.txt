Rarely does a movie appear that has the power to expand the mind, warm the heart and touch the soul. "LOU" is such a movie. I got the "LOU" from my wife, who got it from a neighbor who is in the movie business. She looked at him a second time with me. We were both captivated. She like it was the first time. <br /> <br /> "LOU" is a magical piece designed to send you back to the moment when all your dramas began to take place. He does it while he is entertained without rest. The acting and the rhythm of Bret Carr as director do not let you look away from the screen. He creates a character that disarms with an insect bunny, stammering innocence, but affectionately led with such sincerity that you forget you're watching a movie. When the epiphany arrives during the brilliant climax, I saw my wife cry for the second time. <br /> <br /> As a life coach, I facilitate individual growth and transformation, and this film is a "must see" for life coaches and anyone looking for their own personal growth and transformation. It's a brilliant and creative masterpiece with the power to change lives!
