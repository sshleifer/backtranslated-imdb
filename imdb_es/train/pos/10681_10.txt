While the British produced some fun and funny comedies in the 1990s: Ab Fab, Men Behaving Badly, One Foot in the Grave, etc., the 70s was the true golden age. <br /> <br /> In the 1970s there were new territories to explore, including the sexual revolution, feminism and slowly evolving consciousness about the need for a "sensitivity" that, twenty years later, would become a correction politics. The attempts to deal with the confusion of this completely modern world were the subtle and not so subtle issues in everything from the parodies of the Monty Python Flying Circus to comedies such as Man About the House. (At the end of the 70s, this "attack" resulted in more meditative and bittersweet comedies, such as the masterpiece Butterflies.) <br /> <br /> Man About the House is a perfect example of the good Britcoms of the time : Slightly elegant, cheeky, fresh, naive, sometimes scandalous, with some well-made observations about contemporary life. Compare it to a cynical 90s show like Ab Fab, and it's hard to believe that the two were created in the same country. <br /> <br /> Man About the House is one of the great Britcoms of the 70s, right? up there, with Good Neighbors (The Good Life), and About the House spin off from George and Mildred. Its quality is confirmed by the fact that, as with Good Neighbors, its creators, writers and many of its actors have had continued success in British television.
