If you have read the books, then forget the characters that Tolkien built in your head. The representation of hobbits, dwarves, etc. has had the 'disney' treatment. The dark riders are excellent, and as I had always imagined in the books. <br /> <br /> Kinematically this is an excellent movie, which combines live movement and animation to produce amazing effects for the year. I only wish that he (Bakshi) had been given the money to complete his epic. <br /> <br /> It's worth having the video since it will be worth a little bit after the 2001 Lord of the Rings!
