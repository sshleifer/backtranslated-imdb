The undoubted highlight of this film is the performance of Peter O'Toole. In turn, tremendously funny and terribly tragic. Does anyone do it better than O'Toole? I do not think so. What a great face man has! <br /> <br /> The story is strange and quite disturbing and emotionally intense in some parts (especially towards the end) but it is also strangely moving and successful on many levels. However, I felt that the film basically revolved around the light performance of Peter O'Toole and I am sure I would not have enjoyed it half if I had not been in it.
