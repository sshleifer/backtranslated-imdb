I do not think a movie like this is released today. It takes time to present the depth of the characters and the plot is not full of twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat. <br /> <br /> But, what this movie has: an interesting study on how families deal with pain. How when the language to heal and overcome the tremendous loss leaves us speechless and, instead, we depend on raw emotions. Grief without reason and patience is anger, even hatred. And unfortunately, the main character (a young man who accidentally shoots and kills his brother while hunting) in the movie receives more than his fair share. Finally he leaves and moves in with his grandfather (Wilford Brimley) who makes it clear that it was an accident. I got the impression that this young man knew that in his heart, but he needed to hear those words from his parents and receive his forgiveness. <br /> <br /> What I loved about this movie: the lack of dialogue. There was tremendous emphasis on physical reaction, facial expressions. And the slower pace of the movie allows you to really see the reactions of the actors. Something that we can not do much with today's movies. <br /> <br />
