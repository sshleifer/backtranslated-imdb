I just saw this recently, after an interval of almost forty years. It holds up well, especially the outstanding songs of Lionel Bart. ("Who Will Buy" with its magical counterpoint, just one of the many highlights). <br /> <br /> I do not agree with the other publication that denounced its rating of G. The classification system, completely new at that time, never intended that the G (General) rating would mean "completely without conflict". <br /> <br /> By characterizing it as inappropriate for children, it reminds me of the description I once saw. The Wizard of Oz: A girl arrives in a strange land and kills the first person she meets. Then he goes on a road trip with three companions and kills again.
