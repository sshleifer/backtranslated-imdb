Riding Giants is an incredible documentary that details the history and stories of three influential wave surfers, Gregg Noll, Jeff Clark and Laird Hamilton. Stacy Peralta did an incredible job assuming the role of director and should be congratulated for doing such a brilliant job. The structure of the film is brilliantly edited and works perfectly with the narration, interviews, animation and surf footage. The soundtrack of the music adds to the overall satisfaction of watching this movie, which makes Riding Giants brilliant. Personal details include any of Greg Noll's comments, with his direct directness, the images of Laird Hamilton in Teahupoo and the shots at the end of the film. But, in reality, this whole movie is a great featured event that is recommended if you have the opportunity to see it. It is a pity that it is not better known, but it is a jewel that deserves attention. 10/10
