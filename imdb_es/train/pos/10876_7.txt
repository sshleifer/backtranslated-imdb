I was very excited to see this movie. I thought that Australia had finally made a good movie ... but I was wrong. <br /> <br /> This was the most pathetic attempt of a slasher movie. I'm sorry that Molly Ringwald came to Australia to make a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> The acting was terrible (especially the Australian guy who was trying to speak with an American accent) and the plot was also pretty bad. <br /> <br /> When I first heard this movie come out, I thought the title was pathetic (because it sounds like the cheesy movie "Stab" in Scream 2), but I was willing to let it go if it was a good movie . <br /> <br /> WARNING! MAIN SPOILERS !!! <br /> <br /> Probably the worst of the movie was the ending. I expected a big surprise about who was the murderer ... but the murderer was not even human ... what turned this realistic horror movie into a terrible horror movie. <br /> <br /> I do not see this movie. You will probably be disappointed!
