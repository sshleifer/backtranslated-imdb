I have not laughed so much in a long time, although the movie also has some sad moments, especially when it changes from hyper-funny to honest and serious. The characters are very realistic most of the time, sometimes sappy, but quite credible. I'm not a fan of Jerry Springer's show; I feel sorry for the participants. This film, on the other hand, is a satire, and it is doing very well. <br /> <br /> Too bad all the insults have come out with a whistle while this movie aired on public television, that makes it a lot of fun. I'm going to rent this movie to enjoy it to the fullest. <br /> <br />
