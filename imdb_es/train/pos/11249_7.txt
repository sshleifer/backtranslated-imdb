I just watched the 6 full episodes on DVD. The acting in everything is excellent, without a doubt. There was not enough action for me, I must say. There is no real suspense as such, just a lot of first class character development. Nothing like Tinker Tailor in terms of "whodunnit". If you like a good story told slowly and carefully, then this is for you. Peter Egan as leader Magnus Pym is excellent. <br /> <br /> The film portrays the life of a traitor. A man who should have been a loyal member of the British Intelligence Service but who was so psychologically damaged by his unhappy childhood that deception became his way of life in all things. When he was a boy, he adored his father, but his father was exposed again and again as a swindler and a swindler. Pym did not betray by ideology or money, but because he needed to deceive those closest to him (wife, son, mentor). Pym is fatally damaged by his father's influence: he has eaten up his moral fiber. He has no true love or loyalty in him. <br /> <br /> Heavy psychological things and there are not many light moments in the 6-hour series. Although very well done.
