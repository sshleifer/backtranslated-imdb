I really did not expect much from this movie, but it was not bad; Actually it was pretty good. This movie contained a couple of the funniest parts of the script I've seen in a movie. Now I'm not saying that this is one of the funniest movies of all time, but I laughed a lot in some places. "The police ruled that my father's death was suicide, they said he fell through an elevator shaft, in some bullets." Now this movie is not for everyone, its humor is mostly stupid like Zoolander or Dodgeball; So if you hated these movies, I would probably recommend you stay away. In general, it was a nice movie, about a group of aspiring superheroes, who in the end become true heroes. It is a very overrated comedy that many people probably have not seen yet, because like me, before seeing it, I expected it to be a total garbage. After watching this movie, I finally understand why this movie could bring together a superstar cast that includes Ben Stiller, William H. Macy, Hank Azaria and even that child from Good Burger. It's because Mystery Man is filled with an excellent comic writing period of 7 out of 10. A big surprise.
