Viggo Mortensen plays a new prisoner in an enchanted prison in which the director (Played well by Lane Smith) has an awful secret that could be the reason why several prison guards and prisoners are killed by a supernatural presence. Lincoln Kilpatrick is the lifesaver who knows the secret and fears for his life. When I think of prison films, I always think of action movies starring Stallone or Van Damme or in high-caliber dramas like Shawshank Redemption or The Green Mile. However, I did not expect a more ghost story from the Exorcist III. However, prison is an atmospheric endeavor and certainly remains the best movie of Renny Harlin's career. The film is spooky and has a good performance from a cast of strangers (at that time). Lane Smith is the best, because his director is not the usual clich√© of evil personified, but rather nervous and nervous, which adds credibility to a film that far exceeds expectations. <br /> <br /> *** from 4 to 4 (Good)
