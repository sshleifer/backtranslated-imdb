How can the viewer rating for this movie be only 5.4? Only the lovely young Alisan Porter should start automatically with 6 when you decide your rating. James Belushi is also good at this, his first good serious role, I had not liked anything more than About Last Night until this. It was pretty good at Gang Related with Tupac too. Kelly Lynch, you have to love her. Okay I will. I'm just wondering what happened to Miss Porter? <br /> <br /> I gave Curly Sue a 7
