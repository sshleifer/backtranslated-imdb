This program is undoubtedly one of the best television programs. I mean, the acting is great, the suspense, the drama, the comedy, it has everything, and with such a simple story: a plane crashed on an island. The characters are great and Evangeline Lilly is HOT !!! Matthew Fox, once again, shows us what a good actor he is, Josh Holloway is great, Jorge Garcia is very funny, he could go on and on. In addition, the unexpected plot twists, the background stories of the characters, the music that is at the end of each episode. J.J. Abrahms has shown once again that he is an excellent writer and producer. I want to say that this is better than ALIAS, and I loved ALIAS. Whoever is not watching this program, should definitely consider getting the DVDs and watching them, because they are missing something great. This program could be the best program in the history of television!
