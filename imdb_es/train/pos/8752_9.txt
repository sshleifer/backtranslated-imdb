I've been waiting for an image as original as this for quite some time. Brokedown Palace has that "hard to believe" aspect, however, with the ingenious direction and script, the Palace has a great score. <br /> <br /> I have never really enjoyed seeing Claire Danes in any of her movies, but I'll tell you what, it really changed my opinion with this one. Kate Beckinsale joins the Danish on holiday in Thailand, where they meet a young man who convinces them to travel to Hong Kong with him. However, he refused to inform them that they would carry an obscene amount of narcotics for him. Well, ultimately, they are trapped and end up in a Thai prison. I know, I know, how can you not know you have 18 pounds of drugs? Well, if you can overcome that small mistake, you will find a story very well written and represented. Lately I have been attracted by the stories of the movies that I see and by developing a personal feeling towards the characters I see. This movie is not different. At the end of the film I found myself taking more care of her than any of the other characters in the film. <br /> <br /> Bill Pullman plays Hank Green, a lawyer who lives in Thailand and specializes in international relations. As always, Pullman offers excellent performance and unites the film perfectly. <br /> <br /> There are some twists and turns that, at the end of the movie, will make you cry. This is one of those movies you probably went through when looking for that movie to watch at home. It is my opinion that the next time you go to the video store, do not go through this again.
