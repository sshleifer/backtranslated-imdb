This show is wonderful. It has some of the best writings I've seen. It has a brilliant direction directed by Dvid Trainer, who also directed another intelligent television series called BOY MEETS WORLD. <br /> <br /> This program is undoubtedly one of the best. Like THREE'S COMPANY, ROSEANNE, and the famous COSBY SHOW, this will be on TV for a long time. <br /> <br /> From his perfectly crafted jokes to the great presentations that he would only dream of, it is a wonderful spectacle. For the people who lived in the seventies and for those who did not. This show attracts young people and young people at heart. A perfect show
