['The Five Deadly Venoms is easily the most memorable KF movie of the Shaw Brothers stable (maybe Master Killer). It has the artists who came to be known simply as &quot;The Venoms&quot;, one of the best choreography of fights and, surprisingly, for a Kung Fu movie, a great plot! One of my all time favorites!!!']
