The first installment of this notorious horror series features a woman who was kidnapped by a gang of men dressed in black who tortured her for several days before finally killing her. They beat her savagely, they turn her in the chair without stopping, they take out her nails. Guts are thrown at the animals, boiling water is thrown at them and finally their eyeball is punctured with a needle (really sick and unpleasant scene). The creators of this unforgettable torture show tried to make it as real as possible and for me this. One of them is the closest thing to a snuff film you can get without committing a murder on the tape. Of course, some of the special effects are pretty bad, but the idea of ​​making a snuff is pretty scary. I have also seen "Flowers of flesh and blood" which is more bloody and sadistic, but less annoying. Anyway, this is a must see for horror fans!
