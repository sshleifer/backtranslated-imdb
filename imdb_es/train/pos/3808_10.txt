I voted this for a 10 out of 10 simply because it's the best animated story I've seen in quite some time. The animation is awesome. The work of art behind each landscape was beautiful. From colors to lighting to non-standard art rate. I was impressed Moving beyond the beauty of the screen, you will be immersed in a story that is both timeless and cool at the same time. The development of the character is short, however, these key moments are exactly what is needed to give the viewer an idea of ​​what and why and how the character has reached where it is. I am impressed with the whole thing and I think this is a must for the whole family.
