"Shore Leave" is mainly an average Star Trek adventure. However, there is nothing wrong with the episode. I just think that this is not the best representation of what the show had to offer fans. It's light entertaining, nothing more. However, I am happy to see that a television show of this kind had enough sense to take a break from the serious intergalactic conflicts. In this episode, Kirk decides to give his crew some free time, and a landing group is transmitted to a planet that seems like the perfect place for a vacation. As usual, the planet is not as peaceful as it seems. There are some moments of action and tension, but most of the story is played to laugh. Good, but not exceptional.
