['Can such environmental production have failed its main objective, which was to correctly adapt Allende&#39;s novel? Obviously yes. Bille August managed to make a superficial and superficial film where the basic elements of the South American mentality are presented simply as parallel events, which results in a total incoherence. I can not believe that there was a whole production team that could not understand the book! Of course, there is technical quality in this film and I think the actors did the best they could with what they had in their hands, but something is missing. And this something was the most important part.']
