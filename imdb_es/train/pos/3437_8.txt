Some genre films need to be dressed. This was an exception. Taken on its own merit, it is an arranged version of the horror genre film. With minimal special effects, it manages to be a psychological type study, with a simple but existential theme: to whom does the bus hit and why to it? It is not a great movie, however, because the idea works little, the story works. Subtle, and all about the interactions of the characters. Actually, there is a contraption in the initial scenes, but it may have been placed there simply to set the tone of things to come. I greatly appreciate the balance of masculine and feminine energy, and I would not recommend this story to anyone interested more than to people who react to a physical and psychological challenge. You will enjoy the movie if you have some empathy, appreciate the need for a little adventure in your life and ask yourself "What would I do in this situation?"
