I took this movie in a screening test. I was very surprised to find a really sweet and funny story. Well acted. Natasha Henstridge is the next Julia Roberts. The male protagonist was impressive. Very funny movie It takes place in the best locations in New York. It made me want to go there. I just saw "You have an email" I thought "It had to be you" was a much better story. More fresh. <br /> <br /> It was clean and great for the whole family. I think it will work well Audience I saw it with love. A definitive recommendation!
