Any story comprises a premise, characters and conflict. The characters who plan their own work promise triumph, and a militant character lends itself easily to this. The premise of Ardh Satya is summarized in the poem of the same name written by Dilip Chitre. The line goes: "ek palde mein napunsaktha, doosre palde mein paurush, aur teek tarazu ke kaante par, ardh satya?". An approximate translation: "The delicate balance of right and wrong (commonly seen in busts of blind justice in the courts) has impotence in one dish and skill in another." Is the needle in the middle a half truth? " <Br /> <br /> The poem is recited halfway in Smita Patil's film to Om Puri in a restaurant. It has a profound impact on the protagonist and lays the foundation for much of the subsequent events that follow. At the end of the film, Om Puri ends up in exactly the same situation that is described so precisely in the poem. <br /> <br /> The film tries hard to review the poem. However, Chitre's words are too powerful and, at best, the film matches the poem in all respects. <br /> <br />
