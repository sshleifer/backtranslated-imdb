But just as entertaining and random! I love it or you hate it, but do not expect a sophisticated plot or a jockstrap that bites your nails. Think of it as Seinfeld, but without the follow-up and repetition of extravagant characters (well ... so far, I have the feeling that I will develop favorites as the season continues). <br /> <br /> "Creature The comforts" are not for the weakest of humor; They are designed to be enjoyed with the least possible effort from your brain. That's why this program includes everything I need in a program when I get home from work at night: a superficial conversation in the background with the right amount of "cute" for the characters to enjoy when I finally look up from the Computer to see what I'm missing. <br /> <br /> More fun than most situation comedies today, quieter than a night in NASCAR. Just the right mix of dead air and reappearances. I can not wait for the next one.
