I just watched a press screening of this movie and I was pleasantly surprised. It is not often that I can see all my favorite actors in one movie at a time. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the pocket scene and it was good to see Rachael Bilson and Hayden again together. I think his chemistry on the camera is a direct result of his time together outside the camera. My favorite scene was by far (surprisingly) the piece by Bret Ratner ... Without revealing too much, I will only say that there is a surprise that leaves you hanging ... <br /> <br /> The old couple were very good together and He really had the impression that they had spent a life together. <br /> <br /> Both the Chris Cooper and Ethan Hawke segments struck a blow with surprises that seem realistic and similar to the experiences I've had in the Big Apple. About the whole movie is a great place to have a date ... especially if you already like the city itself. <br /> <br /> I can not wait for the next one in the Cities of Love.
