This story is beautifully acted. It is sad and moving the journey of a girl to discover where she comes from and where she is going. Stephanie was adopted by her mother's best friend after her mother and father were killed in a car accident, and since being cataloged as the "miraculous baby", she is dyslexic and is finding life a bit difficult. His findings on the road affect those closest to him. His relationship with his tutor and his tutor's ex-boyfriend is handled with great sensitivity and sensitivity, and the entire cast of support is genuine, three-dimensional and credible. Located around a peach canning factory in a small town in Australia, this is a warm and erotic movie, and it leaves you with a nice feeling when the credits are closed. After reading some of the other rather superficial comments about Hugo Weaving, I would like to add that I think he was a brilliant cast, and that he was extremely sexy. No, he's not Brad Pitt, but that does not mean he's not attractive.
