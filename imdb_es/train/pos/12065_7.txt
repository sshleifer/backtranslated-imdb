['&quot;Insignificance&quot; is far from being a great movie, a play, directed by Nic Roeg. In the scheme of Roeg&#39;s films, this is above the level of most of her later work on &quot;Do not Look Now,&quot; which is characterized by the judicious use of Theresa Russell as the lead actress. She is really very good here, and far from the problem in other Roeg films like &quot;Bad Timing&quot; and &quot;Cold Heaven&quot;. As the &quot;Actress&quot;, who is Marilyn Monroe, Russell is very effective, presenting her as a completely depressive, but pleasant mermaid. She plays well with Michael Emil as Einstein, who is excellent to say the least. He looks at the part admirably, and although Theresa Russell does not look exactly like Monroe, she is certainly attractive enough to make the part sound true. Other players are suitable, if not as arresting as Emil and Russell are. An intelligent script, quite functional, is well directed by Roeg, but certainly not brilliantly, like &quot;Walkabout&quot; or &quot;Performance&quot;. As in other later Roeg films, he tends to rely too much on vague and insubstantial flashbacks, which add very little to the film. In many ways, the movie would have worked better as a more modest piece (for example, 60 minutes). Still, a fairly acceptable movie, passable. Sometimes quite excellent, but in general something was missing. Rating: - *** 1/2 / *****']
