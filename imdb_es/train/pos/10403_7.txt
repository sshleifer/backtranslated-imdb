This is an oriental fantasy about "Arabian Arabian Nights" full of incredible adventures, fantasy witchcraft and magic. The evil vizier Jaffar (magnificently played by Conrad Veidt) with powerful magical powers imprison Prince Ahamad of Baghdad (attractive John Justin) who loses his throne, then escapes thanks to a small thief named Abu (sympathetic Sabu). They arrive in Basra, where Ahamad and the princess (the beautiful June Duprez) fall in love. But the prince and the thief are persecuted by Jaffar, Ahamd becomes blind and Abu becomes a dog. The story accumulates several fantastic ingredients, such as the transformation of the star, a flying mechanical horse, a magic bow, a flying carpet and, of course, the colossal genius (Rex Ingram overacting) that grants three wishes to Sabu, the magic eye , the figure of the goddess Kali with several hands, among others. <br /> <br /> This extraordinary image ranks as one of the best fantasy movies of all time. Produced by Alexander Korda of London Fim and directed by Ludwing Berger, Michael Powell and Tim Whelan with an impressive screenplay by Lajos Biro and Miles Malleson, he also talks about the writer and actor as a Sultan fan of mechanical games. The outbreak of World War II caused the paralyzing shooting, then Korda's three brothers and collaborators traveled to the United States and continued filming in Grand Cannon Colorado. The splendid cinematography in Technicolor, visual and brilliant, led to the achievement of three Oscars: production design by William Cameron Menzies and Vincent Korda, Cinematography by George Perinal and Special Effects by Osmond Borradaile, although today they are dated and it is a necessary remastering because the colors are worn. In addition, a nomination for the evocative and oriental musical score of Miklos Rozsa. This vivid tale with immense doses of imagination will delight fans of fantasy and classic moviegoers.
