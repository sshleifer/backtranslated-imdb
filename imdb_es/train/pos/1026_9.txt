['I enjoyed this show for two reasons 1. Richard Dean Anderson 2. Amanda Tapping. These two artists brought the show with the support of the usual and recurring actors. The replacement of RDA in seasons 9-10 was enough to get the heart out of the show. <br /><br /> The chemistry between all the main characters is simply tremendous. You have the feeling that the actors like to shovel when the camera stops rolling. This relationship is transferred to the program we see. <br /><br /> RDA gives his character &#39;O&#39;Neill&#39; a credible personality. He never knows when to give the sages a rest. You watch others roll their eyes in dismay at some of their statements. However, they know that he is the man to have close when the situation is dangerous. <br /><br /> There&#39;s a lot between &#39;Carter&#39; and &#39;O&#39;Neill&#39; below the surface. They manage to keep the lid, but often barely. The episode &#39;Soledades&#39; in season 1 had some of the best dramas ever seen on television. The love between the two made the prospect of dying bearable because they faced it together. <br /><br /> &#39;Carter&#39; and &#39;Jackson&#39; often have to soften some of the turbulence created by &#39;O&#39;Neill&#39;. However, the tactical instincts of O&#39;Neill always seem to be good. He understands what to do without having to think about the matter. The team has been endangered several times by others who do not listen to their orders. <br /><br /> The quality decreased markedly in seasons 9 and 10. The original story ran out and the new villains never caught my interest. Ben Browder was far inferior to RDA in bringing the show. He had his rare moments with Claudia Black, but that was it. Amanda Tapping was calling her performances these two seasons. You could see her big change in appearance after having a baby. She was probably thinking more about the child than about the show. <br /><br /> The spin-off &#39;Stargate Atlantis&#39; has a few moments, but it is mostly a weaker effort. The main characters lack the chemistry of the cast of the original. The villains (Wraiths) are so unlikely that they are ridiculous. Maybe Amanda Tapping can bring the program to life or it will not last beyond the fourth season. <br /><br /> There has always been a problem for me in the special effects for the show. Having spaceships in the form of pyramids is a monstrous design that is rarely equated in science fiction. The use of torches for lighting on these boats is equally bad. The country use of ancient Egyptian decoration that hides ultramodern technology is so difficult to accept. <br /><br /> I wondered about some of the continuity in the program as well. In the first game of season 2, &#39;Daniel Jackson&#39; was shot and his uniform has a huge hole where he was injured. He gets into a sarcophagus and heals his body and restores his uniform as if it had come off the shelf in the closet. The episode &#39;Hathor&#39; causes a sarcophagus to fall into the hands of the SGC, but it is never mentioned again. This device could have been used in several later episodes in &#39;Daniel&#39;, &#39;O&#39;Neill&#39; and &#39;Dr. Frasier &#39;.']
