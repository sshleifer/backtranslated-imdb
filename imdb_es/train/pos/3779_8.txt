I got Bill and Ted's first film for Christmas and I had to get the second one when I saw it in a store. This was (I think) as fun as the first, but a much stranger story. It was funny how they had their own personal hell and how they had to play death. The funny thing was that they played it in stupid little games like a track. The only thing that would change is that Station and Death are in the band, but other than that, it was great.
