['Someday someone will write an essay comparing Paul Naschy&#39;s &quot;Fury of the Wolfman&quot; with the great Spanish surrealist films, &quot;L&#39;age D&#39;or&quot; and &quot;Un Chien Andelou.&quot; Naschy&#39;s film is a masterpiece of delirium from beginning to end. Dali and Bunuel probably loved it, and they ate their hearts to see someone so easily make apparent what they had to break the brain to achieve it. <br /><br /> The film lacks cohesive structure although it has a plot that moves from A to B to C. Some mix about a &quot;Professor Walterman&quot;, his first name, who was bitten by a Yeti monster during an expedition to The Tibet has not been the same since then, which is understandable. One of his jealous colleagues, the crazy daughter of the famous Doctor Wolfstein, knows his condition and reveals that his wife has been cheating on him. But it is a configuration for a twisted science experiment to unleash your inner beast. <br /><br /> &quot;Walterman&quot; turns around, becomes a werewolf, kills a few people, is electrocuted, dies, buries, digs up, is taken to a castle full of circus monsters, connects to several machines, recharges With a variety of electronic effects, it is injected with powerful elixirs. , he is chained, he becomes a werewolf, a woman in a night suit with Nazi fetish boots up to his thigh whips him, runs away, helps the pretty doctor out of the castle, walks away from the circus monsters with a Ax battle, finally becomes a werewolf, and has to fight to the death against the incarnation of the female werewolf of his unfaithful wife. The lady with the Nazi boots shoots her with silver bullets from her Luger gun, they die together, and the pretty doctor goes to the morning with the journalist, who did nothing. &quot;Look, what a beautiful day it is!&quot; <br /><br /> &quot;The Wolf Man&#39;s Fury&quot; was written by Paul Naschy in a hurry. The original director, Enrique Eguilez, was fired and replaced by José María Zabalza, a drunkard who was infamously intoxicated throughout the production. He often could not work (although he found time to instruct his 14-year-old nephew to make some modifications to the script) and Naschy ended up directing much of the film uncredited. Zabalza did enough to cut out some action scenes from one of Naschy&#39;s previous films, &quot;Mark of the Wolfman.&quot; Fortunately, the scenes were good enough to be used twice, although the costumes were different, and they helped eliminate the execution time after Zabalza refused to get up to finish the movie. Postproduction was a nightmare. Nobody knew who was doing the editing, the money ran out, the master impression disappeared for a while, and then, in a pre-release screening for a movie distributor, the executive came to find Zabalza pissing on the curb in front of the theater . He was too drunk to find the bathroom, but at least he reached the curb. <br /><br /> However, somehow the movie works, if you leave it. Key those atavistic memories we have about muddy castles, catacombs, chains, whips, shady wastelands. Fans of that kind of thing will see it hypnotically even if the story as a whole does not make much sense because of the broken discontinuity of execution. In one scene, the torrential rain and the werewolf howl at the lightning; in the next shot his bone is dry and he is howling at the full moon. Then it&#39;s raining again. And yet, you do not see it as a joke. It is like a dream in development where contradictions are possible, the opposites are the same and the effects come from the causes; First, the werewolf takes the power cord and screams, and then the wire begins to spark with electricity. People say that their low budget hurts the overall effectiveness. I say that the film would have been untimely if they had one more penny to spend. It&#39;s a wonder to make something out of nothing, and it succeeds not because of what it might have had, but because of what it does. It&#39;s easy to laugh at things like this and even easier to dismiss. The trick is to be able to see through the chaos, or rather to consider the chaos as part of the effect. <br /><br /> Paul Naschy died last week at the age of 75. He had been suffering from pancreatic cancer for a year or more, he was working on film projects until his last days, but he died in Madrid, Spain, with his family while receiving chemotherapy. treatment. His rich, varied and surprisingly long career is a legacy for a man who obstinately pursues his artistic vision in the face of universal disinterest. And yet, in all of us there is an eleven-year-old boy who will see his films as &quot;Fury of the Wolfman&quot; with amazement. Even people who do not like Euro Horror will discover something in this movie to admire, if only for a minute in a couple of places. You can find it free on Archive.Org or even buy it on a DVD for a nickel. It&#39;s worth a lot, much more. <br /><br /> Surprisingly, Naschy was horrified to learn that many others like me consider this little twisted, sick and demented movie as a classic masterpiece, if not a masterpiece of Cinema Dementia. The problems she encountered during the production and the mess of a movie that was left behind were perhaps too personal a personal disappointment for Naschy to forgive her. I would never dare to forgive him, but I will say this: I prefer to see &quot;Fury of the Wolfman&quot; in his impression of public domain more dazzling, more cropped and degraded than the one of implacable and unpleasant rubbish. occurring in cinema complexes of swine flu, this or any other weekend. <br /><br /> The world lost a great artist this month. Watch your movies, and remember. <br /><br /> 9/10']
