Several years ago, the Navy maintained a studied distance away from the creation of "Men of Honor", a film based on the experiences of the first struggle of the black master's chief diver's service to overcome virulent racism. Always eager to support the films that show the best side of our Navy in the USA. UU Nimitz and two helicopter assault aircraft carriers, with ground support facilities, were provided to complement this fascinating story of a young sailor's battle with uncontrollable rage. Part of the film was filmed aboard the USA. UU Belleau Wood. <br /> <br /> Antwone Fisher wrote the directorial script for the director of Denzel Washington in which he plays a Marine psychiatrist who deals with Fisher, played effectively and deeply by Derek Luke. <br /> <br /> Fisher is an obviously brilliant enlisted man assigned to the USS. Belleau Wood (LHA-3), a first-line helicopter assault platform. Fisher seems unable to avoid launching his own attacks at the slightest provocation from his enlisted companions. Sent to the MD as part of a possible pre-separation procedure, Fisher opens slowly before the black psychiatrist, revealing a terrible childhood of great abandonment and trembling brutality. <br /> <br /> The story unfolds cautiously as Fisher. she trusts her doctor and gets the courage to pursue a love interest, a seated enlisted woman named Cheryl, played by a beautiful and beautiful Joy Bryant. <br /> <br /> Fisher reluctantly gets involved with the doctor by asking questions at a slow fire, but soon realizes that he must seek answers, even painful ones, to grow and move away from the destructive behavior that the conflict seeks. <br /> <br /> Although all the main characters are black, this story transcends race while showing the evil of exuberant religiosity. and concomitant hypocrisy in host family settings. Viola Davis, a versatile actress seen in several recent films, is an image of a sullen immorality, but it is nothing compared to the adoptive mother, Mrs. Tate (Novella Nelson), who, in a few words, would win scenes, if there were , the Oscar for the guttural brutality. <br /> <br /> The films about patient-therapist interaction follow a certain predictability (all these transference and countertransference things) but Fisher's seriousness and his doctor / mentor is really exciting. It's a good story, well told. Period. <br /> <br /> While in the Navy, "Antwone Fisher" is not, in any real sense, a service story as it was "Men of Honor", an excellent film about crushing racism directed against a real person . Nor is it really a movie about blacks. It is about surviving terrible experiences of childhood and, as Fisher says, being able to proclaim in adulthood that the victim is still "upright". The persecutors are reduced in size and importance when a brave and strong young man claims his right to a decent life with the help of a sympathetic doctor. <br /> <br /> My only objection is that Washington is a lieutenant commander, but he is addressed as a commander. With all the support people of the Navy included in the final credits, someone should have told Director Washington that his character, Like all naval officers who are below the rank of commander, it is considered "Mister". It's not a great criticism, right? :) <br /> <br /> I do not know why this movie is playing in so few theaters. It deserves a wide distribution. Derek Luke may well get an Oscar nomination. <br /> <br /> 8/10. <br /> <br />
