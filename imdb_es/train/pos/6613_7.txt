A very unique science fiction animation film, and frankly I love the uniqueness, no matter in what way, better or worse. This French film is quite interesting to watch, the technical part is innovative, like "Waking Life" that I saw recently. <br /> <br /> It took me quite a while to get used to the Black-White style, but in the end I love it, the sketch-like images are really extravagant! The future world hired is a symbol of the final destiny of the human race, which I love very much. <br /> <br /> The full plot is fine for a Sci-Fi, it's not that intriguing but it's fine, like some Hollywood products. a giant conspiracy about human eternity, a bit of cliche and the twisted end is not so convincing, some developments are too simple and insipid, and the whole movie is too long. <br /> <br /> So I think 'I'm in love with the style that this movie shows, others are not so good. <br /> <br /> On the eternity of life, I believe that most people have come to the unanimity that we do not want eternity because it demolishes. In the sense of life, we treasure our lives because they are limited and significant, if we can all live forever, the world will become a mess and a chaos. Leaving someone you love is difficult and heartbreaking, but that is also a way to show that our lives are genuine and that all emotion fills one's life and makes the world colorful and lively.
