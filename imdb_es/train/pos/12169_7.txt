On the night of his bachelor party, Paul Coleman (Jason Lee) meets the beautiful dancer Becky (Julia Stiles) at the bar, they drink a lot together and the next morning he wakes up with her in bed. His future mother-in-law calls him and informs him that his girlfriend Karen (Selma Blair) may be arriving at his apartment, and desperately asks Becky to leave her place in a hurry. Later, she finds that she has crabs, and later, in the preparation of her wedding dinner, she realizes that Becky is Karen's cousin. This is the beginning of a very funny comedy, with hilarious situations. The first attraction of this film is undoubtedly the central trio of actresses and actors. Julia Stiles and Selma Blair, who are excellent actresses and extremely beautiful, and Jason Lee, who is incredibly funny, have good performances. I laughed a lot throughout the story, but there are some scenes that are very funny. For example, when Paul finds Becky in his bed; when he finds his paintings; Your imagination in many situations; in the pharmacy, trying to buy and get explanations about crab medicine; Most of the scenes of his neighbor, the minister; when Karen calls the department stores; or when the police find a suspect to assault Paul. I could tell many other scenes, but better than the reader rent or buy this movie and have a lot of fun. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Louco Por Elas" ("Crazy For Them")
