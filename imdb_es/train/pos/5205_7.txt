A group of American students and their tutor decide to visit the ugliest part of Ireland to study ancient religious practices. Despite being warned repeatedly about the dangers of deviating from the beaten track (by the creepy local Irish boy, natch), they do just that and end up with their guts outside, courtesy of a family of consanguineous cannibals (the descendants of the infamous clan Sawney Bean, who, according to the plot of the film, raised sticks of Scotland and settled down in the Emerald Island). <br /> <br /> If you believe that porn stars and low budget horror automatically equate to tons of naked and terrible acting, then think again: the evil race is full of adult stars, but in fact, there is no as much nudity as one might expect given the 'talent' involved, and acting, although far from Oscar, is not all that bad (with the exception of Ginger Lynn Allen, who we know can make a wonderful 'French', but whose Irish It is terrible). <br /> <br /> Evil Breed opens with a magnificent style with the brutal massacre of a couple of lovers campers: after a brief sex under the canvas, the hottie improved with silicone is dragged from the store and torn by the half; the man cut off his arms and legs and roasted him on a spit. It's a very bloody start, and it augurs well for the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, after this promising start, things start to go very downhill: they introduce us to the main characters, an annoying group of Twenty-somethings just ask to be chow cannibals, and they are subject to a good amount of time lost in the form of terrible false alarms, a lot of insults about murderous druids of the local Irish bug Gary (Simon Peacock), and worst of all. , a submodernist and submodernist conversation about the conventions of horror movies (how smart!). <br /> <br /> Then, just as it seems that the movie will never get better, director Christian Viel decides to get serious: a man gets a knife in his head and there is a free sex scene in the shower with the lovely blonde Gillian Leigh (NOT a porn star, but I'm sure there's a race waiting if she wants it). After that, things get better quickly as the cannibals kick on the top team to eat meat, and the movie transforms into a real bloodbath: Gary has a machete tucked in his ass (it's about time!) AND he strangles himself with his intestines; Ginger Lynn kicks boxes to a mutant; Jenna Jameson is destroyed, eviscerated and has a silicone breast implant gnawed by a confused cannibal; a boy is decapitated by cheese wire; and Taylor Hayes looks bloody, bruised and naked with a dead fetus between her legs (apparently, it has been captured and used as breeding stock). <br /> <br /> All this is so scandalously bloody that it makes you overlook the less interesting things that are worth it, and Evil Breed gains a final score of 7/10. <br /> <br /> NB. A very problematic production and the intromission in the study resulted in Christian Viel finally abandoning the project. Shots were fired and the gore was cut to a large extent for a US release. The good news is that, although the film does not flow as well as it could have done, and it is cursed with a terrible ending, the UK DVD (the version I saw) seems to have remained relatively intact with regard to the splash ( only 13s were cut from the movie in total).
