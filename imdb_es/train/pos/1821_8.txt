When I was a girl (and my father owned a video store), this was one of my favorite movies. I had not heard much about that since, nor did I remember anything about it, since it had been forgotten in the wake of the other, probably better Don Bluth movies. However, I managed to track it a few weeks ago and I was pleasantly surprised again. Located in New Orleans in the 1930s, the entertainment is lovely and the songs are memorable. There are some errors in continuity if you look with enough attention, but generally they do not detract from the plot, which leaves you smiling (and maybe even a bit hazy, if you're an animal lover). The characters are believable (maybe even a little too big for the younger observers), too. Two legs up, and for those of you who have not seen it in a long time, it's definitely worth seeing them again.
