It is not the most successful television project that John Cleese did, "Strange Case" has the feeling of a first draft that was rushed into production before the revisions could be made. There are some silly ideas along and even some smart ones, but unfortunately the story as a whole does not add up much. <br /> <br /> However, Arthur Lowe is a hoot, like Dr. Watson, bionic bits and all. "Good sir."
