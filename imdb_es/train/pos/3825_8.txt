A young woman arrives in her husband's hometown after she died in an accident. He hardly settles in this small city, but soon after, he loses his little son in a kidnapping and in all his hopes ... This could lead to all kinds of plots in a normal movie: find a new partner and finally be happy; or depressed enough to fight and finally commit suicide ... She tries to commit suicide, but not after a series of severe fights, with God. She trusts God, only to discover that God seems to forgive everyone, even the murderer. Well, I should be careful here with God, the movie does not mean anything against God. The way the film deals with the subject is quite interesting: not from the point of view of the woman or from God's perspective (in this way, there would be a lot of grass growing, clouds flying, I suppose). Rather, it is an eye of a third party, the film lets us perceive and does not explain anything. <br /> <br /> The movie would not be so interesting if there was only one woman. There is a man who is everywhere around the woman and obviously is in love with her, but in his own way. He's a funny guy, like a clown I should say, who hangs around our heroine. The combination of these two, the woman full of tension, crying and always vomiting, and the man, smiling and talking stupidly, ends in a good balance of emotions: nothing absurdly wrong or too tedious. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
