. . .but it was on an UHF channel and the reception was very blurry. I would really like to own the movie since the reason I saw it in the first place is because I am a bus driver and the moment I saw this movie, I was driving that bus model. He was alone (during his murder trial, some 15 years later) that I vaguely remember that OJ was one of the stars in him. I only remember that he was the driver and that the bus had been shot and driven savagely. I've been looking for this movie everywhere without success, since I saw it in the mid-80s. I liked the movie, I do not usually watch thrillers, but after reading the summary in the TV guide and see its beginning (although blurred) I stayed all the time.
