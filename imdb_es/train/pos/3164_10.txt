I can not believe that we no longer have that 70's show. I have all 8 seasons of that 70's show !! I absolutely love it! I lie in bed every night and watch several episodes before going to sleep. At the end of a long busy day, it is good to relax and laugh before going to sleep. It was so sad that they took the program out of the air ... at least we still have the repetitions !! I hope and pray for you to come back with at least one meeting ... Maybe when Donna finishes college and we finally see her and Eric get married !! Would not that be incredible? It would be even better if they continued it for several years!
