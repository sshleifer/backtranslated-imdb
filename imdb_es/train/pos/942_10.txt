This is the best film version of Dicken's classic tale. I have seen it again and again on VHS, and recently I purchased the DVD version, which is formatted for TV (not for widescreen). What I find interesting about this teleplay game is the cast of English actors who are now recognizable, since many have appeared in other films / shows in North America since 1984. My biggest surprise is Edward Woodward, "the equalizer", as the Christmas Ghost present. .
