A giornata particolare is a film that has made brilliant use of closed spaces. It is in these boring and empty spaces where the audience sees the emotional turmoil and bustling outbursts of the two main characters of Ettore Scola. Marcello Mastroianni and Sophia Loren play two frustrated people. decide to join for a few brief moments of their grieving lives. It is the element of sadness associated with the narrative that makes us believe that people will take sides with the characters close to them. All men would feel sorry for the character of Sophia Loren. All the women would surely cry with all their might in the difficult existential situation of Marcello Mastroianni. Disguised sexualities are also one of the key issues in this grim and moving film. Most characters deal with issues related to their own sexualities. The giornata particolare can not be described as a pro gay movie, although it has been well described that a homosexual man mixes well with women. This is a film for which the Italian director Ettore Scola has created a pretty good combination of reality and fiction. His idea is to show how the arrival of Hitler changed the destinies of the common Italian people. A word about the brave character played magnificently by the great Marcello Mastroianni. Act like a true man who does not ask for compassion. Happily he accepts his destiny and prepares to face the worst moment of his short but significant life. A true masterpiece of cinema !!!
