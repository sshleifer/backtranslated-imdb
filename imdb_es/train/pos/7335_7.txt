With Ralph Bakshi, most of his films seem to be like two-edged swords. You will get something amazing, but only if you endure the silly and unnecessarily sad. The Lord of the Rings was a great adaptation of the story that perhaps did not always shine in the animation department. <br /> <br /> Fire and Ice is a great achievement of Bakshi from the point of view of animation. The rotoscope is much more detailed and the animation has a vibrant appearance. You still get some of the opaque cells and the slightly blurry background paintings, but overall, the look has definitely improved since Bakshi's last epic fantasy. The animation has almost a realistic-naturalistic style, and unlike LOTR, where this style was often at odds with the actual content, here it enhances the unique atmosphere of the film. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the movie has not been created. a significant story outside of its simple environment and, in fact, most of the motivations of the characters are quite blurry. Lorn and Tigra are easy cases, but even the main villain Necron was hard to follow, not to mention that guy with hairy mask (also known as "that guy"). Even though most of the voice actors were appropriate, there are some strange quirks in the audio department and Tigra sounds especially terrible when it screams. <br /> <br /> However, I believe that the inherent entertainment value of the film unnecessarily overcomes the silly execution of the plot. The poor coverage of the characters is something you will never get over, but it helps you remember that maybe this movie is not even meant to be taken seriously. It's still a great and very funny hella.
