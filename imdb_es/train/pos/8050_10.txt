The most agile of the martial arts makes him do it again. One of the first Sammo films that makes him imitate the hero of his character, Bruce Lee, Sammo is amazingly Lee in his actions and fights. The way he slips in Bruce's style and then returns to his own more familiar kung fu is a pleasure to watch and shows how skilled and adaptable his art is. Add a little slapstick humor so dear to this kind of movie and this is a movie that has it all: comedy (some unintentional, like the fake black man), action and some incredible fights scenes. <br /> <br /> A great movie about beer and friends that is worth an hour and a half of anyone's time.
