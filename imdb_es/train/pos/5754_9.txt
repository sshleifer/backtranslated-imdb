I remember seeing this when I was seven or eight years old. I must have found the round characters, because they left an impression on my mind that lasted a long time after the end of the movie. And the end, now that's sad, well ... for a child of 7-8 years. <br /> <br /> I recently had the opportunity to see this movie and discovered that the plot was too simple, the character, two-dimensional ... I think it's the kind of movie that can only be done with the innocence of a child small ... Pity ... <br /> <br /> I recommend this for all parents with small children ... (I saw it in its original French version, so I can not tell you if the translation is good or not ).
