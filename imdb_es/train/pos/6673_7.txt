Many of the user comments I've seen in the IMDB for this movie do not do it justice. First of all, let me say that this movie should not be taken seriously. It's supposed to be a funny movie, but stupid, that does not require you to think, just enjoy it. If you watch this movie with the intention of seeing a masterpiece, be it in the cinema or in the humor, then you will be very disappointed. However, if you just want to watch a silly movie with some talented actors / actresses and some interesting phrases, then you will enjoy it.
