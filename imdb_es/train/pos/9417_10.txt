An unpretentious, subtle and lean movie, "The Man in the White Suit" is another breath of fresh air in the film format of the Ealing studios. While I suspect that some modern viewers may seem dark, I doubt that many will not be seduced by the expert plot, the themes and characters are transmitted languidly during the course of the film. <br /> <br /> The authentic and great Alec Guinness gives another good characterization in a film, perhaps not as obviously virtuous as the inspired "Hearts and Crowns" of Ealing of 1949. This time, she simply plays a character in place of eight, but as the inventor and not worldly scientist Sidney Stratton, always Find the right tone and expression. Along with the expressive and subtle performance of Guinness, the rest of the cast is effective. Of the main players, Cecil Parker and Ernest Thesiger stand out. Thesiger is convincingly absurd as the big unused but influential business, while Parker is reliable as the inefficient owner and father of the mill. Father, that is, Joan Greenwood, the skilful comically delicious actress, who is at its peak insurmountable in this film. Resplendent and seductive in appearance and diction, she is quite sublime in this film, a fine contrast to the Guinness similarly unusual, but more unpleasant. The scene in which he apparently tries to tempt him is played so skillfully by the couple that it is deeply moving and fun at the same time ... <br /> <br /> The issues are handled very effectively, without an easy moral of to draw. The complexities of the relationships between science, business and the workforce are examined insightfully and pleasantly. Directed by Alexander Mackendrick, this film is technically expert in all areas; Evocative photography, the adaptation of sound effects and music and a melancholic script silently impress. A completely satisfactory film, with magnificent Guinness and Greenwood. <br /> <br /> Rating: - **** 1/2 / *****
