Streetfight (also known as Coonskin) is a unique film directed by animation pioneer Ralph Bakshi. It is a rarity of cinema, and it is worth seeing it. It's a live action mixed with animation, apparently influenced by Disney's legendary Southern Song, almost as if it were an answer to that movie. Philip Michael Thomas, who would later become Don Johnson's partner in Miami Vice, and Scatman Crothers, most famous for his role in Kubrick's The Shining, are fugitives from prison. Charles Gordone and Barry White (yes, Barry White) are friends with Thomas and plan to help him escape from prison. They are trapped in a police barricade, and Crothers tells Thomas a story about a black rabbit, a bear and a fox moving from the south to Harlem to find a more peaceful existence. The story is animated and offers many wonderful things to see. Like all Bakshi movies, most will be upset and will not like the animation. The true lovers of animation will forgive their disorder and fall in love with their inventiveness. The film is very violent, very sexual, and deals mainly with battles between races. For a long time, I thought I was watching something extremely important, but after a while, especially after I finished watching it, it started to look more like a blacksploitation movie run-of-the-mill, along the lines of Superfly. It is very careless and really does not say anything. Besides, is not Bakshi white? Whatever the answer to that, Coonskin / Streetfight is still worth watching for both animation fans and fans of cult movies. 7/10.
