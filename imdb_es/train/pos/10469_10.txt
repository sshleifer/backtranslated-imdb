I remember seeing promotions for this program before it appeared in 1993. I was 8 years old at that time, and now, at 22, it is strange to see how this cult show begins and ends and look back. All 90 years all Suddenly it seems so far away, what a great decade. Anyway I used to watch MonsterVision all the time, since I'm a huge fan of monster movies and horror movies. It was like the 90s version of Chiller Theater. If MST3K can get DVDs, why not Joe Bob's program? At least, MonsterVision was more interesting and informative. Many of Joe Bob's comments and information about the movies were very funny. Most of the films shown on the show were grade B or C, but they showed many of the A house films, as well as the Hammer films of England, which are top notch, as well as many others with the majesty of Stop Motion by Ray Harryhausen. Many were strange movies that you would not see anywhere else, such as Japanese science fiction films, besides, of course, Godzilla, which is familiar to almost everyone and independent films like Metal Storm and Motel Hell. With the new Decade of preservation of the film and more independent directors, I think that MonsterVision would be a good show for the IFC, since they already have a success with the show of the IFC Grind House. I am sure that this program will be resumed by nostalgia some day, I suppose I will have to wait and see. Until then "that's great television"!
