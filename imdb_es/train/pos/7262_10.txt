My daughter, her friends and I have seen this movie literally dozens of times. I bought it twice and some girlfriends ran away with it. Subsequently, I rented it many times. It just never goes out of style !!! Blockbuster does not even have it on their lists anymore and I've tried to buy it, find it, rent it for more than 5 years. Without a doubt, this was and is my favorite movie from my daughter's childhood ... She has everything! We laugh, we cry, we discuss real life and how difficult it is for some children in the world. There was nothing faked about this movie. We relate to every second and every Bill line! A million thanks for restoring our faith in human nature. Sincerely, Shelleen and Kailin Vandermey. Craven, Saskatchewan. CANADA, eh !!! :-) <br /> <br /> August 2007 update: <br /> <br /> Who are we to judge whether a rich woman falls in love with a poor man? or a man who has love chooses to raise a child that is not his. It may not be me or your life. Not only is it credible, but it happens every day. Thank God! Keep my faith in human nature alive! celebrate!!!!
