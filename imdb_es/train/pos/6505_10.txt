Theo Robertson has commented that WAW did not adequately cover the conditions after the First World War, which led to the rise of Hitler and World War II. <br /> <br /> Maybe you missed the first UNAS and a quarter of HOURS of volume 8? It covers this period and, together with the previous volumes of the series, clearly shows the existing conditions, I think. A friend of mine grew up in Germany during this period, joined Hitler Youth and his experiences were very similar to those mentioned in WAW. <br /> <br /> This documentary is far above the History Channel documentaries. own, that there is no comparison. <br /> <br /> The ONLY one fails, and it's small, the one I have with WAW is this: the numbers are not included, many times. For example, if you are talking about loan-leasing, how much war material was lent / leased? How much to Russia, how much to Britian? How many merchant ships did the U-Boats sink, and when? How many ships, in total, did the German or Japanese Navy have in 1941? What kind were they? How many troops? How many troops did the allies have, in total, and per country? Many numbers could have caused many viewers to fall asleep, but I would have preferred MORE! And, of course, I always want to see more military analysis. Like WHY did not Patton and Clark catch the German army that was in Cassini, after they surrounded him, instead of taking Monty to Rome and letting him escape? I do not think you can begin to understand the war until you've seen some of these video segments in "total war," like the bombing of Dresden. It's like trying to understand Auschwitz, etc., before you see the videos of the extermination camps: you just can not wrap your head around it, it's too incredible. <br /> <br /> Unknown at that time, and of course, of course, unfiltered, were the most notorious cruelties and inhumanities of the Japanese, including cannibalism, (read "Flyboys"), and some members of the prescription medical "experimentation", without anesthesia! <br /> <br /> Dave
