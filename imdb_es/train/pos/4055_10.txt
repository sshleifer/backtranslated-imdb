This movie is amazing and I would recommend it to children and adults alike. The animation is beautiful, the characters are rich and interesting, and the story is captivating; Much better than anything that American studies produced at that time. However, there are a couple of caveats to this statement. It's a pity that Disney bought the later catalog of Studio Ghibli and then proceeded to kill him. My main point is that Disney has re-rendered the film, despite the fact that the original English version is very impressive. The new cast with Van Der Beek et al. It ruined it and eliminated much of the characters' appeal, for example. Pazu and Sheeta went from being adventurers to complaining teenagers. The original music is also much better than the Disney remix. The question arises why Disney made such changes? It seems to me that by having Van Der Beek and others in the cast, then Disney can get more money, which is fair, but in the process they tainted the film. It is still a beautiful film and I would still recommend it to anyone. My main problem is that Disney ruined a childhood movie that I loved and still love. I am lucky to have an original Japanese import with the original English dub that I will now protect with my life!
