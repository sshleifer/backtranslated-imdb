IT CONTAINS SPOILERS! <br /> <br /> I saw an announcement of this in a video. Then, my sister discovered that we had the book, so I read it. I rented the video the same day I finished the book. I thought It was very memorable like the book. The cast was brilliant. Tara Fitzgerald was excellent, since Helen and Rupert Graves hated Arthur. The costumes, the music and the stages are incredibly beautiful. <br /> <br /> WARNING! DO NOT READ MORE IF YOU HAVE HAD OBSERVED THIS <br /> <br /> On the downside there are some sex scenes that have been added and some violence. That's why the video has a rating of 15. There are other things that have been included. After the first part, I felt that the accuracy was going downhill. While the book is better than this, I'm glad I saw it and would recommend it to people who have read the book, are fans of Bronte, or like costume dramas (I'm the 3!) As long as they advance through sex. scenes The book is quite underestimated. The books of Anne Brontes do not seem to be as widely read or known as Jane Erye or Wuthering Heights, who have appeared several times in television and film. Another thing. When I read the book, I was surprised at how much religion there was in it, but everything had been discarded here! <br /> <br /> 7 \ 10
