I can barely imagine a better movie than this <br /> <br /> Hey, before you all make me "Chick Flick". I'm a very big, strong and masculine Macho Man, and I think this was one of the best movies of the last 20 years. <br /> <br /> The performance was excellent and the story was wonderful. This is a wonderful medicine for the heart and soul. The performance could not have been better nor the film better cast. <br /> <br /> I've known for a while that Mercedes Ruehl, along with Holly Hunter, Joan Plowright, Dame Edith Evans, Sissy Spacek, Judi Dench is one of the best actresses that have appeared in the film. And, of course, in my opinion, Cloris Leachman (also in this film) can, in fact, overcome them all in the magnitude of his talent and the varied roles in which he has appeared over the years. In any case, this was an incredible cast. This movie was like a book that you can not leave, and when you have reached the last page, you want more ... even more. For my life, I can not understand why this movie here in the IMDb only qualifies with a 3.9. <br /> <br /> That rating here is completely amazing to me. Or maybe not. Maybe in fact I understand it very well and that is what makes me really sad. It makes me very sad that films like "American Beauty", "Leaving Las Vegas", "Sexy Beast" and "Fight Club", shoot up in popularity when, in fact, at least in this opinion, viewers should have received a " R "rating ... R which is for" garbage ". Hey, I realize there are many different stories in this world for many different audiences, but it's a sad commentary when this charming, powerful ... extraordinarily directed, acted and written film seems to have been overlooked. . <br /> <br /> Obviously he was also at the Academy Awards ... How sad. And how predictable. My summary is that if you want to see a powerful story, happy, sad and beautiful. Look ...... preferably you own this movie ...
