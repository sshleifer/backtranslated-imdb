['I do not know why the critics destroyed this movie. I almost never agree with them anyway. <br /><br /> The movie could have been a little more terrifying: I do not usually go to horror movies! I even had to prepare to see him during the day. I should not have bothered! ;) (The cinema was also full of children, hehe;) ... Liam was great as always. I also liked Catharine Zeta Jones (Theo) and Lili Taylor (Eleanor-Nell) <br /><br /> The house was very gothic and beautiful in a ghostly way. The special effects and sound were impressive. I also loved the music, especially the gentle melodies for Eleanor and her trip to save the children, how she grew out of her routine and stagnant life and finally gained her power, peace and freedom.']
