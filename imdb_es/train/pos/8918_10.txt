There is no hidden agenda. Pure Scifi. All fun <br /> <br /> I saw the original on TV and it scared me pretty bad. I was a child :) <br /> <br /> The original can be appreciated more compared to the new one that I saw and forgot. The original, starring the great movie star Steve McQueen (BULLET), is by far the best and the only version that everyone should see. <br /> <br /> The production of the film is dated, but the fx used to make Blob stand still. To the test of time. He was convinced that this thing was moving on its own. 10/10 <br /> <br /> -Zafoid
