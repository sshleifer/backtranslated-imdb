Kiera Nightly moved directly from the P & P series to this action movie ... she could hardly have chosen to remake her image more dramatically. A great success in Love Actually and as Lizie in Jane Austen's classic, is, once again, "having a chance". Just as his warrior woman dressed in a bikini at King Arthur was more skin than muscle, it's hard to imagine this delicate frame that faces the life of bounty hunters ... but this is exactly what Domino Harvey (the real one) did, and I (being one of Nightly's biggest fans) I think she takes away if not. <br /> <br /> Stuff .... <br /> <br /> * 90210 (for the non-American world) is the zip code of Beverly Hills in Los Angeles, where all the movie stars live. * The most famous film of Father Domino Harvey was Manchurian Candidate (which appears in the film). * Domino Harvey died of a drug overdose in his bathroom before the movie came out in June 2005, after being arrested for drug trafficking. She had just completed the negotiation so that part of her music would be included in the film. * Kiera Knightly alludes to the sexuality of Domino Harvey in his interview with Lucy Liu. <br /> <br /> If you find this movie a little bit exaggerated, then take a look at Domino Harvey, since the facts are more surprising than fiction.
