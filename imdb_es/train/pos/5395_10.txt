['I remember seeing this movie, thinking was very interesting. I really wanted to know what happens next. I was surprised how much they fit in a short 8 minutes. We start in a school playground. . Two friends are debating about jumping class. Child B tells child A: &quot;Do not go to class today.&quot; And Kid A declines, claiming that something really important could be lost. So child B jumps and child A goes to class. When he arrives there, the teacher informs him that today they will learn the only and most important lesson they will learn. They were going to learn the meaning of life. She gives everyone a brochure, and when she arrives at child A, she runs out and tells the boy next to her to share. Well, the child will not share, so Child A goes to find the teacher. When he finally finds her, he receives a shocking revelation about the true meaning of life. I suggest that everyone see this short film. It will only take 8 minutes of your life, but the message is so important that it could help you throughout your life.']
