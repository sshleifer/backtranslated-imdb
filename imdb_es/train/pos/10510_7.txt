This is a correct adaptation, but not as good as the TV version. The actors are generally fine, but I found Jeremy Northam quite wet as Knightley, particularly compared to Mark Strong in the TV version. Gwyneth Paltrow is fine and her English accent is pretty good, but once again, I preferred Kate's Emma Beckinsale. There are excellent supporting performances by Toni Collette, Juliet Stephenson and Sophy Thompson. <br /> <br /> The script often plays too much for laughter, the book is a comedy, but there are too many gossips here. and also the secondary plot of Frank Churchill is almost completely absent. <br /> <br /> My biggest criticism is the scenario. It is too exuberant. England has never been like that. It looks like a chocolate box. Only Americans would do it that way. <br /> <br /> Despite these criticisms, I enjoyed this movie but would recommend more the television adaptation.
