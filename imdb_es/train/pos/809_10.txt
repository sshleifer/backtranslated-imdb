A very good movie. A classic science fiction movie with humor, action and everything. This movie offers a greater number of aliens. We see the leaders of the Rebel Alliance and a large part of the imperial forces. The emperor is a somewhat original character. I liked the Ewoks that represent in some way the indigenous savages and the Vietnamese. (Excellent references) I loved the duel between Vader and Luke, who is the best in the series. In The Return of the Jedi, the epilogue of the first trilogy has ended and the Empire finally falls. I also appreciated the celebration of the victory where Vader's redemption is fulfilled and he returns to the spirit of Anakin Skywalker along with Yoda and Obi-Wan. It gives a sadness and a tear. The best Star Wars scenes are in this movie: When Vader lights the Emperor. Luke observes and finds comfort in seeing Obi-Wan, Yoda and ... his father (1997 version, not Hayden Christenssen). The next best scene is when Luke rushes to attack Darth Vader to protect Leia. There is a deep dark side to this film even though there is a good ending. I felt there was much more than meets the eye. And as always, John William's music will bring classicism to the Star Wars universe.
