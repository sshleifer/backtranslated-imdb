Probably my favorite movie of all time, a story of disinterest, sacrifice and dedication to a noble cause, but it is not preaching or boring. It just never gets old, despite having seen it about 15 times or more in the last 25 years. The performance of Paul Lukas brings tears to my eyes, and Bette Davis, in one of her very few truly sympathetic papers, is a delight. Children are, as the grandmother says, more like "dwarfs in disguise" than children, but that only makes them more fun to watch. And the slow awakening of the mother to what is happening in the world and under her own roof is credible and surprising. If I had a dozen thumbs, everyone would be "up" for this movie.
