I enjoyed this movie a lot, but it's nothing new. <br /> <br /> All of us here, we are grouping it with other war movies, this movie has been badly categorized! It's not a war movie other than "One flew over the cuckoos' nest" is an asylum movie or "Cool Hand Luke" is a prison movie. This is a film about individuality, nonconformity, self-confidence and the costs of that personality type. <br /> <br /> The plot is the same as "One flew over the cuckoos nest" and "Cool Hand Luke", its in GOOD company, and has its own. It is in these films that must be compared and compared, not with "Apocalypse Now" or "Platoon". <br /> <br /> Eric
