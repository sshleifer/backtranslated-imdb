This is what I wrote to some friends before: <br /> <br /> HOLY CRAP, The Grudge is, frankly, one of the most terrifying movies I've seen in my life. Either I am becoming very soft in my old age, or Sam Raimi and Ghost Pictures did a KICK A ** job! (I can not wait for Boogeyman!) <br /> <br /> I was very scared sitting in the dark theater and wished I had someone, someone, sitting next to me (except for the protagonist in Grudge.) I saw the movie by myself .) I swear, there were many jumping scenes that were NOT expected! I felt silly but my nerves did not care! I was on the edge of the whole movie, from the first credits, and the music was fantastically terrifying. However, I keep thinking about that sound, and I DO NOT LIKE! <br /> <br /> In fact, I gasped loudly a few times and shouted "oh" in one scene! Oh, yes, I even covered my eyes a couple of times! However, a word for the wise: I thought some of the scenes were a bit psychotic. My DH hated Event Horizon and I thought that who wrote it was sick and psychopathic, but I do not remember the movie, so I can not compare it. <br /> <br /> I can not say I "enjoyed" this movie b / c I was terrified, but it was very, very good and terrifying. The final scene, too ... wow! Being a 32 year old mom, I think I can have nightmares about this movie, especially because of that sound. Please, get out of my head;) <br /> <br /> In summary, this is not a slasher movie as I grew up with (Jason, Freddy). This is a spooky movie most of the time. Perfect for Halloween <br /> <br /> Two great trailers for this movie were Boogeyman and The Ring 2!
