In the first place, the only reason why people keep complaining about this movie is because they can not stand that some parts of the real story are "altered". Well guess what? The Peter Jackson movie was not a perfect interpretation either. Pretty good ranting. This is a very beautiful movie. The backgrounds are beautiful and taken from well-known Tolkein artists. The film covers approximately half of the trilogy (Fellowship of the Ring and until the battle of Helms Deep in the two towers) and moves at a good pace. The cast of voices is top notch and most of the characters look like I imagined they would. Samwise is a little too ugly for my taste, but Aragorn seems AWESOME. The movie has a great score that fully supports the movie. If you like good fantasy stories but hate reading (the books are even better) try this movie, considering that it was made 20 years ago. <br /> <br /> Also of particular interest: Peter Jackson's adaptation to The Fellowship follows almost exactly the same thread as that of Ralph Bakshi (Jackson has said many times how much he admired Bakshi's effort).
