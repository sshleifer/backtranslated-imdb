Rosenstrasse is more an intimate film than one of epic proportions, which could have alienated many viewers looking for an argument similar to a pianist. Fortunately, Von Trotta, a good screenwriter, opts for a feminist look to an era too enlightened in its colorful exterior, but too little analyzed in terms of intimacy and from the point of view of German Aryan, rather from the point of view Jew. Rosentrasse finds its strength in these anonymous charges of people trapped in historical circumstances from which they emerge as victims. The rhythm of the film is introspective, movingly slow, meditative. In addition, the characters are so vivid, while the transitions between generations and the passage of time have been skillfully designed. Rosenstrasse is not a masterpiece, and some narrative defects are well discerned. Another flaw lies in a trivial cinematography incapable of capturing the intensity of the internal drama experienced by the characters. However, this movie is worth seeing. Finally, Rosenstrasse is part of the latest trend in German films dealing with the ghosts of a nightmare past, a trend that includes films as excellent as Nowhere in Africa, and recently, the controversial Downfall. I would recommend this movie to those who know how to read beyond the images.
