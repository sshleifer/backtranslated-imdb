I liked these movies. It's another Yash Raj movie that you know will look good on the screen, all the characters are always good or very nice, with one exception that you know will eventually become nice ... Another rule of the Yash Raj movie is that both the hero as the heroine; they have only one or neither parent. Think of all those movies. MPK Suman did not have a mom, HMAPK Salman had no parents, and the final rule is that you have a 90% chance of seeing Alock Nath crying ... <br /> <br /> The movie is also good. It's a bit slow at first but it keeps you entertained. There's almost no comedy, but it makes you smile often enough. The little boy (nephew of the hero) is well placed and offers very good linings. The actress is very pretty, but shy, you would not get it in real life. This film does not have very large and happy families who live in BIG house, so it was a good idea and allowed the film to be differentiated from other films. There will be many women crying at the end of the movie. There is not a strong message from this movie, but it is a good watch. If you're married (arranged marriage), the movie will remind you of what happened. And if it is not, it will inform you and frighten you ... <br /> <br /> In general, it's a very good-looking movie. There are no big plots or twists, but a very soft film, very similar to the Bollywood classic.
