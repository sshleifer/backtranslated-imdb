"The gingerbread man is the first thriller I've ever made!" ?? Robert Altman <br /> <br /> In 1955, Charles Laughton directed "The Night of the Hunter", a spooky fragment of Southern Gothic in which Robert Mitchum plays a fearsome serial killer. One of the film's most famous sequences consists of two children escaping from Mitchum in a rowboat, the children row frantically while Mitchum follows them like a monster. <br /> <br /> Seven years later, Mitchum played an equally creepy assassin in "Cape Fear," another film set in the southern United States. That movie featured a local lawyer trying to protect his family and also ended up with Mitchum terrorizing people in a boat. In 1991, Martin Scorsese, trying to diversify and tackle something more conventional, remakes "Cape Fear", the scene of the boat and everything. <br /> <br /> Now we have "The Gingerbread Man" by Robert Altman, another small town portion. Southern Gothic. Altman says he consulted "The Night of the Hunter" for inspiration and approached such a conventional movie simply because he wanted to "spread his wings and try a popcorn image," but what he's trying to do here in secret is to deconstruct the movies canonical of the South Gothic genre. <br /> <br /> So instead of a confrontation in a small boat, we have a confrontation on a giant ship. Instead of kidnapping two children, we got two children returned to the police. Instead of hiding the money, we have money that is easily delivered through a last will and testament. Instead of the fair lawyer of the 1961 film and the deplorable lawyer of the new 1991 version, we get a three-dimensional lawyer at Kenneth Branagh. Instead of the monster chasing the family, the hero chases the bad guys. Instead of the monster entering the boat of the family house, we have the hero who hunts the monster aboard the monster's "house boat". Similarly, instead of a killer serial killer, we get a weird and innocent freak played by Robert Duvall. . .etc etc. etc. <br /> <br /> Altman goes on and on, inverting everything a little bit, pulling the edges and doing his thing. His touch is most evident during the first half hour of the film, which exists in an uncomfortable space between the narration of a film based on the conventional plot and Altman's fondness for overlapping dialogue, casual narrations, camera movement and the way the characters are not so much. introduced since they are simply part of what is happening. <br /> <br /> Even so, despite Altman's best intentions, the film never rises above mediocrity. Altman is too bound to the conventions of the "suspense format" to cause much damage, his style is too lethargic to generate tension and the film is simply not radical enough to counterpose other canonical films in the genre. "Gingerbread Man" is, therefore, far too conventional to operate as a purer Altman film and Altman to function as a conventional thriller. <br /> <br /> However, the movie is not a complete waste. Robert Downey Junior, Kenneth Branagh and the usually intolerable Daryl Hannah, all provide juicy performances. The film also has a pleasant atmosphere, facing an approaching hurricane, and the final act contains some interesting twists and turns. While it is not the complete disaster that was Scorsese's "fear of the cape", the film is never something special. <br /> <br /> 7/10? At the end of the 90s, Altman made 3 successive films set in the southern United States: "Kansas City", "Gingerbread Man" and "Cookie's Fortune". Unlike "Gingerbread Man," both "Kansas City" and "Cookie's Fortune" address the genre in the broader and more loose canvases that Altman felt most comfortable with. <br /> <br /> "Kansas City" is the most important of these two films, their class hierarchies, politics and crime, and their desire to radically separate themselves from the typical frames of gangster genres, would prove to be influential in all serious. Writers of the century's crime scene (see, for example, "The Wire"). That said, "Cookie Fortune", although it is a much lighter story, is perhaps the best image. <br /> <br /> Note: Altman claims that this is his first thriller, but he directed "Images", an artistic thriller. , in 1972. <br /> <br /> It's worth a visit.
