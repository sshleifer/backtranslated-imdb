The problem is that the film was based on the concept created by the 60s that comics could only be made as "camp" (ie, the Batman program of the 60s) for television and movies. So, you have combat sequences with subtitles (let's go!), A Doc Savage nonchalantly unromantic (he felt uncomfortable around the women in the pulps, not an idiot), Monk Mayfair on a sheet of night (a scene that surely it will give nightmares for several nights), and the end totally hokey with the secondary bad boy locked in gold as a Herve Villechez posing for an Oscar statute. And when they are not making Sousa march's scores, the little "funny" music reduces the drama. <br /> <br /> Even as such, this movie is ... fine. It's fun, and when it stays serious, it's a very accurate representation of the pulps. Except for Monk, as mentioned before: he is very muscular, not obese. And Long Tom, who is supposed to be a pale, scrawny boy with an attitude, not Paul Gleason with a scarf (unexplainable). <br /> <br /> The sequences of green death, for example, are remarkably horrifying and are not something I would recommend for children. But they are very close to the pulp sensation. When the writers and the producers do it well, they do it well, I'll give them that. <br /> <br /> But if the producers had done Doc with the care and scripts of, for example, the first of Reeves. Two Superman movies, think what we could have had then. I think the problem is the schizophrenic of the movie. There is a definite sense of trying to do a tribute to the 30, but they are also trying to give in to the attitude of "the heroes should be the camp" that Batman created. One has the impression that there was a first draft sober and pulpy and then someone came in and said: "Hey, let's make it fun, it worked with the Batman show 8 years ago!" <br /> <br /> But Doc lives, thanks to Earl MacRauch and Buckaroo Banzai. If MacRauch is not doing a tribute to Doc Savage in that movie, the man is really insane. So when the series really comes out on TV (supposedly mid-season in '99 -00), Doc Savage, updated at 90, will live again.
