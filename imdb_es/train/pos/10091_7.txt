I saw "Elephant Walk" for the first time in about 30 years and I was surprised at how similar the story is to the greatly superior "Rebecca". As others have said, you have the sweet, sweet girl swept off her feet by the charming, brooding lord of the mansion, only to find her marriage threatened by the inescapable memory of a relative larger than life, but deeply flawed. You have the severe and disapproving servant, a crisis that will bind the couple or separate irreparably, culminated by the burning destruction of the luxurious farm. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, "Elephant Walk" also owes something. from his creepy jungle atmosphere to "The Letter", the love triangle of Bette Davis located in a rubber plantation in Singapore instead of a tea plantation in Sri Lanka. <br /> <br /> Maltin gives "Elephant Walk" only two stars, and IMDb readers are not much nicer, but I enjoyed it despite its predictability. Elizabeth Taylor never looked more beautiful, and Peter Finch does a credible job as the basically good man, unable to get rid of the influence of his dominant father. Dana Andrews, favorite of "Laura" and "The best year of our lives", is lost as the frustrated admirer of Elizabeth. The real star is the bungalow, one of the most beautiful sets of interiors in the history of cinema.
