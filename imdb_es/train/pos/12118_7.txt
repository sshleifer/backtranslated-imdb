When I saw that this movie lasted only 80 minutes, I thought we were in trouble. The condensation of the huge novel by W. Somerset Maugham in a film that lasts less than an hour and a half seems like a disaster that is about to happen. But you know, the film is not bad, and even manages to keep much of what makes the book so resonate with its readers. <br /> <br /> I've heard many moviegoers complain that Leslie Howard was an actor's wet noodle, and he was, but I can not think of someone more suitable to play the role of Philip Carey than a wet noodle , because that is certainly what Carey is. Howard plays it well, which means you want to shake him and slap him repeatedly on the head, then finally get him out and buy him a thorn. <br /> <br /> Oh, and then there's Bette, like the girl with whom Carey is obsessed and who knocks down her world around her. I did not know what the hell had Mildred's appeal in the book, and the film remains true to that detail. But as Davis plays it, he becomes the most fascinating character in history, and if it's nasty and unpleasant, at least he's the most dynamic person on screen at any given time. Davis' performance here is credited with changing the course of acting on the screen, just as Brando would almost 20 years later when he shouted "Stella!" in that little-known Tennesee Williams game, and it's not hard to see why. Davis is intense to the point of fear. She makes no effort to express any compassion on the part of the audience, and allows herself to look ugly and very unpleasant. His appearance when Carey appears at the end of the film to find her dead or almost dead from an unnamed disease (although one does not take much care to hide the fact that it is an STD) is shocking. Of course, it helps that this film went out just before the Production Code went into effect; If it had been done a year later, you can bet that things would have been a little different. <br /> <br /> Yes, much of the novel and many of its most interesting parts are left on the floor of the cutting room. , and the story really becomes Carey and Mildred and not much else. I discovered that this is the least interesting and tedious part of Maugham's novel, but it is the part that gives the novel its title and it seems to be the part that still attracts readers now, so it seems to me a wise decision about the part of the filmmakers who chose to adapt the novel in the way they did. <br /> <br /> Grade: B +
