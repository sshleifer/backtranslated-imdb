When you come across a jewel of a movie like this, you realize why the 80s were the best decade to live. Rock music ruled, and so did movies ... especially horror movies. The filmmakers knew how to entertain us, and "Trick or treat" is evident for this. When the rocker Sammi Curr, which was probably written after W.A.S.P. Singer Blackie Lawless dies in a hotel fire, her number 1 fan, Eddie, is distressed. Go to friend and local DJ Nuke (Gene Simmons) for support. Nuke gives him a copy of the last recording Sammi made; This is the only copy available. It was delivered to the radio station to be played live on Halloween night. When Eddie plays it, he somehow brings Sammi. He helps Eddie with the bullies at school, but then he gets out of control. It is definitely a great movie. The bad thing is that this movie is sold out. I paid $ 25.00 to finally get it out of eBay. You should also ... $$ well spent!
