The story of Cinderella is one of my favorites of Charles Perrault, with Sleeping Beauty, which also became a Disney movie in 1959; This movie is a sweet and charming Disney masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The movie has a great soundtrack; that's one I like about a movie, it's a very good soundtrack and I also love songs; My favorite song is the romantic "So this is love". I also love the mice in the movie, they are cute. My favorite scene is the scene after the narration, the birds tried to wake up Cinderella in the morning; I also love it when the animal friends of Cinderella (the mice and the birds) arrange the dress of the biological mother of Cinderella, so that she can go to the ball ... until Drizella and Anastasia break it into pieces, the best ones!
