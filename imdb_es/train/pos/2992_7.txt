It seems that even the director does not like this movie, but for me, I think he's being a little hard on himself. <br /> <br /> Sure it's not perfect, but there are some atmospheric shots and the story is good enough to keep you interested in everyone. <br /> <br /> It's filmed in what seems to be a pretty nice town that also adds to the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> If you like horror movies filmed in England, try it. <br /> <br /> I just watched a trailer of the last movie in this movie, 'The Devil's Chair', which looks pretty amazing. <br /> <br /> There is not enough horror in English Movies for me, so those who come deserve our attention, and this is not as bad as you think
