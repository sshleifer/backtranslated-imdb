['The first time I saw this, I did not laugh too much. At that time, I was only about fifteen years old and I thought maybe part of the deeper humor was too mature for me to understand at that moment. I had the same reaction when I saw her a second time a few months ago, and this time it was because Felix&#39;s unsuccessful suicide attempt at the beginning of the film darkened the film a bit. This scene made some of the things Oscar said and did to Felix later in the film seem unnecessarily cruel, and his personality clashes were not as fun as they could have been. If I had not known the story, I would have been worried that some of the antics of Oscar to Felix could push him to the limit. As it was, it did not make me laugh or smile like the TV show did with Jack Klugman and Tony Randall. Still, in general, a pretty good movie and generated one of the best television comedies. 7 out of 10']
