Ah, clichés, clichés, cliches; They are a main part of a variety of horror films. This, has many of them. Still, it's Stephen King, one of the best horror masters. This movie was really good, just too predictable. And what horror movie does not have stupid people? This is crammed with delayed victims who practically ask for their lives to be taken. The pet semester seemed a bit creepy to me. The way everything is set up was REALLY creepy, but not scary. For the most part, the performance was SOME what one could believe, the suspense was not as exciting, but the level of entertainment is in an important range; My eyes were practically glued to the screen. All Stephen King fans should see this movie, but as for anyone else, expect an OKAY thriller.
