This was a pretty good movie. I'm not sure if this is considered a spoiler comment, but I did not want to risk it. Anyway, near the end of the movie, the prosecutor reads a verse from the scriptures and then quotes another from memory. I can not remember the first passage he reads, but the second one is Genesis 9: 6. He says it is Genesis 9:12, but he actually quotes verse 6. This is a common passage that many use to defend capital punishment. It is a pity that prosecutors do not dare to quote the Bible today. Has anyone ever heard of John Jay, the first Supreme Court judge in the history of this country? He said that the Bible is the best of all books. Too bad we have lost that point of view in America.
