This movie deserved better. It's very funny, it has some jokes and jokes in sight, some information for the "Geeks" among us (and we know who we are), and the effects are really effective. Seeing Paul Reubens throwing himself in the face of an Academy Award winner is worth the price of admission alone. I never read the series of comics before watching the movie, but I've seen it since then. As good as they are, I still recommend the movie to MM. (Although having the Flaming Carrot as a character would also have been great) Greg Kinnear is, well, ... amazing as the Incredible Captain, and NAD ONE ELSE could be The Shoveller, except William H. Macy. My favorite phrase in the movie? "We have a blind date with Destiny and it looks like she ordered the lobster." Watch this movie. BUY this movie! It's only $ 5 and some changes at your local Wal-Mart. You really appreciate it. Oh, and Mrs. Garafolo is in that. THAT ONLY makes it worth seeing
