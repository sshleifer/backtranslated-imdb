THE JIST: Look another thing. <br /> <br /> This movie was highly rated by Gene Siskel, but after watching it I can not understand why. The film is definitely original and different. It even has an interesting dialogue at times, some cold moments and a spooky "noir" feeling. But it's just not entertaining. Nor does it make much sense, in the plot, but especially in the motivations of the characters. I do not know anyone who behaves like these characters do. <br /> <br /> This is a difficult movie to tackle; I suggest you not accept the challenge.
