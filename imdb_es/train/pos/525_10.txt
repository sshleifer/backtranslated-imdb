Right after the end of World War II, Powell & Pressburger was asked to look for something to try to heal the gap that was developing between the United Kingdom and the United States. At that time there were many comments overpaid, about sexed and here. Somehow they came up with this masterpiece. <br /> <br /> My favorite movie of ALL times. Has it all. Romance, poetry, emotion, religion, drama and very peculiar. <br /> <br /> I can never explain exactly why, but I touched all the right buttons and although I've seen it hundreds of times (yes, really) I still have the guarantee of crying at many points. <br /> <br /> Was the magnificent performance, the wonderful scenarios, the inspired script? Who knows. But * DO * look at it and you'll see what I mean.
