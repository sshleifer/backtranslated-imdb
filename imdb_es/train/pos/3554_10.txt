Marlon Brando and Frank Sinatra hated each other while doing this film and in the following years. Barrando asked Sinatra for some singing lessons, but Sinatra (who was already upset about the fact that he was chosen as Nathan Detroit, when he wanted the role of Skye Masterson) wanted to be the star singer in the production and did not want anyone It was better than him. He told Brando to get lost, so to go back with him, Marlon kept ruining the scene in the restaurant where Sinatra was eating cheesecake so he had to keep eating, eating and eating. In recent years, Sinatra gave Brando the nickname "Mumbles" or "Mr. Mumbles" because of the way he talks.
