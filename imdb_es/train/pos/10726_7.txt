['To my surprise, I enjoyed &#39;Spacecamp&#39; a lot, I remember seeing it about 13 years ago and recently I hired it again. I was quite impressed. Obviously, special effects in today&#39;s space films such as Armageddon and Deep Impact are far superior to SpaceCamp&#39;s. However, this film had a story, a very stereotyped story of the eighties in which you could almost recite the following line of dialogue before listening to it. But that&#39;s what I liked: they do not make movies like this anymore, so it was a refreshing change. It was interesting to see Kelly Preston, Leaf Phoenix and Lea Thomson in the early roles, with Tom Skerrit and Kate Capshaw adding substance to the light &amp; fluffy plot. I loved the robot called Jinx, it was very nice, but unfortunately I had more emotion than some of the main characters. The film was almost inspiring in its own way, and it was interesting to note that it was filmed at NASA Spacecamp in Alabama (I think).']
