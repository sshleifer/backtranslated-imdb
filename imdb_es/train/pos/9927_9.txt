Domino is a great movie. It's about a young woman named Domino Harvey (Kiera Knightley) who becomes a bounty hunter because of her boredom with her lifestyle. She joins with two fellow hunters (Mickey Rourke and Edgar Ramírez) and the adventures begin. The script is good. Very realistic and realistic with the tone of the movie. The only problem I had with this movie is that it focuses on the different things they do, instead of the Domino character. <br /> <br /> Even with that, Kiera Knightley offers a fierce performance. She shows the right amount of anger and dedication in this performance. Mickey Rourke continues his performance worthy of an Oscar in 'Sin City' with another tough guy performance. Edgar Ramírez really does not do anything except speak Spanish from time to time and look at Kiera. Delroy Lindoi gives a good support performance. Mo'Nique was herself, although she surprised me in one particular scene. Lucy Liu has a great chemistry with Kiera Knightley in her scenes with her. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the film, however, is the address. Tony Scott's accelerated style really makes the movie come alive. The cinematography is one of the best I've seen. You need a regular film and it gets acid. All blacks are blacker, whites are brighter and have a kind of green glow. The action scenes are exciting. <br /> <br /> IN GENERAL: If you liked Sin City & Man on Fire, you will like Domino.
