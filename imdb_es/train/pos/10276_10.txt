Opening the film with a Bach Toccata is an auditory sign of what is going to unfold in this intense drama. All the devices of composition that Bach perfected to keep his listener (and the interpreter) intrigued and entertained apply to this film. There is no mutual tenderness between the two main characters and the protagonist in the final scene that I feel is justified in claiming that she was raped even though her victimizer feels he was warned that he was a CH. Mamet convincingly explores the emotional abyss and differences between genders, but I feel that he has no idea how they complement each other, given a healthy sense of humor. If Mamet ever developed a healthy and funny interpretation of the interaction between genders, I wonder how this work would have ended. As it exists, it is very bleak and mean.
