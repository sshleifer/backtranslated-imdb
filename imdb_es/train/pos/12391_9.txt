Minor spoilers <br /> <br /> Alison Parker (Cristina Raines) is a successful model, who lives with attorney Michael Lerman (Chris Sarandon) in her apartment. In the past, he tried to commit suicide twice: the first time, when he was a teenager and saw his father cheating on his mother with two women in his house, and then, when Michael's wife died. Since then, she left behind Christ and the Catholic Church. Alison wants to live alone in her own apartment and with the help of real estate agent Miss Logan (Ava Gardner), she finds a wonderful furnished apartment in Brooklyn Heights for a reasonable rent. She sees a strange man in the window on the top floor of the building, and Miss Logan reports that he is Father Francis Matthew Halloran (John Carradine), a blind priest who lives alone with the support of the Catholic Church. Alison moves to her new place and, once there, receives a visitor: her neighbor Charles Chazen (Burgess Meredith) welcomes her and introduces her to the new neighbors. Then, invite Alison to her cat Jezabel's birthday party at night. The next day, strange things happen with Alison in her apartment and with her health. Alison looks for Miss Logan and is informed that she lives alone with the priest in the building. A subsequent investigation shows that all the people she knew in the match were dead criminals. Frightened by the situation, Alison embraces Christ again, while Michael investigates the spooky events. Alison realizes that she is living at the door of hell. <br /> <br /> Although underestimated in the IMDb User Rating, 'The Sentinel' is one of the best horror movies in history. I've seen this movie at least six times, being the first time in the 70s, at the movies. On September 7, 2002, I bought the imported DVD and saw it again. Yesterday I saw this movie once again. Even after so many years, this movie is still great. The spooky and creepy story scares even in the current days. The cast is a constellation of stars and stars. You can see many actors and actresses, who became famous, at the beginning of the race. Fans of the horror movie certainly love 'The Sentinel', and I am one of them. My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): 'A Sentinela dos Malditos' ('The Sentinel of the Damned') <br /> <br /> Note: On September 2, 2007, He saw this movie of new.
