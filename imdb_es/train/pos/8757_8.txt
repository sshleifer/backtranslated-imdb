I like movies that do not offer the typical "happy ending", and that's the main reason why I like this movie. Alice Marano (Danish) and her best friend Darlene (Beckinsale) are arrested in Thailand for drug trafficking after receiving an anonymous report by telephone to the Thai authorities. The film does a solid job of keeping viewers guessing if (or which) of the girls were involved, and Bill Pullman is perfect as his shoddy lawyer. Jacqueline Kim becomes an excellent act as her kindest and most magnanimous wife, Yon, who is also a lawyer. I wish the girls were subjected to further abuse in prison, as another commentator has suggested, as I have heard that the prisons in Thailand can be quite brutal. Where this film catches me, however, is its end. Alice submits to a sentence of 96 years in total so that Darlene can be forgiven, and we (the viewers) realize that both are innocent. Any movie that challenges my expectation of the end wins extra points with me, and this well-acted drama is certainly worthy.
