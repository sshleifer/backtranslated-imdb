If you enjoy the subtle actions and reactions (yes, I said subtle) of John Candy, you can not stop liking this movie (pronounced "fillum" by Salvatore DiPasquale). The non-observer (and uninformed) observer always saw Candy as a broad actor, a great buffoon. And sometimes it was (see "Rayas" and "Splash"). But, when given the opportunity, it could be really sharp and quite subtle. It is a pity that they have done so many papers that only showed their broad side, because we will never see more of the others. Oh, yes, the movie. One can see "Going Berserk" again and again (I know I have) with the frequency of "Caddyshack". It's that good. The plot, although a bit complicated, is actually quite deep for a farce of this kind. Allow Candy and always undervalued Joe Flaherty and Eugene Levy to bounce on Candy ... and bounce HARD. It is definitely worth checking out anyone who has enjoyed SCTV or the other work of Candy.
