(You'll know what I mean after you've seen Red Eye ...) <br /> <br /> In general, Red Eye was a better thriller than expected. It has a slow start, and it builds slowly. But when it's over, it's a blow! <br /> <br /> It's hard to define exactly what makes this thriller so ... exciting as I found it. Except that, in a few words, the director did a job worthy of credit by taking him into action of what would otherwise have been an execution plan. I'd rather forget that I was watching a movie. That says a lot. <br /> <br /> Other factors, I believe, are the "closeness" of victim and evil ... and that over time, you begin to really relate to the victim. A scanty 8 out of 10, more like a 7.5 ... but that's pretty good!
