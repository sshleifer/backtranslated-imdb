Shintar√¥ Katsu, who played the blind swordsman "Zatoichi" in a total of 27 films, ends the Hanzo trilogy with this excellent film in which he makes love with a ghost, Mako Midori (Blind Beast). <br /> <br /> The big stick, which is often used in the pursuit of justice, is removed forever. <br /> <br /> Katsu was his usual impudent self as he pursued those who would steal the treasury to lend to usurers amounts he could not pay. <br /> <br /> The usual game of swords and the amazing ability of the big man was present, along with the blood. <br /> <br /> I'm going to miss him.
