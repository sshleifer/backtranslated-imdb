It is interesting to see that Brosnan's performance is much more realistic than that of the original James Bond novels compared to the Bond films. He is neurotic, paranoid, alcoholic and womanizing. This is a perfect break for him, even to make fun of the link icon. "I am a disaster, a parody of myself," he says. There is nothing better than that. I just finished reading Dr. No, and that's how Ian Fleming had played James Bond. Personally, I never liked Brosnan as Bond because it fitted the icon too much. There was nothing to customize the character, compared to Roger Moore or Sean Connery. It's great to see Brosnan play a character based on reality and extravagantly off the wall. A shallow character who tries to come to an understanding of deeper emotional and psychological problems in which he has no background. It is an impressive portrait, and having Greg Kinear to grind it, is poetic. This film reminds me a bit of the dynamics established between the main characters in "My Blue Sky", but more genuine in their coping mechanisms.
