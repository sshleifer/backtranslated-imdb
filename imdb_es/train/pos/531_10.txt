This movie has the most beautiful opening sequence ever made. I have seen this film for the first time a week ago, since then every day I watch the opening and every time I feel so excited as the first time I heard David Niven pronounce the immortal words of Sir Walter Raleigh's Pilgrimage: <br / > <br /> Give me my limestone shell, My walking stick of faith, My script of joy, my immortal diet, My bottle of salvation, My dress of glory, the true indicator of hope; And so I stay with my pilgrimage (??) <br /> <br /> Do you know why it would be foolish to say that the lives of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressuburger are completely justified for having created such a wonderful opening? Because they had already been admitted to the Paradise of the Poets long before they made this film. <br /> <br /> I imagine the two of them facing a trial on the Day of Judgment and saying indifferently to an angry God: I ask your forgiveness, sir. So, you want to know what we have done during our life? Well, you'll see: we've written directed and produced: I know where I'm going, Colonel Blimp, red shoes? Do you think enough sir? It is quite obvious that these two great artists had already fulfilled their duty to God, Nature, the Muse or whatever they call it when they shot A matter of life and death. The fact that other people's lives would be justified by their actions might not be obvious to everyone, even though I feel that my life would have a meaning if I had never done anything else to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Of course Veterans will be tempted to say: they do not make films like this anymore. They will be partially wrong; neither did films like this in recent times. <br /> <br /> I have already quoted Keats here, but I will repeat his words: A thing of beauty is a joy forever.
