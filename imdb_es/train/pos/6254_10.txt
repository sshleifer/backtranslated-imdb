I just watched this film at the Toronto International Film Festival 2001. The job title there was 'Dog Days'. The reaction of the audience was mixed. Some people felt that graphic sex and realistic violence were too much for them. Others seemed to genuinely appreciate how good this movie was. <br /> <br /> This movie is not for the faint of heart. It's like 'Happiness' with explicit sex and a less optimistic view of humanity. There is poisoning with animals, a strip-tease of an old man, an orgy bathhouse in a shopping mall, anal penetration of the candle and sexual abuse of the mentally incompetent. <br /> <br /> If some of this sounds like this too much to handle then this movie is not for you. This film shows humanity in its most desperate and pathetic form. The banality of our existence is pushed into our face with the greatest joy. <br /> <br /> Seidl has no interest in redeeming humanity here. And why should I do it? This film presents excellent performances by all involved, it is always interesting and is probably the most intelligent social statement that will be made in a movie at one time.
