I was adopted at birth and I certainly did not have the problems that Antwone fisher had in the movie, but I still share some of the emotions and this movie really helped to get them out and forced me to deal with them. It even made me realize that I have a "missing piece" and now I'm going to look for my biological parents. <br /> <br /> I cried almost a day after seeing this for the first time. Antwone's confrontation with his biological mother juxtaposed to the reaction of his father's family to his sudden appearance is powerful for those of us who do not know what will happen if we find our biological parents. And his self-confidence and his own affirmations for his mother and the abusers of his past were so powerful. I could really identify with this and my need to tell people "yes, my parents left me aside when I was born, BUT another group of parents picked me up and loved me, and now I am a success!" <Br /> <br /> It also helped my wife to understand me and our adopted children, who went through tragic experiences before arriving at our home. And it helped me realize how messy our social system is. If you remember reading last year's story about the foster child in Florida who was "lost" And then the story of "Miranda and Ashley" in Oregon City, where SCF ignored the sexual abuse complaints about the man who finally He killed And the week in this movie was released, another story in New Jersey of three children who were ignored by the system. One died Apparently, the state thought that the house they were in was fine because the tutor was employed (as a stripper) and "only once in a while" used heroin. <br /> <br /> In this film only many subjects are mentioned. - and are treated so well by the script and by the performance that Antwone Fisher should undoubtedly be a candidate for "Best Film". It does not matter if you are adopted or not, it is a tear that can not be ignored by anyone concerned about children in our society.
