The design of the film seems to be the alpha and omega of some of the main problems in this country (USA). We see relationships everywhere in the university setting for the movie. Appropriately, the obvious of student v. the teacher is present But what the film adds to its value are its other relationships: vs. male. female, white v. black, and the individual v. society. But most important of all and in direct relation with all other relationships is the vs.. individual. the same. <br /> <br /> I was surprised by the bilateral point of view the director gave to show race relations on campus. Most films tend to show injustices on one side while showing the other's suffering. This film showed the injustices and sufferings of both sides. I also did not try to show how it was good, although I would say that the skin chiefs were shown much more cruel and vindictive (quite obvious towards the end). The movie also talks about sex and rape. Ironically, it is this injustice that somehow unites the two races, for a time. Lawrence Fishburne makes an exaggerated performance as the clever Professor Phipps. He crumbles the idea of ​​the favourism of the race and, instead, shows the parallelism of the lazy and trite with the laborious and positive. Other stars that make this film are Omar Epps, Ice Cube and Jennifer Connelly. Michael Rapaport offers an excellent portrait of a young man confused with an out-of-place anger that seeks acceptance. Tyra Banks makes her film debut and proves that supermodels can act. <br /> <br /> Higher Learning gets its name for showing the university something more than going to class and getting a role. In fact, I would say that the film is almost a satire to show the interactions of the students, instead of a dry book, like the real education in a university. It is a process of learning about life, not textual. I think you will find that "Higher Learning" is appropriate for important topics in many universities and even in life in general. 8/10
