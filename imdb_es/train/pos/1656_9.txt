"Thieves and liars" presents a very naturalistic description of the levels of corruption that affect many Puerto Ricans and forces them to make difficult, if not impossible, decisions about their lives and those of their loved ones. The cast is excellent, considering that some are non-professional actors; An excellent option that increases the level of reality in the film. Photography impels history without intrusions, as it should be in this type of film. The script captures the idiosyncrasies and attitudes of the "Boricuas" in a very profound way. Sometimes it feels like you're watching a documentary! When you watch this movie, you feel as if you have entered secretly into the true Puerto Rican society and you see how it implodes. I loved!
