"Kaabee" describes the difficulties of a woman before and during World War II, raising her children alone after her husband was imprisoned for "thought crime". This movie was directed by Yamada Youji, and as expected, the atmosphere of this movie is really wonderful. Although the historical correction of some scenes, especially the beach scene, is suspect. <br /> <br /> The acting in this movie is absolutely incredible. I am amazed at how they managed to reunite this star cast for a 2008 film. Yoshinaga Sayuri, possibly the most decorated Japanese actress, will undoubtedly win more individual awards for her performance in this film. Shoufukutei Tsurube in a supporting role was also very good. However, it was Asano Tadanobu, who offered the most impressive performance, portraying perfectly his character and the difficult situation in which he was. <br /> <br /> The movies with prewar atmosphere are not my thing, but thanks to Wonderful direction and acting, the story absorbed me totally. In addition, it was not a far-left nonsense such as "Yuunagi no Machi, Sakura no Kuni", and examines the controversial and sensitive issue of government oppression and brainwashing that occurred in that period in Japan. Excellent movie, highly recommended for all the spectators.
