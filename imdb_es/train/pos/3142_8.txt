In what is a truly diverse cast, this show comes at its own pace on FOX. It's the kind of comedy that grows in you. If you only see 1 program, you may not like it very much, but once you see two or three, you get hooked. <br /> <br /> This is because some of the jokes are successful and others are missing depending on how you see them. . As usual today, the themes are very mature. Humor is usually very mature too. Often, the most fun parts are those in which mature themes collide with the innocent. <br /> <br /> Red (Kurtwood Smith) a veteran actor makes a very good kind of humor in this program. Debra Jo Rupp also plays well in this cast. Danny Masterson, the oldest actor of the "children" is also very good. Laura Prepon (Donna) looks better in previous shows as a natural redhead (who had the idea of ​​making her blonde?). She shows very good talent and comedy time often. It looks good without makeup too. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best FOX entries in the comedy department and is the most successful live from Married With Children
