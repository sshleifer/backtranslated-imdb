Greetings again from the darkness. Insight into the mind and motivation of a wonderful artist. How strange for most of us to see someone who MUST work ... regardless of the conditions, otherwise, their reason for life ceases. See the Goldsworthy sculptures come alive and see their reaction to each one is extremely voyeuristic. This artist creates because he must - not for money or fame. It is your life force. When you see its faults, the energy seems to be expelled from your body like a hot air balloon bursting. It is not the fear of starting over again, it is that it takes your energy from your work. See him create just to have the takeover of nature and remember that his work is something painful, but nonetheless, impressive. Discuss the flow and time in the minimal dialogue and there seems to be little doubt that the artist and the earth are the same. When he says he needs the land, but he does not need it ... I allow myself to disagree. The only complaint is that the musical score seems to slow down even more a rhythm that, in the best of cases, is relaxing.
