This is absolutely one of the best movies I've seen in my life. It takes me on a roller coaster of emotions. I laugh and cry and I get angry, I feel happy and in love! All this in just over two hours of time! <br /> <br /> The actors are all brilliant! I have to mention the main actor, of course, Michael Nyquist. He does a remarkable job !! I also admire the actor who plays Tore, who plays this young man mentally challenged in such a convincing way! It reminded me of the roll of Leonardo di Caprios in Gilbert Grape! And then there's the most beautiful song in the world: Gabriella's. <br /> <br /> I recommend it for everyone to see and enjoy!
