['The first time I saw this movie when I was a teenager. It was at a time when heavy metal ruled the world. Trick Or Treat has all the elements for a cool movie. With a cast featuring Skippy of Family Ties, Gene Simmons of Kiss and Ozzy Osbourne as preacher, how can you be wrong? Back evil messages played on vinyl! Yes, that&#39;s right, use records in this movie. In one scene, Eddie (Skippy) hears a message from the evil rockstar on his record player when things start to get scary. The monsters start coming out through their speakers and their stereo becomes possessed. When I was a teenager I tried to play my records backwards hoping that would happen to mine. Almost 20 years later, Trick Or Treat is still one of my favorite movies of all time.']
