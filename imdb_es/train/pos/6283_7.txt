['As much as I like the great epic images, I&#39;ll spare you the name of a stop, it&#39;s great to be able to relax with a few beers and a simple action movie at times. Films where the plot takes a back seat to the ensemble pieces. Movies where the dialogue is not written so intelligently that it is linked with endless knots of purple prose. There are hundreds of movies that fit perfectly ... but in my opinion, Gone In Sixty Seconds is one of the best. <br /><br /> It is an update of the movie that shares its name. He also shares the spirit of that image, but it is not his execution. Everything that was great about the original has been simplified. Everything that was simplified was also amplified thanks to a larger budget. Often, these kinds of efforts are recipes for the complete disaster; see the ugly remake of The Italian Job for one that spoiled it, but here, thanks to a cast of mostly excellent actors, Sixty succeeds. <br /><br /> The plot and much of the dialogue is not much to write IMDb. Often, there will be scenes in which the same line of dialogue comes and goes between the actors, each of whom will express it with different inflections. Many people found this annoying; I think it raises a smile. Each actor has the opportunity to show their definition of style here, with Cage, Jolie and Duvall at the head of the group, of course (and it should be noted that it is also fun to see that Ms. Pitt does not have the first bill here). The chemistry between the good old San Nick the unconditional (see revision date) and Angelina leads to a couple of good times. <br /><br /> The villain is not even a little scared: I&#39;ve seen Chris Eccleston play tough guy roles before, so I know he can handle them, but I think it was deliberately aimed at making his role inconsequential so as not to distract him from the action. We know that heroes are going to succeed, in some way; We&#39;re just sitting in the car with them, enjoying the ride. I think many of these scenes were interpreted with a language so brazen that it missed the head of many people who gave it a bad grade. In fact, I would not have minded winking at the camera on the fourth wall: it&#39;s just that kind of movie. <br /><br /> All this style and not so much substance, something that often exhausts my patience if it is not executed * alone * therefore, it would be useless if the action were not there. And for the most part, it is. Marvelously so I have noticed that there seems to be a common tendency to use fast-cutting close-up shots for direct action these days. Personally I find this kind of exhausting things. I prefer movies like this one, in which the stunts are impressive enough so that I do not need an artificial tension boost through the violation of tight shots all the time. I have been told that Cage actually did all the car maneuvers he could, without losing his insurance (in real life, I mean, his character does not care) and it shows. The man can really move a vehicle and is put to good use in the slow burning end climate where he drives a Mustang to the ground in the most extravagant and FUN way possible. <br /><br /> So yes, this movie is not an &quot;epic, affirmative effort of life after 9/11 with obligatory social commentary&quot;. The rhythm is irregular, some of the scenes could have been cut and not all the actors tow the line. But car movies are rarely better than this. So if you hate cars ... Why are you reading these comments ?! <br /><br /> I would take care of the numerous iterations of &quot;The Flaccid And The Tedious&quot; (guess the franchise) any day. 7/10']
