This is not among Jimmy Stewart's best movies, I admit it quickly. However, although some see his film as pure propaganda, I wonder what's wrong with that. Yes, of course, as in the TV show THE FBI, this is an obvious case in which the Office is doing public relations work to try to get support. But, as the entertainment says, it does a good job. Also, surprisingly, by the time it was made, the film focuses more on crime than on espionage and "Commies." Instead, it is a fiction of one of the first agents and the career he chose. Now, considering that Jimmy Stewart plays the agent, it's pretty sure that the acting and writing were good, since it was a movie with a real budget and a studio that was not willing to waste the star in a third film category. So in general, it's worth seeing, but not especially good
