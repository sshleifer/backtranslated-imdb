This is one of my favorite kung fu movies and is considered one of the most popular Shaw Sisters since the late 70s. The plot is interesting and twisted, the characters are great each with their own style: toad, snake, lizard, etc. The action is limited compared to other Chang Cheh / Venoms movies, but what is interesting is different Kung Fu styles in Visualization of the different characters. I recommend this movie to those who think that all the Shaw Brothers films, especially those of Chang Cheh, are the same, most of their films generally focus on the 10 tigers and the conflicts between Shaolin and Manchu. This movie is a breath of fresh air in comparison.
