Now I've always been a fan of the Full Moon puppet work. But I have to say that Robot Jox is one of the best projects. If you listened to me, the story works wonders, the atmosphere really works and the actors do a first class job. Gary Graham, who really makes his mark on TV shows like ALIEN NATION THE SERIES and STAR TREK ENTERPRISE, proves that he can be an action star that kicks ass and takes his name. The effects of stopping the movement could have been a little better. The color was wrong, they look like plastic instead of the metal they were supposed to be. But that is a minor complaint compared to the set that is Robot Jox, if you like Gary Graham or other Full Moon movies, then you will like this movie. 9 STARS OF 10.
