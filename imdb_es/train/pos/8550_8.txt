Now I love American Pie 1 and 2, while 3 was great just for Seann William Scott's performance as Stifler, but then the quality has diminished. Band Camp kept the standard reasonably high with the characters that really mattered to you, but Naked Mile was the same joke and recycled storylines (Erik Stifler's sexual problem is like Jim's). He had some fun moments like the soccer game against the dwarves and the 'punishment' of Coozeman, but in general it lacked originality and the 'Mile' was stupid and stupid. Not to mention the irritating girlfriend who does not want to have sex. <br /> <br /> Anyway, enough with the Naked Mile I saw Beta House with apprehension, since I thought I could take the series to a new low, but I was pleasantly surprised. To be honest, there is no real argument, but it is full of hot girls (Ashley is amazing) and sexual jokes galore. Yes, it's a formula and the jokes are old, but Dwight Stifler (Steve Talley) raises the bar with exuberant performance. The Greek Olympiad is entertaining, especially in the penultimate final events, while Christopher McDonald's cameo is hilarious. However, there are weaknesses. Coozeman is as irritating as he was in the first, I'm still baffled by the way he ever got a part. <br /> <br /> While Coozeman is bad, Erik Stifler is worse. John White made the Naked Mile a bit difficult to see, but at Beta House he takes his performance to a new low. First, it lacks charisma, a prerequisite of Stifler. You really can not worry less about him. The only reason I was bothered by their relationship was that Ashley could be on the screen! She shines on him just like the rest of the cast. Seriously, John White is the latest in bad acting and has as much charisma as a dead fish. <br /> <br /> To say that the film entertains and Coozeman's fear that his girl is not exactly a girl is extremely funny. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie is worth renting, gather some of your classmates and laugh at the vomit-fest event and vent your anger towards Erik 'the loser' Stifler.
