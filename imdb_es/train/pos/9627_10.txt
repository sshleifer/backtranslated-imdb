This is by far the funniest short of the two comic geniuses. From the moment they enter, until Hardy simply falls off the ceiling, this keeps me laughing hysterically. I strongly recommend that all Laurel and Hardy fans watch this short film. I also recommend all the ghost series. If you are looking for laughter, watch this movie and you will be happy.
