['After an anonymous phone call about a spacecraft that would have crashed in a frozen forest, two policemen found evidence that the event had actually occurred and apparently a Martian had left the place. They drive to the nearby Hi-Way Caf√© and find a bus stopped and seven passengers waiting for the reopening of a snowy bridge. However, the driver says he only had six passengers when he parked the bus. When questioning travelers, strange things happen in the restaurant, with the lights on and off and the turntable on and off. When the passengers are released and the bus continues its journey, a passenger returns to the diner and reveals a plot of invasion of the Earth. <br /><br /> &quot;Will the real Martian get up, please?&quot; It is one of the best episodes of this great series. The intriguing story has ironic and witty dialogues, funny characters and situations and a surprising and totally unexpected plot point at the end. My vote is eight. <br /><br /> Title (Brazil): &quot;O Marciano&quot; (&quot;The Martian&quot;)']
