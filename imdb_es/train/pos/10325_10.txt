I was raised in Doc Savage and I felt petrified by green death as a child, but even as now, I found it completely entertaining. I have made countless friends and colleagues watch this movie and I have enjoyed the diversity of reactions. , granted that in their majority they think that I am strange but there you are. "I do not know what Doc is about, but he's always done with girls" has to be the last line when you look at his sad band of men. This movie is a classic parody in the whole genre of superheroes, and it was long before the time came, it should not be taken seriously, move on the Austin Powers. Ron Ely is a God. It is unfortunate that this film has not been released on DVD in the United Kingdom. I do not think that it should be remade and bastardized, as I said it is a classic, it can not be done without Ron (like Italian work without Mini and Michael Caine). I give it 10/10.
