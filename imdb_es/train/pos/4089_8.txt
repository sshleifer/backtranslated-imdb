Surprisingly erotic outbreak of gothic horror that will be loved by fans of Hammer House of Horror around the world. It seems to be an interesting version of "Beauty and the Beast". It is definitely worth taking a look and surprisingly well acted when you consider the genre and the era. <br /> <br /> Corsets, castles, horses in heat, furtive monsters of synthetic fur in the forest, proof that nobody had a Brazilian in the 70s, and with more bodily fluids that you can shake, What more could you want ?! <br /> <br /> It certainly illuminated my Sunday afternoon!
