I enjoyed Still Crazy more than any movie I've seen in years. A successful band from the 70s decides to give it another chance. They start playing some concerts in sordid places in Europe, with hilarious results. The music is fantastic, the script and the acting are great. The characters are successful, especially the lead singer with the high voice of heavy metal, makeup and personality problems. The concert at the end was unreal. Go see it, preferably in a cinema with a good sound system :)
