His choice of films, the basic concept of production (which places him in the sets or simulations of the films he comments on) and his delivery are brilliant. But if you want Freud, keep in mind that you are getting Lacan's version of Zizek, which should not be confused with Lacan himself. As usual, Zizek delivers complex ideas with gusto and convincingly. The problem is that it is also quite mercurial, so there may be more in your taste than in the actual content. Cinematically, it is a gem. Psychologically, this will make people of all tendencies (Freudians, Lacanians and Jungians) scratch their heads but, at the same time, look for popcorn. Zizek is a phenomenon and an icon of pop in itself.
