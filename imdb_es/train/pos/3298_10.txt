This is definitely one of the best movies I've seen in my life: it has everything: a genuinely moving script, excellent actors that make subtlety a beautiful art to see, a really elegant romance (it's a pity that that kind of romance is it just seems that it does not exist anymore), beautiful songs and lyrics (especially the final song), an artistic score and costumes and ensembles that make you want to live in them. The ending was just a disappointment because I expected a spectacular movie to have a brilliant ending, but it was even more wonderful than the vast majority of the films. Definitely take a look at this movie, again and again. There are many details that you miss the first time they deserve a second look.
