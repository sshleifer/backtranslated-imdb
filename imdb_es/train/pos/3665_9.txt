They did it. And, boy, did they do it fantastically or what? The BBC finally brought the Doctor back to our screens on a Saturday night where it belongs! And they did it with style! <br /> <br /> EPISODE ONE: "Rose": one of the strengths of the new series is Russel T Davies as a writer and executive producer. He is a fan of the program and knows what other fans want, but he is also an experienced writer in his own right, so he knows what others want. Another strength, as shown perfectly here in this first episode, is Billie Piper and her character Rose Tyler. Finally, the Doctor's partner gets a credible story and a strong character. It's also nice to see the return of the Autons, a nice nod to the Classic Series there. <br /> <br /> EPISODE TWO: "The end of the world": at the beginning of this double bill to show the TARDIS 'strengths, we end up in a story where special effects are everything! Now they have the technology to create real and credible environments and monsters, no more rubber suits! Also the signs at the end of this episode about the past of the new Doctor, very interesting to kill all the Lords of Time and make him the only one. <br /> <br /> EPISODE THREE: "The Unquiet Dead" - We have had the future, now we are going to have the past. The first written episode that is not from Davies is a bit flat in some places, but this is offset by Charles Dickens from Simon Callow and the sudden twist in the plot when it is revealed that the unfortunate Gelf is not so unfortunate after all ... . <br /> <br /> EPISODE FOUR: "Aliens Of London": the consequences of the Doctor's actions are explored in depth in this series, among other things, with the repercussions of Rose running with him. In addition, we have our first cliffhanger; He is not the best admitted. The Slitheen are an interesting villain, although they may seem too CGI for their own good. <br /> <br /> EPISODE FIVE: "Third World War" - The second part of this story about the Slitheen suffers mainly from the same problems as the former. In addition, the clips of the next episode that appears at the end of the current episode are annoying and spoil it for people. <br /> <br /> SIX EPISODE: "Dalek": Yes! We have had the future, the past and the present (ish), but now we come to the good: the return of the archenemy of the Doctor. Here I think we can complement Christopher Ecclestone: he was brilliant as the Doctor, and no more so than in this episode, where we see the pain on his face when he remembers the War of Time and the strange nature of it when it almost becomes The Self Dalek <br /> <br /> EPISODE SEVEN: "The Long Game": in reality, it is only a story that acts as a prologue for the end of the series. Saved by Simon Pegg as the Smarmy Editor and Tamsin Grieg in a funny cameo. The media control us: that has not been done before, it has ... <br /> <br /> EPISODE EIGHT: "Father's Day": this is a great episode. Full of human emotions and pain for Rose, and the true consequences of what happens when you really ruin the story. An outstanding for Billie Piper here. <br /> <br /> EPISODE NINE: "The empty child" - I do not find this child very frightening. I'm sorry, but I do not. However, it's a good episode, but the cliffhanger could still have been better, it's the "Next Time" bits that spoil them. John Barrowman introduces himself here as Captain Jack, the handsome swindler. He is a good actor who has been present for a while, but now he seems to have noticed. <br /> <br /> EPISODE TEN: "The Doctor Dances" - Part Two of this WW2 Story - very well done in terms of historical context. A good optimistic ending, although a bit confusing perhaps for the younger viewers when the "Mummy" is revealed? <br /> <br /> EPISODE ELEVEN: "Boom Town" - probably the weakest in the series, but that does not mean it's bad. A good return for the Slitheen and also an interesting study of the character of Doctor and Rose. <br /> <br /> EPISODE TWELVE: "Bad Wolf" - this starts pretty silly, with a bit of good humor and a bit of cheeky fun in popular TV shows about her in Blighty. However, things become extremely serious quickly, and the revelation at the end is the best suspense of the series! <br /> <br /> EPISODE THROUGH: "Parting Of The Ways" - Goodbye Christopher Ecclestone. A fantastic doctor in many ways, David Tennant has to try hard to be as good as he is. The regeneration scene at the end is played wonderfully. Oh, and the Daleks are back - in the end! God bless CGI, because you could never accomplish this normally! <br /> <br /> In general - brilliant! 9/10
