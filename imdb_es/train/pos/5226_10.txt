What about all the European comments (especially England) here? All I have to say is that when I saw this movie for the first time when I was 13, I thought it was great. Of course he is stupid. That is the point. You have to see the movie Dr. Strangelove and Men in Black to get all the joke behind this movie, but come on, people, what did you expect to see? I can think of many movies that are much worse than this, and they were expensive Hollwood movies with real actors. For what it's worth, Men in White is a very stupid and funny movie simulation. And with all the stupid and funny things that England has been doing for the last half century, I am surprised by all the negative comments. We stupid Americans like our stupid humor P.S., see 'Team America: World Police' to see some real laughs that Europeans will especially like - HA!
