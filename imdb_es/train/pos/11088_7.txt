The villain in this movie is a sob and seems to enjoy what he is doing, that's what I think makes him so bad. I do not think most men like this movie, especially if they ever cheated on their wife. This is one of those movies that stays pretty hard until the end. But then, there you have it, a candy bar ending that makes me look back and say: "HOKIE AS HELL". A pretty good movie until the end. The end is the end that we would like to see, but not the end for such a bad start. And then there are the consequences of what happened. I guess you can decide on the true ending. I'm left with the feeling that only one character should have survived at the end.
