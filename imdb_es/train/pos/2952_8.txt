Judy Davis shows us why she is one of Australia's most beloved and respected actresses: her portrayal of a lonely nomad without direction is first class. Claudia Karvan, a teenager, also gives us an idea of ​​what would make her one of the most popular actors in this country in the coming years, with future roles in THE BIG STEAL, THE HEARTBREAK KID, DATING THE ENEMY, RISK and the acclaimed television series THE SECRET LA VIDA DE NOSOTROS. (By the way, Karvan, as a child, was a child who was robbed of Panda's toy outside the drugstore in the 1983 drama DOWN WITH Tracey Mann.) If this movie is presented to you, be sure to watch it! Score: 79/100. See also: HOTEL SORRENTO, RADIANZA, VACANT POSSESSION, LANTANA.
