Sad story of a downed pilot B-17. Brady is shot down over occupied territory. Local ranchers provided kindness and protection at the expense of their own lives. I had never heard of this movie and it hooked me for two hours. After the movie, I'm glad I took the time. It is a complete story that explains the look on Brady's face at the beginning of the film.
