Conrad Hall came out with a bang. The great film photographer finished his illustrious career with this film before transmitting it. He himself was proud because this is one of the best looking crime movies you've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Of course, acting is not bad when you have Tom Hanks and Paul Newman as protagonists. The amount of action here is also correct: not too much; not so little. <br /> <br /> None of the characters here, frankly, are "good guys", since Hanks is a professional hitman for the city's boss Newman. The only redeeming quality of Hanks is not wanting his little son to end up with a murderer like him, but he does teach him how to be the one escaped from the robberies! Hey? <br /> <br /> As good as the acting is and as interesting as the story is, the true star of this film is the director of photography Hall, who paints scene after scene with his lens. Your work is simply amazing.
