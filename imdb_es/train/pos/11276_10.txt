It may be hard to believe, but this film was denounced as immoral by more pulpits than any other film produced before the imposition of the Hayes Code. Yes, the priests told their flocks that anyone who went to see this movie was committing a mortal sin. <br /> <br /> I'm not inventing this. They had several reasons, as follows: <br /> <br /> Article: Jane likes sex. It shows her and Tarzan waking up one morning in his shelter in the treetops. He stretches sensually, and with a flirtatious look says "Tarzan, you've been a bad boy!" So they have not only been having sex, they have also been having sex! A few years later, according to the Hays Code, it was assumed that people (especially women) should not be represented as people enjoying sex. <br /> <br /> Article: Jane prefers an innocent person, although wise and inventive, savage (Tarzan) to a civilized and respectable man of nine to five (Holt). When Holt at first impresses her with a nice London dress, she hesitates a little; when Holt tries to kill Tarzan, and both Holt and Jane think he is dead, she hesitates a lot. But when he realizes that his man is very alive, the attractions of civilization vanish for her. And why not? Tarzan's relationship with Jane is egalitarian: he lacks the "civilized" insecurity that would force him to assert himself as "the boss of his wife." To boot, it lacks many more "civilized" complexes, for example, jealousy. When Holt and his friend arrive, Tarzan greets them cordially, knowing full well that Holt is Jane's old flame. When Holt arranges it with a London dress and dances slowly with it towards a portable phonograph, Tarzan falls from a tree and takes out his knife. Jealous? No He's just cautious with the strange music machine, since he has never seen one. Once it's explained, it's great. <br /> <br /> Article: Civilized Holt has a dirty mind. The wild Tarzan is innocently sexy. When Jane slips into Holt's illuminated tent, Holt becomes aware of her silhouette as she puts on the fancy dress. On the contrary, after Tarzan playfully takes off her dress, throws it into the hole of the pool and dives after it, follows the nude scene with more erotic taste throughout the cinema: the couple spends five minutes in a lovely aquatic ballet. filmed in three versions (dressed, topless and nude) the scene was cut before the premiere of the film, but the nude version is restored in the video now available. And when Jane emerges and Cheetah, the chimpanzee, steals her dress just for A joke, Jane makes it clear that her irritation is only because of the proximity of "civilized" men and their complexes. Where is the "universal caution" so dear to the hearts of seminarians? Nowhere, that's where. Another reason why the hangers considered this film as sinful. <br /> <br /> Article: The notion that man is the crown of creation, and that animals are here only for the use and comfort of man, receives a heavy beating. Holt and his friend want to be guided to the "elephant cemetery" so that they can pick up the ivory and take it home. They want Tarzan to lead them to that cemetery. You, reader, are thinking about "Great opportunity!" and you're right He's in shock He exclaims "The elephants are asleep!" What explains everything to him. Jane explains Tarzan's feelings, which the two "gentlemen" find ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Article: Jane, the former civilized woman, is much more ingenious than the two civilized men she accompanies. Holt and his friend ruin it, and are besieged by hostile tribes and wild animals. It's Jane who keeps her cool. While the boys panic, she takes charge, shouts orders and passes them the rifles. <br /> <br /> Article: Jane's disguise is a kind of poncho with nothing underneath. (The original idea was for her to be topless, with the foliage artistically blocking her nipples, which actually happens in a brief scene). <br /> <br /> Finally, several men of the web complained because the movie was called "Tarzan and his companion" instead of "Tarzan and his wife". There are no comments! <br /> <br /> Of course, Tarzan, who has been nursed to health by his ape friends, comes to the rescue, defeats the white hunters and induces the cargo elephants and African carriers to return the ivory. They stole the sacred place from which it came. End. <br /> <br /> So there you have it. A totally subversive film. Like all the other films about complex and interesting women (see, for example, Possessed with Rita Hayworth and Raymond Massey) that were such a fluid genre in the early 1930s and had such an abrupt end to the adoption of the Hays Code. <br /> <br /> The joie de vivre of this film is best expressed in Jane's soprano version of Tarzan's famous shout. A nice touch, which unfortunately was abandoned in future productions. <br /> <br /> Let's hear it for artistic freedom, feminist Jane and sex.
