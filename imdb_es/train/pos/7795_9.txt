This will be a different type of review. I've seen this movie twice on TV and I'd like to have a copy because it talks about Panama City and the beach in the winter, which is my favorite time to be there. It was the first movie I had seen by Ashley Judd and she was great and I enjoyed all the things I've seen her. The Sundance reaction also impressed me, as did the director, Victor Nunez, who has directed and wrote several films about Florida. This movie talks to me and I have not seen anything to compare it with. The plot speaks to me less than the environment. Well, I told you it would be a different revision.
