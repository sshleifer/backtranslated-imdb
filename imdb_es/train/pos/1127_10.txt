I only saw IPHIGENIA once, almost 30 years ago, but it has haunted me ever since. <br /> <br /> A sequence is kept particularly in mind, and could only have been created by a great director, as is undoubtedly Michael Cacoyanis. <br /> <br /> The context: the weight of history, a powerful army and a fleet, all fall on the shoulders of King Agamemnon. An act of sacrilege has calmed the seas, endangering his great expedition to Troy. He is told that he must sacrifice his daughter Iphigenia to Apollo to obtain the winds of the sails of the Thousand Ships. Initially he resists, but he approaches, and deceives his wife Clytemenstra to take his daughter to the Greek camp and marry the greatest of all warriors, Achilles. <br /> <br /> Clytemnestra and Iphigenia arrive, find out about the Sacrifice, and anger the gods for protection and revenge. Meanwhile, the proud Achilles discovers that his name has been used in this fraudulent and dishonorable manner. Go up a hill to tell Ifigenia that he will protect her. <br /> <br /> The shot: the camera surrounds the two young people, without looking directly at each other. They regret their fate and the weakness of men who cheat their loved ones and covet war. Suddenly, they look at each other and, for a moment, we feel their power and their beauty, and the irony not expressed, except by the camera, that at another time, in another place, maybe they could love and marry. . It is an acute and sad epiphany that lasts only a moment. <br /> <br /> What direction! What camera! What a storyteller!
