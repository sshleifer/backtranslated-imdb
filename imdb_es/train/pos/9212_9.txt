Yesterday, I went alone to the movies, because here in Mexico, most of the time films from other countries are part of the so-called "alternative camera". But after watching this movie, I realized that not all foreign films are alternatives. Fortunately, this is a good example. But I must say that I enjoyed this movie so much ... that in the end I was happy ... this film is a spoonful of hope these days. And the main lesson for me ... is that at the end of the day ... love is the main force behind us. This is a good option to watch a good movie in Spanish ... and I must mention the good music ... especially the main song of the movie ... Things that make life worthwhile ... Excellent song! !!
