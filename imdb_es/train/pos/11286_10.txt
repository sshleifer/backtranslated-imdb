I recommend watching this movie with your partner if you are planning a romantic night with him / her. The chemistry between Johnny Weissmuller and Maureen O'Sullivan as Tarzan and Jane is so hot that it could tarnish your screen. <br /> <br /> After the original movie, we begin to see how Tarzan and Jane have adapted to the jungle. and each other. The scanty clothing of Jane's jungle and the protest of Tarzan when Jane covers herself for her visitors, illuminates that not only are they romantically, but they are also very sexually in love. <br /> <br /> One's imagination can complement the constant contact and love conversation between Tarzan and Jane will portray how much Jane is teaching Tarzan about emotional, romantic and sexual love. And Jane's student is not only embracing but is also thriving on her sexuality without previously exploiting it. <br /> <br /> The skin show in this movie is off the charts. In addition to the attractive two-piece suit for Jane's waist, legs and hip, she also has a naked bath underwater with Tarzan. (Although it is not O'Sullivan, but the Olympic swimmer Josephine McKim who is duplicated by her in this scene) Weissmuller, also reveals a tremendous body and perfect pectorals in his loincloth just there. The ladies will be delighted when Weissmuller emerges from the water after his long struggle with the giant crocodile and sounds his scream, with his loincloth soaked in water practically falling from his hips. <br /> <br /> It's a pity that the overprotective Censores tempered the adult character of Tarzan's films after this entry. Although Weissmuller Tarzan's films would still thrive in the coming years, they would rarely come close to the sexual appeal of this film.
