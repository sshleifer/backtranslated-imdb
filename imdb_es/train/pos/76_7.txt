The follow-up of Vincent Price to HOUSE OF WAX (1953), the film that consolidated his reputation as an icon of horror, also revolves around a bitter theme. although it is ingenious? businessman. Although it is a remake, the first (filmed in Technicolor) remains the superior effort; that said, apart from a resistible comic relief, the obligatory recourse to cheap tricks (it was another showcase in 3D) and the occasional narrative deficiencies (what happened to the missing bag that supposedly appeared in some police station containing a severed head ?), this offers more than enough emotion in the style of Grand Guignol and the value of the camp in general (Price accommodates him in a variety of disguises as an inventor of illusions that supplants the conjurers of "disappeared" stars who had taken advantage of his genius) to stand on its own. the feet By the way, director Brahm's participation here is not a mere coincidence. since the narrative incorporates elements of two titles of terror (both carried out by Laird Cregar) that had directed previously, that is to say, THE LODGER (1944) and HANGOVER SQUARE (1945). Mary Murphy (as the priceless assistant of Price) and Patrick O'Neal (as her police detective fianc√©e) They interpret the young protagonists with enough curiosity, he himself would take the initiative in a similar piece, CHAMBER OF HORRORS [1966] , which I acquired just in time to serve as an encore to this). An interesting sideline here is the adoption by the latter of a novel detection technique, the fingerprinting, which is crucial to bring Price down (in a predictable but somewhat uncomfortable burning climax), although the persistent eavesdropping on his amateur crime novelist has at least a lot to do with this long-term! Seeing the star on a paper made to measure, the film emerges very funny. Particularly in a 73 minute compact.
