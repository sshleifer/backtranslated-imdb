It's okay, it's okay, do not bend again. I was kidding. <br /> <br /> "Bustin 'Out" is actually a better and truer title than any other. <br /> <br /> The racism and crime dramas get the satirical treatment that our animator friend with classification X Ralphie boy means. And he does one of his best jobs here. <br /> <br /> On the crime front shows the truth. They build it, defend it, then boredom and stronger rivals make it (maybe) lose it. See for yourself to see what happens. <br /> <br /> Racist? I do not know. With Scatman (RIP) and the love walrus (also RIP) being black and the main point of view, I saw it as an attack on racism mainly. The fact that Richard Pryor liked that also says it. And the youngest (pre "Miami Vice") Phil Mike Thomas there was a pleasant surprise. <br /> <br /> It is an animated film of "Blacksploitation". That is good. Done well and well done. It will do a little twisting (like the lynching scene) but unfortunately that is based on a fact. <br /> <br /> But Ralphie REALLY should have rethought that title.
