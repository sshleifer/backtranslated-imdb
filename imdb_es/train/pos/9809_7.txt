Randolph Scott goes to Albuquerque to take a job with his uncle. However, on the way, the scene stops, even if they do not carry a safe. However, a good lady on board is hiding $ 10,000 for her and her brother's business ... and the thieves seem to know this. <br /> <br /> Once in town, Scott goes to this guy about work. However, he soon learns that this guy is an imbecile, the typical evil westerns. You know, the rich guy who just wants to get richer by cheating, stealing and threatening until he's the owner of everything. And, it so happens that this imbecile was behind the theft. Scott demands that the guy return the money and then Scott goes into business with the kind lady and his brother. <br /> <br /> It is not surprising that this is not the end of the problems, only the beginning. Again and again, intrigues of various kinds occur to try to crush the opposition of the uncle. One trick is to bring a beautiful lady to befriend Scott and his companions. She is crazy and looks bad for Scott, until he realizes why he has come to town. <br /> <br /> Unlike most of Randolph Scott's later films, it shows Scott as a slightly more stubborn man. All too often, in his films, he is the last to suggest violence, but in this film he quickly suggests a lynching (turn to the law, let's have a hangin ') and later quickly threatens the uncle. What a surprise to see him as a hot head, although in most cases, it is the same Scott who would wait. <br /> <br /> As for the movie, there is nothing particularly unusual about this. that. Gabby Hayes plays the usual character, Scott is a hero, you can not reason with the bad guy and finally he gets destroyed and Scott stays with the girl. Despite this very typical plot, everything is handled very well and, as a result, it is worth your time. <br /> <br /> By the way, there are two strange scenes in the movie. First, at the end of the movie, there is a fistfight between Scott and uncle uncle # 1, Lon Chaney, Jr .. In it, Chaney smokes while fighting, something he had never seen before and admired how he could swell away while they kicked his ass. Secondly, get a load of that car scene out of control with the whip: now THAT was an impossible feat!
