"The invisible mouse" is a cartoon of Tom & Jerry charming and different. It has the usual chases and cat / mouse battles, but this time in a different way. Jerry accidentally falls into an invisible ink bottle and obviously is very happy with this because he realizes that he can prepare many "surprises" for Tom, scare him, torment him and confuse him. <br /> <br /> As much as it's weird, it's also great and fun to see what we can not see: invisible Jerry. It's fun to see things go up in the air without seeing who is doing it (we know who, right?), It's as if those things have a life of their own or even almost a matter of ghosts. It's just as fun to see Jerry eating sweets and fruits while invisible. I really like that instrumental music that sounds when it's not visible. <br /> <br /> Some of the best jokes about this brief summary are when Tom sees Jerry's shadow and hits him and even when Tom tries to hit him with a frying pan and Jerry writes "I missed him". I also like it when Jerry drinks Tom's chocolate milk, becoming visible and with a cheerful expression on his face. <br /> <br /> In general, this short has the basic ingredients necessary for a classic caricature: humor, entertainment, fun and some good works of art as well.
