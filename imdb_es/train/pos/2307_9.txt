I must say that this movie is really amazing and comforting. Reese Witherspoon is so lovely and Jason London is not that bad either! It's so sweet to see Dani falling in love and it breaks my heart and yet it warms my heart as I watch Court fall in love with Maureen. However, it is even sweeter to see how much he cares about Dani. I must admit that in the end I wanted him to fall in love with Dani. It's so nice to see her fall for him, I did not want her heart to break so much. But the biggest tragedy I've seen in this movie. Watching him die made me cry for a whole day. I just can not believe it. However, a more loving relationship has never been shown in a movie than Maureen and Dani. They can really do it through anything. I give this movie a 9 because I did not want Court to die, but it was still one of the most incredible movies I've seen.
