Well, first a correction to the label published on the main page of this movie. Abe Lincoln did not walk with his sister in the movie, nor did he stop at his sister's grave. The person in question is Ann Rutledge, who was very close to Lincoln in her days in New Salem. Some say that Ann was, in fact, Lincoln's girlfriend, but there is no evidence to support it. <br /> <br /> Now, there are fabrications and fictionalizations in this movie. Hollywood has always taken a dramatic license with anything under the sun, and "Young Mr. Lincoln" is no exception. However, the court case found in the film is based on a real event: the murder charge against William "Duff" Armstrong, and although it is largely fictional in this film with many name changes, it will still have fascinated viewers the screen. This is the Golden Age of Hollywood, with the best drama, and Henry Fonda offers possibly the best Lincoln that anyone has ever played.
