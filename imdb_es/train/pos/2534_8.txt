A scientist working frantically in seclusion finds a way to locate the impact crater of a meteor carrying a new radioactive element. All the (pseudo) scientific and cutting-edge talks of the 1930s are there, including the idea that radioactivity could cure any disease if it is properly utilized. When he summons his rivals, who had thrown him out of the scientific community and ridiculed him, to witness his discovery, they propose a "joint" expedition to Africa ... of course they end up stealing much of the dr. The original discovery of Rukh, giving him only residual credit. On top of that, a sissy effeminate who looks like a supporting comedy actor from the worst Abbot & Costello (Lawton) literally steals dr. The young wife of the Rukh trophy (Drake), who falls madly for that piece of human being. Having grown horns like a deer was not going to make dr. Rukh (Karloff) is more friendly, so he embarks on a mission of covert revenge ... killing 2 of his enemies and friend friend. Benet (Lugosi), the only one who had helped him ... finally succumbing to the deadly radiations that had allowed him to embark on his revenge to begin, but (to my greatest dissatisfaction) avoid the adulteress and that poor excuse for a human. being she had married. Acting is very good, with Karloff and Lugosi being very good. Check the scene of the hysterical waitress ... Not worth mentioning other characters ... Recommended, like ALL old universal horrors ...
