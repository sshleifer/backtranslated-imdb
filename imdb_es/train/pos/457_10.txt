This program is very funny and the title song is so catchy that I can not get it out of my head. I find that as I get older I am attracted to the wrinkles that make things, and these four are excellent in their efforts. Some of what they do is scandalous but brilliant considering that now, with the world of our PC, we can never do it in real life. I always learn something from the shows. But if you like mystery, drama, comedy and a bit of forensic work, you'll love this show. It reminds me of Quincy, ME in a way and Barney Miller in another way, the way they work and interact with each other. They fuck a lot but they do the work, and that's what counts.
