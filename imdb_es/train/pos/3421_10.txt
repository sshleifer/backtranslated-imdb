This shorter film is the epitome of the results expected when the imbecile runs the asylum. It is sad how the futures of these young people were knocked down at a craps table when Saddam Hussein and the people of Iraq, God rests on the souls of the more than 350,000 who have been killed, have nothing to do with terrorism or Al -Quida. <br /> <br /> After this movie, the astute viewer will have to pick up or download a copy of "Loose Change". This movie is available for free on the Internet, until the Bush clique blocks it, when searching Google for the title, as indicated in parentheses. <br /> <br /> God save our country. This will not be done following the cristofascistas who controlled the Houses of Congress for more than 10 years before November 2006!
