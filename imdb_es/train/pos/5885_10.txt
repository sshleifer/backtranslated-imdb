This movie surprised me a lot. I did not have many expectations, but I was wrong. Mary & Rhoda was very funny and well written. They did not spend much time repeating the past, so they did not trust the success of the old television program to take the film. In general, it was very entertaining. <br /> <br /> My girlfriend commented that this could be a weekly meeting and I think I could agree with her.
