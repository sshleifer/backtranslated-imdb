A film by Frank Capra WONDERS OF LIFE. <br /> <br /> Keeping the blood pumping through our veins is the responsibility of the worker HEMO THE Magnificent. <br /> <br /> In the mid-1950s, AT & T and Bell Science teamed up with famed Hollywood director Frank Capra to produce a series of CBS television science films to educate the public about the Universe that surrounds them Far from the boring black and white forages that so often imposed on young scholars, the Capra films instructed and entertained with animated scripts and striking visuals shown in Technicolor. The four films - OUR SR. SUN (1956), THE STRANGE CASE OF THE COSMIC RAYS (1957), HEMO THE MAGNIFICENT (1957), THE DISAPPEARED GOD (1958), quickly became the favorite of the school, where they were shown infinitely in 16 mm format. <br /> <br /> The star of the series was Dr. Frank C. Baxter (1896-1982), an affable English teacher at the University of Southern California. This common pedagogue proved to be the perfect film instructor, and brilliantly conveyed to his audience the sometimes complex facts in a way that never made them seem boring or boring. Dr. Baxter, who won a Peabody Award for his achievements, continued to make high-quality instructional films after the Capra quartet concluded. <br /> <br /> HEMO THE Magnificent, which was produced, written and directed by Capra, tells the story of the human heart and blood circulation system, using animation and soft humor. Film star Richard Carlson appears as the fiction writer, energetically helping Dr. Baxter tell the story of Hemo. <br /> <br /> Film experts will recognize Sterling Holloway as part of the television production team, and the voices of Marvin Miller, Mel Blanc, June Foray & Pinto Colvig as various cartoon characters, all without accredit. <br /> <br /> The devotional script that begins the film is completely in tune with the tone and tone of the production.
