I watched this film at the 2005 Palm Springs International Film Festival and from the 14 movies I saw there, I would classify it as my movie number 3. I had an initial interest in seeing this being of Swedish descent with many of my ancestors. from the region of Norrland, Sweden, where this was filmed. I also grew up in an area of ​​rural North America where many small cities looked a lot like the scene of this movie. It is good to see more films that use rural places as their configuration as Så som i himmelen. This was a very good movie and I'm sure it's a very difficult movie to conjugate with its great cast, but director Kay Pollock really accomplished this after almost two decades of absence from the direction. Helen Sjoholm in her film debut as an actress was fantastic and I would like to see more of her on the big screen. I enjoyed Michael Nyqvist at the head of this well-rounded cast. I would recommend this movie and I would rate it with a 9.0 on a scale of 10.
