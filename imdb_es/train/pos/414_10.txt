Cecil B. deMille really knew how to create a classic, and after 7 decades, his western appears as the Real McCoy, fascinating, entertaining, spectacular; in no way outdated. <br /> <br /> As a true DEADWOOD TV fan, I'll tell you about Gary Cooper's performances as Wild Bill Hickock and Jean Arthor, since Calamity Jane is much more on target. <br /> <br /> We no longer have giants in Hollywood. PLAINSMAN is just one of the dozens of classics from the 1936-1945 decade that have seen a lasting commercial life decade after decade: launched, reissued, reissued again. Filmmakers like today's Spielberg, Jackson, Bruckheimer are like children playing in a sandbox. None of today's movies will be searched in 7 months and less in 70 years.
