While a 9 may seem like an unusually high score for such a light film, however, compared to the hundreds and hundreds of detective films of the 30s and 40s series, this is one of the best and also compares very favorably with Powell's subsequent "Thin Man" movies. Now, this does NOT mean that the movie is similar to Thin Man, since THE KENNEL MURDER CASE is not a comedy, but rather a traditional movie of mystery detectives. Now you would think that not having Nora Charles or Asta or a comical traditional companion (something that is found in practically all the detective films of the series) for fun would be a detriment, but I did not miss them at all because this was so exceptional. Well written film: it has a really interesting case and excellent performances of all. <br /> <br /> The film starts at the dog show and is called The KENNEL Murder Case, although this film by Philo Vance really spends little time at the dog show and dogs are not a very important part of the film . Instead, a totally hated man is killed and left in a completely sealed room, an idea that is repeated in some other detective movies (like CRIME DOCTOR'S STRANGEST CASE). However, how it is explained all this seems quite credible and fits very well, keeping my interest at all times. I would like other detective films of the time to have such cleverly written arguments and an exceptional performance like this one. This is without a doubt a guardian.
