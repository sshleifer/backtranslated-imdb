I loved it and it was so shattered that there is no other season !!! I would like them to do it! It was the best show in history! There is probably no chance that they will decide not to cancel the show! ha ha, I wish I had! I would be so excited! I really would! I miss him! And it was especially shattered not knowing what's wrong with Jason! I think they should do another ... I also think it's silly that you have to write ten lines to post a comment ... it makes your comment drag ... and no one will read it! I really want to know what would have happened between Jason and Nicole ... Maybe they could go for a ride !!
