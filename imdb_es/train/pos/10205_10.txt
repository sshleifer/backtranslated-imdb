We found this accidentally, I was behind the movie box of what I thought I was renting, I did not find out until I got home, I saw it anyway. Absolutely fantastic! a wonderful movie, and one of my three favorites of all time, I recommend it to everyone! <br /> <br /> The story is nice and easy to follow, this could easily have been messed up, but the actors and the director do a great job to keep it together. <br /> <br /> The actors themselves are fantastic, they show a wonderful character and they do an excellent job. <br /> <br /> I have to find a copy somewhere ...........
