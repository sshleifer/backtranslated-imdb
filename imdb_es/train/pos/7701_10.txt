This has always been one of my favorite movies, and always will be. In recent years I have become a fan of science fiction of the 50s and 60s, trying to collect all the best that were made back then. I love many things about them, from how they could be up to how technically some of them were correct. The great colors and the sets encourage me too. It's a shame they do some of these good old movies again; they almost always fill it in, just look at the new repeat of The Day Earth Stood Still, it's absolute rubbish! Forbidden Planet is one of the reference space films of all time, and now they also try to do it again, and I shudder to think what the new one will be like! In my opinion, some things, like fantastic classic movies, should be left alone to be what they are, classic examples of great attempts to tell simple stories and give people emotion in the process. Once they add all the technological junk we have available now, the movie seems to be more dog meat from the Hollywood sausage factory, nothing special. By the way, I realize that the uniforms of the astronauts in Forbidden Planet were also used for "Queen of outer space"! That just tells you that budgets were a little lower back then, is not it? Hey, less money and better movies, hmmm ... <br /> <br /> Great performances in this movie by Leslie Nielsen, in a serious role, and Anne Francis, Walter Pidgeon (who has always been one of my favorite actors ), Earl Holiman, and of course Robby the Robot! <br /> <br /> The special effects are fantastic, and the plot is not too exaggerated. This is a great science fiction experience!
