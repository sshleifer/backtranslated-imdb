One of the most underestimated movies I've seen in a long time, Bogus Journey by Bill & Ted is the second hilarious adventure of Bill S. Preston Esq. And Ted Theodore Logan, also known as Wyld Stallyns. There are two ways of seeing this movie: first, you see a stupid dialogue, a crazy plot, a youthful idea. Or ... You see brilliantly minimized idiots who once again find themselves in a situation too big for their brains. Launch a Bruce Willis or Arnold Schwarzeneggar in this plot and it becomes a great hit movie. Bill and Ted enter the story with the same level of sincerity, only it's Bill and Ted. This is a difficult fence to keep in balance, but when you see the film not as a disposable comedy, but as an adventure with two guys who have nothing to do with an adventure, it becomes much more.
