['I remember seeing this movie on Saturday afternoon television in the 50s or 60s. It was well presented, but I do remember that there was a message of hope transmitted by transmitters secreted in lanterns in one of the last maniacal executions for the imminent release. I&#39;m not sure it fits the facts. <br /><br /> Still, the movie is well made. The German High Command informs ironically and without emotion &quot;The Russians advance through the Fredrich Strasse&quot; as if everything went according to plan. <br /><br /> I got the impression that this film and a later version made in the United States for the imitation of TV were based on the story of the British historian Trevor-Roper for a similar title, The Last Days of Hitler. I was surprised to see no credit to Trevor-Roper. <br /><br /> I agree that the new German film on the DOWNFALL theme was as well made as the classic one. The American imitation was a bit flat. <br /><br /> Few figures have attracted as much film attention as Adolph. However, I find it interesting that none of the many films and books that have ever come out speak of Hitler&#39;s double alluded to by going through the magnificent historical piece by John Toland. <br /><br /> It was gibs?']
