This movie is perhaps the most moving and edifying I've ever seen. I am not a religious person, but sometimes a great work of art like this film can give me an almost religious experience. Suddenly, one realizes that life has a true meaning. <br /> <br /> I must admit that when I first heard about this movie, I was skeptical. I thought the plot sounded artificial and I feared that the story would be banal. But being a fan of David Lynch, I decided to give it a try. It took me about 30 minutes to be completely captured by the movie, but then I got completely lost in it. There is so much wisdom and warmth in this movie! I left the cinema with the feeling that I had really learned something valuable about life. <br /> <br /> This is not a typical David Lynch movie, and somehow it was very surprising that I made a movie like that after exploring the dark sides of human nature for so many years. On the other hand, I'm not surprised that he manages to convey deep emotions and a deep human intuition, because I also thought he did very well in The Elephant Man. Lynch is one of the most talented directors and I think The Straight Story is his better version. 9.5 / 10
