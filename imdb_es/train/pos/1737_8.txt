I love the old Burt Reynolds movies. They are more fun and better than any other movie combined. They could have stopped making movies after "Cannonball Run 2", but I guess how could they have known there would not be any more good films? Man, this movie is good. Burt Reynolds has to dress like a chicken and drive a lot in a race car, and the exuberant Loni Anderson is at hand, looking extremely hot in a way eighty. Burt and Loni, those were the days! I used to have this magazine that had Loni Anderson advertising a vacuum cleaner. I loved that announcement! Also, there's a part in the movie where the audience at the racecourse is upset about something Stroker Ace (Burty R.) is doing, and it shows a guy in the audience bending over and sticking his finger in his butt to show your disappointment! I laughed so much I almost died in the night! If you can find this movie, rent it! And then never watch another movie, because I tell you now: it does not make sense.
