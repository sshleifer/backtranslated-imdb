['Oh, I loved this movie. I think he had everything. He made me laugh out loud a dozen times. Yes, I am a girl, so I am writing this from a girl&#39;s perspective. I think it&#39;s a pity that I only got a score of 5.2. Too many guys voting? It was far above other romantic comedies. Just because I&#39;m a woman I do not enjoy all the chic movies, on the contrary, I prefer other genres. Romantic comedies tend to be shallow and not as funny as they should be. But like I said, this movie had everything, almost, in my opinion. Great script, good phrases, good acting. Although the character of Eva Longoria Parker reminded Gabrielle much of Desperate Housewives, so what? It was amazing. I will keep this movie for the rainy days, the days when I feel bad and I need some laughs.']
