Another Australian masterpiece, it delves into the world of the unknown and the supernatural, and does it very well. It does not resort to special effects as big as American movies, it focuses more on the emotional impact. A relatively simple plot that Rebecca Gibney & Co. brings to life. It follows the story of a couple who buy an old house that was supposedly the home of a very old woman who never went out and whose husband disappeared in mysterious circumstances a century ago. Strange things begin to happen in the house, and John Adam begins to become the man who disappeared, who was actually a mass murderer. Highly recommended 8/10
