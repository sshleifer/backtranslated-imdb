I watched the first series eagerly, but I wondered if I would return after a long break. However, I tuned in to episode one of Series 2 and was hooked again. This really is excellent tele; Pioneering things like Mission: Impossible in the 1960s. The characters are well rounded and expand as the series progresses, change as they adapt, some more easily than others, to their new surroundings, but remain astutely in their character, and yet, it is more than possible to have sympathy for them. someone for whom you would not have thought you could feel sorry, when something really overwhelming happens to them. I hope there are many years of 'Lost' to wait, and I really do not care much if I never get answers to all the mysteries!
