Apart from the usual stereotypes of the thirties, Eugene Pallette as the harsh detective of the police, Jack La Rue as the "dark" Italian and, of course, James Lee as "the Chinese cook", this film is THE great mystery of a murder in a closed room. For a movie from the early 1930s, this step by step "peeling of the chapaer of the mystery" is similar to the COLUMBO series, except in this movie, which does not have the advantage of knowing in advance who the killer was.
