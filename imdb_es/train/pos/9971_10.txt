This movie was excellent, I thought the original was pretty mediocre. This, however, has all the ingredients, a 1970 Hemi Challenger with 4-speed transmission that really shows that Mother Mopar knew how to build the best high-performance cars. I was in the Chrysler sky every time Kowalski knocked down that big block, Hemi, and that was what I did a lot :)
