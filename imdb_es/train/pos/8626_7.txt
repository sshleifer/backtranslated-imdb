"Der Todesking" is not exactly the kind of movie that makes you happy. The second consecutive cult monument of Jörg Buttgereit, which is actually much better than the infamous "Nekromantik", does it exist in seven short episodes? One for each day of the week? Stirring about the suicides of unrelated people. In the midst of these already very disturbing episodes, Buttgereit inserts truly horrifying images of a decomposing male corpse. The episodes are not all equally powerful, but, as a healthy product, "Der Todesking" ranks high on the list of the most depressing art films of all time. In particular, the episodes on Wednesday, involving a man explaining his sexual frustrations to a stranger in the park, and Sunday's, focused on a younger man who is dedicated to killing, are extremely intense and devastating to watch. The added value of this film, or any other similar shock material, is debatable and I'm not even sure if Buttgereit had any kind of message to communicate here. There is a vague mention of a strange chain letter that encourages its readers to commit suicide, but above all we keep ourselves informed about the motivations of these people to end their lives in such a dramatic way. Unlike what I expected, "Der Todesking" is neither exploitative nor repulsively graphic! On the contrary, in reality, I could never have expected Buttgereit to be so subtle and reflective in relation to the portrait of pure human misery. Thursday's episode is a perfect example of this, as it shows different points of view of a famous German bridge, while the names, ages and occupations of the people who jumped appear on the screen. Production values ​​are inevitably poor and editing often lacks professionalism, but this is not what really counts in this type of cinema. The theme is strong and forces us to contemplate on the less joyful? but also indispensable? life aspects. GREAT use of tragic music, too!
