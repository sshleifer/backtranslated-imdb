The premise of this anime series is about bread, about everything to base a plot! I really laughed. The main character has a special power to make bread with which he was born, and he goes to baking school. I wish it were available on DVD, and it does not matter if it's subtitled or dubbed, it's that good. Even the subject is just fun. At one point of the subject, there is an African-Japanese man with an Afro on horseback, wielding a French baguette as if it were a samurai sword. These images will not make sense unless you watch the anime. You will laugh until your sides hurt. It is definitely the most unique anime I've seen so far.
