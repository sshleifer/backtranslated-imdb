FORBIDDEN PLANET is the best SF movie of the golden age of SF cinema and what makes it a great movie is its astonishment. As soon as the spaceship lands, the audience, through the human crew of the ships, travels through an intelligent and, at times, terrifying adventure. We met with the unforgettable Robbie, the mysterious Dr. Morbuis, his beautiful and innocent daughter, Altair, and we learned about the ancient inhabitants of the planet: the Krell who died overnight. Or did they? <br /> <br /> It can be said that the planet is filmed in a film studio with painted backgrounds, but that adds to the feeling of claustobobia that I feel and the electronic music of Bebe and Louis Barron adds even more atmosphere. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised that this movie is not in the 250 best IMDB movies.
