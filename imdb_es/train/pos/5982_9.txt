One of my favorite movies. It has it all: oscillating soundtracks, courtesy of Eddie Clark, former Motorhead, lots of action, lots of laughs, a totally ridiculous plot and the most wonderful stereotypes of the 80s as characters. Eddie, the cute and handsome boy, who just wants to be left alone to be different, Leslie (almost like wet), Nuke (the wear of the rock), Eddie's mom (pathetic), Roger (the geek) and Ozzy like the preacher (surely it exists in America?). Then there are the children (rich, vicious and stupid) and the girls (vacancies, vain and stupid). What more could you ask for? <br /> <br /> Well, first of all, there's Sammi Curr, the rock star, an amalgam of every 80s rocker you can imagine. What about that guitar that fires rockets? Then there is the scene in which Sammi throws the old woman through the TV screen and crushes her. And what does Roger do? Go, lift it, like a good geek would do. My favorite scene is where Tim Hainey gets his reward from Sammi through the wet finger on the plug: magic! <br /> <br /> If you liked rock in the 80s or just love ridiculous movies like me, then look at this. It's available on DVD and it's very cheap, so treat it or treat it.
