['This series was like what you would expect from Mr.Spielberg. It is truly one of those frightful, funny and childish shows that you will not forget. Like Outer Limits (another great show), this little series does what not much can. It was great, and it deserved to run longer. It was a great show, that even the children could see, although some of them were a little scared when they wanted to be, but they all always had a moral at the end (like Twilight Zone) that made you realize the situation. You did not want to end up in, or the ones you did. I remember seeing some of these in science fiction when I was 10, and even now, I still enjoy seeing them when I can. Truly a fun and imaginative show. I loved it, and I still do it']
