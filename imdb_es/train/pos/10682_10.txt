Some years ago, the satellite channel U.K. Gold promoted reruns of 'Men Behaving Bad' with exaggeration: "Here it is, the original floor-share comedy!" In fact, this was not true. 'Man About The House' was also a situation comedy that was shared flat and developed from 1973 to 1976. <br /> <br /> It was a creation of Johnnie Mortimer and Brian Cooke, creators of the popular comedy of situations "Father Dear Father". When it was over, they decided they wanted to do something more in harmony with the times. <br /> <br /> In the first episode, Chrissy (Paula Wilcox) and Jo (Sally Thomsett) order their apartment in Myddleton Terrace after a wild party when they find a man in his bathroom. He is Robin Tripp (Richard O'Sullivan), a Southampton cook student with no fixed address. While she is drying her clothes, she puts on a lady's robe and prepares a meal for them. They are so impressed by their culinary skills that they invite you to stay. But there should be no mischievous business. So Robin has to pretend to be gay ... <br /> <br /> In BBC-2's "I Love 1973", shown in 2000, Julie Burchill claimed that "House" showed her a way of life that she envied. She was not alone. One of the most iconic images (for me, anyway) of British television in the 70s was Sally Thomsett leaving the London Underground with an umbrella, and a "blind" man doing a double take when the high passed. <br /> <br /> A man who lives with two girls was a dangerous subject for the time, but Mrs. Mary Whitehouse did not need to warm up, it was an innocent and kind fun. The scripts of Mortimer and Cooke were as close as possible to the edge without crossing them. <br /> <br /> Richard O'Sullivan was still playing 'Bingham' in the 'Doctor in Charge' of I.T.V. when this started In fact, the second performance of 'In Charge' overlapped with the first 'House'. He was born to play the sex mad Robin. "Chrissy" by Paula Wilcox was more street than "Beryl", her character she played in "The Lovers", while "Jo" by Sally Thomsett was an adorable dizzy blonde. As time passed, he became almost an older brother to them. <br /> <br /> For many viewers, Brian Murphy and Yootha Joyce stole the show as the Ropers at war. George had lost interest in sex, but Mildred had not. They continued with their own program, aptly titled 'George & Mildred'. The late Doug Fisher had a good relationship as Larry's friend of Larry's, Robin. He worked so well that he became a regular player. <br /> <br /> A year after its debut, there was the inevitable split of the film. I'm not a big fan of the movie 'The Man in the House' because I think it spread to fit the big screen. Most of his characters had never appeared in the series. <br /> <br /> The format was sold to America, where it became the long-running 'Three's Company' starring the late John Ritter and Suzanne Somers. It was much more suggestive than the British original, with Somers often wearing sexy clothes. <br /> <br /> After six seasons, 'House' ended with Chrissy marrying Robin's older brother, Norman (Norman Eshley). The fans were devastated to see that Robin could not get the girl he loved, but there was some comfort in the fact that he also got his own show, 'Robin's Nest'.
