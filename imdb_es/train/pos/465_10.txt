['Marlene Gorris has established herself as one of the great directors of the world. This sensitive and visually beautiful film is based on a story by Vladimir Nabokov and captures the dark irony of that writer. John Turturro gives what I consider his best performance (usually I&#39;m not a fan of him); and Emily Watson is also brilliant. Worth seeing.']
