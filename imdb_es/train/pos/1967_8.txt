I do not understand why the criticisms of this film are universally bad, unless it is beyond my reach. I found him sick, bright, twisted and psychologically sophisticated. You will not delve into the mind of a criminal psychopath in a Hollywood movie that is. It has layers inside the layers, acting nuanced by Stone and a plot that will keep you guessing even after it's over. People need to overcome the fact that Sharon Stone is 48 years old, and that Michael Douglas is not in this. I predict that this movie will be a great success on the DVD once people see it for themselves and stop paying attention to the professional critics they publish. Try it, you could be glad you did!
