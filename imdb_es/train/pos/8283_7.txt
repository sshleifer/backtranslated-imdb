['A solid B movie. <br /><br /> I like Jake Weber. His discreet delivery is refreshing in a moment of more than the best performances. I liked the relationship between father and son. I liked the family dynamic. The Wendigo seems silly, but it is a representation of the child&#39;s toy and the dead deer. It&#39;s an amalgam like, you see? This is a psychological story, not Freddy slash em up instant gratification movie. Watch it and reflect on your inner child and what the movie could tell you and you&#39;ll be fine. <br /><br /> Good job.']
