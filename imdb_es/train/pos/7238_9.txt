Warning of small SPOILERS! <br /> <br /> Good movie ... VERY good movie. And I'm surprised to say, because I'm not a big fan of vampires and the sound of director Deran Serafian's name usually means bad news. Most of his films are below-average action movies such as Death Warrant and Gunmen. This was one of his first films and maybe he should have continued to make horror movies instead of action. This movie really fascinated me. Good achievement, not seeing famous actors or big budget involved. It really is the story that keeps you focused. Especially fans of Dracula's original myth will be satisfied. Sarafian illuminates another aspect of the famous story of Bram Stoker and remains fairly loyal and true to the truth. It explains the life of Count Roemenian Dracula and how he scared the Turkish army by throwing corpses in front of his castle. Of course, that's where reality stops and "based on a true story". Bram Stoker invented the blood drink and all that. <br /> <br /> In this film, the count (Vlad Teppish) emigrates to the USA. UU And it seduces tons of women. And they're all pretty girls, I'll give you that. In general, good performance of unknown faces, enough blood and blood to satisfy the most morbid terror fans and an interesting story. This movie is really unknown and was hidden in the darker shelf of my local video library. But it is certainly worthwhile to clean the dust off the cover and place it on the VCR. Heck, it's much better than Nicole Kidman's famous movie with the same title. These two films do not have anything else in common, but I blame that movie for stealing the attention of this beautiful little image. Take a look ... my humble opinion on To Die For = 8.5 / 10
