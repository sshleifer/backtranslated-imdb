Cast perfect for a drama of few people. Simon is dead but somehow he is resurrected from the outside. What he had seen there is shown in the form of blank spaces orchestrated to a magnificent score by the German avant-garde composer Werner Henze. Simon is obsessed with his death, consoled by the support of the death people he had seen on the other side. His girlfriend tries to give him life, but by not doing so, he decides to follow him after his death. Very delicate and moving, deeply psychological, but a little slow and somewhere even boring.
