The working-class romantic drama of director Martin Ritt is as amazing as it comes, however, there are moments of pleasure that are mainly due to the charisma of the stars Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro (both great). She is a widow who can not move forward, is illiterate and a costume inventor. You can probably guess the rest. The adaptation of Pat Barker's novel "Union Street" (a better title!) Is so relaxed that it borders on foolishness, and the editing of the film is a disaster, but it's still nice; A fantasy of blue neck of pink color. There are no approaches to serious problems (even the angle of illiteracy is just a plot tool for the next love story) and there are no real fireworks, although the characters are intentionally a bit colorless and the wires are toned to an interesting degree. The ending is pure fuzz, and cynics will find it difficult to swallow, although these two characters deserve a happy ending and the image would not be satisfactory in any other way. *** since ****
