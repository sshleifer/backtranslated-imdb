Frownland is like one of those intensely embarrassing situations in which you end up laughing out loud at the exact moment; and just at the moment when you realize that you should not laugh, you have already reached the pinnacle of the sonorous voice; and when you look around you at the ghostly white faces with your mouth wide open and your eyes glazed, you feel a throbbing pain that starts in the pit of your stomach and suddenly goes up your throat and ... well, you understand the point. . <br /> <br /> But in spite of everything unpleasant and the blows in the face, Frownland, it really is an extraordinary job that, after seeing the inarticulate disorder of a main character and all his pathetic problems and setbacks, you I want to take your eyes out and at the same time, you feel terrible for him. <br /> <br /> It would have been much easier for me to simply get out of the Ronald Bronstein movie, but for some crazy people For this reason, I felt an unshakeable determination to stay the course and experience all the great irritation the movie has. to offer. If someone sets you on fire, you will usually want to turn it off: stop! Release! And roll! But with this movie, you want to see how the flame slowly envelops your whole body. You endure the pain, perhaps out of spite, or through some unknown masochistic curiosity that I can not even begin to try to explain. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, conventional cinema will never allow this movie to reach a theater near you. . But if you have the chance to catch it, get ready: bring a doggie bag.
