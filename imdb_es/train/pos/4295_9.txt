Alain Chabat claims that this film is his original idea, but the theme of the reluctant lovers who finally get it is as old, if not older, than Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> Chabat is a "vieux garcon", happily single and not wanting any member of the opposite sex to disturb his life. He has a problem, 5 sisters and a matriarchal mother, the G7, who decide that he should be married. Enter the lovely, lovely Charlotte Gainsbourg and what should be a simple plan. Charlotte has to pretend to be Chabat's girlfriend and then simply not show up on the wedding day. There is no talk of marriage since the G7. Of course, the best established plans have the habit of getting out of control. <br /> <br /> There are very strong supporting roles from Lafont as a mother and Osterman as the brother of Gainsbourg. There are some fantastic scenes like the first one that Charlotte has to love, and then rebel against the family. French farce with an Englishman.
