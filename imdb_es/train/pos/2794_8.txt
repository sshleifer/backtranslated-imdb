How can a film be controversial and soft at the same time? This one does it with an almost perfect structure. Nobody wants their daughters to be athletes. Apparently, most cultures do not want their daughters to have small breasts either. Here we see a group of excellent actors from whom we have never heard portraying people from different cultures who live monotonous lives until their females want and have the potential to become professional footballers. The structure around the parallelism of the two cultures is wonderful. There is no condescension. Both cultures are seen as modern and valid. (And yes, both are stupid, too). One flaw: the Hindu wedding ceremony seemed to involve hundreds of relatives, but not a child among them.
