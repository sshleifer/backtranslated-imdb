I watched this movie twice in community screenings and I really loved it. I work in the community of Jane Finch and I feel that the film really captured something of the essence and flavor of the community: guts, determination, exuberance, creativity, in your image with a dose of despair. The writing, the dialogue and the acting are solid and I really found myself stuck in the story of the young Raya as she struggles to reach her goals and not get lost in the process. Excellent dance sequences and not only the bodies move smoothly and with electricity, but the camera moves with great fluidity and intelligence too. All the characters are multidimensional, none of all good or bad and the female characters are admirably strong. This is a film that has a strong heart and that celebrates the uncontainable spirit of youth, hip hop and communities like Jane Finch.
