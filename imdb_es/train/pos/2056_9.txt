I do not think most people give this movie all the credit it deserves. I love low-budget horror films and this takes the cake, especially for the originality. Yes, the Scarecrow is a terrifying Kung-Fu fighter, but why not? No one else is willing to go that far. I really had not had so much fun watching a movie since Candyman. So the city chooses this child who calls him a scarecrow, even his mother does not care. Then they kill him and the spirit is infused into the Scarecrow, which then goes on a wave of murders. His disappearance is relatively easy to assume once the movie begins. The dedications at the end go directly to a group of horror directors, but with the greatest dedication towards Dario Argento I really thought it was great, these people who want to make films of a newer genre. During the movie there are a lot of Arnold scams, with a line that you will definitely laugh at as if you stayed and kill the sheriff with a stick. I would say, take a pizza, friends and laugh your A $$ with this movie. I love it for its originality, the most fun.
