A comedy of epic fun proportions of the guys who brought you South Park and most of Orgazmo's kids. This vulgur, obscence movie has an absolutely disgusting, colorful and satirical content. It represents an incredibly cruel treatment of humans and animals. I LOVE!!!!! This is something fun. Very funny. Two losing friends create a game in their driveway, which explodes into a national sensation. Corruption, greed and blackmail make the sport bitter, and it is until Coop ta fixes it. And on the way, you will laugh. Much. That's all there is. Enjoy!!!!
