I admit that I have only seen three of Shakespeare's plays (Romeo and Juliet, Macbeth and, of course, Hamlet), one that I liked, another that I found more or less (Macbeth), and Hamlet I just found a masterpiece. I am pleased to tell you that this adaptation is as good as the intense and dramatic game. The acting is extremely strong (with a cast featuring Kenneth Branagh, Robin Williams and Billy Crystal, how can you lose?) And the change in the time period (it seems somewhere between 17 and 1800) unfolds wonderfully as the characters move and tell their infamous lines directly from the script itself that any fan of Shakespeare's play will get chills. If you like this popular drama, I urge you to watch this powerful 1996 adaptation of Shakespearean fan Kenneth Branagh.
