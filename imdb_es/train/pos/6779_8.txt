George Cukor directs a cynical and meditative classic. The distinctive Ronald Coleman is at his best in this piece of Noir about an actor who loses himself in his roles. The acclaimed Anthony John (Colman) has chased away his wife Brita (Signe Hasso) with his temperament and erratic behavior. But the two manage to continue working together to please their audiences. Things start to change as John gets bored with his career; he reluctantly agrees to play Othello. He delves into character as a jealous and murderous man. He begins to walk a thin line between illusion and reality and ends up confusing his role with his own life and eventually kills his lover (Shelley Winters), but has no memory of the wrong action. <br /> <br /> Colman seems impeccable in this role Winters is very impressive since the young woman is determined to get away from her sordid life. Also in the cast: Edmond O'Brien, Ray Collins, Joe Sawyer and Whit Bissell.
