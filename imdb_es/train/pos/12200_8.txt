At the time The Lady was being made from Shanghai, the marriage of Orson Welles and Rita Hayworth was disintegrating. The film was as much an effort of Welles to rekindle the old flames as to make a classic noir. Not receiving well at that time, The Lady from Shanghai has received more and more criticism as the years pass. Improved with age, so to speak. <br /> <br /> Welles is the Irish sailor Michael O'Hara, who on a fateful night rescues the beautiful Rita Hayworth from three robbers in Central Park. The sparks fly, but then the problem comes, it turns out that the lady is married to a cripple, but the brilliant criminal lawyer Everett Sloane. However, Sloane likes Welles a lot and hires him to jump his yacht. <br /> <br /> Until now, this movie is starting to sound a lot like Gilda. If Orson had seen Gilda and was not at this point thinking with his male member, he would have returned to the sailors hiring hall in Lower Manhattan. Instead, he engages in a charming network or intrigue and encounters two murders and Sloane as his eminent lawyer. <br /> <br /> Welles, for whatever reason, decided that his wife would be blonde in this movie. Supposedly Harry Cohn hit the roof as Rita was known internationally for her coppery red hair. This may have soured him in the photo when he joined the legion of studio bosses who saw Welles' vision that the independent film posed a threat to his power. <br /> <br /> Stage actor Glenn Anders plays Grisby, Sloane's partner. Friend, he ends a corpse. The other corpse that is here is Ted DeCorsia, a private detective who feeds on the fund and tries to do business for himself. <br /> <br /> It's a good thriller, showing Rita in her glamorous best, even if she was blonde. here. The final session in the hall of mirrors is beautifully organized, but I would not recommend seeing it if it is in a controlled substance.
