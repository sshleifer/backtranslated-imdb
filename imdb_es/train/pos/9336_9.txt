German private television is not known for copying Dutch and? naturally? Formats of the United States. Well, in the case of Edel & Starck, the xeroxing only went to the basics: Screwball. <br /> <br /> Can not stand the screwball comedy? Do not look at Edel and Starck. Seriously. If you expect another legal drama similar to Law & Order or something like that, go somewhere else. (Or see Law & Order because it's pretty bright in what it does, but I'm rambling). E & S is fun, it often addresses issues that provoke reflection, it's fun, romantic, fun, and witty too. <br /> <br /> Quite frankly, I am quite dismayed that the writers did not get better offers after the series finale. And my cynical nature needs readjusting with respect to private German television productions. The German residents will understand what I am talking about. <br /> <br /> In summary: look at it. I have no idea what synchronization is like in English, but it's worth learning German just to watch them for four seasons. Pseudo-happy ending included.
