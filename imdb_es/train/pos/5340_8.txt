['Clara Lago is wonderful as the main character of the film, essentially a film about a Spanish / American girl who moves to Spain with her mother at the time of the Spanish Civil War. It turns out that the mother goes home to die and she stays with her grandfather. She also makes friends and experiences a lot in a short time. Tomiche (Juan Jose Ballestra) is at first a nuisance to her and then they become close. The film is beautifully shot, bathed in soft colors for the most part. Carol longs for her father, who is a pilot in the war, and you can feel the love she has for him. While the war itself is in the background in this film, it involves the life of the character. I think you&#39;ll like it. See it especially for Clara Lago, who does a great job as Carol. She is definitely one to see.']
