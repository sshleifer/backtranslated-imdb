I saw this series when it first appeared in the 70s. I was 14 years old and I saw it in the house of my best friends, since my father did not want to see it. It became a weekly ritual every Sunday, and as everyone will do. Telling them at age fourteen to watch a documentary in an almost reverential silence must mean that this was something special. <br /> <br /> The wide scope of the events of the Second World War makes it a difficult subject to document. the manufacturers divided it into what they considered the most significant key events and devoted an episode to each one. Some episodes covered long periods, such as the "wolf pack", which covered almost all six years of the Atlantic battle. Stalingrad had an episode in itself. <br /> <br /> This documentary could not be done today simply because most of the interviewees are dead. The list of important players that appears offers a surprising insight into the thought at that time. Anthony Eden the Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Carl Donnitz, at the sight of submarines, Albert Speer, pet architect and then Minister of armament of Hitler. In one of the last episodes we see Traudl Junge, Hitler's secretary, who was with him in the bunker and it was to her that he dictated his final testament: he left the bunker after Hitler's suicide and escaped through the Russian lines . These and many others play an important role in the realism of the events described. <br /> <br /> If I have any criticism of the series, the code breakers of Bletchly Park are not included, but the revelations of their part in the war arose only after the series was made, so I can not blame the creators of programs. <br /> <br /> the initial titles and the music is magnificent, and Lawrence Olivier's narrative adds a natural gravity to the script. <br /> <br /> The best documentary series ever made? definitely. inescapable
