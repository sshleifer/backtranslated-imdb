When The Matrix appeared in 1999 and questioned existence and identity, many films were expected to use it as inspiration. That did not really happen, surprisingly, and it took until 2002 for a similar subject film to appear. But to say that Cypher is a clone would be to discredit him. <br /> <br /> The story is from Morgan Sullivan, who is applying for a job at a high-flying technology company called Digicorp. Your job is to be a spy and get information about a rival company, while you are under a false and supposed identity. His family life is perfectly normal, but he has to lie to his wife about what he is really doing. However, things start to turn conspiratorial and before he knows what is happening, he begins to question who he really is. This is not helped by a strange woman who appears ... <br /> <br /> The twists and turns in all directions keep him absolutely fascinated, and in no time anything seems artificial or incredible. <br /> Br /> It is an exciting journey through a not too distant future, and with a good performance throughout the year will keep you on the edge of your seat. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
