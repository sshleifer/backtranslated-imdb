['It&#39;s a weekend that I&#39;ve seen this funny movie. And I like it a lot All children are cute, they remind me of my own childhood with those stupid thoughts. It is a really entertaining movie for a group of families on the weekend night, which could make many memories and laughs. Children&#39;s humor always works. good acting too. Simple story but great shooting. Good job for the director to find the way of the children. When it comes to the children&#39;s film, I think of &quot;12 and holding&quot;. Another this year, but different aspect of the children&#39;s world, which is real and cruel. awesome work. H2EFW focuses on the happy side of childhood, which every child and family needs. ps Twitch, I think, is Nemo&#39;s voice of &quot;Finding Nemo.&quot;']
