Edward Furlong and Christina Ricci are an excellent couple and they show it with their unique charisma that appears in this film. <br /> <br /> This is the typical "alternative" or indie movie with an argument that presents a rare situation that suddenly becomes really important. <br /> <br /> Pecker is an average child who has an old camera and his main hobby is taking pictures of the exotic inhabitants of the small town where he lives. Suddenly, an alternative artist pays attention to his work and hires him to expose his work in some important festivals and more. <br /> <br /> But Pecker's life changes drastically, since now fortune and fame seem to infuriate the people of the city that is Pecker's main inspiration. Even his sexy girlfriend gets angry because now he does not pay "proper" attention to her. <br /> <br /> Well, this is an Indie movie with an advantage, but not for everyone. It may seem boring or pretentious to some people, but I still think it's worth it to see it just because it offers something "different" to typical Hollywood standards. <br /> <br /> To describe it in a few words: this is the typical Christina. Film by Ricci and John Waters. That's. <br /> <br /> Oh, and I almost forgot to mention that the "Full of Grace" lines are really annoying. Wow
