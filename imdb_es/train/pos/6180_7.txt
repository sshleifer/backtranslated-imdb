['During the opening night of Vanties, a woman is found dead on the catwalk on stage. As the program continues, the police try to gather who killed who and why before the final curtain. <br /><br /> I had always heard that this was a great classic comedy mystery, so I was excited to find myself a copy. Unfortunately, nobody told me about the musical numbers that go on and on and on. While the numbers are certainly the kind Hollywood did in their glory days, they become intrusive because they practically stop the movie despite attempts to weave the action around them. This would not be so bad if the music was half decent, but it is not. There is only one good song. Worse, as if the studio knew they had a song, Cocktails for Two, and we are forced to support four versions: a duo, a large number of production, like the end of Vanities and in the background as incidental music. I do not think Spike Jones and His City Slickers played so much. The rest of the movie is pretty good with Victor McLaglen training well with Jack Oakie. Charles Middleton is very funny, his scenes as an actor in love with the costume owner. <br /><br /> In no way is it essential that you can recommend this if you think you can get it through the musical numbers, or if you are willing to read them. It&#39;s a funny movie of the kind they no longer do.']
