Running out of movies to rent, I picked up Freebird. I fought during the first third of the movie wondering if the rest would be a waste to see. Fortunately, it really got hotter, and I loved the movie a bit. The second half of the movie made me smile and laugh all the time. Fortunately, although there were fragments of CGI included, they were not exaggerated or frequent. <br /> <br /> However, I would have to say that all the actors have a strong European accent, so be careful if you have trouble understanding them. Voices or your cultural humor. <br /> <br /> I really loved this movie, and I will have to ask for a copy for my own collection.
