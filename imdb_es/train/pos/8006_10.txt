This is a great game! Well, maybe it did not have some of the features it was meant to have, but Digital Anvil still has a good game. There is a certain similarity with Elite (you can exchange, collect weapons and load on destroyed ships, go to missions), however, this game presents a mission with many scripts. It is a great mission. The control system is different, use the mouse! Basically you fly your spaceship around a system and ascend! The game has some pretty good graphics, even when it was made in 2003. It should work well even on a modestly specified PC. The story features a great voice acting from John Rhys Davies, George Takei, Jennifer Hale (featured in all computer games). Stay with the story that improves and improves as you go. There's even a career section, where you and an opponent have to run your spaceships around a course (it involves you going through rings). This section took me a while to win. Add variety to the game. Some sections are a bit difficult here and there, but in general you can improve this game. The game has an active mod scene on the network. Collect some mods to expand the game. I have not played any of the mods yet. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately a sequel to this was canceled, a shame!
