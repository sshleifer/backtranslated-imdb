['The Unborn is a very, very different movie. James Karen and Brooke Adams are in the movie and they performed quite well. This movie builds solidly and keeps you moving. Although I think you must be a horror fan to see this because of the scenes and the plot. There is a brief non-nudity sex scene that could have been omitted and for some people this scene may disappoint someone like me who is in the movie and thinks that those things ruin a good movie, but that&#39;s it. There is a scene in which the character of Adams goes crazy and kills a cat, but you can say that it is not real. The music is very different but very good. The Unborn in my opinion is a really spooky movie that is incredibly unpredictable and it&#39;s pretty strange! I recommend all horror fans to this movie!']
