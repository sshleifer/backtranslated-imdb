This western is done in a different way to most others. Realism is the key here. Conchata Farrell comes to Wyoming to work for Rip Torn on his ranch. How this is presented makes for a more interesting portion of Americana. I would have preferred to see this on the big screen instead of on a tape, but it's worth seeing what life was like in the real west. The cinematography is excellent. Solid 9. Torn and Farrell excel in this movie.
