I enjoyed the "Nemesis" by Albert Pyun for his cheesy action and his semi-complicated script. Many people complain about the "confusing" plot of the first film, which is probably the reason why "Nemesis 2: Nebula" has a plot like a rock plot with the same super action to carry it out. <br /> <br /> This gives the name of the hero of the first film, Alex, to a super woman wrapped up in the past to save the future. She is raised by a tribe in Africa. A good part of the film only has a dialogue in an African language without subtitles, which I liked because it made it seem something authentic (how often do movies of this genre try to do that?). It does not take long for the evil cyborgs to travel back in time to find her and try to kill her. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, this is a piece of shit (not that the first one was a great thing). There are subplots that involve Africa's political discontent, treasure hunting and tribal combat. The image is very short in the brain, so none of these things receives a very good treatment. The image is basically a prolonged fight with some persecutions that are reduced to muscle-baby vs. cyborg It has its entertainment value, just do not expect quality, or anything from the first movie.
