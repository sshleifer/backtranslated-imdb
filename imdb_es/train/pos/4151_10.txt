A time of condemnation is presented to give information to the Cold Case unit about the murder of a policeman, committed years before. The murder of Sean Cooper, a good cop, was never resolved. Naturally, detectives believe that the new evidence will help them put together all the pieces of the puzzle that frustrated their colleagues. <br /> <br /> In flashbacks, they take us to the baptism of James Bruno's baby. Sean and Jimmy were companions. There is tension when Sean, who is the godfather, arrives disheveled and late for the rite. Eileen Bruno does not seem happy to be there. The true mystery is revealed by her. She caught Sean, who was drinking with Jimmy in the backyard, kissed her husband and even more shocking, Jimmy responded voluntarily. <br /> <br /> Somehow, at the station, the partners became the center of the gossip. Sean has not fallen in love with his superior because he discovered the relationship with a criminal in his area that controlled the drug business. Sean realizes that this man is with the strong man of drugs because he always makes an excuse to release the garbage bags Sean and Jimmy bring to the station all the time. The pressure is too much for Jimmy. Sean feels comfortable in his homosexuality and wants to be honest about it. Cooper's own father does not want to have anything to do with a queer child. Even his superior McCree wants him out of his jurisdiction, but the case is complicated because Cooper comes from a long line of Irish men serving in the police force. Sean is murdered because of his homosexual condition and for knowing too much about his classmates' participation in making dirty money. <br /> <br /> Tom Petit wrote this honest description of the life of a police officer in the closet and his secret. Love with another police partner. We thought it was a frank account of a serious matter that nobody spoke of in those days. Sometimes people involved in the program, for fear of reprisals from sponsors or networks, do not dare to present these real situations. Jeannot Szwarc, shows a sensitive approach to this thorny issue, which is treated without the sensationalism that the case could have shown with a different team. <br /> <br /> There is a rare appearance of Chad Everett as Major Jimmy Bruno. His shot is right on target with a touch of sentimentality that does not get out of hand. Shane Johnson makes an excellent contribution to the show as Sean Cooper. The cast is wonderful and includes good performances by everyone under the direction of Mr. Szwarc. <br /> <br /> In this episode, Nick Vera, approaches his neighbor, the mother of the basketball player that the detective took his ball away Nick addresses the romance with the woman!
