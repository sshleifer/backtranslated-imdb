The performance of Kurt Russell, similar to that of a chameleon, along with the impeccable film making of John Carpenter, makes this, without a doubt, one of the best biographies of boob-tube ever issued. It holds, too: the emotional basis is strong enough so that it will never age; Carpenter has preserved for posterity the power and the maximum emotion of the life of the only King of Rock and Roll. (I had been a fan of Elvis most of my life, but it was not until I saw this amazing movie that I looked BEYOND the image of the man, it was a revelation). ELVIS is still one of the ten best films for television of all time.
