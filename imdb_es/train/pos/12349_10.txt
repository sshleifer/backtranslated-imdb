This movie just proves that it does not need big explosions, multi-billion dollar computer graphics or well-paid actors and actresses to make a good movie. All you need is an excellent plot and plot. that the master of all Japanese films, Akira Kurosawa brings out brilliantly. I recommend this movie to all those who love an epic piece of time. And for those who enjoy Kurosa, it was previous work. 10/10
