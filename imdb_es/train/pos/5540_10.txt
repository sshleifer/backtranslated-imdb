At first, this movie seems so bad that I almost fell into a trance the first time I saw it. It was like a bad dream. A cosmic hole. But I gave him a second chance, then another and another, etc. Finally I became addicted to this film, because it is a slow rhythm of dream, wonderful natural scenery, bathed by a soft autumnal light and especially by the musical score, which is composed of a bit of progressive rock of the 70s and exquisite songs popular of the actor / singer / composer. Derek Lamb (the troubadour). I should notice the song about hazel wood, silver trout and lady that disappears in the air ..., heard in the middle and near the end of the movie. There are some carnal scenes at the beginning, that allow us to appreciate the natural charms of Elizabeth Suzuki. If the film had been made by some directors of "repertoire" like Bergman, Lars Von Triers or Jean-Luc Goddard, the critics would have rolled on the floor, talking about that movie as if it were a cosmic masterpiece. Personally I think that this film is a million times higher than any of Fellini's cinematic film # Â¤ @ t! Definitely not for the pretentious.
