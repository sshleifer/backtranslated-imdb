Francesca Annis, Michael Kitchen And Robson Green !! Wow, what a threesome ... Okay, it's not Anna Karenina, but it's a good love story, very well written and well acted by everyone. Even some moments of "laughter out loud" mixed with some pretty serious observations about fidelity, age bias and aging of parents / Alzheimer's problems. br /> <br /> Although I've been a fan of Mrs. Annis 'since' Lillie '(in the 70's) and Kitchen's' The Buccaneers 'and' Enchanted April ', I recently discovered Mr. Green (' I and Mrs. Jones', 'Touching Evil', etc.), making me ask the question: why had not I seen 'Reckless' until recently? It is true that it is more of a "movie for girls" than of what a man feels, it is perfect for a rainy afternoon.
