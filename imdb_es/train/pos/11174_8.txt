Probably the most accurate adaptation of Stephen King so far. No wonder, since the same king wrote the script. The story follows the Creed family who moves to a beautiful Maine house. One of the other residents is Jud, a nice old man who knows some things about the area. One is the road that crosses its fa√ßade. The other is a road that leads to the Pet Sematary, where children for decades have buried the animals that died on the road. Very soon, Ellie Creed's cat, Church, is found dead. Fortunately, this happens while the family, with the exception of Louis (the father), is out for Thanksgiving. Jud takes Louis to another cemetery, beyond Pet Sematary, where the Church must be buried. Later, Louis is received (not so politely) by the Church. He has returned, apparently having left the bag in which he had been buried. Maybe he was buried alive. Maybe not. I can not say anything more without ruining the story. <br /> <br /> Of all the King adaptations I've seen, this would be the most terrifying. The characters are real and normal situations. Mary Lambert does a great job directing the procedures. The suspense remains quite high throughout the film, due in part to the development of the plot. The scene where Gage is killed will stay in your mind forever. Then, of course, we have the conclusion. It is easy to determine what will happen, but Lambert achieves some genuinely frightening and, at times, disturbing moments. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a good movie and an excellent adaptation. If you like to be scared and do not mind being chased by some images that bother you, then "Pet Sematary" is just what you're looking for. Fans not of Horror will want to avoid this.
