This is one of those movies that you always think about when you wake up the next morning. It will give you that warm and confused feeling and leave you with a smile on your face. <br /> <br /> Sure, we feed on the typical stereotypes of characters and stories, but the trick is: Entertain. <Br /> <br /> Being from Sweden and living in the United States for quite some time, it's funny how we react. "The morbid husband is going to kill him", "She (Gabriella) is going to die and then there will be a heartbreaking final bigger than life". We know how these things work, everything comes together in the end. And he did. The characters were something simple, they were so elaborate that you really did not think twice, nothing was left to your own imagination. Probably the closest one is Siv, it makes you wonder if she really was in love with Daniel, but that's all. <br /> <br /> But the film is beautiful, set in rural Norrland, the music is absolutely amazing and the characters are adorable. Michael Nyqvist is really great, with his unique and crazy looks, and Frida Hallberg is charming and approachable. Maybe a little too nice. <br /> <br /> But above all, this movie makes you feel, and that's the most important thing. You cry, you laugh, you hate and you identify. I do not know about you, but that does not happen so often.
