The deaf secretary Carla (Emmanuelle Devos) is harassed by her mean male colleagues. <br /> <br /> When they suggest that she needs an assistant, it seems to be the final insult, but when the first candidate is the ex-convict Paul (Vincent Cassel) she takes the opportunity to change her life. <br /> <br /> Carla covers her mistakes and he, eager to go directly, helps her scold her colleagues. <br /> <br /> When Paul asks Carla to return the favor, she finds herself trapped in the criminal underworld, ruled by the ruthless lone shark Marchand (Olivier Gourmet). <br /> <br /> Recognizing his ability to read his lips as a weapon that no one could have negotiated, the two set out to do justice. <br /> <br /> The third feature by French filmmaker Jacques Audiard "Lee mi labios" is a piece that challenges the genre, changing from a dark social comedy to a thriller at full speed. .
