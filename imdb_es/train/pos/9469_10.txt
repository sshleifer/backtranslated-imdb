There is a scene in Dan in real life where the family is competing to see which sex can finish the crossword first. The answer to one of the clues is Murphy's Law: anything that can go wrong will go wrong. This is exactly the case of Dan Burns (Steve Carell, the Office), a columnist for the local newspaper. Dan is an expert in giving advice for everyday life, but he realizes that things are not so perfect by themselves. Dan in real life is amazing in capturing these ironies of everyday life and succeeds in embracing the comedy, tragedy and beauty of them all. Besides this, this movie is very hilarious. <br /> <br /> The death of his wife forces Dan to raise his three daughters on his own ... every daughter in her key stages of life: the first anxious to prove her driver's license, the intermediate until her adolescent anguish phase, and the youngest one moved away from early childhood. They give things to Dan when he goes to Rhode Island for a family reunion and meets an intriguing woman at a bookstore. <br /> <br /> Her name is Marie (Juliette Binoche, Chocolat) and she is looking for a book to help her avoid uncomfortable situations ... which is precisely what is in store when they are thrown into the home of the Burns family. <br /> <br /> If you've seen Steve Carell in The Office or Little Miss Sunshine, he would know that he's incomparable with comedic time and also a tremendously dynamic actor. Steve Carell is amazing in capturing all the emotions that come with family life: sincere frustration and compassion. Both the family and the house itself provide a warm atmosphere for the film that contrasts the internal confusion that develops throughout the film and, finally, bursts into a rather suspenseful climax. The film only falls short in some of the predictable results, but at the same time life is composed of irony and predictability: that is an irony in itself. <br /> <br /> Dan in real life is definitely worth seeing for the sole enjoyment of seeing all the fun subtleties that we often miss in everyday life, and most likely enjoy it a second time, or even a third. Just "put it in my account."
