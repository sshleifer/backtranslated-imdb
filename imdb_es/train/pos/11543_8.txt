['Neil Simon has a lot of work, but it&#39;s the strange couple that brought him to fame. This movie really works. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthaw have great chemistry. The supporting cast for this movie is stellar too. <br /><br /> It is about 2 men who live together and are from opposite planets. The script bristles with humor of this situation. This had been done in some ways previously. This is the one that brings everything together in a very good package. <br /><br /> Simon has done another decent job, but this is really his best job that made the rest of his work possible. It&#39;s hard to imagine Simon ever getting over this.']
