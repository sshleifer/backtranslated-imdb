['I really like this movie. I can see it regularly and I do not get tired. I guess that&#39;s one of my criteria for a great movie. <br /><br /> The history is very interesting. It introduces us to 6 characters; Each one has a unique style of kung fu that is very secret and very deadly. Each of these characters is trained by the same teacher, but their identities are kept secret from each other. The dying teacher sends the sixth poison, his last student, to try to correct the errors he suspects some of his students have committed. <br /><br /> How will the last student find the other poisons? How will he know which of them is bad? The way these questions are answered is part of what makes this movie great. <br /><br /> We can also see the poisons fighting each other in each combination. It&#39;s fun to see how their styles match each other. <br /><br /> If you want to see if you like kung fu movies, this is a good movie to start with. There is nothing better than this.']
