Cinderella In my opinion, the best love story that has ever been told, I loved it as a child and I love it now. It's a wonderful Disney masterpiece. This is one of my favorite movies that I love Disney. I could talk and talk about Cinderella and Disney all day, but I will not give you a brief summary of the story. When the father of a young girl dies, she has to live with her evil mother and her half-sisters, equally ugly and unpleasant, Drusilla and Anastasia. Made to do corrective housework all day, poor Cinderella has only the little mice that run around the house and her dog Bruno as friends. When one day a letter is sent home, he tells all available women to attend a real dance. Cinderellas, the evil stepmother and stepsisters, try to avoid his assistance. Cinderella finally gets her dream and desire and can attend her captive beauty, generosity and beautiful nature that help her win her prince.
