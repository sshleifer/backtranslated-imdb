['It&#39;s a short film by David Lynch with only 8 minutes, but it has all the &quot;Lynchian ingredients&quot;! It is mysterious, dark, inconclusive, mysterious and strange; And before the blonde starts talking, it&#39;s a little scary! The soundtrack is exceptional to create this strange environment because it is also sinister and mysterious ... <br /><br /> On the stage itself, it does not have the &quot;traditional&quot; red curtains, but it has walls painted in purple, which give it an equally disturbing effect. <br /><br /> The plot is about a girl who is locked in a dark room and she asks for help; Then comes another girl who starts talking to her in a mysterious way, saying that she is there only because of her ... We do not know what happened or what will happen next ... it ended unsolved and disconcerting, since a good movie of Lynch must finish! <br /><br /> It&#39;s a great short, despite some amateur actors. The girls are professional actresses, but I think their performance could have been better in this short film.']
