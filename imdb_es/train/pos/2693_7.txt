Although the story is essentially routine, and the "surprise" ending is nothing more than a joke for the audience, you can see what attracted these good actors to the project: it offers them the kind of roles in which good actors can shine, and they shine they do it. The film is made impeccably - for its time. It was redone in the year 2000 as "Under suspicion" and if you just want to see a version of the story (that's all it deserves, really), I recommend the last one, with the updated address of Hopkins and the most explicit ones. references to points in the plot that the original could only suggest. The end, however, still blows. (** 1/2)
