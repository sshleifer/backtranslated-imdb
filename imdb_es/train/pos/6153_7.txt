The obvious parallels between the enchanting fantasy of Walt Disney Bedknobs and Broomsticks and C.S. Lewis Chronicles of Narnia are quite obvious. There are more coincidences here than comparing Bedknobs and Broomsticks with Mary Poppins, even though much of the same creative talent entered the two Disney films. <br /> <br /> Like The Chronicles of Narnia, it involves some English children leaving London. During the bombing and coming to live in the country. And those children have to deal with a world of magic. But unlike C. Lewis, the children of Rawlins have the magic to invade their world and help defeat people by making a mess in the here and now. Do not retreat to a fantasy realm like the Pevensie children. <br /> <br /> There's no heavy-duty Walt Disney philosophy here, except maybe it's not good to mess with witches, even apprentices like Angela Lansbury, who learn their magic from a Charlatan like David Tomlinson. Ms. Lansbury did not become one of the most profitable artists for nothing. She carries her own brand of magic that even Disney's special effects guys could not overcome. And they won an Oscar for the Magic Kingdom in that department for this movie. <br /> <br /> Two artists said goodbye to the films in Bedknobs and Broomsticks. Tessie O'Shea played her last role in this film, she received many films in the UK as one of her most beloved artists in the music hall. And that great actor, the actor Reginald Owen, as the retired general who leads the Old Home Guard in the war and in the songs, says goodbye to film audiences around the world. <br /> <br /> The team of Robert B. Sherman and Richard M. Sherman, who wrote the score for Mary Poppins, wrote a good and useful here. The Age Of Not Believing was nominated for an Oscar, but lost in the Theme from Shaft. Personally, although I like the homage of David Tomlinson to the most colorful street in London, Portabello Road. <br /> <br /> Bedknobs and Broomsticks is an excellent fantasy movie that still stays well after almost 40 years. Imagine what it would be like with computer-generated graphics.
