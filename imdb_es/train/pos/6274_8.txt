I went to see this movie with a group of friends one night. I really did not hear much about that. So I did not expect anything. But after seeing it, I liked it a lot. Nicolas Cage and the rest of the cast were very good. But I have to say that Giovanni Ribisi's performance needed a bit of enthusiasm. But such a small defect could be nullified. <br /> <br /> Gone In 60 Seconds is about a retired car thief who must drive 60 rare and exotic cars in one night to save his brother's life. The movie is not in any way predictable. So the ending should be a surprise. Do you think it's just another fast car driving movie? Well, you're partially right. There is much more about it. Everyone should take a look at this movie.
