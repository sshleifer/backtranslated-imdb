I need to be honest. I watched and enjoyed this show because it was rude, offensive, hilarious and obscene. Yes, there is a lot of humor for all tastes. If you like the humor that tries to make fun of people who fall off skateboards, for example, you'll have a great time. <br /> <br /> Or, if you enjoy people who are doing extreme things. Bad, you will also have a great time. And if you like scatological humor and extreme situations, you will enjoy the show. <br /> <br /> I enjoy the three types of humor that "Dirty SÃ nchez" offers. I like to laugh a lot with the situations of the show. "Jackass" is like a walk in the park compared to this one. So if you're tired of the typical American stupidity of Jackass, try the extreme English stupidity in this program. With due respect. <br /> <br /> This is a show that has little taste or class. It is not recommended for those who are offended or easily offended. <br /> <br /> Now, these guys need to see a psychologist. Especially the character paco.
