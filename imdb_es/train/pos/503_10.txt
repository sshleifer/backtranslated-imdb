After 7 years of seeing that terrible nonsense called Star Trek Voyager, I felt quite insensitive. Next Gen and DS9 were incredibly good things and Voyager ruined TV Trek. This opened with probably the best pilot for a Trek show. The team was really good, as well as the choice of actors for the parties. Scott Bakula played with a typical captain for the first time in deep space and his unpolished way of doing things was a refreshing change for the captains of those who already know everything. The rest of the team was very nice in their roles and I think they had a good first season. When the show was canceled prematurely, I was very disappointed. In A Mirror Darkly showed us what the cast was capable of. Too bad a movie or television movie was never considered. So much background story and foundation of the federation that remains to be counted, including the appearance of hostilities with the Klingons ..........
