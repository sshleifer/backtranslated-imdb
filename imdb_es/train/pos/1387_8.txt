A bit slow (somehow like a Sofia Coppola movie), but it's still a very captivating movie about the discovery of sexuality by three teenagers. The magic of the film lies in its ability to recover many memories of how it felt to be his age. Confusion and insecurities are represented in a very simple but very faithful to life. The music is perfect and the performance is incredible. The camera works very well too. I highly recommend it to those who are not afraid to look back to this particular period of life when we discover our sexual impulses and our desires. I would also say that it is a good movie for young people going through that period. There have been many films about adolescence, but this really captures the true essence of discovering the adult world of romance and its complexities.
