I had to give this movie a 10 simply because it did what so many movies released to the black audiences could not perform in a miserable way. This movie was empty of all the video slut clich√©s, and it also jumped on gangsters, rappers and rude language. He examined several relationships among physicians, African-Americans, and African-American male / female romantic relationships on a completely new and refreshing level. I was very impressed by the careful mixing of light humor with some rather difficult and heavy subjects. The movie will make you feel happy and sad at the same time. I also saw it at the Boston Film Festival. It premiered at AMC Loews Boston and I really hope this movie reaches a much wider audience. Black People (and ALL others) would LOVE a movie like this, if only the industry were SMART enough to publish them! <br /> <br /> As an extra, if you are a doctor, a resident, a medical student, a premedical student, married to a doctor, have a brother doctor, have a doctor in the family or know a great period Doctor, you would love this movie too. He portrayed residency and practice in a realistic way that was highly appreciated by the doctors, residents and medical students who watched the film. Dennis Cooper completely completed his residency in internal medicine, so he definitely applied his knowledge / experience to the film and that is very evident.
