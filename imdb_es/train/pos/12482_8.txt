I did not read anything other than good things about this movie and, finally, I had the opportunity to see it at the end of the night and it was everything I expected it to be and more. This is the way it should be a proper horror movie. I think the reason was so scary was because it was very realistic. The creepy sound score was perfect to create a dark environment. I liked the dramatic opening scene and I enjoyed how the rest of the film developed. It was very easy to follow and understand, unlike some movies that are too complicated. The special effects went very well. I'd love to see more horror movies like this one. This is easily one of my favorites. A thunderstorm and realistic lightning would have created a nice atmosphere for this movie. Also, I had all the elements a good horror. The needs of the movie. I recommend this movie to anyone who can appreciate a good scary movie that does not shoot. I will add it to my collection. The DVD has some interesting special features.
