['Hello everyone, my name is Larissa. I am 13 years old, when I was about 4 years old, I looked at Curly Sue and hit my socks. I&#39;ve been watching that movie for a long time, in fact, about 30 minutes ago, I just saw it. . Alisan porter is a very good actor and I love that movie. It&#39;s so funny when she&#39;s handing out the cards. Every time I see that movie at the end of it, I cry, it tells me that I know I&#39;m only 13, but it&#39;s such a moving story that it&#39;s very strange that Alisan is now 25 years old. Every time I watch a movie, someone is always young and the movie comes out about a year after I made it, and when you see it and you discover the age of the person in the movie you are really more telling how they can move from one age to the next . following. Like Harry Potter. That movie was great too, but still Daniel was about 12 years old in the first film and I was about 11. So, how could I go from 12 to 16 in about 4 years and I&#39;m only 13? I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m 16 now, I think it&#39;s almost 18 years old, but that&#39;s kind of weird when you watch a movie and in the next there&#39;s about 4 years, then when they only had 1 in the last one. I&#39;m not sure I have a great imagination and I like to bust it. I am a computer person but I also like to do many things as children. I&#39;m very smart as curly dreams in the film, but one thing I do not like about the movie is when that guy calls the host house and makes the curly disappear that would kill that guy if he really had done it in real life. . Well, I&#39;m going to stop writing. I know that sometimes I write a lot, but children have a lot in their heads that they need to go out and, if they do not, children will never learn. <br /><br /> Larissa']
