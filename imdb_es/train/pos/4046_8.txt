Rohmer returns to his historical dramas in the true story of Grace Elliot, an Englishwoman who stayed in France during the apex of the French Revolution. One always suspected that Rohmer was a conservative, but that he knew that he was a reactionary of so much blood. If you can set aside Rohmer's brazen defense of the monarchy (and that's not an easy thing to do, since, for example, the French lower classes present themselves here as loathsome disgusting ones), this is actually an elegant movie , smart and polished. . Lacking the money for a great cinematographic recreation of the eighteenth century in France, Rohmer has instead the actors who play against the obvious painted cartons. It's a blatantly artificial concept, but it somehow works. And the newcomer, Lucy Russell, manages to sympathize with a character that should not be.
