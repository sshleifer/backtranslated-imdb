Read Eric's review again. He perfectly described my own feelings for this film more eloquently than ever. I only write here to encourage you to look for it and see it. <br /> <br /> I saw him many years ago on television, I think the IFC. It is a film so unique that I hesitate to make comparisons. It was filmed in northern Mexico, somewhere in the relentless wastelands of Coahuila / Zacatecas / San Luis Potosí. This is not the style of Sedona, Durango, Mexico (from the John Wayne movies), but a truly wild and wild place. I have to find the novel now to verify the original location of the story. Like the location, this movie is strange, wild, wonderful, rare and absolutely not for everyone. It's the kind of production that almost motivates me to study film. <br /> <br /> I had not really forgotten this movie, it's indelible. However, over the years, I had forgotten about its existence. I do not know anyone who has seen it, never read it, nor seen any reference to it. Erendira is such an unusual name, he had even forgotten the title. Well, I'll be looking to buy a copy now. <br /> <br /> ** Since the previous publication became a great Gabriel García Márquez fan and I regret not having read it before. <br /> <br /> Regarding the comment of MsMyth below; The film was filmed in Mexico, but the author is Colombian and did not comment on the history of Mexico or Mexico, although Márquez now lives in Mexico for "political" reasons. This story is universal. <br /> <br /> I am still trying desperately to find a copy of this movie for my library. I liked the movie? You have to read the story and then everything else García Marquz wrote. And, by the way, the original location in the story was Colombia.
