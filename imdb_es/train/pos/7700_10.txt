This was one of those offers of $ .50 cents of yesteryear and much more complex than most realize, and it was in color! not only the effects are extraordinary, vs. the shit like 'the earth against the flying saucers' --- the real 'killer' is the 'universality of the plot' --- it all depends on two principles --- the old concept of a father's desire for incestuous thinking hidden for his daughter, and the idea of ​​what would happen if the technology of a world reached the point where all the wishes of citizens manifest themselves. <br /> <br /> It goes without saying that all of us who wish to die are dying, not many, if there are any, and that became the destiny of the "forbidden" population of the planet, quite modern, actually. unfortunately, the 'gear' of 'The Krell', wasted by ignorance, remains, and 'Morpheus', the incestuous father, knows how to access that technology, and does so, to avoid losing his daughter to another. old plot, beautifully represented. <br /> <br /> and considering its age, it's still an amazing suspense, action, human emotion, classic and visually very modern, do not let it pass: -It's foreshadowing all modern science fiction --- and its psychological content elevates it, beyond any genre --- a timeless work --- <br /> <br /> and sound! you will not see / hear any pure "synthesizer" and a thoroughly prepared Moog background --- a 'do not miss' ---
