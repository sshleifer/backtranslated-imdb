Personally, I think the film was made in a very professional way, I loved the choreography and the acting. The plot is also exciting and mysterious. The film itself is very emotional, and what I liked most about it is that it makes you think later. Antonio Gades has lived absolutely his role until the end, and I must say that it is one of my favorite photos and that Saura is a wonderful director.
