William Powell is a doctor who deals with murder and an ex-wife in "The Ex-Mrs Bradford," also starring Jean Arthur, Eric Blore and James Gleason. It seems that Powell had chemistry with almost any woman he was associated with. Although he and Myrna Loy were the perfect match for the screen, the actor made a couple of other films like "Thin Man", one with Ginger Rogers and this one with Arthur, both with very good results. <br /> <br /> Somehow you never get tired of seeing Powell as an ingenious and elegant professional and "The former Mrs. Bradford" is no exception. The ex-lady. B has Mr. B with a child support summons and then goes back to help him solve a mystery in which she has dragged him. And this is not the first time he does it! It almost seems as if there was a "Bradford" movie before this one or that it was the first in a series of movies. Mr. B complains that his former mystery writer leads him constantly to cases. This time, a rider who rides the favorite horse on a climb mysteriously falls off the horse and dies just before the finish line. <br /> <br /> The solution of the case is somewhat extravagant, but it is not the point. The point is the joke between the couple and the interference of the former Mrs. B. Jean Arthur is quite glamorous in his role and very funny. However, with an actress who is as smart as Arthur, humor seems intentional rather than stressful. I suspect that the writer had something else in mind, for example, the crazy side of Carole Lombard. When Arthur hears that the police have arrived, she says, "Oh, it's probably about my alimony, I've been waiting for the police to take a hand on this," it's more a rib for Powell than a serious statement. It still works well, and shows how a good actress can make a part of herself. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing, as William Powell and Jean Arthur always were.
