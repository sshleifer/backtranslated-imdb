Last year we were invited to two films about Truman Capote writing the book that made this movie: Capote and Infame. <br /> <br /> I can not imagine a movie like this in 1967. A raw, powerful and brutal chilling drama; Elevated to the status of a film classic by the magisterial direction of Richard Brooks (Elmer Gantry, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, The professional, Blackboard Jungle). <br /> <br /> It's interesting that Robert Blake, who starred in this movie, has had so many problems lately that may be related to his interpretation of a killer in this movie. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that stays with you after watching it.
