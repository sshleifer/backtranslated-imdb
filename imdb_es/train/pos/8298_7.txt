Better than the typical movie made for television, INVITATION TO HELL is blessed with an excellent casting (Urich, Lucci, Cassidy, McCarthy, Joe Regalbuto pre-Murphy Brown, Soleil Moon-Frye) and a high-concept update of the Faustian plot family. . Urich is nice as always and Lucci is particularly attractive and diabolically exaggerated in the mother of all the roles of fatal woman. As a hybrid version of STEPFORD WIVES and THEY LIVE, the film is committed early with its apocalyptic vision of Miltonesque and the horror fans will probably not have many complaints until the soppy documentary, maudlin arrives. 7/10
