['Where the Sidewalk Ends is a good crime drama of black film and is well filmed in black and white and also in the place. <br /><br /> A debt collector accidentally kills a guy suspected of murder and to protect himself, covers it and blames it on someone who does not like to have committed many crimes in the past. But towards the end, he realizes but not before falling in love with a woman he knows and who is the lover of the person he killed ... <br /><br /> The cast includes Dana Andrews (While the city sleeps, The curse of the devil), Gene Tierney (Laura, The ghost and Mrs. Muir), Gary Merrill (Mysterious island), Karl Malden (The streets of San Francisco, Beyond the adventure of Posidon) and Craig Stevens (The Deadly Mantis). Good parts of everyone. <br /><br /> It&#39;s worth taking a look at where the sidewalk ends if you have the opportunity. Excellent. <br /><br /> Rating: 3 stars out of 5.']
