['I saw &quot;Brother&#39;s Shadow&quot; at the Tribeca Film Festival and I found myself thinking about it two days later. The story of a prodigal son (Scott Cohen) who returns to his family&#39;s custom furniture business after a stint in prison offers all the necessary qualities of a solid drama: memorable characters; sharp dialogue, observer; Sensitive use of the camera by a filmmaker who thinks visually. <br /><br /> But more than that, it presents something that is very rare in the multiplex these days: the intransigent vision of a mature sensibility. The talent of the director and screenwriter Todd S. Yellin seems to emerge in full force, but we have the feeling that he (like his protagonist) has paid his dues. He knows how real people struggle in this world, and knows how we long to see, or at least indirectly experience, success. However, Yellin respects his audience too much to blow happy smoke through our back doors. In the end, we see that Jake&#39;s triumph is not in the commissions, not even in the esteem of his family, but in &quot;the work&quot; he could not give up if he tried. <br /><br /> It is an essential issue in a world (and especially in a film industry) that can not rise above the &quot;bottom line&quot;. This movie deserves a wide audience.']
