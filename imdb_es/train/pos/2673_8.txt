The Journey of Hope (1990) is about a journey that many nomadic and poor Turks make in order to live the good life in Switzerland. These people are as desperate to live as Westerners who will give up their lives in an attempt to reach the promised land. Many of them are scammed by greedy scammers who make a living charging huge fees to desperate people who find themselves in a situation of not winning. A family defies the cold, the treacherous mountain range and the predatory criminals only to discover that there is not always a bright white light at the end of the tunnel. This problem exists throughout the world, not just in the United States. Some people tend to forget that. A heartthrob of a movie that will leave you wondering why in the end. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
