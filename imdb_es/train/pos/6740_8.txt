The completely rounded character of the main role of this film, the one of the policeman torn by his past and in a path of self-destruction so clear to the spectator, is unique in his time, 1950. <br /> <br /> Along with music Disturbing and well written plot, the film is an excellent example of black cinema at its best. The close-ups of Dana's eyes reveal the inner anguish, Karl Malden stands out as his boss, who does not admit nonsense but also has compassion for those under his command in the room. <br /> <br /> Otto Preminger made this kind of film almost alone. If there is any failure, it would be with the amazing beauty of Gene Tierney, who seems strangely out of place with the hardened police. His scenes in the cafe, however, are wonderful and sound true. <br /> <br /> Tom Tully, in the small part of his father, is perfect, just like Gary Merrill as the hood. Great lighting and ambience. The building where the deadly events are highly atmospheric, I love the old woman in the basement. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10.
