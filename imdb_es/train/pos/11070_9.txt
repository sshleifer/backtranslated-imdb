I just finished watching this movie and I can honestly say that this is a work of art. I was very surprised to see the overall rating as 5.2. <br /> <br /> Guy not only gathers a list of films from the list (ish) and turns them into such glorious characters, but he has also given us a movie with a fantastic A diverse story that has much to do with imagination. <br /> <br /> There are too many people who want films with a plot that can be understood and delivered to a plate ... however, these are films that make critics worse because they are too predictable. <br /> <br /> This movie is special. Get it now!
