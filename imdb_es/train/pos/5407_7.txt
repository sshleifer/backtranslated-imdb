I've always liked Pokemon movies. Yes, I know, they are all very cheesy, mediocre in certain areas and safe, although they are aimed at young children, they are too adult in some fields to be able to protect them with the statement: "Hey, lighten up, it's a movie for kids, "but other than that, are not they still good entertainment pieces? In my opinion, they are like that and I enjoy them a lot. This is as nice as the previous three, and certainly more cute. It has some really sweet and touching moments, since it is the introduction of the adorable and fresh Pokémon Celebi. It is not the best Pokémon movie, but I enjoy it more than the third installment, although the third is not bad, and the whole series is entertaining, harmless, fun for the popcorn family and should be considered nothing more , nothing less. This film has some high marks of intensity and interest, especially around the climax / end, like all deliveries, and the characters, although a little more lackluster than the previous three, I thought, are still nice and funny. This film is the lowest and the most criticized of the four adaptations of length of feature film, and it does not deserve it.
