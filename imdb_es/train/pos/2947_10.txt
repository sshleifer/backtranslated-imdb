If you have not seen this, you do not know what you're missing. The first time you do it, you will literally feel pain in the floor vomiting from laughing so hard, and probably having wet yourself too. <br /> <br /> That's funny. There has not been a single comedic performance until this date when I've seen it go over or even come close. So many classic liners, stories and segway ... <br /> <br /> Uncle drunk at the barbecue, Gi Joe, Mr. T, goony goo, ice cream man, you say any of these things to anyone who has seen this I will bet you dollars on the donuts, you will not be able to keep a serious face and you will burst out laughing, or you will recite the rest of the dialogue of the act. <br /> <br /> Pure classic! Too bad you can not get it on DVD ... <br /> <br /> Rating 10+ out of 10
