This is a comedy as it once was and comparing this with the two remakes, THE MONEY PIT and ARE WE DONE TOWET ?, Just points out still more how the filmmakers of the 40s had a talent for comedy that since then, unfortunately , has been lost. <br /> <br /> I was 15 years old when I first saw him and even at that tender age, there was a lot I could laugh at. Now that I am familiar with the frustrations of adults, I see many things that I missed when I was young. <br /> <br /> The three main actors ... Cary Grant, Myrna Loy and Melvyn Douglas ... interacted perfectly, but the core of the film lies in the frustrations encountered to achieve a dream. It is never so easy and it is free of invisible complications as one imagines. <br /> <br /> In short, this is a classic comedy that is still above the attempts to remake it.
