I do not know the stars, nor the modern Chinese teenage music, but I do know a very entertaining movie when I see it. <br /> <br /> Kung Fu Dunk is pure Hollywood in its values: it is played to laugh, to love, and it is a great combination of Kung Fu and basketball. <br /> <br /> It seems that everyone had a lot of fun doing this, the production values ​​are excellent, and modern China looks brighter than Los Angeles here. <br /> <br /> The plot of the abandoned orphan growing up in a kung fu school only to be expelled and then discovering the superstar as a basketball game (and love and more, etc.) is great. This is new. fun, and immensely entertaining. <br /> <br /> With great action and good dialogue, this is just to enjoy, for all ages, and for our money it was one of the best family movies we've seen in a long time. . <br /> <br /> Please ignore the negative reviews and give Dunk a chance, we are very glad we did, a GOOD sports comedy movie.
