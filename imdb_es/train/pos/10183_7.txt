This is probably Karisma at its best, apart from Zubeidaa. Nana Patekar also gives her best, without even trying. The story is very good at times, but in the end it seems to drag, especially when Shahrukh appears in the picture. What I really liked were the actions of the contacts, the delivery of dialogue and history, for what it was. It could have been better directed, and edited. The support case was even excellent, including Karima's mother-in-law, although she only had a brilliant moment, it was great to see her. <br /> <br /> The sets were also pretty good. I really did not like his representation of a Canadian family, but once they enter India, it is as real as possible. <br /> <br /> In general, I would give a thumbs up!
