The main reason to see this movie is Warren William, who is in top form as the shyster campaign manager. It is electric, and constantly finds ways to deceive the public and defeat the opposing party in the midst of major disasters. William is a great actor. I feel he never deserved it. Bette Davis as her girlfriend also shines in a little written paper. Personally, I found Guy Kibbee not quite right as the candidate that William and the others are trying to impose on the public. It looked more like an empty canvas than a person. I would have preferred to see a real character emerge instead of a non-character. The story itself is implausible, silly and clich√©. But it's worth watching Warren William and Bette Davis.
