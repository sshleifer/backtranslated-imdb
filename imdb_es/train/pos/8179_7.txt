This would have been a lot of fun to see in a theater, in 1996. There's a guilty pleasure corner in my cinematic taste that really appreciates the well-made shocking movies. <br /> <br /> "The Dentist" is sometimes criticized because people often have strong feelings about dental issues. Maybe the ADA launched a campaign against it, since dentists report that they have to apologize for this movie and for "The Marathon Man" (which only has one scene comparable to "The Dentist"). <br /> <br /> It is surprising to note that, according to the trivia page, the film was filmed in 21 days. Of course, post-production may take longer than filming, and the "The Dentist" edition is perfect. The fast cuts increase the tension so much that in the scene where the dentist "takes care" of his wife, there are only two quick cuts that show what is happening. The rest is left to our very fertile imaginations! Corbin Bernsen was a good choice for the role, since he has a lot of experience in the psychological interpretation of "strange" characters and completely sold the obsessive and compulsive aspects of the dentist. <br /> <br /> For me, the pace of the movie was just Right. The filmmakers reveal the wickedness of the wife in the right way. All the characters in the dental office look like real people working in a real office. There is a lot of tension while dealing with impatient people waiting for the arrival of the dentist. Meanwhile, the dentist is on the cusp of a great psychotic crisis. Unlike so many films of this genre, the script is very tight. All victims fall into the dentist's trap in a very calculated manner. Two types of law enforcement officers even get involved in a small secondary plot that ends up creating a commotion of a confrontation near the end. <br /> <br /> Definitely not for the faint of heart or for the dental, but for a true roller coaster. and highly recommended for fans of smart gorefests.
