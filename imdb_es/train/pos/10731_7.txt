I realize that it seems that in the DVD version missing scenes or lines between the publication of the FRF and the launch. <br /> <br /> They must show that they can earn the right to sit in the FRF in addition to the green team. <br /> <br /> Another scene is like during his failure in the simulation, Kevin gets to Joaquin. to repress. <br /> <br /> I think the VHS edition other than ABC could have all the things that are missing. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, I would like to know what version of DVD has the missing things. <br /> <br /> The DVD that I have seen feels edited for television.
