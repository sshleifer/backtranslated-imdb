I never saw it on TV, but I rented the DVD through Netflix as soon as I discovered it was available. I had high expectations, and I was not disappointed. It's fun, and the animation is excellent. That level of quality that I would have only expected from feature films, so I am surprised by some of the negative comments about him. Maybe the release of the DVD has improved the animation? An additional advantage of the DVD is that it was fun to watch both versions of the pilot. I am an adult, and I really appreciate it for adults. Not only children like cute animated characters. It is not far from being "obscene", as some have claimed, but I can see where some parents would not want their young children to see it. I am very disappointed that it was canceled. I would like them to produce more episodes. Or maybe a movie.
