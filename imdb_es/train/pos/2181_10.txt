<br /> <br /> Artistically filmed, the actors accurately portray their role. You have the real feeling of seeing Lucienne ascend from poverty to the most beautiful girl there is. A sense of tragedy to triumph again to tragedy. In general, I've seen this movie at least 10 times. And I can very well say that Prix De Beute '(the Beauty Award, Miss Europe) is one of my favorites in my collection of silent films. The expressiveness of Louise Brooks is perfect and I recommend this film to ANYONE who appreciates artistic beauty along with a tragic story.
