This is a very gloomy, forceful, even brutal film about a death row break that goes wrong. It is black and white photography prevents it from being dated. Mickey Rooney is excellent as the twisted leader, but strangely sympathetic. One of the first films that portrays the psychological desolation of death row. It is also quite moving.
