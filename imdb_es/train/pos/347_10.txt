Valentine is now one of my favorite Slasher movies. The scenes of death are elaborate and most of the acting is good. Marley Shelton did very well as a female lead (much better than Jennifer Love Hewitt in the "I Know ..." movies). David Boreanaz, who is the main reason why I saw this movie, had a fairly small role, but he interpreted it well. The exception to the list of good actors is Denise Richards. She was horrible in this. The only scene in which I was glad to see her was in * SPOILER * her death scene. All in all, it's a good movie to watch. You should definitely see this before seeing "Scream" or "I Know ..." again.
