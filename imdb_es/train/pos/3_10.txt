"Everyone is a stage and their people participate in it," or something like that. Who the hell said the theater stopped at the orchestra pit, or even at the theater door? Why does not the audience participate in the theatrical experience, including the story itself? <br /> <br /> This movie was a great experiment that said: "Hey, the story is you and it needs more than your attention, it needs your active participation". "Sometimes we bring you the story, sometimes you have to go to the story." <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, nobody listened, but that does not mean that it should not have been said.
