This was one of the favorites of my childhood. I remember seeing him on TV and getting excited every time. Now that I have grown up and I have a son of mine, I wanted to introduce you to this classic movie. We saw him last Friday, and he liked it. During Abu's fight with the giant spider, my son's hand crawled and took mine; I was really scared. "Will you beat the spider, dad?" Just look, you'll see. It has no historical frame of reference (eight years), so Baghdad, under the grandson of Haroun al-Raschid, could also be Oz under Ozma. <br /> <br /> I think he especially liked the amount of heroics and the derring-do were perpetrated by the thief-child, and not by the adult king. In fact, if you deconstruct a little the narrative of the film, the king is the companion of the thief, not the hero at all, which must be very satisfying for imaginative and adventurous young people. <br /> <br /> It is definitely a piece of the era. I suspect that by the time I'm eleven or twelve, my son will find it "corny" or the word that the next generation will use by then. The love story is only one-dimensional, as a cynical friend commented: "Why Ahmad loves the princess? Because the narrative demands it." Abu's willingness to put himself in danger (repeatedly) by the dispossessed and deposed deposed king is equally unlikely. But if we argue about these things while accepting flying mechanical horses, the fifty-foot geniuses and the All-Seeing Eye Temple would be foolish in the extreme. The satisfaction of seeing the prophecy fulfilled at the climax of the film is tremendous, as is the final shot of Abu flying triumphantly over his magical (stolen) carpet, in search of "some fun and adventure at last!"
