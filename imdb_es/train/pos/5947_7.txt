With 50 years, this fantasy musical comedy could be his age, but he uses it with dignity. <br /> <br /> This movie is still very funny. Crosby was never really the romantic lead material, but he delivers the material with the slightly humorous touch he needs. Bendix plays wide and is very funny in a part that resorts to his strengths. Hardwicke, how joyous it is for a gentleman of the kingdom, a genuine one, to throw himself into this kind of thing with so much abandonment. And Rhonda Fleming has fun in less showy leading roles. Only Murvyn Vye disappoints an unconvincing Merlin. <br /> <br /> Although it is not a musical, the songs are very good, and the "dance" routine that accompanies Busy Doing Nothing is perfect: fun, appropriate, skillful without being challenging. and making a virtue of the musical movement of Crosby that, let's be fair, was intrinsically funny because it is never his greatest strength. <br /> <br /> The color is fine, the sound is a bit muddy in some places. <br /> <br /> And the story - well, you take some liberties with the original, but I suspect that Mr. Clemens might have been pleased with the result.
