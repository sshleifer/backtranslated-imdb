['I see movies to make a living, selecting which ones are good enough to distribute ... Leaving aside those that do not make the cut. I&#39;m not saying that I know more than anyone, based on this, I&#39;m just teaching you how I came to see &quot;The Gospel of Lou&quot; ... Anyway ... Many bad movies land on my desk and I actually feel like through all of them. Actually, I do not &quot;see&quot; everything, I usually only watch television from time to time as I analyze the production value, the performance and how well the story is presented. If something catches my attention, I&#39;ll take the time to see it. &quot;Lou&quot; attracted me during the first few minutes where I closed my laptop and put my chair on the TV to be able to tune in completely. Needless to say, it captivated me throughout the film. The story is well told, the characters are attractive or repulsive (depending, of course, on the intention of the actor and the director) and are very well interpreted. Sometimes I spot occasional amateur mistakes in the work and editing of the camera, but the emotional nature of the story makes these faults easy to dismiss. I have heard the comments of other people who say that sometimes the film filled their eyes with tears, sometimes with extreme joy ... I laughed a minute and I cried the next and this movie moved me incredibly. Unfortunately I could not buy it because, as the saying goes, a week was missing and a dollar was missing. That&#39;s how it is sometimes ... but at least I had the pleasure of seeing this and I can not wait to see what kind of response it receives. Good luck and great fortune for you, Bret Carr (if you read this), you are undoubtedly a talent to consider.']
