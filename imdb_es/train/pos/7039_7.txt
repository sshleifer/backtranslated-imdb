War Inc. is a funny but strange movie. The actors are nice, the movie is also nice, but I do not know how to describe the plot. I will enter the plot later. This is a movie with some strange casting options. Besides John Cusack as a hitman, we saw years ago at Grosse Point, which I liked. <br /> <br /> Here we have Hilary Duff playing a Russian pop star named Yonica Babyya or something like that. Your character is strange. There is a scene where a scorpion gets into his pants. And hit Hauser (Cusack). There is a turn at the end that involves the two characters. Makes sense. <br /> <br /> That's the only launch option I'm going to do. Because it's just weird. The whole movie is strange. But sometimes it's incredibly funny and I never got bored. Here we have some of the best actors out there. Excluding Miss Duff. She is not great But here we have John Cusack, Marisa Tomeii, Joan Cusack, Ben Kingsley. See what I mean? <br /> <br /> This is the story of a hit man named Hauser (Cusack). He is sent to a Middle Eastern city to hit an oil tanker named Omar Sheriif (not the actor). While trying to deal with his own personal problems, he has to help the wedding of a pop star (played by Hilary Duff). And he falls in love with a reporter (played by Marisa Tomeii). However, there is one thing about the pop star. Hauser is disgusted by her. There is a scene in which she is singing a song to him and then he vomits. <br /> <br /> The spin at the end of the movie reveals something of why. What happens with the turn is that I saw it coming. But that does not matter. This is a strange, funny and entertaining comedy. I love most of the actors. So, really, how could I not recommend it? <br /> <br /> War, Inc .: 3.5 / 5
