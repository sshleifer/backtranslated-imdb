['Seriously, can you imagine a lot of talent in a movie without a big budget: Daniel Day-Lewis, Ray McAnally, Brenda Fricker, Hugh O&#39;Conor and Fiona Shaw? There is no doubt that Fricker and Day-Lewis deserved their awards: but it would have been totally justifiable to have seen O&#39;Conor (as Young Christie) and McAnally awarded: the clich√© is true here: they do not play roles, they live in them Performance Day-Lewis is a tour de force, a transformation that is impressive, but it was really a mark of the Academy&#39;s intelligence that along with this performance, they also honored Brenda Fricker&#39;s beautifully restrained, motionless and moving work as the mother of christie. By the way, if you have not seen this magnificent actress in &quot;Swann&quot;, that is another film that is worth seeing for her contribution (and the sublime Miranda Richardson).']
