['Deathtrap gives you a turn every turn, every turn, in fact, your biggest problem is that there are so many twists that you never really get oriented in the movie, and that often does not make any sense, although they usually catch you. you by surprise The story is very good, except for the fact that it has so many twists. The script is very good with a great dialog and characters, but you can not capture all the development due to the turns. The performances of Caine in particular are incredible. The address is very good, you can direct Sidney Lumet. The visual effects are fair, but most of them are really in a work and are false. It twists a lot, but it still works and it&#39;s worth seeing.']
