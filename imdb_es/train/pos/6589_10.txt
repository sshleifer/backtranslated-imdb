['I loved this program since it was broadcast for the first time, and I always expected to see every episode every week. The plot, the characters, the writing, the special effects were outstanding! Then, the science fiction channel again shit and canceled a very entertaining and well written program. I say bring it back, I know all the actors would come back. I would suggest buying the DVD, I am. I hope that executives of science fiction channels receive news of these comments and realize that they need to get more involved with their viewers. Now I only see one program on that channel, (Ghost Hunters), but I&#39;m pretty sure they&#39;ll cancel it soon.']
