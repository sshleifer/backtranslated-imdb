Apart from the delivery of wood by Susan Hayward throughout this film, it was as good as any biblical film made. Henry King handles this film with the respect of an epic in all the small scenes, and Peck is, as always, impeccable. Alfred Newman's poignant sound score, with the poignant twenty-third psalm, is unforgettable even after so many years. The scene with Goliath is a bit of the hokey side, but not so badly done by the time this movie was made. This goes well together with the minor biblical epics of the day, "The Song of Ruth" and "Esther and the King." It's worth seeing, and Raymond Massy is excellent as the prophet Nathan. The film is completed by the ever-good James Robertson Justice as Abishai and Jayne Meadows as Michol, David's first wife.
