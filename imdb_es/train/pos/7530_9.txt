This is, so to speak, a sequel to batman the animated and is almost as good as for all the same reasons why it has a lot of action. The story is good. The voice over the actors is really good, like Kevin. Conroy as a batman, Mark Hamil as a Joker, etc. The villains are really good, like The Joker, Two-face, Catwoman, Clayface, etc. So I'm sure you will not be disappointed with Batman's new adventures because it's really good. So be sure to watch it on TV or rent or buy the collector's edition because it's really good. <br /> <br /> Overall score: ********* of ****** **** <br /> <br /> **** out of *****
