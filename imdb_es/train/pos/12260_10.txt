This is an excellent start to the film career of Mickey Rooney. His talent here shows that a long career is ahead for him. The pursuit of cars and trucks is exciting for the 1937 era. This beginning of the Andy Hardy series is an American treasure in my book. The performance of Spring Byington is excellent as always. Please, Mr. Rooney or the owners of the movie rights, take a chance and do this on DVD. I think it would be a winner.
