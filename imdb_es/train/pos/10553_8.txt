... that this ;-) What would happen if Terry Gilliam and Douglas Adams had worked together in a movie? This film begins with a touch of Brazil ... when, at a certain point, the story moves directly to the penumbra area ... without showing anything new, but nothing ... and nothing is very funny! When Dave and Andrew begin to explore their new surroundings, the movie becomes really nice ... bouncing heads? Well ... yes ;-) <br /> <br /> anyway ... this movie was, imho, the biggest surprise at this year's FantasyFilmFest ... <br /> <br /> Like that in Cube and Cypher Natali gave him a minimalist design, strange but very special, which makes it difficult to locate the place of the story or its moment ... in some way timeless ...
