Jimmy Stewart and Anthony Mann came together to make some of the best westerns ever made and this is one of the best. <br /> <br /> The real star of the film, however, is the spectacular Canadian Rockies that serves as a backdrop for the story. Part of the best cinematography ever made in the history of cinema. <br /> <br /> In the five westerns that Stewart and Mann did together, the supporting roles were perfectly chosen. There is no exception here, even in parts that may have only a few lines, the characters are firmly engraved with those lines. <br /> <br /> Stewart is a cynical and lonely loner in this movie whose only true friend is hers. The companion Walter Brennan. It is the death of Brennan at the hands of the villains that makes him want to finally liberate the gold settlement from the bad guys and, by the way, redeem himself in the process. <br /> <br /> John McIntire is the main villain of the piece and he was an unappreciated actor with a wide range. He could play old coders, authority figures and, in this case, a particularly nasty and cunning villain. <br /> <br /> One of the best westerns in history.
