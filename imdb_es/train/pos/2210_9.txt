I can not believe how many people hate Hal Sparks! He was my favorite show host, no doubt. I hate celebrity gossip and, in general, I do not like talk shows, but when Hal Sparks organized Talk Soup, I had to watch TV for me. I rarely missed an episode during his career, and I was sad when the guest hosts started arriving (although most of the guests still did a good job). <br /> <br /> Anyway, for all the people who do not like Hal Sparks, I imagine that they should never have seen the weekend specials. They were one-hour Talk Soup episodes, which comprised the best clips of the week, and were filled with comedy sketches. The original bits that Hal Sparks did were hilarious. In one of them, a demon of bad comedy possessed it, and in a scene like that of an exorcist, his head turned when he told jokes about airline food. An episode was dedicated to mock Multiplicity, as a group of Hal Sparks cloned multiplied throughout the episode, surpassing the study. <br /> <br /> Okay, maybe these do not sound so funny when you describe them, but all I know is that besides Talk Soup, the only other two shows I saw constantly during those years were The Simpsons and Late Night with Conan O'Brian. So, if you like the comedy styles of those shows, then you probably like Talk Soup during the Sparks years. <br /> <br /> That said, Henson and Tyler were also excellent hosts. The three hosts brought something different to the table, but in my opinion they were all good comedians. Of course, throughout the years of guest stars and Tyler, my interest in this show began to wane, but from time to time I see The Soup, the spiritual successor of the program, and the new host can provoke some unexpected laughs on time. <br /> <br /> Well, I've wasted a lot of time talking about a TV show that is no longer on the air and in a channel that I generally despise. Go see something else!
