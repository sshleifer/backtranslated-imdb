I have to agree with most of the other messages. Was it a comedy? A drama? For me he leaned a bit too much towards the side of comedy. It could have been a great movie without the comedy and it was horribly contrived. Jamie keeps running to Julio and what his name is. In New York, how many times do you meet someone you know in downtown Cleveland? And how could Robert Pastorelli unearth the Yankee Stadium to hide the gold. Again, a comedy or drama? But it was still entertaining especially for a Sunday morning. I enjoyed the performance of Kimberly Elise, she is undoubtedly a beautiful actress and seems to take her job seriously. She is a younger actress who is going to be viable.
