I've always been a big fan of "Homicide: Life On The Street", so when I heard a reunion movie was coming, I could not wait. <br /> <br /> Let me tell you that I was not disappointed at all. It was one of the 2 most powerful television hours I've seen. It was great to see everyone again, but the greatest pleasure of all was to have Andre Braugher back, because the relationship between Pembleton and Bayliss was always the strongest part of a great show all together.
