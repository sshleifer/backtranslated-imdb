I think most people do not seem to have the correct idea of ​​the movie, at least that's my opinion. I'm not sure it's a movie about drug abuse; rather it is a film about the way of thinking of these geniuses brothers, drugs are side effects, something marginal. Again, it is not a commercial film that is seen every day and if the author wants it, it definitely fails, since most people think it is one of the many movies related to drugs. I, however, believe that something else is the case. As in many films that represent different cultures, the audience generally fully understands the films that represent their own culture, that is, something that they have grown up with and are very familiar with. This movie is to show what people "genius" think very often and the problems they face. The reason they act like this is because they are bored with their minds :) They have to meet people who do mediocre things and accept those things as if they were launching space shuttles every day. They start a pretty hard job and excel in no time. They feel that: I went to work, I did not do anything, I still did it twice as well as the guys who surrounded me when they were in all their projects, what should I do now with my free time? And what is even more boring? When you can begin to predict behavior not because you are a psychologist, but because you have seen this pattern in the past. So, for them, from one side is not a challenging job, which is also quite boring at times, and on the other, they begin to discover the behavior of people. Itódigos a big bored Food. And the dumbest things are done to get out of this state. Previously, the guy who mentioned that his biggest problem is that they are trying to understand life in terms of logic (mathematics describes logic), while life is not really a logical thing, in fact it is absolutely correct.
