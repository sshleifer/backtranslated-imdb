['Good. As you can see, this is one of my favorite movies, if not the favorite. This is a character drama that is absolutely hilarious. The main character is a businessman who is caught in a &quot;same, different day&quot; mentality. He sees a woman who seems melancholy through the window of a dance studio from her train every day and wonders about her and decides to find out more about her. He decides to join the dance class only to discover that she is not the instructor. From there he joins four other dancers and learns to enjoy the dance, as well as to discover the mysterious woman. <br /><br /> There is no free sex (or any other) involved, just how a small group of people learn how friendships are formed and developed. <br /><br /> This movie was reconstructed with Richard Gere and Jennifer Lopez and the new one, although attractive, is not as fun as the original one. The film never became big in the United States because it was not eligible for the Oscars because it aired on television in Japan (movies can not be published on television or are disqualified for Oscar nominations). He won numerous awards in Japan for the best film, cast, director, etc. for his &quot;Oscar&quot; awards.']
