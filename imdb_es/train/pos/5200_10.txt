['Rudy does it again with this heat of the streets and follows Dolemite. This entry is filled with the Rudy Ray Moore requirement, music, humor and martial arts. Rudy eludes a crazy red-collar sheriff in this movie that also presents an infamous scene where Rudy dives on a steep hill. See it to laugh and for an explosive blast of magic from Blaxploitation.']
