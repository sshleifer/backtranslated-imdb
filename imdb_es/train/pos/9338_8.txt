It is true that the idea of ​​this television series may have arisen from the immense success that Ally McBeal is enjoying all over the world, including here in Germany. However, having said that, Edel & Starck is very different from Ally McBeal in many ways. <br /> <br /> The two main characters work very well together. Felix Edel (Felix Noble), played by the well-known German actor Christoph M. Ohrt and Sandra Starck (Sandra Strong - Noble & Strong, do you understand?), Played by the lovely Rebecca Immanuel, exchanges romantic repairs and continually spies on each other while they involve in criminal cases similar to comedies in Berlin and surroundings. In addition, they are helped by a magnificent cast of co-stars, especially his secretary, played by Isabel Tuengerthal, who is a rare gem with GREAT comedic potential. Also the somber wheel merchant, Otto, and the noble friend of Felix's childhood, Frank, work very well, not forgetting Sandra's best friend and roommate, Patricia, played by the beautiful Barbara Demmer. <br /> <br /> In general, a joy to see on Monday nights: no wonder that the series and its stars have received several awards. Will Felix get Sandra? <br /> <br /> I hope we have to wait many more episodes to find out ...
