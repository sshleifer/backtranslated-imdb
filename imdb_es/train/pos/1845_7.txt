['Why this is called &quot;Amas&quot; is a puzzle, because it&#39;s about four women, three of whom are not lovers ... Except, wait. Oh I see. It&#39;s a salacious title and we all have merchandise, I suppose. The series itself? Delicious. Most of the characters are bent on cutting metaphoric pieces of themselves. Big fun. It reminds me of the 1976 LWT miniseries, &quot;Bouquet of Barbed Wire,&quot; where all the characters and their parents held the machete. <br /><br /> Siobhan (Orla Brady) is the only real lover and she is getting into trouble. The husband is infertile. So there is no possibility of having a baby there then. But at work, there&#39;s Dominic, played by the super sexy Adam Rayner, who looks so good that he&#39;s not surprised when a strong lust breaks loose. It turns out that Dominic does not have fertility problems. I hope his sperm make a drawn sword (probably each one carries a small sword) and now Siobhan is inevitably pregnant in that way. What Siobhan should do is shut up well and squeeze, and move on, it&#39;s a miracle. What he really does, of course, is tell his friends &quot;I have to tell my husband&quot;. Not you not Really, you do not. Having. Having! <br /><br /> Katie (Sarah Parish) was once a lover, as we learned that she had had an affair with a married man before the series began. Without realizing it, she is now busy with her son. The father died of cancer and Katie, who is a doctor, helped him on his trip. So, she is an euthanasian, has had relationships with two of her patients and is sleeping with the father&#39;s son, carelessly ignoring the incestuous nuances. It&#39;s not going to end well for Katie. <br /><br /> Jessica is an experimental lesbian. She organizes events and is busy making a lesbian marriage as the series progresses. He quickly engages in visual exchanges with one of the brides Alex, played by Anna Torv, and the script rushes to a lesbonk in great haste. However, you can not think of a good way to put the two women together in bed, so I invented a little lame &quot;Are not you going to have a bachelorette party?! Well, I can not let you get away with it. I will organize one and the guests will be ... Me! &quot;, which achieves the result but is not exactly Winterson. I thought the writers had to make a living. Lazy. Torv&#39;s interpretation of his character is good. Alex treats Jessica as possibly unpleasant and Alex&#39;s body language always points backwards when she is moving forward. Mind, once you are on the wall, enter happily, and as expected, because Shelley Conn is so appetizing that a good percentage of the human race would have the opportunity. <br /><br /> Which brings us to Trudi, who is a widow. Of course, there should be simple people in a community but, if you are going to have a simple character, then you have to invent something to admire in them. It is very possible to be a bundle and attractive. However, Small&#39;s Trudi seems one of those characters that Casting stood out in a medieval crowd scene after the director said &quot;That&#39;s ridiculous, not all the characters would be pretty.&quot; More revealingly, you can not find anything to admire in it. Nothing. It&#39;s a turnip in a bowl of apples. Surprisingly, she makes &quot;sexy&quot; from time to time. I will not forget her appearance in a bright red corset with stockings tucked into her crotch for a long time and for all the wrong reasons. <br /><br /> So, well, delinquent fun all year. There is easily enough material here for a second series and I hope you do one. Although I trust that they learn a lesson. The characters never take off their underwear in bed! After having abandoned abandoned hours of unbridled lust, they then emerge to the surface still with their bras, or keep the sheets wrapped around their naughty parts. After several episodes, there are still no nipples and you can go ask for a cock. What is this? The Puritanism of the beginning of the 21st century? So the production team, are you listening? Your characters will solve some of their mental problems if they leave it and speak it. At least they will have more fun in the funny scenes, in the poor things. In a series dominated by being in the bedroom, or wanting to be in the bedroom, or having been in the bedroom, is a bit silly, and it seems a lot, that the characters hit their underwear. <br /><br /> In general. I was going to score 6 (half final), but the series does a trick that is quite rare. When each episode ends, you always want more and wait for the next one in advance. Then I score 7.']
