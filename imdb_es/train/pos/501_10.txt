I think this has the potential to be the best Star Trek series so far, I mean POTENTIAL ... we all know that there is a possibility that they drop the ball and run out of ideas ... BUT I DO NOT HOPE! For those who have not seen it ... SEE IT! Without that annoying "MAIN DIRECTOR" floating above their heads every time they run into races, it could be great ... and Scott Bakula was definitely a GREAT CHOICE for the Captain, and the Vulcan Babe is also hot, (see the scene decontamination) I gave this a FULL 10 ... it makes disappear ALL the other participants of the series. I hope this goes beyond 7 years ...
