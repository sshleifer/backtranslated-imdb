In this movie, we have the fabulous opportunity to see what happened to Timon and Pumbaa in the movie when they do not show up, that's a lot! This film even goes back to Simba and (presumably) right after Kiara's birth. <br /> <br /> Very faithful to the first film, "Lion King 1/2 (or Lion King 3 elsewhere)" is a fun, entertaining, exciting and surprising movie (or a sequel if that's what you want) call him). A lot of surprises and hilarities await you! <br /> <br /> While Timon and Pumbaa are watching a movie in the cinema (with remote control), Timon and Pumbaa have an argument about which point of "The Lion King". "They're going to start looking, since Timon wants to go to the part when he and Pumbaa come in and Pumbaa wants to go back to the beginning." They have a very fair commitment to see the movie of their own story, which is what they expect ... Start with Timon's first home ... <br /> <br /> For anyone with a good sense of humor to whom you liked it First films of almost any age, enjoy "Lion King 1/2"! :-)
