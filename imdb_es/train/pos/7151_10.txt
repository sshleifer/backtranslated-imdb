I read Holes in 5th grade, so when I found out they were making a movie, I was ecstatic! Of course, being my busy person, I did not have the opportunity to see the movie in theaters. Holes was in the driveway just outside the city but, unfortunately, we were too busy. I was surprised to hear that all my friends had seen it and none of them had invited me! Everyone said it was good, but I read great books that have made bad movies, so I definitely worried. <br /> <br /> Suddenly, the perfect opportunity came to see it. It came out that week and my parents went on a cruise and let me take care of the children. My sister, who is 9 years old, I saw her and I loved it. Then I took it to the other people who looked after the house and their children, 9 and 4 years old, they also liked it. Even my parents loved it and are, without a doubt, movie critics. In general, I recommend this film is for anyone who understands the moral of the family and loves a hilarious cast. This movie should be on your list of the top 5 "to see"!
