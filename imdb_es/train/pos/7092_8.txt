There is a (possibly apocryphal) story about an exchange between Bruce Willis and Terry Gilliam at the beginning of Twelve Monkeys. Gilliam (supposedly) produced a long list (think of the fifth item's aircraft) and handed it to Butch Bruce. It was titled "Things that Bruce Willis does when he acts." It ended with a simple message that said: "please, do not do anything of the previous thing in my movie". <br /> <br /> There is a fact about this movie (definitely true). Gilliam did not intervene in the writing. <br /> <br /> I would say that these two factors played a very important role in creating the extraordinary success (if not commercial) that is The Twelve Monkeys. <br /> <br /> Visually, the Twelve Monkeys is all that we can correctly expect from a Gilliam movie. It is also full of surrealism gilliamesco and general strangeness (but magnificent). Gilliam delights in misinterpreting her audience. Although the end of the Twelve Monkeys will not surprise anyone who has sat through the first true, Gilliam borrows Kafka to a large extent, a bureaucratic and relentless movement of the characters towards their destiny. It is this journey, and the development of the characters that experience, that disturbs. <br /> <br /> I love Gilliam's films (Brazil, in particular). But all of them tend to suffer from the same weakness. He seems to have so many ideas, and so much enthusiasm, that his films almost invariably end in a tangled mess (Brazil, in particular). I still argue that Brazil is Gilliam's tour de force, but there's no denying that The Twelve Monkey's is a breath of fresh air in the conspiracy department. The style, the substance and the form seem to merge in a way that is not usually seen from the ex-Python. <br /> <br /> Whatever the truth of the previous rumor, Gilliam also manages to obtain a performance of first (and very atypical) Out of the bald. Bruce is excellent in this film, as is the entire cast, particularly a crazy, and very scary, Brad Pitt. <br /> <br /> It has been more than a decade since this movie premiered. When I saw it again, I realized that I really had not aged. I had changed, of course. And this made me see the movie with new eyes. It seems to me that this is an appropriate tribute to a film that, at least in part, deals with reflections in mirrors, altered perspectives and the absurd journey in one direction through the time we all do. A movie of the first order. 8/10.
