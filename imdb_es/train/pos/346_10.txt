What an incredible movie! It was very scary, excellent acting, well written, nice twists of plot, interesting characters, very good direction and a surprising ending that will leave you with a smile on your face. This is a popcorn horror movie that may not be appealing to fans who are not, but it's still one of the best thrillers available today! I recommend it ONLY to fans of: <br /> <br /> 1) The horror genre <br /> <br /> OR <br /> <br /> 2) An actor or actress who appears on it . <br /> <br /> *** of **** stars! <br /> <br /> PS: I'm sick and tired of people comparing this and other modern horror movies with SCREAM. You know what, they did not want to be like SCREAM. Everyone is like "Oh, they copied SCREAM!". Well, if I'm not mistaken, SCREAM also copied other movies! In fact, almost EVERY horror movie copied an earlier one. SCREAM, however, was a good movie. But, still ... stop comparing it and enjoy it for what it is!
