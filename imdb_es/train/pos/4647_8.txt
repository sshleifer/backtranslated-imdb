It takes a very special kind of person to make a film so unhappy, seductive, disgusting and repulsive, but in a way that also makes it brilliant and the quintessence of personal film release. Crispin Glover, in all his antics and predispositions "out there", really did something that is unique. In a world that has become completely partisan, this film seems to evade the standard lines of creativity and art and to surprise everyone effectively. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, the film takes on a rather distant paradigm (if there really is a model) and, initially, models it with characters like Shirley Temple in front of a swastika and nude women who give pleasure. A man with cerebral palsy. It is quite shocking, but if you had the opportunity to ask questions and answers after the evaluations, it clearly opens a bag of worms that leaves you wondering if this is art or just the lowest common denominator. In either of the two costumes, you feel the tremor that this film will ultimately cause. It will never be accepted, not even by the supposed authors of the world who speak openly about the human condition. You may not like it, but it is certainly something worth seeing.
