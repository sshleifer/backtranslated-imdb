A movie that you start to see as a nightly cable video ... It's hot in that apartment, but it has a lot more ... It has a sense of humor ... some action inside and outside the "bed" and has a reasonable performance , as well as a story that is worth seeing ... A definitive film only for adults but well worth seeing ...
