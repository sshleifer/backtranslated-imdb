['I just have to throw away my two cents. Relax, it&#39;s a comedy. Yes, for the most part, the characters are written and acted in general terms. I can not think of many comedies where they are not. This is not a new release, it is published on video and broadcasted on cable almost every week. Would you see it in a theater? Of course, when it first came out. It&#39;s funny ... that should be enough. <br /><br /> Even if I did not like it at all, I would still watch it on cable for Michael Keaton. He is an underrated and underestimated actor. I can not think of another that is so capable in all genres. Nor can I think of someone who is so successful. A comic actor who is also an action star (of short duration but still), who is also a romantic protagonist, who is also a dramatic actor; A villain and a hero. I can not think of any, at least not in Hollywood. Certainly none that have been successful in all those genres. I mean, there&#39;s Tom Cruise, but for me it&#39;s better to be Tom Cruise than to become a character. However, this is not about Michael Keaton against Tom Cruise, so I&#39;ll keep going. <br /><br /> It&#39;s worth renting Gung Ho, but it&#39;s worth buying, since you can probably find it for $ 10.00 or less at stores like Wal-Mart. It is worth seeing it on cable (if it has cable or satellite). It&#39;s one of those fun to watch movies. You can put your brain on pause, and just relax, and laugh. <br /><br /> To ask for more, in my sincere opinion, is to ask too much.']
