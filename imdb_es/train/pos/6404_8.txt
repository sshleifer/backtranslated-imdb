While watching this movie, and I began to see how the characters developed, I could feel that this would be an excellent image. When you have that feeling, and the film actually fills those expectations, the experience is rare. I had that feeling throughout this movie. Robert DeNiro and Cuba Gooding Junior played fascinating and incredibly strong parts that deserved the Oscar. The cast of support was equally strong in creating a winning base for the image to grow. I can say without any doubt, see this movie that will not disappoint.
