While Rome goes crazy celebrating Hitler's visit (uniforms, bands, parades), two strangers stay at home, in a large building, and end up meeting. She is Sofia Loren, who is the wife of a brutal public servant and mother of six children. He is Mastroianni, a radio announcer who has been fired because of his homosexuality. Both need company and understanding, both find themselves in each other. <br /> <br /> The film covers a lapse of a few hours. The color vanished and everything happens with a soundtrack of military marches and hysterical radio announcers. Oddly enough, the Nazi anthem, the Horst-Wessel-Lied, becomes a romantic musical theme. <br /> <br /> Beautiful film, excellent recreation of a special era in Italian history and a moving and sad story. Mastroianni is as good as we've come to expect and Sofia Loren does an excellent job, far away from the Neapolitan fish people of her usual trucker. Do not miss it
