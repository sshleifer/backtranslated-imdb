I do not pretend to be a Ralph Bakshi fan, because I'm not. I've only seen 5 of his animated films so far: Coonskin, Wizards, Fritz the Cat and Lord of the Rings and finally "Fire and Ice". What I can say is that I found that "Fire and Ice" is the most pleasant of all. It is a simple fantasy tale of swords and sorcery in the line of Conan the Barbarian, but the beautiful work of art, the realistic animation and the animated film give a very classic charm to this film. <br /> <br /> It deserves the first mention, it is the animation itself. I do not care what people say about the rotoscope, but in my opinion, Ralph Bakshi used that technique very effectively here. I was surprised at how realistic the movements of the characters were. The directional style and the photorealistic character designs made "Fire and Ice" more like a big budget fantasy box office success than a cartoon. Unfortunately, the level of detail in the art tends to be a bit inconsistent, especially near the end of the film. Some scenes look really flat with little or no detail of the body contour or cloth folds and shadows on the characters. <br /> <br /> With realistic moving characters, realistic action would follow naturally. Not only was the action well choreographed, it was really brutal. I would dare to compare the brutality of the action with live action movies like Zack Snyder's 300. However, I noticed that, although blood was spilled, the blood spatter was reduced to a minimum. Once again, a great choice by the creative team that only increases the visual experience by not taking things too "above". <br /> <br /> Although I do not recognize any "big name" in the cast, the voice actors manage to deliver a satisfactory performance; keeping the distribution of each line realistically and only in the case of the bad ones. <br /> <br /> Did I say bad? Yes, I do. Because that's exactly what the story is about, a standard tale of good versus bad. Nothing really original about the story that seems to be simply a mix of clich√©s of pre-existing fantasy films involving warriors and maidens with little clothing. Whoever seeks "depth" would be deeply disappointed. The characters are not given much development and some of them like Nekron and Darkwolf are one-dimensional at best (however, I heard the rumor of some deleted scenes that explain Darkwolf's obsession with killing Nekron and his mother. Scenes like that deserved a complete restoration and should have included in the final cut to add a level of depth to the show). In fact, I would not be surprised to know that the whole movie was just a "technological demonstration" to show the incredible animation and art, with the story improvised and launched as a last minute idea to pass it off as a "movie" of its own. <br /> <br /> A true classic from a bygone era, "Fire and Ice" really captures the fiery spirit of adventure and mysticism with its beautiful depictions of fantastic creatures and charming characters. It is a unique vision of a world created by Ralph Bakshi and artist Frank Frazetta with a good measure of action and suspense. <br /> <br /> Would it support today's animated film standards? Definitely not. But I urge fans of animation in general to "get off your horse" and give this simple but beautiful movie the opportunity to grow in you. It's really a jewel of the '80s worth checking out.
