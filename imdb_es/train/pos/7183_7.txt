This is a perfect series to watch as a family. We gather around the television to watch this on BBC America. It is an updated version of Robin Hood and attracts children and adults alike. Our teenagers and teenagers enjoy sitting with mom and dad and watching Robin's next exploits. We can not wait for the next episode to air each week and we're happy for the free "On Demand" viewing. <br /> <br /> The wardrobe has a current fashionable place. There is a moral in every story. It is entertaining. Violence is not exaggerated or unnecessary. The soundtrack is absolutely fantastic with the feeling of John William. It is an old world tale that comes alive again with a new world style. <br /> <br /> There is so much garbage on television, from a rotten "reality" television to the brain to senseless violence. You should take this for what it is and it is an updated "Robin Hood" that can not be compared to the cinematic exploits of Errol Flynn. This is a jewel to be enjoyed by all. Parents worried that their children will see too much violence will enjoy that Robin has lost his taste for war and bloodshed. He is a Robin Hood who prefers to try to reason to come out of a disagreement to fight. Maid Marian is also an attractive model for girls. Instead of staying on the sidelines and doing nothing, he takes his own role in helping the poor by being the "Night Watchman." The Sheriff of Nottingham is deliciously superimposed, just as the Sheriff should be and looks like a cross between Billy Joel and Tim Curry. Guy Gisborne is played by an extremely handsome actor, one of which makes most women wish they had not played the role of a bad "boy". <br /> <br /> The only question we have is "Where is Friar Tuck?"
