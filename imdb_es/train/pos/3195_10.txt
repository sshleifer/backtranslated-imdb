['THE BEAVER TRILOGY is, without a doubt, one of the brightest films ever made. I was lucky to catch it, along with a question and answer session with director Trent Harris, at the NY Video Festival a few years ago and then I bought a copy of Trent&#39;s website. This movie has to be seen to be believed! I sincerely recommend looking for Trent&#39;s name on the web and then buy the movie on his site. He&#39;s an incredibly good kid to boot. Do not get confused: The cameraman of the fictional sections of THE BEAVER TRILOGY is NOT Trent! <br /><br /> After having seen the TRILOGY several times, I must admit that I could probably do without Sean Penn&#39;s version. It&#39;s like a trial version for Crispin Glover&#39;s &quot;Orkly Kid&quot; section and it&#39;s more interesting as an element of curiosity if you&#39;re a Penn fan than a good video. However, Penn is quite fun, and you can see the ingredients of a big star in this harsh black and white video. <br /><br /> This is probably one of Crispin Glover&#39;s best roles and I&#39;d love to see an updated documentary about the original Groovin &#39;Gary. Once you see this movie, you will never again get Gary&#39;s nervous laugh out of your head.']
