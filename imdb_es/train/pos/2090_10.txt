This is where the term "classic movie" comes from. This is a wonderful story of the courage, courage and extreme loyalty of a woman. Poor Olan was sold to his indifferent husband, who over the years learned to appreciate her. (Yes, yes, A PEARL !!) <br /> <br /> Luise Rainer was the beautiful star who won the Oscar for Best Actress the year before for her small role (and what a waste of Oscar) in "The Great Zigfield. " He really did not show what talent he had, if he had any, other than his exotic beauty. But in "Good Earth" it shows that you can really act! Its beauty was erased and it did not have big disguises either. People say that she did not show any real emotion in this movie. As hell. His character Olan is a timid and timid woman, with inner strength. She is quiet during parts of the movie with only her eyes and body to convey her emotions. Example: those scenes during the fall of the city and when the looters were being shot. If people say that she does not act well in this movie, you are NOT watching her! <br /> <br /> Paul Muni shows that he can also act. Your character is not nice to me. He never sees her for what she is, until the end of the story. A sweet lover and dedicated wife and mother, with their own special beauty. The greatest of all, the beauty of the interior, like a pearl. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity to see this movie, look at it. You will see one of the best movies that created the golden age of Hollywood.
