For those who think of Dame May Witty as the kind, a little crazy and old lady of The Lady Vanishes by Hitchcock, this movie requires an adjustment. Here, she is anything less kind or crazy. Instead, his son, George Macready is the crazy one. Just do not give him a knife, otherwise his eyes will light up and there will be no cushion for furniture in the house that is safe. Now we know what he has in mind for the trapped Nina Foch, if he can get out of the Mother's dominant hand. <br /> <br /> It's a very tight movie of a woman in danger that keeps the suspense up. The script never gets away from Foch's dilemma. She is detained in a large Gothic house on the edge of an angry sea. They will kill her, but why? Your situation does not make sense. The tension increases as you try one escape tactic after another, but even strangers seem to be against it. We begin to feel their impotence and their growing paranoia as the world moves away from it. <br /> <br /> Director Joseph H. Lewis took a big step towards cult status with this film, and understandably so. Then, too, see Foch running subtly through a range of emotions without once passing over.

My only reservation is the climax that seems too artificial considering the calendar of events. Nonetheless, it's a good, harrowing way to spend a little more than an hour, courtesy of the Columbia studios.
