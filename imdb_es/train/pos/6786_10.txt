Do not tell me your whole system is not affected by it. " The other scene occurs in the apartment of the waitress Pat Kroll. Tony tells him that his name is Martin. She thanks him. Then he says: "O Paul, Hamlet, Joe, and maybe Othello." ... When Tony starts rehearsing Othello, we realize that, although he is trying to keep his real life separate from his life on stage, "the part begins to leak in your life, and the battle begins. imagination ". He can not keep the two separated. In her mind, Pat is Desdemona and Othello, and he mistakenly believes that she has been unfaithful to him. He murders her ... Colman's courageous performance, in a complex and difficult role, won him the Academy Award for Best Actor in 1947. The Oscar nominations went to Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin for Best Original Screenplay. The atomic cinematography of Milton Krasner must not be overlooked.
