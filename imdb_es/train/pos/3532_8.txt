Scott Henderson, the engineer who employs Carol Richman, as his assistant, makes a point to call her "Kansas", every time he speaks to her. It shows us that Carol, effectively played by Ella Raines, is supposed to be a baby in the woods, as far as the Manhattan of the 40s. Only one woman, out of town, would follow the waiter with shadow to a lonely subway high. Even then, only a naive girl could undertake such an adventure. <br /> <br /> Robert Siodmak directed this black film very well. He shows a gift for infusing the story with a lot of raw sex that was surprising for those days. How else could we justify the way the drummer in the musical's orchestra, where Scott takes the mysterious woman with an unusual hat, makes such an obvious pass to a lady on a date? The drummer played with high voltage by Elisha Cook Jr. does not hide his wishes for any of the ladies who sat in the front row of the hit musical where he plays. It was a true explicit invitation, first to the "ghost woman" of the story, Fay Helm; then, Cliff, the drummer, insinuates very openly with Ella Raines, who goes to the theater disguised as the mysterious lady that his boss had originally taken. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that will hook any viewer from the beginning. There are things that are not explained in it, but they maintain one's interest in everything. The murderer does not reveal himself until the end. <br /> <br /> Ella Raines with her expressive eyes was an underestimated actress. She stands up against much more experienced actors. Franchot Tone, a New York theater actor who works in Hollywood, never found in this medium the fame he deserved. He is effective as the best friend of the accused man. On the other hand, Alan Curtis is presented as a man who, being framed, accepts his destiny and is saved only by the tenacity of the woman who secretly loved him. Thomas Gomez, like Inspector Burgess, is an asset to the film as a detective who has his doubts that the police had captured the man who committed the crime. <br /> <br /> This movie will not disappoint.
