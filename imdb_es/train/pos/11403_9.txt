Gene Kelly came up with some great ideas for musicals while with MGM. Here he is at the peak of his creative powers working with the Arthur Freed musical unit. It's hard to believe when you see An American In Paris that the players never left the back parking lot at MGM. <br /> <br /> The magic of An American In Paris is due to the creative edition under the direction of Vincent Minnelli and the sets that MGM designed combined with some background shots. The idea for the film originated with Kelly, who simply wanted to make a film with a long ballet sequence featuring George Gershwin's tone poem An American in Paris. It suited Arthur Freed, who approached Ira Gershwin, who told him that he agreed with him, as long as he used other material from Gershwin. <br /> <br /> Gershwin obtained the kind of agreement for the Gershwin music that Irving Berlin normally obtained. Not a note of non-Gershwin music is heard in An American in Paris. Listen to some of the background music and you will hear things like Embraceable You and But Not For Me, which are not real musical numbers. <br /> <br /> Another guy who was very good at writing lyrics, Alan Jay Lerner, wrote the story that it is true that he is thin. All about a former GI played by Gene Kelly, who after World War II never left France, simply settled into an apartment on the left bank and became a hungry artist. Live with the eccentric composer Oscar Levant and that sounds like a redundancy. <br /> <br /> Two women are interested in him. Another American expatriate played by Nina Foch, who wants to sponsor him as a painter, if he is reciprocal in other matters. But Kelly falls in love with a girl from the store played by Leslie Caron in her film debut. Caron also has the star of the musical comedy Georges Guetary interested here. <br /> <br /> Of course, the plot is just an excuse to sing and dance to the music of George Gershwin. An American in Paris is the first movie I saw as a movie in flight on the first airplane trip I made. I still remember flying from Phoenix Arizona to Kennedy Airport watching Gene Kelly doing "Tengo Rhythm". However, my favorite number in the film is Tra-La-La, in which Kelly sings and dances throughout the apartment with Oscar Levant playing the piano. At one point, Kelly dances on the baby grand piano. <br /> <br /> In a book about Arthur Freed, I read a quote in which he said that in the American ballet sequence in Paris it had to be done against the background of the French Impressionists that he felt the audience would take in Place a realistic environment in the streets or in the back lot. So it happened that way. Kelly had done long ballet sequences in Words and Music, The Pirate and On the Town. But this exceeded everyone. In my opinion, I still do it and that includes some of Gene Kelly's later films. <br /> <br /> In a surprise surprise at the Oscars, An American In Paris was chosen as the best film for 1951, beating the favorite A Streetcar Named Deseo. I guess the fantasy beat realism that year. Big budgets also have an advantage in these things. <br /> <br /> Still An American in Paris is one of the best movie musicals ever made and, since studios no longer have all that creative talent under one roof, they are less likely to repeat themselves.
