This movie came out 12 years ago and it was a revelation even for people who knew something about the drag scene in New York. The textbooks on drag performance do not say anything about these fashion houses. Anthony Slide's 'Great Pretenders' says nothing. "The Drag Queens of New York: An Illustrated Field Guide" by Julian Fleisher, with its influence flow diagram that brings together Julian Eltinge, Minette, the Warhol queens and the 90s club scene, and after the date of the film, ignores the houses completely. Even Laurence Senelick's "The Changing Room", the closest thing we have to a definitive book on drag performance rushes beyond the film and does not provide the background information one would have expected from it. <br /> <br /> I understand the film itself, and several articles that I found on the web, this system of houses goes back decades. The greatest cinematographic performance by a member of the house before 1990 seems to be Chrystal La Beija in "The Queen", 1968. The historical context is the missing part of "Paris is Burning". <br /> <br /> The film is valuable because it focuses on a scene that is otherwise ignored. It is a valuable snapshot of life in 1989. The unfortunate fact that Venus Xtravaganza was killed during filming provides a very dramatic ending, but this is not the only film about transsexuals that includes a murder in real life. As we now know, Dorian Corey had a mummified corpse in his literal closet, but this did not appear until three years later. <br /> <br /> Of historical importance, but we still need someone to make a book or a documentary film that provides more context.
