This 1947 movie star was directed and written by Orson Welles (with a funky Irish accent) and also stars the beautiful Rita Hayworth with a less attractive short blonde hair. So, I've dated Orson before in Touch of Evil and Citizen Kane and the Third Man, etc. but this was my first interaction with Rita Hayworth. Our first meeting was fine, she does an excellent job interpreting the scared and cautious Elsa, married to a crippled millionaire lawyer. Mike (Welles) and Elsa fall in love. He wants to run away with her, she does not know if she can live without the things that money can buy. Elsa, her husband and her partner argue and bite, as do the sharks that Mike describes as attacking each other and their preaching proves to be too true. Several twists and turns follow this mystery of murder when we reach the climax in the house of fun. (Think of the final shooting in The Man with the Golden Gun, which took a lot from this scene). I was not sure who the killer was until the end. <br /> <br /> This movie is like shrimp in garlic and lemon. The dish focuses on the sea, it is subtle, bitter and acrid, all with great effect. They may not be the best fresh shrimp, but Costco's good quality frozen shrimp. The tasty sauce adds to the naturalness of the pink shrimp as it is filled with a healthy and complete alternative to a more mundane and common meal. 7/10 http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies
