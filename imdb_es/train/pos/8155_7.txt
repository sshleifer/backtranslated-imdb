I'm too old to know (or care about) exactly what is the difference between rap and hip-hop. And, being Canadian, I probably have never seen MTV, but I'm not sure. <br /> <br /> But I thought that this movie was very funny when I saw it, a little bright satire. The hip-hop culture is so widespread these days that it's hard not to keep listening to it over and over again. (I wish we could say the same about bagpipe music). I got most of the jokes (at least I think so). Sure, it's derived from Spinal Tap, but there are many goals that could support a Tap treatment. Simply not the carpenters, they are sacred.
