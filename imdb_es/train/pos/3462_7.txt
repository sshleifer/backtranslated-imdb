This was the first televised episode of the series Columbo (although it was filmed after "Death Lends a Hand") and announced one of the most successful television series in history. <br /> <br /> Jack Cassidy (who played the killer in the series three times) shows enthusiasm, arrogance and self-confidence in equal measure, like Ken Franklin, half of a team of mystery writers who plot a plot made to kill his partner, Jim Ferris (played by Martin Milner) who decides to end his professional relationship, leaving Franklin exposed simply as a good publicist instead of a prolific writer. <br /> <br /> The initial configuration of the murder is fantastic and Cassidy's performance facilitates a moot praise that he was the best Columbo Assassin in the series. <br /> <br /> Peter Falk is wonderfully underestimated in his role as Columbo and the inherent traits and oddities of the character, which are underlined by apparent slowness and mental distension, contrast particularly well with Cassidy's. The extreme satisfaction of the character: one of his first scenes together where Ken Franklin makes a motive for murder through the non-existent exhibition of Jim Ferris on the identification of assassins operating in the underworld is a good example of that. Franklin insinuates to Columbo this possible motive and Columbo (intentionally or ignorantly) does not cling, forcing Franklin to express his disappointment in a markedly condescending way and comparing him unfavorably with the detective in the books, Mrs. Melville. <br /> <br /> In addition, it is remarkable the initial contribution of Steven Spielberg, 24 years old. However, some elementary inclusions of the cameras that accompany the actors and actresses, adds some elegant and elaborate touches to defend the general professionalism of the episode. A particularly clear picture is Jim Feriss's corpse lying on the sofa, almost dark in the foreground, while Ken Franklin lifts a glass towards him in the background after he answers a phone call to Ferris's anguished wife. I have no doubt that working for a restrictive schedule of 10 to 14 days, Spieberg's efforts should not be underestimated. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the event of the second murder, necessitated by a scheme of blackmail that is hatched by a woman Franklin's friend (and, ironically, is known as "careless" by Columbo in his climate summary ) takes the steam out of the whole thing. The vanguard of the plot is compromised and the screen time between Falk and Cassidy is reduced inexcusable at this point to help the scriptwriter (Stephen Bocho) out of a closed corner, since he can not develop the story without another murder . <br /> <br /> The climax is the most disappointing aspect of this episode. The initial joke and the exchange of words between Falk and Cassidy are executed firmly and effectively, but they simply announce the fact that more should have happened in the episode. The main aggravation lies in the sealing track (if it can be called a clue): until now, the arrogance and arrogance of the character of Cassidy is surprisingly expelled by a clue that really does little to imply his guilt; and once this is mentioned, it capitulates in an unspectacular and unusual way. <br /> <br /> In short, a bold opening of the series, which inevitably announces and predicts everything that is good about Columbo, and, on the contrary, the problems associated with such ingenuity, that is, maintaining the high standards and, in particular, create a credible and suitably intelligent ending.
