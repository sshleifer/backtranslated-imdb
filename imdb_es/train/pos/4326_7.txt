I can not say how precisely the film follows the novel, without ever having read the book, but given that the time elapses approximately six and a half hours, it is a good bet that most of the base is covered or, at least, We can say with the certainty that this is not a condensed version of Reader's Digest. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are high, well above the standards of other classic BBC series such as Inspector Morse and Sherlock Holmes. We can believe that Dickens's London looked, sounded and thought a lot like that. There are some occasional minor lapses, some athletes who shoot a pistol with a percussion cap in 1840 or 1820 or when this happened. <br /> <br /> The performance must also be applauded. Suzanne Burden is the educated and honest heroine who quietly does good. She is also pretty, in a mature way, her beauty in her compassionate nature not in any coquetry. Denholm Elliott is his tutor (and more than that, as it turns out). Burden and Elliott are two of the few characters that are good in a pure way. Another is a former sergeant forced to do evil by evil people. Another is a poor and helpless young man. <br /> <br /> I do not think anyone else has written this. It has all the characteristics of Dickens: poverty, tragic deaths, crude capitalism, the rich and generous man in his closed house, hidden kinship, dark motives and the impotence or absolute wickedness of the justice system. Well, not the justice system as a whole but the chancery, which was evidently a court that resolved issues related to the distribution of assets. (So ​​I infer from Wikipedia). It became so notoriously rigid and dilatory that it was completely renewed in England in 1973. Twice, Elliott's character describes it as "a curse". The most impressive scene involves a creditor seeking money and harassing a retired soldier in the latter's gym during a fencing lesson. The sergeant is more masculine in the traditional sense than any other male character I remember from Dickens. The apoplaytic moneylender and tenant shout threats from his seat and the sergeant turns to him and does a delicate exercise with the saber after another, each advance bringing him closer to his tormentor, while the old scarlet-faced creditor recoils in his seat. . <br /> <br /> There are a couple of things missing. Often, Dickens will keep at least one or two lines of dialogue fun. ("Humbug!" Or "The law is an ass.") Not here. "Shady" house is the correct title. Second, there are virtually no Weberian "ideal types," neither Mr. Micawbers nor the Artful Dodgers or Scrooges. Third, the atmosphere, the whole spirit, is implacably depressing. One tribulation follows another, usually related to money or some shameful peccadillo of the past. <br /> <br /> My God, it's depressing. It is as if the author were unloading his spleen on everything he hated in the world he knew. Poverty, it's fine. I knew poverty. But one wonders what the Foreign Ministry did to Dickens to deserve this kind of treatment. <br /> <br /> Maybe I should add that I just watched the first episode of the 2005 series, and it's better in two ways. There is more zip in the direction, so the pace is a little faster. And Jarndyce's business against Jarndyce is satisfactorily explained from the start, instead of lurking in the shadows like that mysterious "curse", so the plot is easier to follow.
