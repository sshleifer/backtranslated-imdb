['This film should not be compared to &quot;The Sting&quot; or other Caper / Heist / Con game films. What makes it an excellent cinematic experience is what you have to say about relationships, deception and trust. It is also a rather sharp criticism of psychiatry, given that the female protagonist is a shrinkage that is so easy to deceive and then acts so primitively in the end. Has Mr. Mamet had an unfortunate experience in therapy? Very, very recommended!']
