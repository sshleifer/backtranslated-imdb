If you have not seen Eva Longoria from the television show "Desperate House Wives" then you're missing out. Eva will be one of the biggest Latin stars and soon you will see her in theaters. This was Eva's first film and she does a fantastic job acting. She was 24 years old when she shot him, and she looked sexy then. As for this low-budget film, it is quite good for the director for the first time, who will soon release another film, "Juarez, Mexico," which is currently being screened at many film festivals in the United States. In fact, it seems that you can have a limited theatrical version of some news. What would be nice to see is a "Snitch'2" with a higher budget.
