This movie is just funny. No sense, but fun. to enjoy this movie completely, you can not have an idea of ​​what a movie like this is like and just enjoy all the jokes and puns related to the movie. I still find it funny at first when he says "he wants a beer ........ cock". funny things. but what makes the film decent is the fact that it does not try to create a serious turn in the movie, too many comedies try to have serious aspects that you simply do not believe. But this is different and only focuses on being fun. I must say, however, that Yasmin bleeth is terrible in the movie and does not add anything other than the 3 main types, coop, remer and squeak are very funny to watch and make the movie great to watch.
