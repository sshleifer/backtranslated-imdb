Yes, the poster is a pretty horrible job. <br /> <br /> I thought the movie was fine ... nothing really exceptional ... I just hoped that he was a hard junkie and totally destroyed his life. <br /> <br /> Ahh, but that can not happen to rich kids, right? Not for the son of a wealthy businessman who celebrates big parties in the ballroom and has a nice manicured lawn on the front of the mini mansion. <br /> <br /> No ... the child is too good to have his life totally destroyed. After all, who will drive the new SUV and who will go to law school? <br /> <br /> Ah, the poor and rich little children ... in their picturesque pretty house, with its ivy league schools, its ultra clean homes and its social parties ... what will the world do? without them? <br /> <br /> I hope everyone gets addicted to drugs, quits their lives and ends up in jail ... so maybe we can watch films that do not revolve around poor rich children. of the surreal world.
