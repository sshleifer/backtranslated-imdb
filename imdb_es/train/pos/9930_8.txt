['I am totally surprised by some of the comments in this forum, and many of the comments. I think Tony Scott made a good movie here. Yes, it is very stylized, flashy and exaggerated, but it is very entertaining. I&#39;m glad that at least Ebert and Roeper agree with me :) <br /><br /> It is possible that this movie is not for anyone, but if you like the top, dark humor, great action and dialogue, you should see it. <br /><br /> I had previously seen Man on Fire, Crimson Tide and Enemy of the State of Scott, all good movies, but I like it better. It&#39;s like a roller coaster, with a great selection of soundtracks, visual styles and at a time when all movies seem to be pg13, it&#39;s nice to see that someone is not afraid to show nudity, bloody violence and have an explicit dialogue. <br /><br /> It does not hurt that Keira is super hot, and she even shows nipples in this, either ...']
