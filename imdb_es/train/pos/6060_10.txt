This is a great documentary film. Any car racing fan must own a copy of this exceptional movie. The director "Stephen Low" did a great job, as well as the main stars of the film, Father & Son, Mario & Michael Andretti. The DVD looks and sounds amazing. And the best of all is IMAX! Great home theater test disc.
