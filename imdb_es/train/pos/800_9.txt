I could not have been more excited; At the age of eight, in 1983, I was going to see a Star Wars movie in the theater! The best day of my life was about to happen. Until then, my only Star Wars experience had been some of the HBO Star Wars exhibits. I had not even seen The Empire Strike Back yet. <br /> <br /> And, boy, that day was for my less critical eyes. Jabba Great rebel space ships. The Emporer A green leaf lightsaber !! Woohoo! Since that magical day, I must have seen this movie hundreds of times. I can not even make an accurate estimate at this point. With those multiple visualizations, of course, I have observed that this movie, Episode III REAL, has its flaws. <br /> <br /> Of course, in the context of a Star Wars movie, those "flaws" are more like "whims". <br /> <br /> Millions had their magical day in 1977 and 1980. In May of 1983, I had mine. And this was my Star Wars movie.
