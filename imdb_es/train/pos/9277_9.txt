"The cinema is dead, long live the cinema!" said Peter Greenaway, one of the most innovative and productive contemporary directors, at the Romanian film festival Anonimul last year, which reached the third edition and takes place in the Danube Delta. This year, the award for the address was for "Offside" by Jafar Panahi. I was able to see him tonight in Bucharest in the retrospective of the festival. The cinema is dead but still very animated. Panahi's film tells convincingly how Iranian society looks. Digitally shot, "Offside" is a story inspired by a real-life event that happened to Panahi's daughter: the problem and the risk increased when it was decided to attend a football game. This is prohibited in Iran, since we are informed. What Panahi manages to do is provide with few means, but with probably a lot of work, intelligence and humor the cultural patterns in a society that places women on a different level. The absurdity of the laws becomes comical. The film has a happy ending, after all because the Iran team is going to the World Cup. What I appreciated most was the concept, the idea behind this movie. I would be very interested to see other Panahi movies that were also banned in Iran. I suppose it can be thought of as an activist director.
