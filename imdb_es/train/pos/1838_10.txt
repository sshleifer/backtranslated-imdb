WAQT is a perfect example of a chicken soup that is not exactly for your soul. Unfortunately, the broth has lost its real flavor thanks to all the excess dilution and dressing that occurred. <br /> <br /> The surprising and disappointing thing about WAQT is that it comes from a director who stayed away from the usual clich√©s. of the Hindi cinema in its first adventure, but that in its second output gives way to all the formulas of film stereotypes. While Vipul Shah was convinced to show something as unlikely as the blind who steal a bank in AANKHEN, he simply fails to induce life in the entire WAQT package that is based on something as conceivable as a father-son relationship. Adopted from a work by Gujarati Aavjo Vhala Fari Malishu, WAQT has a sensible story with a social message to back it up. A mature look at the father-son relationship, the unconditional love of a father towards his son and the responsibility of a son towards his family. Ishwar Chand Sharawat (Amitabh Bachchan), who established his own empire from scratch, leads a rich life with his wife Sumitra (Shefali Shah). His only son, Aditya (Akshay Kumar) never had the need to strive for anything, as he did everything tailored and spoon-fed in life. Ishwar's pampering has only spoiled him even more. <br /> <br /> Aditya dreams of becoming a superstar, but does nothing to make her dreams come true. Meanwhile, he marries his beloved Mitali (Priyanka Chopra). Ishwar hopes that the marriage will make Aditya a more responsible man, but he is disappointed. Aditya is still at its best to lead a carefree life. <br /> <br /> The endurance limit finally collapses when Ishwar expels Aditya from his home. The sudden change in the attitude of his affectionate father towards him and his now expectant wife bewilders Aditya. He has no choice but to fight for the sustenance of his wife and unborn child. He begins to become an independent man, but the break in the relationship between him and his father grows. <br /> <br /> The story is simplistic, while the uncomplicated script takes a very elementary approach. One can easily identify and relate to the credible characters of both father and son. If you're not one of the two, at least you could have met people like them somewhere in real life. <br /> <br /> Add to it the simple handling of director Vipul Shah's script. With a family affair like this, any other director in his place would have added tons of melodrama in the procedure according to the film laws of the Bollywood family dramas, turning the film into a compulsive ripper. However, Shah stands out in the effortless handling of emotions for most of the movie. <br /> <br /> A clear example of his unassuming direction is palpable in the scene before the interval in which the father expels the son of his house in a rather frivolous way. The purpose of the scene is achieved without staining a large part of the public's brain. The same happens with the scene in the second half in which the now separated father's son has a frivolous conversation. That is what sets WAQT apart from a KABHI KUSHI GHUM or an EK RISHTAA and, in fact, places it at a high level in terms of treatment. <br /> <br /> But after getting all the points of distinction, one can ask where the WAQT fails. in? The problem lies in the fact that, although WAQT is distinguished from the others in its league in terms of treatment, it gives way to failures in packaging terms. What about the director forcing the singing and the dancing from time to time in the first half. There is a song by Shaar kinda shaadi, a song by Chopra kinda Holi, a song by father son disco dandia, a dream song and a dream song come true that induces enough yawns in the viewer. Imagine this ... the father just ejected the son from his house and the son is dreaming of a song in the Moroccan mountains with his wife. Out of place! Out of reason! and the audience Outside the seat. <br /> <br /> The film creeps into the first half and the real story begins only in the second half. The director has wasted too much WAQT on unnecessary elements. The much-discussed dog chase sequence is not bad, but neither is it a redemption. However, the taandav dance of Akshay Kumar is simply ridiculous. Imagine that he qualifies for the hunt for stars in the movie with this histrionic hilarion (involuntarily). Add to this the climax set at the end of starfight where the son bursts with emotions. That is so archetypal! In addition, the editing pattern could have been reversed to hide the father's reason for the change of attitude towards his son. <br /> <br /> Anu Malik's music is fine even if it is not necessary in the process. Santosh Thundiiayil's camera work is competent enough, although not very demanding. Aatish Kapadia has developed some good dialogues for the dramatic moments. <br /> <br /> Boman Irani and Rajpal Yadav make up the light moments of the film very efficiently. While Rajpal Yadav has been exaggerating with his histrionic comics in many movies lately, this time he underestimates his character and is completely restricted. His expressionless expressions complement perfectly with Boman's exaggerated histrionics. <br /> <br /> Shefali Shah is convincing in the role of the mother. It should not be taken as a censure, but it is perfect both to interpret and to "look" at your character. Priyanka is beautiful and fulfills her part well. <br /> <br /> Of course, the main applauses they deserve are Akshay Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan. Akshay is especially expressive in the scene where his affectionate father intentionally rebuke him so that he realizes his responsibilities. Although Bachchan is a bit dramatic in a couple of scenes, his brilliance manifests throughout the film. <br /> <br /> In short, the WAQT is like a soup whose ingredients are tasty and nutritious, but the final recipe is by no means so appetizing.
