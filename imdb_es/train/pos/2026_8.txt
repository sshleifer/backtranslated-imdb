The first time I saw this miniseries a few years ago on British television, I was immediately captivated by the story. This surprised me a lot since I'm not a big fan of 'Jane Eyre' or 'Wuthering Heights'; I think the heroine of the first is a self-destructive, and the last piece of work as an exaggerated trap. <br /> <br /> 'The tenant of Wildfell Hall', like the works mentioned above, is also somewhat depressing in parts. However, the darkest parts of the film were counteracted by the thrill of Helen's flight, the incredibly wild and beautiful landscape of Yorkshire and the sexual magnetism of Toby Stephens. <br /> <br /> This film successfully portrays the frustratingly restrictive lifestyle of all women of the time. At best, they suffered from a form of lower domestic tyranny, as evidenced by the treatment of women in Markham's house. At the other end of the scale, there is the unfortunate Helen, who is married to a rich man of high wealth, but who is exposed to the brutality and humiliation that alternate with long periods of abandonment. She escapes and experiences a brief moment of freedom but, like a mysterious woman who lives alone in a rural community, inevitably becomes the object of gossip and spiteful speculation. <br /> <br /> Tara Fitzgerald is excellent like the long Suffering Helen Markham. Not only incredibly beautiful (despite that terribly unflattering hairstyle) with the most incredible cheekbones, she is also more than capable of playing the central role in the film. Tara is dignified and distant and, at the same time, allows us to see that Helen is still dangerously vulnerable. Rupert Graves is the depraved, but curiously attractive Arthur Huntingdon: after seeing him, I could never imagine another actor playing that role. Pam Ferris deserves a special mention for her role as Gilbert's indulgent mother, as well as the actress who played her sister Rose, and Simon Carter, who is the uncharitable vicar with a taste for the good things in life. Finally, I was able to watch this movie just for Toby Stephens; He is so handsome, robust, sexy, sensitive (but not in a nauseatingly sentimental way). I'm not even sure if he's a good actor, since my hormones prevent me from judging him objectively. <br /> <br /> If there is a flaw in the movie, it is the use of flashbacks that I felt that both interfered with the movie. Flow of history and made it a bit confusing. Other people who have seen this movie with me also had problems with this and I discovered that I had to explain to them that certain scenes were retrospective. <br /> <br /> I am extremely grateful to the people responsible for making this movie. Not only did I buy the video (something weird), but it took me to buy the magnificent novel by Anne Bronte. Naturally, this was better than the movie, but only by a narrow margin. I recommend that anyone interested watch the movie and then read the book in that order. <br /> <br />
