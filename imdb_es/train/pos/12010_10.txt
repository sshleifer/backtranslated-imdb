Warning: slight spoilers. <br /> <br /> The story of Joseph Smith stands out as an amazing, even moving, episode in American history and world religious history. This film portrays the events in the life of Joseph Smith, whom Mormons revere as the prophet of the restoration of the true Church of Jesus Christ on earth. So far I've seen the film twice in its first month of public screening. <br /> <br /> First Joseph Smith is shown as the youngest of a trio of brothers (Alvin, Hyrum and Joseph) who, in a Very young, needed an operation. The operation, done without our modern conveniences, was bloody and difficult. The scene helped show the cohesion of the Smith family and the bonds between the brothers and between Joseph and his parents. <br /> <br /> The religious confusion of Joseph and the subsequent prayer that led to what Mormons call the First Vision was portrayed in an interesting way. . Jesus' face is never shown, but you see the unmistakable nail marks on his hands. Rejection by religious leaders and many in their small New York community is at least slightly sweetened by Joseph's marriage to Emma. <br /> <br /> This film does not clearly describe the events in the history of the Mormon Church, but simply goes back to scene to scene. This is not a criticism, just a note on style. <br /> <br /> It shows the practice of spoiling and softening, and it is especially dramatic and moving when Joseph delivers a sermon on the Savior's love with a face full of scars. of having been attacked recently. <br /> <br /> The film masterfully portrays simultaneously the joy and growth of Mormonism as a children's church, while at the same time the increasingly deepening opposition that extended to the heights of local governments. <br /> <br /> The film shows many scenes of Joseph's life, including some beautiful moments that represent his relationship with Emma. It attempts to show the depth and complexity of Joseph's life, including his fierce love for his wife, his infinite love for children, his wit, his courage in the face of dirty and dangerous opposition, his religious feelings and his compassion. <br /> <br /> While Joseph and Hyrum travel to Carthage, not to return home alive, most of the characters in the film, whose lives were touched by Joseph, show up along the way, which helps reinforce what it was. already seen, but preparing the final scene to be more powerful. <br /> <br /> In the end, the martyrdom of Joseph and Hyrum is portrayed, and the spectators are left to reflect on the events they have just witnessed. <br /> <br /> When I first saw the film, I assumed it was made by the Church to introduce Joseph Smith to non-members. I do not think that's the case anymore, although I hope the movie can do just that. As an expert, I find that the film is a celebration of Joseph and excellently reinforces the good things we already know about him. I'm curious to see how strangers will see the film, whether it's simply as a propaganda, an epic story of an American religious or something else. <br /> <br /> The film is beautifully engraved, it is ideal for families, touching and, hopefully, something good for everyone. It is interesting to reflect on the many aspects of our culture, including the freedom of religious expression and respect (generally) for the law, which we modern people take for granted.
