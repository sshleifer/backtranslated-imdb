The last time I saw the film was about seven years old, so my opinions may have disappeared over time. At that time I enjoyed the filming that changed between cartoons and live action. At that moment I felt sad for the blue camel and its sad life. I also felt joy when after Captain Contagioso kidnapped the heroine (a princess or a toy shepherdess), the tables that were on him turned around. Unfortunately, the producers never decided to transfer this movie to VHS, so all I have are memories of twenty years. I'm sure that if I went back to see the movie, I would consider it corny and silly, but I really enjoyed it with the movie at that moment.
