['After graduating from high school, the best friends, Alice and Darlene, decide to travel to Thailand. While they are there, they meet a charming Australian boy named Nick. After spending some time with Nick, he asks them if they want to travel with him to Hong Kong for a weekend. They agree. However, at the airport, they are arrested for drug smuggling and then convicted for 33 years in a Thai prison for something they say they have not done. Without really knowing what to do, they end up contacting Yankee Hank, an American lawyer who lives in Thailand with his wife. It is said that if you have the money, he can help you. Things start well, but they still can not come out. <br /><br /> The film is really good because it does not show what is going to happen and it is interesting all the time. Although I could not believe the end. It was one of those endings in which you do not know 100% of the truth, but still you know what really happened with Nick and the drug trafficking due to the &quot;appropriation&quot;, etc. <br /><br /> Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale have good performances here. However, Beckinsales&#39;s performance was a bit weak. Both the friendship of the Danish and Beckinsales characters is good, but it might seem stronger. Paul Walker even has a small uncredited paper here. ;) <br /><br /> Anyway, I thought Brokedown Palace was a good movie and I give it a 7/10.']
