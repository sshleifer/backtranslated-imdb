I have a six month old baby at home and from time to time she sleeps very badly. One morning I was having a particularly difficult time to fall asleep when the song of the doodle theme bops hit the television. She stopped crying almost instantly, and for the rest of the program she was happy. I sat her in her inflatable seat and watched her kick her legs, swing her arms and really laugh at this show. They kept her entertained and happy all the time. I also got a video of them, so at times when my little one is nervous, I have something to calm her down. Of course, late at night, if you wake up with a cramp to complain, the doodles are not your cup of tea, but surely they are useful when I need a little time to do housework, etc. The biggest surprise about doodle dops is that my daughter does not even like to watch TV. He prefers to be on the floor playing with a toy or with our little toy poodle than watching television. However, the doodle dops have totally captured your attention. I do not know if she will continue to like her in the future, but for now she is attached.
