The first time I saw this movie was about 11 years ago, when my former accounting professor at the university recommended it to me. I was surprised that a 1968 film could portray computer crime in such a coherent and fun way. Maggie Smith is charming and Ustinov plays the "retro hacker" perfectly. "O Nolo Mio" !!!!!
