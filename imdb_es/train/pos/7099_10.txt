['The fantastic and twisted story of Terry Gilliam about a virus that destroys everyone, except a handful of people on Earth, that forces them to go underground and that the man sent in time to collect information is a fantastic movie, vertiginous and very stylized with Bruce The best performance of Willis ever. <br /><br /> What distinguishes 12 Monkeys from most time-travel science fiction films is that the Bruce Willis character actually deals with the psychological effects of time travel, that is, without knowing what reality is reality: the place where the traveler in time comes. In addition, the film recognizes that the things that have happened can not be altered and that the prevention of a cataclysmic event, in this case the release of said virus, can not be stopped or changed. As Willis affirms &quot;It already happened&quot;, while he is in a psychiatric hospital, the great dilemma in which the film is put is not an exaggerated and trite plot to save the world; instead, it is Willis&#39; inner struggle to simply survive himself. It&#39;s a new and innovative concept, and works perfectly thanks to a script written by Peoples and Gilliam&#39;s unique brand of dementia. <br /><br /> In addition to this, the 12 Monkey narrative is totally non-linear and, instead, it chooses to distort and deviate the way in which the story is told, skilfully incorporating different time sequences: flashbacks, dreams, memories, the present, the past , the future and even a scene that rises from the vertigo of Hitchcock. All serve to envelop the viewer in its disturbing cacophony of madness and uselessness. <br /><br /> Visually, Gilliam is a master of the desolation and shadow that rivals Tim Burton in his landscapes and surprisingly dejected images. With a cold, wide and enveloping cinematography, Gilliam immerses himself in the colorless environment and darkness of his characters. The scenes are often bathed in a strange antiseptic, dead white and serve as a contrast to the characters who often deviate from the madness. <br /><br /> In terms of performance, Brad Pitt steals most of the scenes, filling them with a crazy patented madness that earned him an Oscar nomination. As mentioned, Bruce Willis offers the best performance of his career, without resorting to his heroic clich√©s and cardboard heroes and, instead, presents Cole as a simple, moving and tragic man. Equally good is Madeline Stowe as the psychologist of Willis. She sustains herself, injecting her character with both wild energy and strength as she collapses under the weight of what she believes is a false &quot;religion.&quot; <br /><br /> The expert, overwhelming and complex Gilliam&#39;s handling of what could have been a routine action / science fiction movie makes 12 Monkeys a compelling vision of a nightmarish and futuristic landscape. Its rich, well thought out, intricate story, along with the bravery of the cast and its dark and somber cinematography, make it a masterpiece of madness. Ranking among my 10 best of all time, 12 Monkeys is a dark and luxurious show of a film full of brilliance. <br /><br /> 10 out of 10']
