Mild Spoilers <br /> <br /> In the near future, Arnold plays Ben Richards, an unjustly condemned man who is forced to play "The Running Man", a deadly television show in which people have to follow moving to try to escape and brutal. Deaths at the hands of the 'Stalkers'. Of course, people are expected to eventually die and it is up to Arnold to prove that the system does not work. <br /> <br /> I have not read Stephen King's book, but this is a great movie, however, one of Arnold's best. . He does what he does best in the role of the man of action, delivering death with unforgettable phrases. The classics are probably the "It was a real pain in the neck" after strangle a guy with barbed wire, and "He had to separate!", Referring to the whereabouts he just cut vertically to someone. Dawson is perfectly irritating as a TV presenter, and all the 'Stalkers' are conveniently in the camp. The action is violent, but it is an action movie. That is the point. The film has an accelerated pace and, at 90 minutes, does not stay too long in his welcome. <br /> <br /> With Paul Michael Glaser of Starsky and Hutch in the lead, and after the success of The Terminator, previously this movie was probably seen as a pointless action vehicle for Arnold, and it's very unlikely. . But today, anyone who watches a lot of television can see how the film is approaching reality. I would not be surprised if I turn on the television in the "near future" and see a program not far from this. <br /> <br /> On that depressing note, however I must recommend 'The Running Man' to anyone who likes the 80s, Arnold, ridiculous acts or violence or just a good action movie. 9. 5/10
