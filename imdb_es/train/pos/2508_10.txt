This movie is incredible. The plot was simply ... wow. <br /> <br /> I was very surprised by the performance of Gackt and Hyde, after growing up in the American world of actors who can not sing and singers who can not act. <br /> <br /> In this film, a young Sho (Gackt) meets a vampire, Kei (Hyde). Over time, they form an unlikely friendship. Kei is suffering from the way he is forced to live by others, the average life of a vampire. <br /> <br /> It's a sad movie, but it's not stupid. The plot was very unique, and contrary to your typical vampire movie. The plot was full of twists and turns and very fascinating. <br /> <br /> The only flaw I would say the film had, despite its lack of a happy, though peaceful, end would be its multiple languages. I had the unsubstituted version (I'm lucky to have understood it, except some of the Cantonese), so I would recommend getting something with subtitles. <br /> <br /> In general, the movie was simply amazing.
