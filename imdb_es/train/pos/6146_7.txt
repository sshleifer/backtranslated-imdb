Maybe Disney was expecting another Mary Poppins, but this is a very different story and, although Angela is charming, she was an artist very different from the great Julie Andrews. That said, Lansbury is perfectly cast and offers magical performance. There is something deliciously stained in his character and David Tomlinson gives him wonderful support. Tomilinson can carry a melody, but he's certainly not as good as a singer. It does not matter that he was such a talented actor that you barely notice. There are some great beloved star cameos from another era like Roddy McDowel, who gives a winning performance and the much loved Tessie OShea, who does very little, but it's good to see the old girl again. It is also lovely to see Sam Jaffe and the English television king Bruce Forsythe in small roles. The score has a couple of beautiful songs, especially The Briny Sea and The Age of Not Believing. The large number of Portabello Road has stretched to the limit, but has a lot of theatricality. The effects seem a bit clich√© today, but the scene with the German invaders being attacked by the wildest army in the movie is pretty impressive. Children are not as annoying as other movies, but one struggles to understand what the younger child says. I loved the marching song of the home army. The guard of the house was very important for Great Britain and this is a warm tribute. The animation is lovely, much better than Pixar, which I find grotesque. A warm and happy movie and it is a wonder that has not been done on stage.
