As someone else has already said here, every scene in this movie is a gem. Most movies are lucky to have a perfect scene, but director Jewison has a home run every time. The cast got the best interpretation of the excellent script and, in addition, the musical settings of Dick Hyman's opera and other music were created for a perfect combination. It's hard to imagine how they kept the precise mood throughout the production of a movie. The comedy is subtle (mostly), and the camera work reflects every little emotional inflection of the narrative. Cher is such a natural comedy, Vincent Gardenia (whom I know mainly through his role as Frank Lorenzo in All in the Family until I saw him in this and then on Broadway in the 80s) deserved a stardom much greater than ever had had, and Aiello Unlucky losers are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to congratulating this tremendous cast. Have you ever written Jewison about this movie? <br /> <br /> I would love to read it. It is difficult to understand why the average rating here in IMDb is so low ...
