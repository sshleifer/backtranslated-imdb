In a poor village in Mexico, the Colonel (Fernando Luján) lives with his asthmatic wife Lola (Marisa Paredes) in an old house. Lola still laments the death of her son Augustin some time ago. The colonel has been waiting for his wrestler's pension in a war against the Catholic Church for almost twenty-seven years. However, for political reasons, the current government wants to forget this old struggle. Without having any possession or money, but a valuable penny, they struggle to survive with the expectation of the government's recognition letter, recognizing the law and paying the pension in arrears. This slow and moving film reflects the social and financial situation of the majority of retired elderly people in third world countries. In Brazil, the majority of retired people have to survive with approximately US $ 80.00 per month. The colonel's debts in history were made to pay for a cemetery for his son, otherwise he would be buried as an indigent. Excellent performance of the cast, in a very sad story that is the reality in poor countries. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): (`Não se escreve ao Coronel ') (Do not write to the Colonel) <br /> <br />
