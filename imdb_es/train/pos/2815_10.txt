I can not believe what I see when I read many other comments and reviews. As if it were a mediocre movie of some ordinary uncles. <br /> <br /> The film is great, funny, crazy, violent, although with a minimum of gore, and all the way. Energetic to the core. I loved every part of it. I can not remember anything as crazy as this made for laughter and bragging martial art. And now the most important thing (at least for me): it has no computer effects. When I see some Hollywood actors on screen in high resolution modern action and damn "fuflo" (a Russian word meaning "bull * beep *"), I understand that any child * beep * can do it. - You can adjust the cables to the body, add some cute PC effects and put them in the action movie. Here is different. I do not think there are a dozen physically advanced action stars around the world who can repeat the fight that takes place at the end of the movie or the "Chinese football" play. And it's just a small cinema in Hong Kong made for fun, without pretending to be "Star Wars". <br /> <br /> Having a DVD with soundtrack in English is not a problem with this movie. It does not spoil the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> I can not stop mentioning a very neat play. Some of you, suppose, you will not like it. As for me, it's amazing. Take a look at the Dragon's friend who speaks bravely to the criminals and suddenly receives a punch on the left side of the head. The expression on his face becomes capricious and he approaches the Dragon with a baby expression. And take a look at the menacing size of her mouth: it's almost from one ear to the other when she grimaces. <br /> <br /> This movie deserves a higher rating and a thousand comments from people all over the world. . Very grateful to our Russian industry for the releases of the classic films of Jackie Chan. Their moderns are much weaker in my humble opinion and do not deserve much publicity. <br /> <br /> Total 10 of 10: a legendary film of its kind. Thanks for your attention.
