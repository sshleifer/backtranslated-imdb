Guinea pig: The devil's experiment is undoubtedly a ***** star at first sight, it is a raw, frightening and disturbing look on the dark side of human nature. This movie comes directly to the point, you may be thinking at what point? The point is to satisfy fans of extreme violence and gore. This movie has some blood, more or less violently torturing a woman. Actually, there are only 3 scenes that could be considered gore. However, I will tell you one thing, although the guinea pig: The devil experiment makes Hostile look like Sesame Street. If you thought that Hostile was a crazy movie of brutal and disturbing torture, then you have not seen half of it until you've seen Guinea Pig: The Devil Experiment. <br /> <br /> Film Rating 0-5, Gore 0- 10 <br /> <br /> Guinea Pig: The Devil Experiment (Uncut) ***** (7)
