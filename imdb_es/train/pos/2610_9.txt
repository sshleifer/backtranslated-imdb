In the ten years since Wildside was released, nothing has really come close to its quality in local production. This includes the two enjoyable but overrated Underbelly series, which have come to life in the recent criminal history of Sydney and Melbourne. The miniseries Blue Murder (which also starred Tony Martin, but as someone on the other side of the law) may be the exception. <br /> <br /> Wildside is repeating itself late at night on ABC. Having not seen the program in a long time, I am still impressed by its very human stories and characters. The cast is excellent: Tony Martin as a detective persecuted for the disappearance of his son, Rachael Blake (who later connected with Martin in real life) as a community worker who fights against alcoholism, and Alex Dimitriades as a young policeman whose vice Is the game. . Aaron Pederson, Jessica Napier, Mary Coustas (yes, Effie herself) and a young Abbie Cornish. <br /> <br /> they provided equally good support roles. The ABC inexplicably launched the first three episodes on DVD in a couple of years ago. The logic of this type of marketing surpasses me, but I guess it may have something to do with license disagreements with the original producers. <br /> <br /> A great series that has aged remarkably. We hope the ABC DVD department will agree. <br /> <br /> (According to a moderator on an ABC message board, some type of additional DVD release will be released in December 2009)
