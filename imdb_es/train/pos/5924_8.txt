['Woah It&#39;s one thing I can say about this movie. Personally, I am one of those people who love cats, so that would have been a great inconvenience for the movie, but I loved the way that everyone&#39;s cats took revenge at the end. <br /><br /> I liked the movie, but I must admit it was because I found Brian Krause, who played Charles Brady as very irresistible, I guess lust overcame me while watching this movie. <br /><br /> There was one thing that disappointed me. I&#39;ve seen Charmed before and Brian Krause is married to Holly Marie Combs, his kissing scene was fine in Sleepwalkers, but really bad compared to his kissing scenes with Holly Marie Combs, I do not know if it&#39;s because Krause and Combs have Great chemistry or maybe a little more, that was the only disappointment in the movie, but I think it was compensated with Brian Krause in those skinny jeans that he wore in the movie. <br /><br /> If you&#39;re used to seeing Brian Krause as the heavenly husband of Holly Marie Combs and the father of your son, a big surprise awaits you with this movie, it did not look at all like the angle boy. Although now that I think about it, it would be great to see that the character of Krause in Charmed took over the evil and became something like his in Sleepwalkers. <br /><br /> I also have to say that the music was GREAT in this movie too!']
