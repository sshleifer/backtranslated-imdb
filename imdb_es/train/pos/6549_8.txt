Taking old collections of stories represents a challenge for the production team, how can you update this classic character and make it interesting enough to capture a new audience while removing memories from your previous audience? In my opinion, his mission was fulfilled. A must see for young children, pre-teens, teenagers and their parents. Okay, there are a couple of moments of fear that resolve in a short time, but parents with small children should be calm, the film moves towards better things. I am going to accompany those astute users who point out that Emma Roberts offers us a positive model for young women, and that it is not. Nancy balances her femininity with her research skills. I like it a lot here, it laughs, it does not take itself too seriously, it's a real mystery to solve (one that you can imagine as an additional bonus, and nice characters.) Nancy Drew even makes a good date for the movie in my opinion) .
