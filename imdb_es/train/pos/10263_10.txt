"House of Games" is an impeccably constructed movie, and one of the few movies I've seen has left me speechless at the screen with astonishment at how ingeniously and unexpectedly it ends. I saw it for the first time in a video a few years ago after reading the review by Roger Ebert, who proclaimed it as the best movie of 1987. I had my doubts, mainly because it is not as well known as other films of that year. Boy, I was in a surprise. This was one of the most intelligent and best-written films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The script is a pretty big job, not only in terms of the plot (which rotates and rotates and pulls the carpet) just below you just when you think you have it all solved), but also in terms of character development. On my second visit, I began to realize that Mamet's script succeeds not only as a clever suspense film, but that each development of the plot contributes to our understanding of the characters and their motivations. The climax of the film is particularly effective, because it is absolutely inevitable. It derives naturally from what we know about the characters and, therefore, is much more than a simple arbitrary turn. The performances of Lindsay Crouse and Joe Mantegna also contribute enormously to the film. I can not imagine any other actor besides Mantegna playing the role of Mike, and Crouse plays his role with just the right amount of restraint to suggest a suppressed criminal mentality. His work, plus Mamet's extraordinary script, combine to create one of the best films of the eighties. It is really a must see.
