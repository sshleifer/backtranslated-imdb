As I have noticed with many comments on IMDb, some critics seem to demand that every movie they see have clever and deceptive arguments that wallow in their own intelligence. I'm not one of those people. If I watch an action movie, I want to see explosions, shots and heroic acts. If I see a comedy, I want to have tears of laughter in my eyes. You have the idea Therefore, watching a horror movie, I mainly want to be afraid. The Grudge is a very scary movie, in both scenes of well-executed "jumps" and spooky images. I've been a fan of horror movies for many years, and I'm talking about teachers like Dario Argento, rather than directors of some of the horror movies for teenagers that are produced right now. If you want to be scared, watch this movie. Much more terrifying than the original Japanese 'Ring' (which I also think is a great movie).
