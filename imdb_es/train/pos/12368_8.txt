['I had the TV on for a white noise buddy and I heard &quot;$ 400 for a fully furnished apartment.&quot; So I ran to the TV room waiting for another movie from the 70s and got a lot more. Fortunately, I could go back to the beginning (DVR buffer) and press the record button to see it completely. (Cinemax without cuts and in HD, no less!) Apart from some holes in the history and the intermittent improbable events / dialogues, this is an effective A thriller worthy of your time to see. Pretty spooky and progressive at times: the character of Beverly D&#39;Angelo masturbates in front of Alison Parker, skillfully interpreted by Cristina Raines, Parker stabs, in a very bloody way, his father, an explicit menage in a scene of trios. (Do not let the kids watch) The movie is TOTALLY 70 full of bad clothes (polyester suits and sticky ascots) and decoration, bad hair, too bloated music and family-looking cinematography. The cast is excellent, take a second on the homepage of this movie to see it. It was a surprise to see Christopher Walken, Jerry Orbach and Jeff Goldblum so young. Sylvia Miles - always wonderfully spooky! ENJOY!']
