This movie improved my opinion of Errol Flynn. Although Flynn is, of course, best known for his savoir-faire and sprezzatura (for a couple of high-falutin European terms!), This film gives him the opportunity to stretch (if only a little) as an actor, while playing a brazen social climber with a big ego and a sense of nerve to match. The cast is excellent; Everyone seems well chosen for their roles. <br /> <br /> History moves energetically and, although it is not particularly profound (the opportunity to make social comments about the massively unequal distribution of income during that time is lost, perhaps intentionally), it certainly entertains and satisfies. From what I know of Jim Corbett, the story is also reasonably true to the story. I also liked the great representations of the 1880s in San Francisco. In general, there's nothing I do not like about this movie ... it's worth seeing.
