I do not doubt that the critics took this film, especially art fans who need a laxative. This is a great movie of vehicles in the tradition of Abbot & Costello or, more recently, of Don Knotts. It will not shake the world or change the movies forever. What it will do is entertain. When everything is said and done, that is the most important thing anyway. Watch this movie and forget your problems. It even has a simple and friendly moral message at no additional charge. I always loved Elvira's television show when I lived in Los Angeles. She really did not steal her Vampira ability more than Vampira from the original, Theda Bara. This type of mythical character belongs to whoever does it best; And Cassandra Peterson does it better. Long live Elvira; We need more of this kind of movies. There is never enough. The villain, William Morgan Sheppard, was also excellent. He exudes a wonderful refined malice. I could not find technical flaws. The execution is as impeccable as the artistic form. My deep praise for the director, James Signorelli, and his entire crew.
