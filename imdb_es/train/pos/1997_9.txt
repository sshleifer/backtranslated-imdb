As a Dickens fanatic throughout my life, I have invariably been disappointed by the adaptations of his novels. <br /> <br /> Although his works presented an extremely accurate description of human life at all levels in Victorian Britain, in all of them he was a dominant thread of humor that could be both playful and sarcastic as dictated by the narrative . In a way, he was a caricaturist and literary draftsman. He could be serious and hilarious in the same sentence. He stung pride, arrogance, celebrated modesty and empathized with loneliness and poverty. It may be a clich√©, but he was a popular writer. <br /> <br /> And it is the comedy that often lacks in its interpretations. At the time of writing this article, Oliver Twist is dramatizing serially on BBC television. All the misery and cruelty are his, but not of humor, irony and wild intoxication. The result is only a dark and somber experience: the story written by a journalist instead of a novelist. Actually, it's not Dickens. <br /> <br /> 'Oliver!', on the other hand, is much closer to the brand. The mockery of officialdom is interpreted to perfection, from the bulky center to the drunken magistrate. The classic confrontation between the heel and Mr. Brownlow, in which the law is described as "an imbecile, an idiot," could not have been done better. Harry Secombe is an ideal choice. <br /> <br /> But the blinding cruelty is also there, the callous indifference of the state, the cold, the hunger, the poverty and the loneliness are presented with the same certainty that the Master would have wanted. <br /> <br /> And then there is the crime. Ron Moody is a treasure like the near deaf Jewish, while Oliver Reid has Bill Sykes to perfection. <br /> <br /> It may not be surprising that Lionel Bart, himself a Jew from the east end of London, takes a liberty with Fagin. reinterpreting it as a much more benign type than Dicken's original. In the novel, he was completely ruthless, sending some of his own children to the gallows to protect himself (although he was also caught and hanged). While in the film, he is presented as a capricious father figure, a kind of charitable thief instead of a corrupter of children, the latter is a long-standing anti-Semitic feeling. Otherwise, very few liberties are taken with Dickens's original. All the most memorable elements are included. Threats and violence are preserved enough to guarantee narrative fidelity and, at the same time, allow the sensitivity of children. Nancy is still beaten to death, Bullseye narrowly escapes drowning, and Bill Sykes gets a graphically faithful breakthrough. <br /> <br /> All the songs are excellent, although they are inclined towards confusion. Mark Lester imitates it beautifully. Both his favorite scene and mine is one in which the world comes alive to "who will buy". It's crap, but it's Dickens from start to finish. <br /> <br /> I could go on. I could congratulate the wonderful set-pieces, the contrast of rich and poor. There is a high quality performance of more British regulars than you could shake a stick at. <br /> <br /> I should give you 10 points, but I feel more like Scrooge today. Soak up your Christmas dinner. No original has been made better.
