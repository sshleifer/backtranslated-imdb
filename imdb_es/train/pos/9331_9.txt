This movie was last week and, although at that time of the day (around 6 p.m.) The quality of the movies is almost never good (at least here on Mexican television), I could not turn off the television. The story about Madelene Moore really touches you. At first he does not present himself as a very nice character, but when you watch the whole movie, you just want her to be successful. This movie really leaves you thinking. And I think it's basically due to the great performance of Brooke Johnson. I had never heard of her before or knowingly had seen her in another movie, but it was a great performance. Congratulations to Brooke. I hope to see you soon in another movie.
