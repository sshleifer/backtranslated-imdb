In Manhattan, the middle class American Jim Blandings (Cary Grant) lives with his wife Muriel (Myrna Loy) and two teenage daughters in a rented apartment with four bedrooms and a bathroom. Jim works in an advertising agency that raises US $ 15,000 a year and feels uncomfortable in his apartment due to lack of space. When you see an advertisement for a large house for sale in the country of Connecticut at an affordable price, you drive with your wife and the real estate agent and decide to buy the old house without any technical advice. His best friend and lawyer Bill Cole (Melvyn Douglas) sends a well-known engineer to inspect the house, and the man tells him that he should leave the house and build another one. Jim verifies the information with other engineers and everyone condemns the place and, sooner, discovers that he bought a "money pit" instead of a dream house. <br /> <br /> "Mr. Blandings builds his own house" is an extremely funny comedy, with witty lines and a first-class script. Cary Grant is hilarious in the role of a man driven by the urge to achieve with the American Dream of owning a huge house that he finds that he made a bad choice, while losing his touch in his work and feeling jealous of his friend. In 1986, Tom Hanks worked on a very funny movie, visibly inspired by this charming classic, "The Money Pit". My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Lar, Meu Tormento" ("Home, My Torment")
