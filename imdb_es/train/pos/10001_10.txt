Brilliant acting excess by Lesley Ann Warren. The best dramatic hobo lady I've seen, and the love scenes in the clothing store are second to none. The corn on the face is a classic, as good as anything in Blazing Saddles. The taking of lawyers is also excellent. After being accused of being a coat, selling his boss and being dishonest, Pepto Bolt's lawyer shrugs indifferently: "I'm a lawyer," he says. Three funny words. Jeffrey Tambor, a favorite of Larry Sanders' latest show, is also fantastic here as a crazy millionaire who wants to crush the ghetto. His character is more malevolent than usual. The scene of the hospital and the scene in which the homeless invade a demolition site are classics of all time. Look for the scene of the legs and the two big diggers fighting (one bleeds). This film improves every time I see it (which is quite frequent).
