The autobiography on which this film is based is still one of the most heartbreaking books I have read. Tell the incredible stories of two sisters, both of whom earned devotion and respect by working well in their 70s as a teacher and dentist, then lived another 30 years with dignity. Ruby Dee steals the film with her performance perfectly nuanced as the rebellious "black" Bessie, the dentist. She not only expresses well her anger, anguish and wisdom; She lets you know exactly where they are coming from using an economy of words. Diahnn Carroll has the feeling that the older sister, the teacher, feels perfect, but I'm afraid she never makes me believe that she is more than 100 years old. It does not matter, it's worth telling the stories. Amy Madigan is a bit too extreme and intrusive in acting overwhelmed and insecure in the first half of the film as a NYC reporter. This, too, is just a minor distraction. The stories, all true, are attractive and, although two or three are damaged a bit in the translation, most do very well. <br /> <br /> I recommend the book as essential reading for all the people I recommend. Any book I can not stop watching this TV movie with that rarefied air, but it certainly captures enough flavor to make it worthwhile on its own.
