This is a modest comedy, based on characters, filmed in Brazil with a low budget. The premise is familiar, the same as in the Danny Kaye movie of the 1950s ** On the Double **: someone who, as a joke, gives the impression that a famous person is attacked to personify the real person . <br /> <br /> The contrast between the two cables is highly effective. Raul Julia, like the German secret police-parador, is tall, cool, threatening and Latino. He sports a deliberately obvious blond dye job. Richard Dreyfus, animated, short, Jewish from New York, is fun and friendly. There are many references and internal jokes about the entertainment business. <br /> <br /> The environment is clearly modeled in Paraguay. In fact, Paraguay was governed from the beginning of the fifties until the end of the eighties by General Alfredo Stroessner, an unelected military dictator whose father had emigrated from Germany. But the writer / director Mazurszky reveals his ignorance of local conditions when he paints Parador / Paraguay as a typical Latin American tyranny, with huge disparities in wealth and an active guerrilla insurgency. More in this regard, Mazursky presents comedian Jonathan Winters as an American retiree who is actually C.I.A. station manager at Parador and a figure so powerful that he can give the president of the country a mocking reproach. <br /> <br /> In fact, the United States has little influence in Paraguay, which is largely without the social and racial tensions that are observed in other parts of the region. This is because the country has waged long and costly wars against much larger neighbors in the 19th and 20th centuries. The male population was almost eliminated on both occasions, but the society that emerged was patriotic, racially homogeneous and strongly united. <br /> <br /> On another level, there is a link to feminism in the form of the Madonna character. Performed by the Brazilian actress Sonia Braga, Madonna is a former nightclub dancer who, at the beginning of the film, is a child of presidential pleasure with a lot of body, but is seen on television as president at the end. Now it is politically and aesthetically correct, without makeup or hair. retired, dragged into office by a velvet revolution. <br /> <br /> The only time an event of this kind really happened in Latin America, the administration of the Argentine Isabel Perón (not the beloved Evita, who never held the position) lasted two years after the death of her husband, the legendary ** supreme ** Juan Perón.
