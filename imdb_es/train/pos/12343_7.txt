Artistically speaking, this is a beautiful film: the cinematography, the music and the costumes are precious. In fact, this movie is more beautiful than those directed by Akira Kurasawa himself. In this case, he only wrote the movie as he did several years after his death. <br /> <br /> So, in terms of writing, the dialogue was well written and the story, at times, was interesting. However, the story was also quite depressing but without involvement in any way; After all, it is the story of a group of women who work in a brothel. It is interesting that although prostitution has been seen as a much more acceptable business in Japan, women still yearn for a better life. This reminds me a lot of the movie Streets of Shame, although the characters in Streets Of Shame are much less pleasant and more one-dimensional. <br /> <br /> Then, in general, you get a 7, mainly because of everything BUT the writing. It is a pity that the weakest link in this film is the story of the great Kurasawa.
