Unlike the person mentioned above, I felt that this movie was very funny, particularly in scenes where there is a lot of confusion. I do not want to give the plot and the story to people who have not seen it yet, but I will say that Paresh Rawal does not have a role as extensive as Priyadarshan's previous films, for example, Hera Pheri and Hungama. Paresh Rawal plays an amazing part in the small role given to him, John Abraham does just as well, Akshay Kumar has shown that he is no less in this film than he had done with Waqt and almost all his films after Andaaz. Even though the three heroines in this movie were in a debut, they did a very good acting job, particularly Nargis, who is very good and sexy. I would say that if you liked Hungama or Hera Pheri, this movie is a must.
