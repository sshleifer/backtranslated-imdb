This is the epitome of the fairy tale! The villains are completely evil and the heroes are refreshingly pure. Danes, Deniro and Pfieffer are wonderful, as well as the new actor who plays the role of Tristan. Outstanding performances, charming magic, fun and dramatic, and a perfect fairytale ending make this film absolutely fabulous. I'm not sure that all the content is appropriate for younger children, but for a larger audience, there are many hilarious subtleties! The previews do not do justice to this movie! My fiance and I were quite skeptical, but we were so excited that we had risked this movie, and I can only assure this person that he is about to see this movie to try!
