This movie has a lot of raw potential. The script is sharp, the dialogue is (generally) excellent (although Cheezy's voices could be lost), the direction and the cinematography are surprisingly good, although part of the experimentation simply does not work. The main problem here is David Duchovny. Once a geeky guy, always a geeky guy; and the sad and simple fact is that he is incapable of playing anything other than Fox Mulder. Postures, try to be cunning, pose, try to be macho. In the end, he simply tries too hard. He surpasses his character, exalts his lines, and is surpassed by Timothy Hutton and Angelina Jolie, who are each in a superior class in terms of acting ability. Timothy Hutton was (as always) really good. There was a moment or two in which he dramatized his role too much, but you could say he was having fun with him. He looked at the part, and became the character both physically and atmospherically. Angelina Jolie was also very good. She did not have much paper; in fact, I thought that she could have used a stronger one ... her character was not developed enough, although she did remarkably well with what she had. And the chemistry between her and Hutton was obvious (wow, maybe that's why Uma left him ...;) In general, it was rough, but it was a solid effort on the part of a good cast and great supporting roles. If David Duchovny had not torn his paper, it would have been much better. 7/10.
