I thought that Mukhsin has been written beautifully. It's not just entertainment. There are tons of subtle messages that I think Yasmin was trying to convey. And yes, it could be confusing for some of you (especially if you did not see Sepet and / or Gubra 76 times). <br /> <br /> I bet you noticed how they use the characters from the two movies before. Right? It's really ironic how the characters relate. As the bossy neighbor is that prostitute of Gubra. And the chick on the pool pad turns out to be the religious and the wife of the pious man in the future. <br /> <br /> And I love the voice-overs. It is raw but wakes up fresh. Like, when they took a picture of Rumah Tumpangan Gamin's sign, suddenly Mukhsin's voice was heard saying 'Bismillahhirrahmannirrahim ...' (the scene in which he climbed the tree). <br /> <br /> He captured the attitude of Malaysia (and somehow soft, laughing at how pathetic he is, portrayed in the character.) For example, even children can be really sharp (with a high-pitched, annoying voice) and just plain bad for the whole movie, and how can you be so busy and talk about people, when your own life is not resolved. <br /> <br /> All I can say is that this movie totally reached my expectation if he did not get over it. <br /> <br /> He kept me on the screen, I could not even look away from her, not even to kiss at the movies.
