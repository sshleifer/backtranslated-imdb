When tradition dictates that an artist must pass on his great skills and magic to an heir, the proud old street artist, known as "The King of Masks," becomes desperate for a young apprentice to adopt and cultivate. <br /> <br /> His warmth and humanity, however, find him paying a few dollars for a small person displaced by China's devastating natural disasters, in this case, a massive flood in the 1930s. <br /> <br /> takes his new 7-year-old companion to his floating house of straw, to live with his precious and precious monkey, "General", only to discover that the son is a girl. <br /> <br /> His life is transformed instantly, as the love he feels for this little slave is intertwined with the stupid tradition that forces him to transmit his art only to a young man. <br /> <br /> There are many stories within this. ... many people are moved, and the culture of China is opened for our Western eye to observe. Thousands of years of inheritance are reduced to a cup of drama, and few will abandon this DVD with dry eyes. <br /> <br /> The technical transfer itself is not so good, since I found the sound levels all over the meter, and I could actually see the video transfer lines in various parts of the movie. Highly recommended :-) 9/10 stars.
