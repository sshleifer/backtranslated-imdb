This film has a cast of stars, John Candy, Richard Lewis, Ornella Mutti, Cybill Shepard and Jim Belushi, to name a few, they are crazy in Monte Carlo, as well as in other beautiful European places, and it's a lot of fun. The problem that everyone gets into when they lie to protect themselves is great, and I recommend that you watch this movie, it's worth it! John Candy is in top form in Once Upon A Crime, like everyone else! If you and your family are looking for a great family movie, this is your ticket. All offer stellar performances, great acting, great comedy and great timing, which is rare in movies these days. Great argument, great mystery (which, anyway, I love) and, in general, it is well worth the money spent on it. Get the children, take some popcorn, juice or tea, or sodas, and enjoy the show !!!!
