For the attention of Chuck Davis and Emefy: I saw PHANTOM LADY many years ago, when I was not yet a jazz enthusiast. There is an exhibition that runs until the end of June at the new MUSEE DU QUAI BRANLY in Paris, called LE SIECLE DU JAZZ, which should not be missed, with NINE special extracts from jazz films, including the famous PHANTOM LADY drum sequence. I have seen Gene Krupa, and Elisha Cook Jr, in almost all of her film appearances, and I can confirm the following: 1. Elisha Cook Jr was BENT in the movie. That was a step forward, since in most of his other appearances he was MURDERED (mainly in THE BIG SLEEP by Howard Hawks). 2. Krupa probably nicknamed Cook in PL. He could recognize his style, since he had already graduated from the tom-tom used (and abused) at the beginning of his career, namely, in the sequence SING, SING, SING of Hollywood HOTEL of 1937 and finally obtained everything that was possible of what we Convocation in French "la caisse claire". 3. The PL sequence, at least as shown in the Museum, is not censored. Harry carasso, Paris, France
