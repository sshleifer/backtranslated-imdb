When I heard this movie, I thought it would be another movie for girls. I was wrong. This movie sends a powerful message about judging others. I was deeply moved. All that I have found, I have recommended this movie. No one has returned saying it was bad. Busy, he also did a great job with his role in this movie. I do not know much about her acting career, but wow, the way she achieved the ending was incredible. <br /> <br /> At first it was a bit slow. But after she went to the hospital ... wow, the movie resumes. I have no idea why this movie has not been mentioned in the world of cinema. My wish would be that this film is released again and announced more ... because it sends a powerful message in only an hour and a half.
