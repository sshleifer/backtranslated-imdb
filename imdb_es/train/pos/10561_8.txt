089: Footlight Parade (1933) - released on 9/30/1933, seen on 5/5/07. <br /> <br /> The ice cream cone was invented in New York. <br /> <br /> KEVIN: After a long and busy break, we played another Busby Berkeley musical from Warner Bros. This time it's the ultra-fast step of Footlight Parade, starring James Cagney as the giant theater producer Chester Kent . I am 100% sure that Cagney was channeling Berkeley with his performance of the irrepressible Kent, who has to provide new ideas for the performances every minute. Joan Blondell is also excellent as the acid language secretary turned into a love interest. The secondary plot of Ruby Keeler / Dick Powell is not as important this time, but no less pleasant. One thing that puzzled me were the Berkeley performances themselves, which seemed to be too extravagant and complex to be performed on any stage, much less on a stage that would later show a movie. Obviously, Busby does not let a little thing like a story stop him from gathering the most exaggerated musical numbers he can conjure. I liked most of this movie until the end, with the blatantly offensive "Shanghai Lil", which, as you can guess, is almost like a stomach twist when nasty racial acts arrive. <br /> <br /> DOUG: Six films in three months. It has to be a new album. Anyway this completes Warner Bros. 'Musical Trilogy of 1933, preceded by' 42nd Street 'and' Gold Diggers of 1933 '. I would definitely recommend seeing the three in a row. I wonder if James Cagney was channeling Busby Berkeley while playing Chester Kent in this movie, or if the written paper was inspired by Busby. I hope it was; It seems to make sense that Berkeley is the kind of person who would see elaborate dances in everyday events as Chester does. The funny thing about Cagney was that he really did not seem like a prominent man in the traditional sense. He was 5'7 "square-headed and spoke with a strange New York accent, but the guy was quite versatile, ranging from the poisonous gangsters who made him so famous to the fast-talking producers we see here. important man in the body of a character actor.The rest of the cast has some familiar faces, Joan Blondell returns and almost steals the show as the loyal and luxurious secretary of Cagney, Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler play The cute couple, but it seems have less time on the screen than before, Billy Barty appears again as the imp rogue. The film is typical of the most spicy and adult-oriented musicals of the pre-Code era, as opposed to those of the 50s and 60s. more family oriented, and it's an excellent climax of Warner's musicals that year (the "Shanghai Lil" number does not resist, with Keeler doing a seemingly Chinese job). <br /> <br /> Ãšl Tima movie: Dinner At Eight (1933). Next movie: I'm No Angel (1933).
