The film took a new angle in the life of Gandhi, which is nice to see and shows how human it was. His relationship with Harilal is something that worried Gandhi and he mentioned him several times as his failure as a father in his autobiography. <br /> <br /> My big complaint is that I thought Gandhi was surprisingly uncharismatic in the movie. It could have been better acted by the person Gandhi played. Some of Gandhi's statements seemed too smug and it seemed as if he had been portrayed intentionally in a negative way in some parts of the film. <br /> <br /> The film is not really complete, but focuses only on the relationship of father and son. The rest is blurred and is only used to show the time period and the general settings of the movie. <br /> <br /> In general, it is a good movie if you take into account that it is not a complete image.
