['But how can you face a baseball team that can not win? For George Knox, it&#39;s not easy. When the film begins, Roger Beaumont (Joseph-Gordon-Levitt) and his best friend JP (Milton Davis Jr.) ride their bicycles around the stadium of the angels. When they return to the home of his adoptive mother, Roger is surprised to receive the visit of his father (Dermot Mulroney). Your mom is dead! And when he asks his father when they will be a family again, he jokes: &quot;I say when the angels win the division championship.&quot; Later, Roger and JP hide in a tree to watch the angels play baseball. When manager George Knox (Danny Glover) pulls out his pitcher, the pitcher gets angry and fights with him, and soon the team of angels gets into the fight that causes Knox to be expelled from the game. That night Roger makes a prayer, so that the angles win the championship. When his adoptive mother, Maggie Nelson (Brenda Ficker) agrees that Roger and JP are going to play basball, Roger sees real angles on the field and helps the left fielder (Matthew McConaughey) to catch, which leaves the manger and to play-by-man game (Jay.O Sanders) how he did that. Roger learns from the angel&#39;s head (Christopher Lloyd) that only he can see the angles, because he was the only one who prayed for help. <br /><br /> 10/10']
