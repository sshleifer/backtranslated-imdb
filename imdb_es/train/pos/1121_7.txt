Here is a real weirdo for you. It starts with another takeoff at the PSYCHO shower scene, on campus, and then it gets more crazy when several students and their boyfriends head south towards spring break. The problem begins when they drive to Redneck County ruled by the homicidal Dean Sheriff. One of the girls at the university wanders through the woods, witnesses a murder by the sheriff and has an open head. Then, it's time to start the MACON COUNTY LINE, while Dean stalks, catches and kills witty witnesses one by one. Tony March is on target as the evil and happy Dean. The general tone of the film is really disturbing. The ending is so abrupt that you almost think that the director was left without a movie; It is also a study in despair. SHALLOW GRAVE is a must for misanthropes, misogynists and nihilists around the world.
