This was an adorable movie. A true movie to feel good when you need it. The story is light (this has not gone with the wind) but sometimes, this kind of plot is needed. The fun and warm characters, the fantastic acting and beautiful costumes / costumes. <br /> <br /> Parminder K. Nagra (also from the TV show ER) is WONDERFUL in this role. She is definitely a bright new star for Hollywood. Everyone should watch her, it's going to be BIG in the future. <br /> <br /> It also impressed the soundtrack of this movie. A good mix of modern and Indian songs. I was dancing for most of the movie. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended if what you need is a funny movie.
