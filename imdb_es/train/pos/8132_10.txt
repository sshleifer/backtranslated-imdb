I do not remember when I first heard about this movie, but I rented it about six years ago and it's still one of my favorite comedies. I admit that you will probably despise this movie if you do not know anything about rap music. But if you're a fan of rap, even if it's casual, you'll love the jokes and internal references. One of the best lines of the film is the difference between a b **** and a h **; I still use this line today and I laugh a lot with it. One of the best performances comes from Larry Scott, who played the nerd Lamar in 'Revenge of the Nerds'. It's unfortunate that this movie probably never gets a DVD release.
