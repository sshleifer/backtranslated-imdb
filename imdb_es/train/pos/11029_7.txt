I am far from being a fan of Sylvester Stallone and I think the only time I really appreciated his appearance was in the French movie Taxi 3, which is a small paper almost nonexistent. And yet, I must admit that this movie was not really that bad, although I feared the worst. <br /> <br /> When Gabe (Stallone) fails to rescue the girlfriend of one of his friends and she rushes to death. from a 4000-foot-high mountaintop, he can not force himself to continue working as a mountain ranger. For almost a year he does not put food in the reserve, but then he comes back. Shortly after returning, they receive an emergency call from a group of hikers who were trapped in a snowstorm. At least, that's what the rangers think. In fact, it is a group of thieves who crashed with their plane into the mountains after their daring plan to steal cases full of money from a flying government plane failed. The cases spread throughout the reserve and need the help of professional climbers to recover them ... <br /> <br /> This is not, of course, one of the most intelligent movies in history, but in its genre it is nice one. I especially enjoyed John Lithgow as the evil mind and leader of the band of thieves. I know him better from the television series "3rd Rock from the Sun", but I also enjoyed his performance in this movie. In general, the performance is fine, it had a lot of action to offer and, of course, also some phrases of a single line, but it also offered a very nice decoration. This movie was filmed in a magnificent natural environment. I loved the mountains and snowy valleys, the mountain rivers and the forests ... Maybe that's why I give this movie a higher score than I normally give to an action / adventure movie of this kind. I give it a 6.5 / 10. If you do not wait too long, this is a nice movie.
