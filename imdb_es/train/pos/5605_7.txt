This rarity of Roman Polanski clearly shows where his worries were at the time he did it. Polanski himself plays a shy man who rents a Parisian apartment where the previous tenant committed suicide. She becomes obsessed with discovering what led her to it, to the point that she is dressing with the drag and representing the events in the way they might have developed. The film is disturbing to a certain extent, and it has that creepy scary atmosphere in which Polanski stands out, but it looks too much like a rehash of "Rosemary's Baby" and "Repulsion", two other best Polanski films that deal with the mysterious events. in apartments in a bad mood. <br /> <br /> But as for the concern ... unless I'm reading too much in the movie, I have to believe that this was Polanksi's reaction to the feelings of persecution he felt at Being labeled as a sexual pervert and exiled from America. I'm not making a judgment about him one way or another, but it's hard to deny the evidence of that in the movie itself. <br /> <br /> Grade: B +
