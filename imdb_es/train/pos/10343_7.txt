The "Amazing Mr. Williams" stars Melvyn Douglas, who made five films in 1939, one of which was Ninotchka with Garbo. His co-star was Joan Blondell (Maxine), who ALSO made five films that year, THREE of which they did together! Douglas is Lieutenant Williams, and he and his companions are presented with a corpse, and they must find out what really happened. The spectators will recognize their co-workers: the actors (Clarence Kolb, Donald MacBride, Don Beddoe) always held positions of authority ... senators, bank presidents, policemen. This imbecile has a comedy gift: cops always shoot each other, and even Williams and his girlfriend are fighting verbally. Some fun jokes: Williams even takes the man they arrested to a date with his girlfriend. There are many fun things here, so get over the slow start and expect the funniest things later. I do not want to give away any spoilers, so you'll have to catch it in Turner Classic Movies. The director Alexander Hall did mostly comedies and reportedly engaged with Lucy at some point.
