['Edmund Burke said that &quot;all bad needs are for the good to do nothing&quot;. Hollywood often gives us crap because there are not enough families to watch quality movies. This film was an uplifting story of the loss and restoration of faith. He had no violence, no lasciviousness, and he did not deserve a PG rating. The western landscape was filmed well, and some of the views were simply stunning. The actors were a bit young for their part, but otherwise credible and talented. The musical score was too high, and in some places it completely drowned out the dialogue. I almost never get surprised by the end of the movies, but I was pleasantly surprised by this. Sometimes good people win, and earn by honest efforts. We liked the movie and the message, and we would recommend it to the whole family.']
