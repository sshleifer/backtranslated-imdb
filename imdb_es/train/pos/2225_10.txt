I am completely surprised that this program has been canceled. Its duration lasted only one year. I recently started seeing it and I love it. It's a program that could have gone as far as they went to Friends. I had humor and it was extremely nice. <br /> <br /> These are 2 brothers and 2 sisters who live under the same roof without their parents. Kurt (Joey Lawrence) plays the role of the older brother and assumes the most paternal role. <br /> <br /> This should have lasted much longer than the year since it was fantastic. Spectacular show with the best actors. <br /> <br /> 10/10
