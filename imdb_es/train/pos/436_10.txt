I really liked that movie. I'm not even sure what I like, but I think it was wonderful and should be available for DVD. The women were strange, and yet they got along well enough to spend the time they did at the Villa in Italy. The actors, in my opinion, did an excellent job. The characters were so different and, at the same time, intelligent, a story that made it work. There are problems of humor, drama and relationships in time. This requires 10 lines, but I can not think of anything else to say, so I'll just recite until I get 10 lines. I'm very sorry for this. What else can I say that it's been a long time since I last saw it? I'm looking forward to seeing it again but it's not available.
