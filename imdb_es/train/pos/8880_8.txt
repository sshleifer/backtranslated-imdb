Of life in (some) schools. Of course, artistic licenses were taken, but some of what you saw in this film continues in some universities. <br /> <br /> I went to universities in Southern California, where the races practically match yours. It's funny because these are schools that want racial unity, equality, etc., and I can honestly say it's there. But the problem is that when the class ends, or when they are just waiting for the class, they (the students) seem to be with people of their own race or ethnicity. Is it so bad? Not really. Everyone needs a feeling of belonging. But as the school newspaper of one of the schools that I attended once I wrote about that, "we should all try to relate to students from other ethnic groups and try to get to know them." Otherwise, you are creating your own segregation. <br /> <br /> Racism certainly existed in one of those schools that I attended. Once, someone placed leaflets on the campus talking about the glories of the Aryan Race and had the symbols of some of those racist organizations. Fortunately, nothing happened like the incident in the movie where the young white man went and started shooting at a multiculturalism meeting. <br /> <br /> I can only wait and pray for nothing like that to happen. <Br /> <br /> So, "Higher Learning" is too dramatic? Exaggerated? Perhaps. Is it the "out of place" way? It depends on where you went or to school. The race where the ethnic groups simply stay with their own DOES happen. Except for Hollywood hype, the race hit me pretty close to home.
