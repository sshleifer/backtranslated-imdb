This is a well-made documentary about the exciting world of Indy car racing. Photography is simply exceptional. The scene in which Mario Andretti drives the old roadster racing down New England street bordered by old maples, leaves aside the speed of the car, is incredible. The film loses some of its beauty on the small screen, but if you like to see the cars driven to the limit, you should see this movie.
