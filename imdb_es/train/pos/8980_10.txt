First I must admit that I am a big fan of The Dandy Warhols, and that is the reason why I came to see this movie. <br /> <br /> The uniqueness of this movie, compared to other modern rockumentaries, is that it's not just about a page in a band's history (like "I'm trying to break your heart", about Wilco), but it covers a long period of the band's history. In this film, director / producer Ondi Timoner closely followed his friends / rivals The Brian Jonestown Massacre (BJM) and The Dandy Warhols (DW) for more than 8 years (1995 - 2003) and recorded tremendous 1500 hours of video on gross, more than 1:45 hours (the future release of the DVD will contain much more material than the original movie). The result is amazing: there are no fillers; the film is a file of 100% pure and genuine, which gives the feeling that the film is progressing with the bands during all these years. <br /> <br /> Both bands at the start of their careers promised to "make a revolution" in musical creation, and not sell their souls to the devil of the "record industry". However, their paths quickly separated: The Dandy Warhols signed a contract with Capitol Records and became relatively popular (especially in Europe) after a single album, while the Massacre of Brian Jonestown (with its leader Anton Newcombe) was disbanded in oblivion. (At least as it is portrayed in the movie). And the movie follows the descent of the Brian Jonestown Massacre, in contrast to the rise of The Dandy Warhols. <br /> <br /> First, I loved the film and its approach to telling the story of Anton Newcombe (for example, Courtney Taylor - the leader of The Dandy Warhols - narrates), but after thinking a bit I gave myself realize that something is wrong with this movie. <br /> <br /> First, treat Anton Newcombe as a missing person. The project began in 1995 as a documentary about several promising emerging groups, in which Anton Newcombe and Ondi Timoner were equal partners (that was the reason why during all these years Ondi Timoner had immediate access to both bands). It was Anton Newcombe who brought The Dandy Warhols to the project. In the end, he was completely ignored, as if he were expelled from the project. Everyone talks about BJM, but he does not participate in the discussion. I guess he was not even informed when the group started the final editing process. There are always two sides to the story, and here we only have one ... Of course, as expected, Anton does not approve of the final result and sees this movie as a betrayal of his former friends. <br /> <Secondly, the movie is very skewed by the Warhols. Sure, the winner takes it all, but the fact that Courtney Taylor (leader of DW) narrates (although it seems a good option, provides a sense of participation seemingly closer) and that the late history of the bands is represented in a way non-proportional (BJM is covered until 1997, and DW - until 2003), does not add objectivity to the film. <br /> <br /> Third, the movie is (somewhat) superficial. What do you want to teach us? As one critic said: "... the film examines old questions: where does genius fit into a commodified world? Can it thrive and get what it is owed, or does it need to self-destruct to preserve its integrity?" No, DO NOT EXAMINE these questions! It simply represents the story of a brilliant, but unsuccessful musician, narrated by a less brilliant, but successful one, who surrenders to the eternal security and coldness of an ego larger than the mountain. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie was fun: it's raw, it's cool, it's stylish, it's ... just very interesting, at least for DW or BJM fans. For the rest of the crowd, I do not know ...
