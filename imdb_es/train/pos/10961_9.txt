One of the best love stories I've seen. It's a bit like watching a train crash in slow motion, but it's still charming anyway ... Big Edie and Little Edie look a bit like family members after watching this movie repeatedly, and they're infinitely citable: " It's a damn beautiful day, now you just shut up? "The initial explanation of Little Edie's costume only promises that the movie will live forever, and so will Big Edie" The World Famous Singer "and Little Edie" The World Famous Dancer " .
