Parker and Stone transplant to their pomp the explosive-ridden humor of their animated masterpiece to a live-action film with great overall results. Much of the movie is Trey and Matt running wildly with their new toy box. The plot is simplicity itself: two average men invent a new sport, a combination of basketball in the driveway with a baseball score that becomes a national fashion. Along the way they encounter numerous clich√©s of sports films and send them, along with any other part of the popular culture that comes their way. It works like an extended episode of South Park, with the usual dialogue between machine guns, bathroom humor and homilies from the heart. <br /> <br /> If this movie has a weakness, it is the association with the team that gave us "Airplane" and the series "Naked Gun". This influence is clearly seen with the intensive use of eye gags and the presence of a bright and rather two-dimensional Yasmine Bleeth in the paper that is generally given to Priscilla Presley. Robert Vaughn performs a little better in the corporate batting that has been his piece of the game since "Bullitt" and Ernest Borgnine exaggerate as only he can, but we must admit that it is perfect for the role of the owner of a crazy team. <Br /> <br /> For those who have not yet noticed, Parker and Stone seem more comfortable as aspiring rock stars than comics. This is manifested in the prominence given to the soundtrack in almost everything they create. As usual, they provide a good selection here, including the mandatory track of your own DVDA for ultra non PC vehicles. <br /> <br /> A special mention must go to Dian Bachar, who deserves some kind of prize for supporting the difficult job of playing Stan de Parker and the overwhelming pair of Stone's Cartmans. <br /> <br /> In short, this is an entertaining comedy that is held back from its potential by relying too much on the "Naked Gun / Airplane" formula. Parker and Stone could do something truly brilliant (or absolutely horrible) if they are given full control over a future movie. America, or lock up these guys or put them in charge.
