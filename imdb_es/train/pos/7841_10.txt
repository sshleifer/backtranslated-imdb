['This is a gift for all Bolan fans, some might think it&#39;s a bit of an exaggeration and it&#39;s just about the egos of Ringo and Marc, but I think it&#39;s similar to any other concert video, except for the fact that this is Marc Bolan, not any man! I especially liked the music video for the children of the revolution, with Elton John and Ringo Starr. This clip alone is worth it, I can not believe that they have not released this version as the only one. The film is really magnificent, especially for us Danes. Now, I was not alive during the 70s. But the Danes in general were totally expelled from what was happening around them. the media did not reproduce or show any of the popular music at that time, including Marc Bolan and T.Rex, they only played a little with The Doors, although only the really popular songs. So, I know for my dad, that when he sees this, he gives back a part of his youth, which he never experienced. <br /><br /> I will not do this too long, so ... If you&#39;re a Marc Bolan fan, you need to see this. You may find it boring or as stated before, a bit above. But at least you&#39;ve seen one of the best musicians, in action! <br /><br /> The only thing that disappoints me a little, is that Ride A White Swan is not on the tape. but I forgive him, since Jeepster and Get It On are so wonderfully played.']
