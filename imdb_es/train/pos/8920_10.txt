I did not know Steve McQueen in 1958. I just knew that I was very afraid to go see this movie. (The movie "Trantula" had devastated me at age seven ... but I was ten years old now). The first scene in which Blob crawls up the farmer's sounding stick and wraps his hand was enough to make me want to leave the theater. But I stayed and suffered through each of our monster's attacks. I felt so much horror when Steve and his daughter barely left the doctor's office (Doc Pobre), and even more so when The Blob went into a movie theater and devoured a large part of the audience. . . so many, in fact, that it went out of the front doors, too big now to go through only one. He seemed indestructible and unlimited in his potential for growth, and when he caught poor Steve in a sieve-like restaurant, it looked like a safe dinner. <br /> <br /> To say that the Blob was cold would be a modern description, but in the end, it is better than to scare and mentally scare little children. <br /> <br /> I remember when I came home Late with my uncle Nick, trying to act brave. I knew I was in trouble, and when I got into bed that night I could not only feel the Blob in the room, but when I gathered the courage to look at the floor, there is the red guy, throbbing, hungry and hungry. I sat down, waiting for me to try to get up and go to the bathroom. It took months to recover. <br /> <br /> I am 57 years old now. . . I have done. <br /> <br /> Of course the Blob was not destroyed.
