Sandler is amazing again ... I've already become a fan of Sandler. This movie is Sandler's saddest story. His expression is fantastic. I cried more seeing click, but there are some similar points. To consider the value of the family before losing it and to be able to say 'I love you' are some of the most impressive truths of life ... It is difficult, it is real ... and in reality there is a real truth. Owner of this success, Binder. I do not think another director can give these emotions that way. <br /> <br /> Cheadle and Burrows are also amazing ... Cheadle is one of my favorites since Crash. Do not expect to laugh or a lot of positive atmosphere ... If you are ready to face the realities of life, do not miss this movie.
