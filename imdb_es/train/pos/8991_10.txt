DIG! It's fun, fun, fun, interesting, elegant and very well done. Knowing that it was done with so little budget during 7 years, it is surprising that a history like that can be told, especially with that style and substance. If you are a fan of music or a documentary, this is something you should see. <br /> <br /> Focusing on The Brian Jonestown Masssacre and The Dandy Warhols over the years is a brilliant way to show the contrast between a decent band that meets with moderate success through perseverance and ability to compromise and a megalomaniacal genius main singer backed by a varied cast of characters who sabotage their own success through drugs, alcohol and madness. If I did not know that this is a video of real people, I would swear it was an incredibly well written and imaginative piece. The story is compelling, concise and simply amazing.
