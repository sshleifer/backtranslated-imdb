Well, this was a very sensitive little number, but I can not help thinking that I've seen it before. It reminds me of another VCA movie I saw in Poitier called "THE OTHER DAYS OF RUBY RAE" She also had spots of "Welcome to the Doll's House" and "Ratcatcher" and Lynne Ramsay in her execution. What does not mean that they are not references of good taste ... only that they feel very modern and very fashionable ... what makes me feel that is closer to advertising (as a focus on style and history) that the work of an original and authentic author to come. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is simply ... too perfect for my taste. Too much coral filter (or coal) for my taste ... too arched framed 12 mm. Therefore, the whole impression left me a little distant: beware of the art that is proclaimed too easily! The French (they are a conservative group) seemed to buy it just like the jury did, however ... but the Cannes short film selection is notoriously conservative compared to its selection of features, although I wonder what has been happening in the last years.
