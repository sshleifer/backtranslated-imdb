A brilliant film about family, guilt, sacrifice, betrayal and love. Macy is a great actor. It was almost a shame to see him in the same scenes with Campbell, who sees himself as part of a neurotic sexual object but does not have the skills to work with him at the level the script was looking for. But he is such a good actor that he played at his level to make the scenes work. I highly applaud the casting of Tracey Ullman as the careless wife. Who knows? Sutherland is also very good. The way he moves makes his character look taller (and even younger in some scenes). Almost everyone knew what they were doing. <br /> <br /> Macy's description of the only situation in which her character can not be careful is nothing more than complete mastery.
