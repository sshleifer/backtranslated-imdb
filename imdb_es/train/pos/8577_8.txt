['I think Hollow Point is a fun movie with some good moments that I&#39;ve never seen before in action movies. Well, both Tia Carrere and Thomas Ian Griffith are not so good at acting, but Tia Carrere is a nice and attractive girl, is not it? But Donald Sutherland is excellent in his crazed gangster role.']
