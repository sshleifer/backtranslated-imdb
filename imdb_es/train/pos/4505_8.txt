The Eskimo is a serious film about the cultural abyss between an indigenous population and the white man that invades. Although filmed in a seemingly non-professional documentary style, the Eskimo is an expert production that contains a credible story that the public will want to see to the final level. <br /> <br /> The native Eskimo simply has different beliefs and beliefs. Behaviors about women and life that whalers do that darken their landscape. When an Eskimo man loses his partner, it is natural for other men to share their women with their friends. It is also common for women to want to take the place of the missing spouse. All this seems natural in the context of the desolate Arctic scenario. The unsuspecting Eskimo is prey to unscrupulous white whalers (with strong European accents) who do not see these natives as their equals. Deception, drunken orgies, rapes and deaths occur after the Eskimo men leave to work in the frozen seas. Finally, the Eskimo leader (Mala) realizes that he has been deceived and takes his revenge. The audience would have acclaimed in the theaters of the 1930s. <br /> <br /> Enter the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the moral dilemma of whether to bring Mala back to trial. The Mounties play like feeling police officers who know that this is not a dry and dry case. Will the Montanos get his man? Is it fair that Mala keeps a code of behavior outside of her traditional society? Is there an exit that does not punish Mala? Is it inevitable that the law of the white man prevails? Is there no hope for innocence? <br /> <br /> This is not a great movie, but it is the one that you will enjoy because of the depth of the theme tackled in a very different environment. I suspect that the filming of the sequences with animals was made before the statement of responsibility today that there were no injuries in the making of the film, so be careful with the rough footage of nature. Highly recommended
