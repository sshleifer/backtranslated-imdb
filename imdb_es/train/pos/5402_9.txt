Hitokiri (which roughly translates as "murder"), a / k / a "Tenchu", which translates roughly as "divine punishment", shows Hideo Gosha at the top of his form. DO NOT miss it, or the other Gosha classic, Goyokin! Hitokiri is not only one of the best Gosha films, it is one of the best "samurai / chambara" movies ever made, and perhaps one of the best Japanese films exported. <br /> <br /> Be careful, everything complex. The details of the plot in Hitokiri can be a bit difficult to follow for those who are not familiar with Japanese history of the 19th century. Even so, the underlying human drama is obvious and open to all viewers. According to Gosha's norm, Hitokiri provides another variation on his traditional theme of "loyalty to his lord" versus "doing the right thing". However, Gosha develops her favorite subject with such sophistication, which is really the movie to watch (along with Goyokin, of course). <br /> <br /> I guess it breaks down like this: if you want a simpler, more action-oriented story, you might want to see Goyokin. However, if you want a more reflective and multi-layered drama (although somber), see this one. <br /> <br /> (OK, OK, essentially, the historical context is a big problem among many different samurai clans that are either (1) working to reform, but retain, the Tokugawa shogunate, and (2) those They try to install Emperor Meiji as the supreme ruler of Japan. Of course, those clans that work "for" Meiji Emperor were often less interested in the "reform" of Japan than in ensuring that their own clan had more power in the "New world order." Ironically, the entire feudal system was officially abolished as one of the first reforms of the Meiji government.They are ironic twists like this: the great Gosha In irony, that makes the whole plot even more bittersweet. ) <br /> <br /> What distinguishes "Hitokiri" from the other Gosha films is the mature sense of Gosha's cinematography. Each shot is carefully composed, and (like Barry Lyndon of Kubrick) each frame of the film could be kept as a fixed composition. Of course, this is typical of Gosha. Hitokiri really stands out with impressive backgrounds, including (as with Goyokin) many fascinating seascapes. Just look at the opening sequence, and you're hooked! Make no mistake, this is not a piece from the English era: Hitokiri is extremely violent (do not say he was not warned). <br /> <br /> What else, apart from the camera work, does Hitokiri stand out? The performances seem (to me) a little more subtle in this. Katsu Shintaro (from Zatoichi / Hanzo the Razor fame) becomes a star as the protagonist / antihero in conflict, Okada Izo. Katsu manages to instill in humanity a character that seems to be a wilder animal than a villain. Throughout the film, you are never sure if you are committed or if you have rebelled for the character of Okada. At the same time, Katsu's representation of Okada's voracious hunger for respect, and his subsequent pathetic attempts at redemption, seem so human that empathy / sympathy can not be avoided. Of course, after seeing Nakadai Tatsuya play the tortured hero in "Goyokin", it's great to see him play such a ruthless villain in "Hitokiri". It's just perfect, there's nothing more to say! <br /> <br /> As a final note, perhaps more interesting for fans than for occasional fans, do not miss the last screen appearance of Mishima Yukio (yes, the gay locked). ultranationalist novelist on the right who committed suicide with seppuku before the mocking crowd of Japanese military personnel who "kidnapped" in 1970, and had a film about his life and work done by Paul Schrader), who actually does a pretty solid job at portray Honorable (for a murderer) Shinbei Tanaka.
