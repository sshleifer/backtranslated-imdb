['The first time I read the splendid Pearl S Buck novel in my ninth grade history class, I enjoyed every exciting page. It was almost inevitable that Hollywood would take over, and considering that it was done in 1937, the results are excellent. <br /><br /> You have to accept certain things: in 1937 it was not about choosing Asian actors in a great Hollywood movie. In a way, this makes the final product more interesting than if they could have used a more authentic-looking cast. <br /><br /> With that obstacle to overcome, the executive producer Irving Thalberg and the director Sidney Franklin (among others) took the trouble to choose a splendid and stellar cast. Paul Muni plays Wang Lung. Muni was at the peak of his powers as an actor during this period, and could almost interpret anything he set out to do. Once you get over the makeup (it&#39;s good, but nobody is going to really confuse you with a Chinese man), your performance has all the plausibility of your best work. <br /><br /> Then there&#39;s Luise Rainer. When leaving an Oscar the previous year for his performance in THE GREAT ZIEGFELD, the star of the Viennese actress was on the rise and was given the role of O-lan despite his lack of experience in Hollywood. His performance earned him a second consecutive Oscar, the first time in history that happened. <br /><br /> There have been many criticisms of Rainer&#39;s performance and his Oscar victory here. She has been called wooden and of a single note. There is a small grain of truth in that. HOWEVER, having said that, all you need to do is go back to the book. For Rainer, although he is not Chinese, he played O-lan more or less as Buck wrote him; In fact, it&#39;s a splendid performance, and one of the best book-to-screen transfers I&#39;ve seen. <br /><br /> As for the rest of the cast, well this was MGM. They had the biggest list of stars and actors in Hollywood at the time, and a big budget to pay for the best, and in the end they got the best. <br /><br /> The film softens Wang Lung&#39;s marriage to O-lan a bit. In the novel, with lust come the lusts of the flesh and he takes a concubine, a movement that devastates his wife, but his feelings as a mere woman do not worry him. In the film, a contrite Wang Lung gives back to his wife on his deathbed the two pearls he had snatched from her years before, realizing too late that she was his true love. <br /><br /> Corny, yes. But that&#39;s Hollywood. Considering the obstacles they faced, the movie could have been opened to shouts of laughter. But despite the notable shortage of authentic Asians in the cast, this film has looked surprisingly well with the passage of seventy-three years. In fact, the most surprising thing about this movie is how good it is, when it could have been a disaster so easily.']
