When I watch a low budget movie, I know what to expect. I hope the performance is not so good (budgetary reasons), I hope the lighting is not so good (budgetary reasons) I hope the sound is not so good (budget again). Stop judging these low budget movies like a big budget movie! I'm also a filmmaker, so I understand the budget constraints in a low budget movie. Stealing locations, shots, etc ... the list goes on and on. I do not want to say that the whole performance was bad. José Rosete, Chris Angelo, Víctor Zaragoza are good. Raul Martinez is a native. Not sold in Carl Washington yet. You have to understand that each line is not important, some are throw lines. I say that if a movie makes you want to see what happens next, it's a good movie. I liked this movie. I gave him a 8. I wanted to see what would happen next. Great job for the Quiroz brothers!
