Hmmm, yes, this episode is extremely undervalued. <br /> <br /> Although there is A LOT of bad writing and acting in some parts. I think the good wins the bad. <br /> <br /> I love the origami parts and the big 'spin' at the end. I love that scene when Michelle confronts Tony. Actually, it's one of my favorite scenes from Season 1. <br /> <br /> For some reason, people have always hated reincarnation episodes, but I've always liked them. They are not the best, in terms of writing. but the subject really interests me, <br /> <br /> I'm going to give it a THREE star, but if the writing were a little more consistent, I would give it FOUR.
