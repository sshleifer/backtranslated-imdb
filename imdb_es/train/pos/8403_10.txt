I found it highly intellectual and artistic in every way! I felt that the script conveyed all the things I feel physically and emotionally when I arrived home from work and watched it. This is a tribute to the cinema in its highest form and format. <br /> <br /> Holy guacamole! How I wish those days will come again. I tried to place a bubble window on the side of my car (1984 Honda Civic), but the trays of vacuum-formed muffins did not cut it off completely. also in my civic position, sexual positions are limited and not supported by the water bed, as brilliantly described in 'the van'. <br /> <br /> 'the van' is of the greatest hilarity and can even replace it. pornography if you watch some scenes in private. <br /> <br /> I anticipate that Sam Grossman (the director) has achieved his work. <br /> <br /> Ratings john: **** 1/2 Sam: *****
