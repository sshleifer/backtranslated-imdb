['The melodrama of the director Alfred Green &quot;Baby Face&quot; with Barbara Stanwyck is located as one of the most famous films of Pre-Code. These films were produced before the Production Code Administration had the power to enforce its rules in 1934. &quot;Inspiration&quot; writer Gene Markey and &quot;Midnight Mary&quot; scribe Kathryn Scola wrote the script, based on the story of Mark Canfield, about the rise and fall of a Girl who used her sexual charms to acquire wealth and position in society. By the way, Mark Canfield was a pseudonym for producer Daryl F. Zanuck. Today, these Pre-Code films seem docile, but they arouse much controversy and contain more spicy material than most films until the late 1950s when the Code began to erode. The themes that the filmmakers explore are women in front of men, women in front of women and women in front of society. Our shrewd protagonist does enough to make all subjects almost equal. <br /><br /> The useless father of Lily, Nick Powers (Robert Barret, of &quot;Distant Drums&quot;) operates an illegitimate bar during the Prohibition, when the Thirteenth Amendment banned the liquor, and prepares his own drink in a motionless place. Nick is a hateful guy who forbids his beautiful and hard-working daughter Lily (Barbara Stanwyck from &quot;Night Nurse&quot;), but Lily refuses to help her father with a local politician of poor quality. The politician. Ed Sipple (Arthur Hohl, from &quot;Private Detective 62&quot;) swears to retaliate for Lily&#39;s refusal to accommodate him. Later, Nick chews on his rebellious daughter. Lily reproaches him. &quot;Yes, I am a vagabond and who is to blame? My father, a good start you gave me, nothing but men, dirty, rotten men, and you are shorter than any of them.&quot; As soon as she leaves, Nick dies when he still explodes and kills him. Lily and her African-American maid Chico (Theresa Harris of &quot;Arrowsmith&quot;) prepare their suitcases and take a ride on the first cargo that leaves the city. <br /><br /> As soon as our heroines arrive in New York, Lily uses her charm to get a job at a bank. Visually, director Green shows Lily&#39;s cunning ascent up the ladder with camera angles moving up until Lily&#39;s sexuality threatens to destroy the bank. At one point, Lily breaks a marriage between a bank officer, Ned Stevens (Donald Cook of &quot;The Public Enemy&quot;) and his girlfriend, Anne Carter (Margaret Lindsay of &quot;Cavalcade&quot;) after Stevens had almost fired her for flirt with her. boss, Brody (Douglas Dumbrille of &quot;Your Women&quot;) in the employee restroom. Lily is extremely astute and manages to get out of each debacle better than before. The board of directors hires Courtland Trenholm (George Bent of &quot;Jezebel&quot;) to assume the position of president of the bank. The first thing Trenholm does is pay Lily instead of letting her publish the entries in her diary about the top brass at the bank. In addition, Trenholm sends Lily to her branch in Paris, where Lily does not create any uproar until Trenholm arrives and they unite romantically. Lily struggles with nails and teeth for everything she has achieved and hates to throw everything away, but in the end she sacrifices everything for her husband. <br /><br /> Ironically, Lily returns to the same city she started in, but she and Trenholm are happy now. &quot;Baby Face&quot; qualifies as one of the five best Pre-Code films. Look for John Wayne dressed in a suit and tie in a scene.']
