I saw a trailer for this in Afro Promo, the collection of movie trailers for films with African-Americans. It seemed what it is; a tense "crazy" comedy in which a tense black man realizes that his son is gay. It seems that the wife of Redd Foxx (RF) has left him for his brother, who works with him in "the store" in Phoenix. He has taken the bus to visit his son Norman, who is Los Angeles. <br /> <br /> So when RF arrives, Norman, wearing only light blue shorts, comes out of his waterbed to open the door. Trying to buy time by having his elderly father climb the stairs to what appears to be the 60th floor, Norman tries to wake up his lover, who refuses to give in. It was right up to the point where I wrote "WHY will not he wake up?" when suddenly it does, and the jaws of my friend and I fell for the first time many times when they present us with our first glimpse of the blue-eyed Garson and curly hair, Norman's white lover who lives in him, who simply "had more Dream faaaaaabulous? Garson is a flaming queen of a guy who can ONLY be pictured as emerging from 1976 LA She has dresses and a bag and a big awkward jewelry, and seems to have modeled her look and personality of Carol Brady of The Brady Bunch <Br /> <br /> Norman orders his lover to find another place to stay during his father's visit.Garson is going to stay with Waylon Flowers and Madame answers the phone when Norman calls. <br /> <br /> Then, RF tries to reach his wife in Mexico, while he is talking on the phone, Garson comes to pack his dress and RF confronts him with an outburst of 70s soul music to evoke his revelation (although it seems more than we areon the verge of listening to a very special song by The Emotions), he realizes that his son is gay. <br /> <br /> Your first impulse is "I'll kill you. Then, RF takes a long walk, in which he goes through all the thoughts that a confused father might have, like "maybe we train him in the bathroom too soon". All his thoughts are triggered by something he sees in his walk, for example, a burly truck driver who appears just as he is contemplating what makes a real man. Surprisingly, he goes to a bookstore and buys about eight books on homosexuality. This, it must be said, is about eight more books about homosexuality than what MY parents bought. Then go directly to a park bench and read them all! <br /> <br /> RF then hires Audrey, a six-foot Amazonian prostitute (in this amazing fur) played by Tamara Dobson of Cleopatra Jones. He hired her for Norman to try heterosexuality, but this bothers Norman and he runs off to stay with his friend Melody. <br /> <br /> Then, Garson approaches and offers to take out RF at night. He sympathizes with the loss of RF's wife, and tells the story of his own mother, who harbors an irrational prejudice against Pilippinos because "she was molested in a luau." They attend an outstanding performance of Wayon and Madam, which culminates with Madame violently banging her head against the piano until her hair is released. Once again, the mouths were open-mouthed. <br /> <br /> So it seems that, if you did not know, RF and Garson have a wonderful evening together. You see, formally, traditional older black men just have to watch the entertaining and effeminate entertainment of mega-queens to come to EVERYTHING that the gay world has to offer. It is really JUST so simple! This still does not stop RF from shouting "Rape!" When Garson wakes him from a bad dream. It ends in a less predictable way than you think. <br /> <br /> There were so many things that were out of place. WHAT is the basis of Norman and Garson's relationship? It seems that they have NO relationship, and Norman has no qualms about throwing Garson away, and even when he shows up to defend himself, he never defends Garson or talks about their relationship. There were some kind of sweetly picturesque touches like that RF would buy all those books on homosexuality ... and he sat on the park bench to read them! I like the idea of ​​a father really trying to discover something about homosexuality, instead of just running away to get drunk or feel sorry for his friends. <br /> <br /> Aside from that, it's something like what it looks like: a bit of a relic of a bygone era, an era in which some gays thought that if heterosexual people sat and saw a puppet of drag, we could all learn to love each other and understand each other! And because of all the naïveté of this thing, extreme stereotypes and message-laden dialogue simply become charming and obsolete, and provide a lot of discussion to discuss how things have changed for homosexuals in the last 30 years. I guess the only thing that seems offensive is the idea that gay friends are desperately in love with them, and are willing to get them drunk to sleep with them and, by extension, convert them to them. <br /> <br /> ------ Hey, check out Cinema de Merde, my website about bad and cheesy movies (with some good movies included).
