I just bought the collection one of this awesome series and even after watching three episodes, I'm still fascinated by the elegant style of the animation and the slow but thoughtful actions of storytelling. I'm still a fan ... with some minor pains. <br /> <br /> Although this installment in the Gundam saga is very good and has what the previous series had, an elegant satirical way of counting errors. Of the war and of not leaving aside the need to have control or power over everything (does it sound familiar?), I must say that it becomes a little too soft to continue explaining the lives of the main characters and their incessant need. of belly about everything that happens and what they must do to prevent the OZ group from succeeding in their plans (especially the character called Wufei ... I mean, he complains more than an American character in a soap opera. ?) <br /> <br /> In addition to the exaggerated drama (I think it mostly comes from the voice acting of English voice actors), this series is still very exciting and will captivate me once more. I mean, it can always be worse. It could be like the recent installment, SEED ...... eeeewwww, talk about dramatic melody ... I'll talk about that later.
