['When I was little, my parents gave me this movie to watch. I really liked it, and I saw it again and again. Even when I was in 3rd grade I still saw him from time to time. Recently, I saw it again, just for nostalgia, and although the program was not aimed at my age group (I&#39;m in my late teens), I still found it entertaining and educational. This show teaches good lessons about imagination and getting along with others. Some parts seemed quite entertaining. In addition, this program does not have any negative content, so you can leave children alone with this program and not worry about learning bad language or anything else. I would recommend this.']
