This is not the best romantic comedy ever made, but it's certainly quite nice and visible. It is run in a traditional way and works well. Cybill Shepherd as Corinne is not bad in her role as a woman who can not overcome the death of her husband. She has a sexy maturity. But I can not say much about Ryan O'Neal as Philip, because it is, at best, bland. It may be adequate on paper, but that is not good enough. <br /> <br /> However, I have the feeling that some of the characters, particularly Alex and Miranda, are not written with enough thought in depth. We do not know anything else about them because minutes after their appearance, the story gets thicker and the writers do not tell us much more than what happens. But that problem was solved because Mary Stuart Masterson has a sweetness like daisy to cheer her up, and Robert Downey Jr. is so charming that it melts the screen. Even his smile is contagious. And it happens that his big dream eyes are perfect for the scenes of deja vu and flashback. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this movie is light and easy, and if you like it that way, why not try it? <br /> <br />
