ABC has done more for this program by allowing television veterans James Garner and David Spade to join the cast of this program. At first, the program was visible and even predictable with John Ritter and Katey Sagal. The loss of John shocked the world. Katey and the three children are really a solid professional cast. The time of the lesson after John's death in real life caught my eye. I lost my father when I was 17 and I was able to sympathize and understand his pain and agony. ABC should be proud to maintain this program and even preserve it as John's last wish. This show has matured and developed due to such impossible circumstances. They should be rewarded with Emmy.
