There are too many topics that are avoided in movies and eating disorders is one of them. This movie shows it as it is. It is not full of glamor for the spectators to enjoy, it is shown with a real truth that makes it even more powerful. I've only seen it once and that was a few years ago, but I can still remember everything about that and how it made me feel. It is a very powerful film and is a good support for anyone who suffers from an eating disorder to give them the willpower to stop. This is what the movies should be: they should be there to help people and not to glamor things that are wrong.
