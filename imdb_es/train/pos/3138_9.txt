Yes, I did, while sitting here with a red face, remembering feeling almost guilty when I saw him a couple of weeks ago, while my wife chose to see something as insignificant (in comparison) as "Mommie Dearest". <br /> <br /> How do you explain the appeal of "Batman and Robin"? I mean the only ones who really counted, Adam West and Burt Ward. It was a terrible show, with terrible plots and a terrible performance, and oh yes, it was terribly funny! And the same applies to this "reunion" and "flashback" movie. Adam and Burt are invited to an auction in which the old Batmobile will be sold for charity. But it is stolen, and our friends (like themselves) jump to the people of their old characters (if not their costumes) and go to discover what has happened. On the way they remember the series, and we see how they combined in flashbacks, with Jack Brewer and Jason Marsden playing the young Adam and Burt of the television series. It was really interesting to take a look backstage at the old series, and Adam and Burt just came back to the character (although they were not really in the character, well, you should see it to see what I mean.) It was also great to see Julie Newmar and Frank Gorshin. <br /> <br /> If you are not a fan of the previous series, you will hate this.If, God forbid, you really thought that Michael Keaton and George Clooney became acceptable as "Batmans", then you will hate this yet But if you grew up with Adam and Burt and you're still willing to admit that you never missed an episode, well, this is for you. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's true - 9/10
