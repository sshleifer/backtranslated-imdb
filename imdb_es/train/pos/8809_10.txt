This document really opened my eyes to what people outside the United States thought about the September 11 attacks. This film was prepared by experts and presents this disaster as something more than an attack on the soil of the USA. UU The consequences of this disaster are seen from many different countries and perspectives. I think this movie should be distributed more widely by this point. It also helps in the recovery process to finally see more than just news reports about the terrorist attacks. And some of the pieces are really fun, but not abusively. This film was very recommended to me and I transmit the same feeling.
