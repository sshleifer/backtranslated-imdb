Jim Carrey can do anything. I thought this was going to be a silly children's movie, and FULLY it was not. It was incredibly fun for ALL, adults and children. I saw it once because it was almost out of the cinemas, and now it's FINALLY coming out on DVD this Tuesday and I'm very excited, as you can see. You should definitely see it if you have not done it yet, it was great! <br /> <br /> Liz
