Jon Voight is brilliant in Midnight Cowboy, but Hoffman's performance, although he remembers his last turn at Rainman, is the kind of acting that keeps me watching movies. As a representation of a New York character, only Bill Butcher's Daniel Day Lewis performance in Gangs of New York comes to mind as comparable, and Day does not give his character the emotional depth that Hoffman gives Ratso. <br /> <br /> It's typical of Hoffman's way of acting that the actor we most identify with Midnight Cowboy is Voight. I think Hoffman is one of the 4 or 5 best actors in film history to play the people around him in such a way that he elevates his performances well above their normal levels. <br /> <br /> Voight's Buck is so naive that he would float out of the movie, except that Ratso knocks him down, knocks him down, but also teaches him a lot about how to survive and, more importantly, how to live. <br /> <br /> Midnight Cowboy is a film about escape that becomes a movie about how to find yourself. I think that, as a high quality film as it is, it has a very beautiful message, that no matter how much you lose (Ratso clearly defines "loser"), if you can find a way to be true to yourself. You are in possession of the secret of life, and you could even share that idea with someone else. <br /> <br /> I can not help comparing Midnight Cowboy with Klute, a few years later, which I think is more like a movie about finding yourself that becomes a movie about escape.
