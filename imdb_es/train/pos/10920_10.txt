I remember seeing this movie as a child. I do not remember where I saw it. I must have been around 14 years old. I thought the movie was amazing and I wanted to see it again. He came to the Kung Fu channel once, but I missed him. I was really bored. It's the best special effect Kung Fu movie I've seen to date! I highly recommend it, and now that I've figured out where to get it, I can enjoy it once again and for years to come. I also have to see this movie of The Return of Poison, of which some have spoken so much.
