Yesterday I saw this movie and I have to say it's the best horror movie made for $ 36,000 I've seen (Sorry Steckler) The movie is definitely worth looking for if you're a zombie fan. This movie reeks of soul and environment. Some of the shots of the zombies are the best committed to the cinema. The gruesome and dusty reticulated corpses crawl slowly towards their screaming victims. Brrrrrrrr. <br /> <br /> Falling and hot Canadian women with sensual accents will keep you worried before HORROR raises her dead head. This film entertains from beginning to end. I could not ask for more than that. My only complaint is that it is too short.
