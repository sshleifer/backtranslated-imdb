['When I started watching &quot;Fay Grim&quot;, I had no idea it was a sequel to &quot;Henry Fool&quot;. Now, the latter was not a movie that I imagined would have a sequel. But one has arrived, and it&#39;s pretty good. I guess you&#39;ve seen the original, so I will not explain it. This begins with Fay (Parker Posey) living with his son he had with Henry (Thomas Jay Ryan). Simon (James Urbaniak) is still in jail. One day, the son is expelled for bringing a pornographic toy to school. But this is not an ordinary toy. It contains a secret that explains a lot of what happened in the first movie. And this secret goes deeper into geopolitics than &quot;Syriana&quot;. <br /><br /> I must say that I am quite impressed with what Hal Hartley has achieved here. Maybe this does not reach the original quality, but certainly makes a good look at what is happening in the world. And the end leaves open the possibility of another sequel. <br /><br /> Also starring Jeff Goldblum.']
