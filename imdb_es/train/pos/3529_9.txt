['Scott Henderson (Alan Curtis) is unjustly accused of killing his unfaithful wife. The night she was murdered, he left with a mysterious woman who refused to give her his name. After being accused of the murder, the police visit all the places where he had been with her, but the people only remember that he was alone. He was sentenced to die and his secretary (Ella Raines) intends to find the murderer because he loves him. <br /><br /> This was done as a Universal B movie (look at the cast - all the actors in the characters and one star - Franchot Tone - in decline). The budget was small and the cast almost unknown, but what came out is one of the best films of the 1940s. It is beautifully directed by Curt Siodmak and has a fantastic script that comes from an excellent book by William Irish (a pseudonym of Cornell Woolrich). It moves quickly and looks fantastic. And there&#39;s the infamous jam session with Raines and Elisha Cook Jr. that just came out of the screen with incredible sexual energy (I&#39;m surprised the censors have not eliminated it). <br /><br /> There are only a few flaws that prevent this from being perfect. Tone gives a terrible performance. It looks horrible and it&#39;s just horrible. Also Curtis is rigid and soft like Henderson. You really wonder why Raines loves him, he&#39;s so emotional. But Raines is pretty good at the lead role. She is beautiful and full of life. Also the last scene in which the killer is behind her never sounds true. It is hardly a physical threat and its reactions seem exaggerated. <br /><br /> I still give this a 9. A really cool movie - you fail to one side.']
