Canadian filmmaker Mary Harron is a cultural sissy whose previous films left bare the artistic excess of the sixties and the greedy eighties. With "The Notorious Bettie Page", she points her unwavering eye to Fifties America, an era wrapped in the moral justice of Joe McCarthy, as she experiences the beginnings of a sexual awakening that would result in free love for the next decade. Harron and his co-writer Guinevere Turner are clearly not interested in the standard biopic of a sex symbol. This is a film about the clandestine icon of an era and how its pure and pure sexuality revealed both the predatory instincts and the impure thoughts of a culture not touched by the beauty of a naked body. If the details of Bettie's life were all that bothered the movie, then why end it before her most tragic period began? Clearly, Harron is more interested in the attitudes of the United States toward sexual images before and now. Along with the audacious performance of Gretchen Mol and the incredibly atmospheric cinematography of W.Mott Hupfel III, he achieves this goal admirably, raising a mirror to the past while making the public examine their own "enlightened" attitudes of the 21st century into the future. called pornography. While the United States is drowning under a new conservatism, this is a film that is needed more than ever.
