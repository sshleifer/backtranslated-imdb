After seeing Vertigo, then see Bell, Book and Candle, made a few more months. <br /> <br /> My second favorite movie of Kim Novak, with Picnic, is presented as third. <br /> <br /> The three performances are great, Vertigo, being the best of all. <br /> <br /> They came to my town of Kansas Prairie from nowhere, near, in Salina, Kansas in the 50s, to film Picnic. <br /> <br /> Bell musical score, Book and Candle, I think it's one of Alex North. Perfect for this little comedy. <br /> <br /> After Vertigo, Stewart and Novak, they made this comedy, how much fun it is to notice the dramatic contrast. <br /> <br /> It's worth it, if you like Kim Novak The greta garbo of my youth.
