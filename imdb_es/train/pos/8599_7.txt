It's been 19 years since Gordon Gekko used "Wall Street" to let us know that greed is good. Now, Michael Douglas takes the GG person and transforms him into a Secret Service agent, Pete Garrison. Guess what? Works! This is a solid political thriller that kept me guessing. The detailed work in showing the security precautions taken by the SS on behalf of the President and the First Lady was equally intriguing. All the potential customers were pretty good, but no matter how hard he tried, he could not accept Eva Longoria as a Secret Service agent. While Jodie Foster simply made you suspend the belief and really think she was the FBI Starling agent in "Silence of the Lambs," you do not have the same feeling with Longoria. However, this is a fun, escapist entertainment movie with the Beltway as a backdrop.
