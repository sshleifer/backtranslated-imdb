Being a fan of giant monsters, seeing "Yeti" was an absolute necessity, especially after hearing a lot about it. Thanks to the good smuggling market, I was able to find a copy quite easily and I was pleasantly surprised to see that this film was really, dare I say, decent. <br /> <br /> Decent for what it is, really, namely, a cheesy giant monster movie. It starts pretty quickly because Yeti is almost immediately, and we are introduced to several characters. They consist of some people of bad quality, other good ones and a girl who is practically one of the most incredibly beautiful girls in any sci-fi movie, by far. <br /> <br /> Yeti looks like a long hairy guy just out of the original Woodstock concert, and really, it's not that bad, especially after being introduced to the world in a kind of funky cage. Godzilla is not, despite his rude awakening, he does not even despair (in reality he rarely destroys anything in the whole picture), but he seems a bit bewildered as he tries to solve things. Yeti seems to understand English very well (my copy was dubbed in English) and he knows who the good and the bad are. <br /> <br /> However, we want the giant Yeti to do its thing, and it practically throughout the film, and in the typical low budget fashion, it seems that it changes a lot depending on the scene and there is even A lot of photos of the "fake legs" of him just standing there. <br /> <br /> Yes, the special effects are not the best, but there are definitely some good ones here. One scene in which Yeti breaks through a warehouse is very well made, and in another, he uses the windows of a building as "stair steps" to go down from the top of it - breaking each window with his foot and often surprising the occupants inside - in a sequence that really looks a lot, much better than it should in such a "bad" movie. <br /> <br /> "Yeti" never bows as low as "APE" does. Actually, the only time you approach a real nonsense is when the beautiful girl makes the Yeti nipple become erect and raise an eyebrow in the form of "oh, yes, baby." But even this is not so bad, and a little even laughs at the viewer. <br /> <br /> The movie is quite long for this kind of thing, but, surprisingly, it's not boring: the story is really good, and just seeing this beautiful actress on the screen will make any male spectator happy . <br /> <br /> "Yeti" may not be on the top echelon of giant monster movies, but it's definitely better than other King Kong '76 scams like "APE" and "Queen Kong" by far.
