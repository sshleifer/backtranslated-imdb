Clouded Yellow is a compact psychological thriller with interesting characterizations. Barry Jones and Kenneth More are great at backing roles in characters that have more to them than meets the eye. Jean Simmons is pretty good, and Trevor Howard becomes a fascinating and unconventional thriller hero.
