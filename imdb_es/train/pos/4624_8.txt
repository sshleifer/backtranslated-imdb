['Believe it or not, the last case of Inspector Gadget is what got me hooked on the whole gadget thing. <br /><br /> My name is Miriam and I am twelve years old, so obviously I was not present when Inspector Gadget was at the height of his career. Of course, I had heard about him, but I really did not know him. <br /><br /> As I read, keep in mind that I NEVER LEAVE THE ORIGINAL SERIES (I would if I turned it on!). This is the only Gadget thing I&#39;ve seen (although now I&#39;m obsessed) and I&#39;ll focus on what I liked since everyone else is very negative. For all of you pessimists, I also have some cons there. = P First, for a child&#39;s sense of humor, you might consider this movie quite funny. I thought it was, so they sue me. I also thought that the animation and the designs of the characters were good, and I&#39;m also glad that there were more gadgets, since it&#39;s my favorite character. (I do not like Penny). Then there was Garra (although his voice was horrible) and the Madcat; I thought they were pretty good too. Gadget&#39;s idiocy seemed pretty good in its place, though not a little exaggerated (ie thumb-sucking the hand thing with the hat.) However, it would be a good screenshot. = P) Oh, and I liked the song that appears in the credits. Yes, I&#39;m strange. <br /><br /> And, like all movies, there are also some negative aspects. <br /><br /> Talking about cars? What&#39;s up with that? It can be said that this was aimed at younger children. That would not bother me so much if there was not the fact that the cars basically saved the day. I would have preferred much more if Penny and Brain had taken their place. And, apparently, Gadget loved his car more than what would be called natural. A little weird, to say the least. <br /><br /> Oh, and the Boss was downright bad for Gadget. I mean, sheesh, yes, he was not always the most cheerful person, but he did not hate the gadget, from what I read. Like the inspector, his personality was exaggerated. <br /><br /> Well, that&#39;s all I have to say about this movie. I thought that the animation composed the plot centered on the car and that in general it was quite decent; more than the live action gadget movies (murdered, murdered, BUTCHERED!) at least. Maybe I&#39;m just biased because this is what got me to Gadget in the first place, or maybe my mind is distorted, or maybe I&#39;m strange, but I liked this movie a lot, although I&#39;m the oldest one, it&#39;s recommended for.']
