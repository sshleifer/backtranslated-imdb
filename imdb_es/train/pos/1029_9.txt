I would have rated the series with a perfect 10 for a story and a development of outstanding and high quality characters had it not been for the last episode of season 10! <br /> <br /> The final episode of the tenth season "Unending", where (it seems) the Asgards were killed in a very hasty, unconvincing and very unceremonious way, left me in disbelief! <br /> <br /> From the extremely hasty end of the series, it is obvious that many of the arcs of the story were originally scheduled to occur in at least one more season. My guess would be that they quickly accelerated these stories to position the Stargate SG-1 franchise for the next two direct moves to DVD! <br /> <br /> Unless Asgard returns in a future SG-1 movie (with a very good explanation of the "apparent" extinction), I believe that fans have been tricked into badly cleaning loose ends! <br /> <br /> Poor end of a science fiction series that would otherwise be brilliant.
