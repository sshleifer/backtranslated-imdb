"Lost", "24", "Carnivale", "Desperate Housewifes" ... the list goes on and on. These and many other high-quality programs show that we are in the middle of a golden age in the history of television. "Lost" is pure genius. Incredible layers of personal and psychologically viable stories, underlined by a sublime cinematography (incredible to use this word, when describing a television show), an incredible score, excellent performances and editing. Anyone who is not hooked on this, is missing one of the most important creative expressions of television. You can have your problems when you watch only one episode a week, but the DVD format is really an amazing way to watch this. I hope they continue like this (as I'm sure they do).
