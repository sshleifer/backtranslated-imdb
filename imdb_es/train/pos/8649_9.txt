I bought this a while ago, but somehow I neglected to see it until last night. I like Juliette Lewis, although I'm indifferent to Brad Pitt. After this observation, I must admit that he is an excellent actor: his character was completely credible, and I did not think at all of "Brad Pitt". <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I can not say the same for David Duchovny. I'm a fan of X-Files and I had to search twice to confirm the date of this movie, since I thought it was made a few years later. I like Duchovny but I found his character a bit two-dimensional here, except where he's making voiceovers. That part was strong, it seemed in character, good intonation, etc. Otherwise, I kept thinking "Agent Mulder", which is a shame. <br /> <br /> Michelle Forbes was a delight. Why have not I noticed it before? (I'll look up to see what other roles he has made and see them as soon as possible) I'm a little concerned about the stereotypes about Lewis, this movie and "Natural Born Killers" (a favorite of the company). Although it is interesting to see a contrast of characters, in NBK she is a willing accomplice, while here she hates violence and tries not to recognize the dark side of Early until it gets in her face. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this Movie almost without reservations. Apart from the fact that Duchovny's character did not seem to be fully formed (and maybe he was "destroyed" by Pitt), it was perfect. I was also pleased with the ending, glad that the innocent heroes did not die, but first they had to suffer. It was realistic, tense, disturbing. <br /> <br /> If you like NBK you may like this movie, and vice versa.
