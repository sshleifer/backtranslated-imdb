It's a good movie. I like that no place descends to obtain its ink, and the skeletons persecute him, but fortunately he dodged them, opened the window and did not even notice them. Xiao Qian is very pretty too. And when he put the needle in Ma Wu's butt, it's hysterical. and when he says that love is the greatest thing on earth while being between two swords is also great. then also the part where he eats his buns while watching how they kill many people. Then you see him singing poems while he ran to escape the wolves. The love scenes are romantic, Xiao Qian and Ning look pretty together. add the comic time, the giant tongue, and you will have horror, romance, comedy, all at once. Not to mention the excellent special effects for the 90s.
