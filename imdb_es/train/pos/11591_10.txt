['I&#39;ve also been looking for this movie for quite some time, and it would be great to find it on DVD ... <br /><br /> I saw this movie when I was about 6 years old, in the Netherlands. And it impressed me a lot. It was shown before the JUNGLE BOOK of Walt Disney! <br /><br /> What I remember about this movie is fragmented. I remember that an Indian boy was friend of an eagle. This impressed me a lot. For some reason he was expelled from his village (he did not understand the reason for this). When other boys threw stones at him, he climbed a rock and jumped. At that time he became an eagle and flew away with his eagle friend. Like an eagle, he still wore his turquoise collar. <br /><br /> CB']
