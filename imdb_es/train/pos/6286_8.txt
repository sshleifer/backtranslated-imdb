gone in 60 sec. where I started, it keeps you in the movie with good action and some great cars. People say it's not a good movie, I do not agree that it has some corny parts, but what an action movie is not. I gave him 8 out of 10 causes of action and comic relief if you like Rock or Face Off, this movie is a good choice for your cage in the alley, along with one of the most underrated actors in my mind. -Roy Lindo. I think sometimes people look too far in the movies. Sometimes you need to relax to enjoy the movie and after the words ask yourself if they achieved what they were showing. That is, if they went to action, it was the pact of action. If you were trying to make a movie to change the way the movies are made and try to win all the prizes, right? I think they made the action movie they set out to do, give it a try and you will not regret it.
