If I'm going to watch a porn movie, I'd rather have some kind of argument and a dialogue of descent. Behind Bedroom Doors is one of the few that I have found with those attributes. <br /> <br /> The new girl next door deceives the human nature and the weaknesses of the neighbor in regard to seduction and sex. Chelsea Blue, (I mean Brooke LaVelle) is the actress chosen to play the role of the seductive blackmailer, and plays the role magnificently. Chelsea Blue is a very talented and extremely beautiful actress. The movie is a total of 10 just because she is in it. His partner in the movie, Monique Alexander is a definite beauty. The two should do more work together. In this film, however, Monique, who plays Gigi, does not have much to do or say. That's too bad. It seems that she has more talent to be shared. I like the girl who was the DA wife possible. I forgot her name, but she's pretty good looking and she's not a bad actress. Nicole Sheridan ... I'm still trying to figure out why some people are so excited. It is obvious that there are parts of it bought and paid. What is good, but is it finished? I'm sorry, but let's go! I fear that his performance here would have lowered the rating, except that the talent and beauty of Chelsea cancel any negative aspect. In general, this movie is good.
