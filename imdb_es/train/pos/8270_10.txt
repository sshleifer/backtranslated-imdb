This is an extraordinary movie, which constantly tricks you. It seems that it is heading towards the clich√© at several points, and then something amazing will happen that really startles. It would be too much to say much, but stay with this movie and you will be rewarded. William Haines is absolutely charming, he is certainly a star that deserves to be rediscovered. The gay subtext in his relationship with Jack Pickford is incredible, there is even a scene in which Haines rubs Pickford's chest (Pickford has a cold). Both actors interpret this subtext in a subtle way and with great depth of emotion, so there are moments that are very moving. And I never thought that I could get involved in a football game as much as in this movie, and I do not even understand the rules! Also excellent is Francis X. The son of Bushman, Ralph, as the rival of Haines for the girl (yes, it's not a gay movie). Wonderful silent classic: a great example of the commercial cinema of the twenties with an advantage.
