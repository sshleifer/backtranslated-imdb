More like a psychological analysis of movies, but Psycho sounds better as a headline. The man in charge of the film (the narrator, if you wish) describes the films here in his own way. Most of them are classics, but they are all listed here in IMDb and I strongly recommend that you watch them (especially the Hitchcock, Solyaris, Conversation and Lynch movies), because Slavoj Zizek will mention them! <br /> <br /> Or in other words, he could spoil them for you. I do not remember if it ruined more of those that I have enumerated (I believe that also in the films of Chaplin), but as I wrote, it would be better that you saw them all beforehand. In the IMDb list there is a missing movie, which I informed them, so I could get there very soon. It's a Meg Ryan movie, but it's just a short fragment anyway, not very important. <br /> <br /> Zizek's opinions and opinions are crazy and fun to listen to, if you're open-minded to see things. Another perspective (even if that destroys your favorite movie a bit for you ... does not mean it will, but I could do it)!
