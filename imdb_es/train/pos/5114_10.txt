['While Urban Cowboy did not consume the same testosterone that could be found in a rodeo, it provided an accurate view of that day and age, in the urban area of Texas. I also believe that in order to truly criticize this film, we should have lived in the relative time and place in which it was made. There was good music, moments of fun and, yes, some &quot;rudos y caidos&quot; in the honky tonk roadhouses. Bud and Sissy&#39;s relationship, like &quot;two ships that pass at night,&quot; was well conceived. When Pam broke the note that Sissy had written to Bud, she echoed the tragedy of many real-life romances. The whole story was well thought out. I thought the cast and crew did an excellent job. I thought the screen game was well written and directed. Scott Glenn should have received an Oscar for best supporting actor.']
