The Plainsman is an entertaining western, without a doubt a classic, that is current even today. Gary Cooper is Wild Bill Hickok, ideal for the role, along with John Wayne and James Stewart, were the best actors who played the Western heroes of his generation. Jean Arthur is great as Calamity Jane, nobody that I know played better than her. Even if it were not historically accurate, the film manages to capture the most important thing about Hickok and the time that passes. Sometimes you have to sacrifice History to make your point and that is what DeMille does here. Hickok's friendship with Buffalo Bill, the sale of rifles to the Indians by a large manufacturer to compensate for the losses he would have due to the end of the civil war, Custer and Little Big Horn, the difficult relationship between the wife of Buffalo Bill . a religious woman, with Hickok, a man who had killed many, also the unusual love relationship between Hickok and Calamity makes this 'The Plainsman' an unconventional and interesting movie. Anthony Quinn has a very short appearance, which already shows what great actor he would become. Great care was taken to show the original weapons of that time.
