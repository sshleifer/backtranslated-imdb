.... after 16 years Tim Burton finally disappoints me !!!! What happened to the old Burton who read "The Dark Knight Returns" by Frank Miller as an investigation for his preparation to direct Batman in 1988-89? Apparently, Burton did not investigate the book or the film, because he was wrong in everything. This movie sucks! It is not as good as the original and does not treat the same subject as the original. If you want a good movie of apes, look at the original. <br /> <br /> ** of **** stars
