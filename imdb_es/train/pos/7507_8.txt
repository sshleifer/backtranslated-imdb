Greetings again from the darkness. Mary Heron is accumulating enough the list of films that offer a vision of their specific time. His previous "I Shot Andy Warhol" and "American Psycho" were at their best when commenting on the rarity of society during that period. Although "The Notorious Bettie Page" is obviously Ms. Page's, it's almost a spike behind the curtain in the world of curly photos in the 50s. <br /> <br /> The movie is fun to see both from the perspective of history and from the technical aspect of the way in which it was filmed and put together. The grainy film and black and white photos capture the time and the introduction of color in Miami Beach through the photos of Bunny Yeager is very well done. <br /> <br /> The cast is strong with David Strathairn (newly arrived from his Edward R (Murrow), Chris Bauer (as Irving Klaw) and Lili Taylor.The star of the film is Gretchen Mol, wonderfully talented Underestimated and with little work, Ms. Mol always brings an advantage and a spirit to her roles She was absolutely fascinating with the little seen, Jason Alexander directed "Just Looking" in 2000. Here is the notorious Bettie Page. she is captivating and her body is impeccable, she really seems to enjoy this role and helps us understand how the girl from Tennessee could become the queen of the underworld. <br /> <br /> As expected, the soundtrack Patsy Cline and Peggy Lee are just two of the featured artists, although the film suggests a story in this industry, the final third deflates and avoids the magic of the film, but the magic of Gretchen Mol and Bettie Page make this a a fun movie to watch and that will produce endless presentations on HBO in the near future. Now, will someone turn Ms. Mol into the star that she should be?
