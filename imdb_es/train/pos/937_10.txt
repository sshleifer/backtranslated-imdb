When this was initially broadcast in 1984, my wife and I recorded it on our first VHS recorder. I still have that old tape, which I try to see annually. It was the year my first child was born, and seeing A Christmas Carol in this incarnation brings back memories of happy times, many of which we spent with this movie playing in the background. I finally broke this year and ordered a DVD, which led me to take a moment to write this brief reaction to the movie. The story of Charles Dickens is captured in an outstanding way here. George C. Scott is absolutely amazing and totally believable as Scrooge. The cast is equally spectacular. This is, in my opinion, an impeccable production. Small details add a lot to the enjoyment. The game "similes" that the nephew and the wife of Scrooge play with their guests at the party is a good article. (Since then I have recreated it with my high school English students as a brief respite from class work!) Honestly, I can think of some ways to entertain myself during the holidays that I enjoy rather than indulging in this CBS production, which was originally sponsored by IBM. (Incidentally, it's fun to see the old tape with the original IBM commercials ... showing how much computers have evolved in 21 years ... Incredible how things have changed!) Conclusion: A Christmas story is a timeless story, and this Interpretation is a timeless classic. Enjoy ... and may God bless us all!
