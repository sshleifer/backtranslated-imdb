The PRC, which was the lowest of the basses, actually had a golden bump with this little thriller in a bad mood. They did the same thing a year earlier with "Detour", which is probably one of the best low budget movies ever made. <br /> <br /> "Strangler" is basically a one-set movie, full of fog and shadows, a technique used by most studios in the ranks of poverty to hide sets, or the lack of they. But here, it works well. The ghost of Charles Middleton (better known as Ming the Merciless) wobbles around the swamp killing those involved in his unjust execution for murder and generates some compassion on the part of the viewer. His last victim is being the ferryman's daughter ... he concentrates his anger not only on the people directly involved in his fate, but also on his relatives. <br /> <br /> Rosemary LaPlanche performs her usual imitation of Someone in a coma that goes through her acting style. He offers himself to the strangler to stop the murder, but as a blow to the audience, the strangler sees the goodness of his gesture as a sign that his mission is complete and returns to the afterlife, something punished. If Ulmer (who directed "Detour") has directed "Strangler", she would be hanging from the nearest tree and the strangler's work would be done. But who complains? It is not the story that attracts the most, but the wrapped sets, the lighting and the overall mood of the piece. It is located, just behind "Detour", as the best time of PRC
