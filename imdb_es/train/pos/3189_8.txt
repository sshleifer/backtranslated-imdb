This is one of the best comedy / musical "B" movies I've seen (and since I'm 40 now and I only see this now, I'm not an expert, but I've seen all the known movies out there). ). When there are a lot of actors who take their advantage for minutes at a time, comedy usually interferes with the musical fragments, and very often the musical pieces interrupt the flow of comedy. Call me crazy humor, but when I saw this at TCM Europe, I would laugh out loud with pleasure! So, who gave me the laughs? Undoubtedly, Mischa Auer gave me incredible and tremendous laughs, even steals the end, it was great! Speaking of which, I think the reason why this movie works is because although L & H are a selling point (and why I was hooked to see this one (them and Hal Roach), I love them in their first things of Hal Roach), this follows them as a minimum and stays directly in the ADULT rate (by 1930 standards, and not far from today's standards if you read between the lines). It's also great to see Jack Haley. I admit that I only know him from W O OZ and I loved him there, and I also laughed out loud here for his waiter part in the show. Patsy Kelly is the only "ugly" woman in the movies of the 30s that really excites me (something tells me that she was a great spit in real life); and the musical numbers have a real professional production quality (Busby Berkley'ish), which left me impressed of what I'm used to in this genre. I could go on and on, but rest assured that I really enjoyed this movie. 8 out of 10 I saw him at TCM Europe and I will record it to see him again with my wife at TCM USA. Good material!
