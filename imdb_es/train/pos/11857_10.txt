Many people say that Al Pacino acted in an exaggerated way, but I refer to something common for a movie role like this: a Cuban drug dealer that you need a bit more acting in this role with that Cuban accent. In general, this movie was a very good movie. I rated myself 10/10. I would recommend people to see it.
