This long episode contains an amazing amount of surprises, suspense, mystery and concerns about a battle of Sherlock's wit against Charles Augustus Milverton, a master blackmailer. This is an excellent execution time of the Jeremy Brett-Holmes series. In the film appears the usual Holmes cannon as Inspector Lestrade and Mrs. Hudson, although not Moriarty, however, is a great villain, Charles Augustus. <br /> <br /> It's a real thread of ripping with intrigue, emotion and suspense, including an exciting final twist. This is a particular Sherlock movie, but we find Holmes falling in love with a servant, kissing, crying and even stealing. This time, along with the episode "Escandalo en Boheme" with Irene Adler, it turns out to be the only one Holmes is in love with. The best performance of Brett, along with Peter Cushing are Sherlock's best TVs, while in the movies there is always Basil Rathbone. Brett is a determined, stubborn, and impetuous detective. In this case, Dr. Watson is not a comical, stupid and clumsy friend personified by Nigel Bruce, but he is a cunning and astute partner well embodied by Edward Hardwicke, a perfect counterpoint to Brett. The casting is frankly magnificent, a special mention to Robert Hardy as cunning nasty. Hardy, now famous for his role as Cornelius Fudge in Harry Potter, is a veteran actor with forty years of career and several hits such as The 10th Kingdom and Winston Churchill. There are also secondary actors with excellent performances, Nickolas Grace, Sophie Gordon, Serena Gordon, among others. The film has a colorful atmosphere, the streets of London and the house at 221 Baker Street are well designed. The film is well directed by Peter Hammond, director of several episodes. It is a must see for fans of Arthur Conan Doyle.
