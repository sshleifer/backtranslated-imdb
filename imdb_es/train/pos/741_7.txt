['I was just a little young for this, but I had to see it. There is excellent music, which many have mentioned, but nobody seems to notice a very rare appearance of &quot;Angel&quot;, a musical outfit quite popular today, but mostly ignored. Using their trademark white suits, they grind through &quot;20th Century Foxes,&quot; and apparently they all try to cram the camera&#39;s field of view. The keyboardist Gregg Giuffria is still the highlight of the band, and apparently never had a great haircut, ever! Cherie Currie (former singer of Runaways) starts here a brief, but remarkable career as an actress, and is quite memorable along with Jodie Foster and the rest. (Her 3-D topless scenes in &quot;Parasite,&quot; and her UFO sighting, in &quot;Wavelength&quot; kept us all watching her for a while). <br /><br /> It is not a masterpiece, but it retains a part of its period, so that everyone can contemplate and admire it.']
