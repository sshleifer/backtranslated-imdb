TCM keeps me up all the time ... they're still creating movies I've never heard of ... Senso ... now Ossessione ... a very early Visconti movie! ... wow ... the Italian version of The Postman Always Rings Twice ... great! beautifully acted and directed ... I never heard of any of the two tracks that were excellent, Clara Calamai, as Giovanna, and especially, Massimo Girotti as Gino ... what a sensual man! More muscular and attractive than anyone on the screen in 1943! His appearance was ahead of his time ... many male stars of the 1950s were probably inspired by him ... he should have been an important world star! The film is much better than the Jack Nicholson / Jessica Lange version and less bright than the MGM version (which I really like) with John Garfield and Lana Turner, remember that white outfit? who can forget ... This Italian version is different ... more realistic and with a very different ending ... look at it ... I'm going to buy it!
