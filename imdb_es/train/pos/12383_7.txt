Christina Raines plays a charming model in New York who looks for a new apartment and begins to meet strange neighbors and reveals a secret about the building and is slowly building up to a climax at the end of the movie. This film has all kinds of elements of the plot of the Roman Catholic Church against the Devil, the door of hell, the strange rituals, a growing conspiracy, and finally a lot of famous and talented actors and actresses that flood the movie. We get Ava Gardner, Burgess Meredith, Chris Sarandon, Jerry Orbach, Deborah Raffin, Arthur Kennedy, Jose Ferrer, Slyvia Miles, Beverly DeAngelo, Eli Wallach, Martin Balsam, Christopher Walkin, William Hickey, Tom Berenger, Jeff Goldblum, and who can Forget about Juan Carradine as the old priest. Many of these actors ruin it, especially Burgess Meredith, who offers an excellent comic / insane performance as one of the neighbors with a bird and a cat. Meredith is memorable just like Balsam and Chris Sarandon. Some of the performers have virtually nothing to do, like Jos√© Ferrer in an ungrateful role, even if it is nothing more than a cameo. The Sentinel is a good horror movie with many psychological elements and some really scary scenes. The final scene is repulsive and, nevertheless, chilling. I find fault with gratuitous sex and violence in the film, particularly in the whole scene with DeAngelo and Miles. Was this really necessary? I do not think so. In addition, the father / daughter things were a bit too, but in general the film works and has a victory rhythm. The director Michael Winner does a professional job and is effective at creating tension and moments of scary movie. The scenes with Carradine are particularly effective.
