If you like science fiction, monsters and ancient legends, you will love this movie! <br /> <br /> Special effects are by far the best I've seen since Juarassic Park hit the big screen years ago. While the performance may have been a little less than desirable, the line of history and the effects made up for it adequately. <br /> <br /> I wish I had seen this in the cinema on a movie screen instead of our large 42-inch size. TV screen. <br /> <br /> If you like non-stop action, amazing images and a taste for myths and traditions ... you have to see this movie!
