['Unlike the Tinseltown version of HELLO, DOLLY !, Jay Presson Allen&#39;s adaptation of Ira Levin&#39;s hit thriller, Broadway, he could not wait for his incarnation on stage before putting it on the silver screen, what the producers wisely decided to make the most of their long time. White road runs! The opening and closing scenes of the film are recorded inside the intimate Music Box Theater in New York, where DEATHTRAP played for almost five years. Even the final disappearance of the movie in the theater marquee is a version of the famous stage game logo. (Although the marketing experts decided to go with a more fun Rubik&#39;s cube icon for the movie). <br /><br /> Now, in a DVD release at a low price, DEATHTRAP looks as fresh and innovative as ever. The cast is fair (better than their counterparts on stage) and location scouts should be applauded for finding an appropriately spooky house for our &quot;one room thriller, two acts&quot;. It will open in a surprisingly simple and innovative way, the director Sidney Lumet, wisely, labels any &quot;new&quot; material at the beginning and end of the film and leaves only the evil center of Levin. <br /><br /> The last scene of the film is an important Hollywood deviation from the boards, and slightly undermines one of Levin&#39;s plot points from earlier in the film [Helga (on a dagger): &quot;It will be used by another woman because of the play&quot;.]]. However, just like THE PLAYER by Robert Altman, our new ending helps the film bend itself once more and blurs the lines between the stage, the screen and (could it be?) Real life!']
