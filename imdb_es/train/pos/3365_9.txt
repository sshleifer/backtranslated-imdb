['A SPECIAL DAY (Ettore Scola - Italy / Canada 1977). <br /><br /> Every once in a while, you come across a movie that really touches a nerve. This offers a very simple premise, executed almost perfectly in every way and incredibly moving at the same time. It is surprising that &quot;Una giornate particulare&quot; by Ettore Scola is relatively little known, even hated by some critics. Time Out calls it &#39;garbage&#39; and Leonard Maltin, something softer, &#39;nice but insignificant&#39;. I do not agree, not only because this film is deeply moving, but, in its simple story, it shows us more information about everyday life in Fascist Italy than most of the films I&#39;ve seen. The cinematography is clearly inconspicuous, even a little bland, and the plot is simple, which could explain the relative unpopularity of the film. Bearing in mind that at the end of the 70s, the audiences were not exactly ruined by the great Italian films, it is even more strange that this has not captured the critics. <br /><br /> The film begins with a collage of ten minutes of archive images of Hitler&#39;s visit to Italy on May 8, 1938. In this context, we meet Antonietta (Loren), a lonely and full of love housewife with six children in a Roman apartment building. One day, when his Beo escapes, he meets his neighbor Gabriele (Mastroianni), who seems to be only one in the building who does not attend the ceremonies. He is educated, educated and soon she is attracted to him. Throughout the film, we listened to the fascist rally of the concierge radio that passed through the courtyard. Scola uses the camera playfully to make us part of the procedures. After the initial scene, the camera crosses the courtyard of the modernist apartment block (hypermodern at the time), apparently looking for our main characters, whom we still do not know. <br /><br /> Marcello Mastrionani and Sophia Loren are unforgettable in the two main roles, all the more amazing since they are completely against the guy. John Vernon, born in Canada, plays Loren&#39;s husband, but only appears on the screen in the first and last scene. I imagine that her voice must have been dubbed, since she is not of Italian descent and never lived there, as far as I know, so I can not imagine her speaking Italian. If your voice has been doubled, I did not notice at all. On the contrary, he is completely credible as Italian, even more so than the rest of the cast. The story is simple but extremely effective, the performances are exceptional, the ending is simply perfect and the framing is not too pretentious, it works completely. Do not miss this one. <br /><br /> Dark Chamber --- 9/10']
