Since musicals have gone out of style and are incredibly expensive to do without all the talent necessary to make one without a studio contract, I doubt that we will ever have a true story of Enrico Caruso. <br /> <br /> But if everything else was in place, it was no accident that no Hollywood studio attempted to do the job until Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer had Mario Lanza under contract. No one else could have done it, I doubt that it will ever try again. <br /> <br /> And why should I do it. I think that Enrico Caruso himself would have been satisfied as to how his singing was represented on the screen. Because his tenor voice was his life, his reason for being on earth. <br /> <br /> To say that you took liberties with your life is to be modest. Caruso, like the man who portrayed him, was a man of great appetite, although with much more self-discipline. He had numerous relationships with several women and had two children out of wedlock who are not in this film. <br /> <br /> Your contribution to the record industry is treated almost as a late occurrence. It is shown in a recording studio once late in his life. Actually, he started recording around the turn of the last century and, along with Irish tenor John McCormack for RCA, Victor made the recording industry what he became. <br /> <br /> When Caruso and McCormack were at their peak, they practically had to inherit a ticket to see one of them play live. But many Italian and Irish immigrant families had a phonograph and one or three of these men. That is why both became the legends that they are. <br /> <br /> What the film has is a beautifully staged operatic aria made by Mario Lanza, a sample of what could have become the discipline of a Caruso to stay with the opera. The Great Caruso won an Oscar for sound recording and received nominations for costume and set design. <br /> <br /> Mario himself helped popularize the film with an RCA Red Seal album of songs by The Great Caruso. Unfortunately, due to contractual obligations, we could not get a real cast album with Ann Blyth, Dorothy Kirsten and Jarmila Novotna as well. <br /> <br /> Although Blyth sang it in the film, Lanza was very successful recording The Most Beautiful Night of the Year, as well as helping to popularize The Great Caruso. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a life of Enrico Caruso, this is not the answer. If you are looking for a great artist who sings at the height of his career, you should not miss the Gran Caruso.
