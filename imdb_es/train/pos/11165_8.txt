Four words explain why this movie was made: "She did it wrong." The enormous commercial success of that Mae West vehicle convinced scholars that Gay's 90s melodramas were a viable proposition. Here we are rewarded with a fast and well-written movement, which perfectly points to the personalities of its stars. <br /> <br /> Wallace Beery and George Raft are excellent as friendly rivals; Jackie Cooper is a bit harder to take, but it's Fay Wray who steals the movie with her maid in distress. With a strong director, as Walsh proves to be, Wray could have a lot of power, and is absolutely credible as the object of both Raft's and Beery's affection. <br /> <br /> Much atmosphere, beautifully designed, This is a forgotten film worthy of revival.
