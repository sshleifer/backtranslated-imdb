I found it a charming adaptation, very lively and full of fun. With the exception of a couple of important mistakes, the cast is wonderful. I have to echo some of the previous comments: Chynna Phillips is terribly grumpy when she was a teenager. At 27, she is too old (and, yes, SHOWS), and she lacks the "chops" for Broadway-style music. Vanessa Williams is a pretty decent singer and, for a non-dancer, is adequate. However, she is NOT a Latina, and her character definitely is. She is also very STRESSED in everything, which becomes boring. <br /> <br /> The girls from the Sweet Apple Conrad Birdie fan club really shine, with special recognition for Brigitta Dau and Chiara Zanni. I also enjoyed the performance of Tyne Daly, although generally I am not a fan of her work. Finally, the Shriners dancers are a fuss, especially the three fools at the bar. <br /> <br /> The film is suitable for the whole family, and I highly recommend it.
