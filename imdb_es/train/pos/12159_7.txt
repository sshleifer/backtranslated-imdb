- After their children are sentenced to life imprisonment, Adelle (Debbie Reynolds) and Helen (Shirley Winters) begin receiving threatening telephone calls because someone feels that their children easily escaped. The couple decides to move to California to escape the publicity of the trial and start a new life. They start a dance school that will soon be very successful. One of the students has a rich single father with whom Adelle quickly falls in love. Meanwhile, Helen is busy raising rabbits and is infatuated too much with an evangelist on the radio. It's only a matter of time before everything falls apart and women enter a world of madness and murder. <br /> <br /> - I can not help comparing what happens with Helen. Whoever Slew Auntie Roo?, also starring Shelly Winters. Where that movie seemed almost restricted in its presentation of Aunt Roo's madness, there's nothing to hold Helen in this movie. It can take a lot of time to execute the movie, but once she adjusts, Helen is a Bad Mad Mutha. You do not want to mess with her. Winters is so deliciously insane that it was impossible for me not to enjoy his performance. I'm not going to spoil the movie, but the things that Helen is capable of doing are totally exaggerated. <br /> <br /> - As good as Winters is, Reynolds is totally ridiculous in his role as gold. -Digging dancer from the tap. I got the impression that she thought I was in a movie that would nominate her for some prize. This is not a citizen Kane! Stop acting so serious. Hey, Debbie, you do not realize that your main goal is to be a victim of Winters' madness. <br /> <br /> - I love these ex-star-stars-in-the-twilight horror movies of his career. What's wrong with Helen? It's as fun as any other.
