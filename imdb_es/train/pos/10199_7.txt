As a child, I loved this game. I played it a million times during the spring of 1993 with my friend Andrew. I used to play Axel or Blaze and he would be Adam and no matter how often we played, we never seemed to get bored. Then came the streets of anger 2. And we quickly forgot that it even existed. <br /> <br /> You play like the ex-cops Axel Stone, Adam or Blaze Fielding, who have given up the strength to face the bad guys in their own way. There are 8 levels to work in a destroyed and corrupt city led by the evil Mr. X. Hit all the bad guys and the final level boss is very funny. Level 4 (The bridge) was my favorite because you could throw the bad guys through the holes in the river. You even have the opportunity to become Mr. X's right hand at the end of the game (at a price). This leads to the "bad end" in which you become the head of the union. Exactly how this is possible is a mystery, since you destroy the union on your way to Mr. X, but it does not matter. <br /> <br /> Streets of Rage also has truly fantastic music. Composer Yuzo Koshiro performed absolute miracles with the limited technology of Sega Genesis. The main theme, Level One, Level 4 and Final Boss are the featured melodies. <br /> <br /> As a Wii owner, I am proud to have this forever on my console. But with Streets of Rage 2 also available, it makes the first one obsolete. <br /> <br /> Pros: <br /> <br /> Average graphics, but beautiful backgrounds represented in a comic like Progression of the panel that fits the tone of the game. <br /> <br /> Great melodies. <br /> <br /> It is easy to understand and difficult to set aside. <br /> <br /> Cons: <br /> <br /> Vastly inferior to the infinitely more complex Streets of Rage 2. <br /> <br /> Poor enemy AI. The bad guys often get away from you instead of getting involved in a fight. This is especially annoying with the Level 5 boss. <br /> <br /> The lack of combined moves. <br /> <br /> The lack of decent weapons. <br /> <br /> Bad type models repeat a lot. With a lot of frequency. <br /> <br /> Graphics B- Sound A- Gameplay B- Durable appeal B-
