This is an excellent film about a traditional working class family in the north of England. Shot on location in Bolton, he stars James Mason as the father who is the dominant force within his home. Or so it seems. Intelligently, the film, based on the work, portrays the complexities of family life. The cast of support is also excellent, with many familiar faces that provide support.
