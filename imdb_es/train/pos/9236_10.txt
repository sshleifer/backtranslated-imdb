Think of the people, give up speaking badly of the original, because it is time for the original Battlestar series to be a masterpiece, even with all the stars, stories and art. Lorne Greene was great as Adama and Richard Hatch was perfect as Apollo and Dirk Benedict was fun as Starbuck, but dare I say, not as pretty as Katee as Starbuck. <br /> <br /> I loved that the episode with Pegasus and Greetings from Earth was good. John Calicos was great as Baltar, the War of the Gods, the best was Experiment in Terra, I thought it was a tribute in a way to Heaven Can Wait, then you had the women of Battlestar, not to compare them with, say, Tricia, which is incredibly beautiful as Number Six, but the beauty of Jane Seymour can not be compared. Not to mention Loerrta Spang, since Cassiopea was fantastic. He had a beauty that would shame a rainbow. I loved the original as much as the new one. <br /> <br /> Can you imagine if John Calicos had the number six? :) <br /> <br /> Thanks for listening.
