['Penny Princess finds that the American worker Yolande Donlon is the heiress of a small kingdom located in that triangle where France, Italy and Switzerland meet, called Lampidorra. It seems that the Lampidoreros have invoices throughout Europe and the main occupation of the country is contraband due to its geography. A US billionaire buys the place, but dies before he can get the title. His closest heir is Donlan. <br /><br /> But, of course, the state has to go through the succession in the United States and what should the Lampidoros do? Especially because Donlan, who has now become a princess, has banned smuggling. <br /><br /> Enter Dirk Bogarde, who is traveling in Switzerland to learn about the cheese industry. It seems that the Lampidoreros have a type of cheese that they playfully refer to as Schmeeze. With some obstacles on the way, Schmeeze solves all the financial, geopolitical and romantic problems between Donlan and Bogarde. <br /><br /> How does Schmeeze work? Well, that&#39;s the trick of the whole movie. But here is a clue. In Lover Come Back, Jack Kruschen could have understood Schmeeze&#39;s secret when he was busy inventing VIPs for Rock Hudson and his advertising agency. <br /><br /> Anyway, Penny Princess is a delicious combination of British farce and romantic comedy. Yolande Donlon once again plays a role in which Marilyn Monroe would have been chosen if the film had been made from this side of the pond. Dirk Bogarde was chosen for the part that was at the beginning of his career as a romantic beat, long before anyone, except him, suspected that he had the acting skills he had. <br /><br /> This movie was sadly at three in the morning at TCM. But at least I found a reason to be grateful for the insomnia.']
