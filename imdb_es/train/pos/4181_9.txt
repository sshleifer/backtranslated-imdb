I have not seen this film for a long time (at least 15 years) and yet I am being persecuted by a vivid picture of the terrible consequences that prisoners of war can face despite the terms of the Geneva Convention. <br /> <br /> A unit of experts in Australian underwater demolitions are captured in an archipelago near Japan after a successful mission to establish mines in a Japanese port. <br /> <br /> Once in prison, these men expect the same treatment as any other prisoner of war. but to their dismay, they soon learn from a friendly Japanese prison guard that they are being tried as spies since they were out of uniform when they were captured. The consequences of such an infraction, by the Japanese martial code, is execution by beheading. <br /> <br /> Despite his pleas and those of the nice prison guard, the day of the counting of accounts comes like a time bomb. The tension is so high that you will actually hear the ticking, although it may be the blow to your chest with the percussion of a running squad. <br /> <br /> The ending is actually too painful to return to acting in my head much less. write it here But I can promise you that you will never forget it. Good luck finding the video in the United States.
