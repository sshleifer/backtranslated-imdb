"Cutting" is a full-fledged parody of the slasher genre and, in general, accomplishes what it intends to do. Most of the standard slasher clich√©s are there; The creepy old house, the forest, the anonymous indestructible serial killer, buckets of blood and, of course, the couple interrupted by the murderer while they are having sex (that's not a problem). <br /> <br /> The set-up is the simplicity itself: the nerds of the film school set out to complete a "masterpiece" of unfinished slasher, unfinished due to the murders of a couple of actors. This also in an orderly fashion - well, messy - eliminates Kylie Minogue on the first reel. They were joined by one of the survivors of the original film, played by Molly Ringwald, who steals the film absolutely because it gets all the best lines. The rest of the cast fits well with their roles, especially the charming Jessica Napier, who plays straight while chaos and blood sprout around her. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of red herrings and fake moments of suspense, and there's very little time to try to figure out who the killer is because the movie moves at such a rapid pace. It also has a suitable low budget aspect, including a clumsy edition that is probably deliberate. Good soundtrack, too. If there is a difficulty with this film, it is to decide if it is a shipment or a tribute to the slasher genre. Probably a bit of both.
