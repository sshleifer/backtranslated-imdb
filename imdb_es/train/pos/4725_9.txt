['Despite the lack of logic present in the story, Kill Shot is a very nice movie. Through a moving performance, Kasper Van Dien brilliantly portrays the emotional division between a rich and hard-working father and his wrong son. Each member of the cast of support intervenes with a solid performance, highlighted by the vivid performance of a young Asian whose name I can not remember. A surprisingly tragic ending can disconcert some younger viewers, but in general, a deadly Shot really hits a death blow.']
