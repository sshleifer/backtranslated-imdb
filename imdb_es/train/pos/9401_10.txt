What a wonderful movie, eligible for so many labels you never get: science fiction, black cinema, with a script and a dialogue of high intelligence that assumes a cultured and educated public ... the kind of film in English that is only made in England prior to 1960 (and it is only shown in US art theaters when it first arrived), and it has never been done in the US. UU <br /> <br /> Main characters in The Man in the White Suit (1951), starring Sir Alec Guiness and Joan Greenwood, routinely use polysyllabic words, scientific reference words such as "polymer" and discuss and explain concepts of chemistry such as "long chain molecules" and then communicate the importance of these to the average man and the benefits that science provides. <Br /> <br /> The Man in the White Suit (1951) is the opposite of the videogame explosion movies that now (2009) dominate world cinema, and certainly dominate the most important cinema in the US. UU story told intelligently delivered by educated and credible English actors (who pla and educated, people fulfilled), and everything is done with comedy, charm, pathos and sense of irony that the ancient Greek dramatists would have approved. <br /> <br /> Everyone should see this movie, and someday, somehow, some worthy filmmaker and his supporters should do something like this. <br /> <br /> It's wonderful.
