Zentropa is the most original film I've seen in years. If you like unique thrillers that are influenced by black movies, then this is the right cure for all Hollywood blockbusters that clog the theaters these days. Von Trier's tracks, like Breaking the Waves, have been more acclaimed, but this is really his best work. It is eye-catching without distraction and offers the perfect combination of suspense and black humor. Too bad he decided that the handheld cameras were the wave of the future. It is difficult to say who took him away from the style he exhibits here, but it is a loss for all that went in his direction of strongly theoretical dogma.
