Many people have commented that this movie was not as good as the first one. Well, maybe it is not for you. However, how does your child react? Well, I loved it more than the first one. <br /> <br /> Disney movies from the past can sometimes be a bit harsh for young children. (For example, Bambi's mother is shot.) This movie was really great for my sensitive girl who likes humor and happy endings. <br /> <br /> If you want to be snobby about what Disney standards should be based on the past - skip this movie. <br /> <br /> If you have a sweet girl or a soft-hearted child that you really want to please, buy this movie and treat your little ones. This movie is great as an hour of sleep for happy dreams instead of nightmares. I am happy with a movie that pleases my son and does not need to impress parents all the time.
