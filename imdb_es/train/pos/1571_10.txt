['Not since Spongebob Squarepants have I seen a great caricature on television. The colors are great, the voices could not be better, the characters are so original, a great big caricature. Esperanza Nickolodean continues to develop this caricature. I hope the season DVD comes out soon! I love cartoons of this type and I hope more people tune in to see this great cartoon. It is very difficult to find the DVD of the season, so if someone finds a store that is selling it, let me know. The only Catscratch merchandise available in Nick Shop is an excellent shirt, but very, very, very expensive! If you like SpongeBob; and who does not? You will love Catscratch too!']
