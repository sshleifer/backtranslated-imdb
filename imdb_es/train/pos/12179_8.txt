['It happened that I saw this movie by chance a few days ago while changing channels. My expectations were not very high, but it was an interesting movie. In &#39;A Guy Thing&#39;, Jason Lee plays Paul, a Seattle-based guy who is about to marry his girlfriend Karen (Selma Blair) and settle down for a life without challenge of middle class domesticity. We meet Paul for the first time at his bachelor party, where he professes no desire to participate in any of the bachelor party activities that his friends (surprisingly few) encourage, in case he is a bit naughty and get very upset with your soon to be a problem. and the fight. Of course, the next thing Paul knows is that it&#39;s the morning after the night before, he&#39;s in bed with a naked hula dancer and his mother-in-law phones to inform him that Karen is on his way. Oh, and the hula dancer is Karen&#39;s cousin, Becky (Julia Stiles). <br /><br /> From this little acorn of potential problems arises a great oak of frantic disgrace, while Paul goes from misfortune to misery, trying to cover up what he has done while maintaining the appearance of being a good family-oriented guy, super excited. about his upcoming nuptials. His efforts to ensure that Karen is not wiser about any possible wrongdoing on his part, ironically, forces Paul to get closer and closer to the fun-loving Becky, forcing him to question whether he really wants life that seems to have been planned for him. . The film contains the right mix of comedy and romance. Definitely worth a watch.']
