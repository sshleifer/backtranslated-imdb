This movie impressed me amazingly. It contained fundamental elements of depression, grief, loneliness, despair, hope, dreams and companionship. It was not just a genius musician who touched bottom, but a man caught in pain trying to find comfort in his music. He finds a partner who comes with his own problems. Claire and Des were able to give each other friendship and love, but more importantly, a conclusion to the events that had shaped their lives for the worst. <br /> <br /> Des is an unlikely character by the current standards of a rock star. However, he has a musical genius. He also has an event in his past that has stalled him, while the things that surround him literally go bankrupt. His focus is to create his Whale Music, in fact, it becomes an obsession for him. <br /> <br /> Claire is the street girl who needs a place to stay. She finds hidden talents while in the company of Des. She also finds a mutual friend who accepts her. She learns to trust him for a period of time. <br /> <br /> These two find love with each other. It is not the kind of passion, the infused sex, but a love where friendship and understanding mean more. For two people who have been injured, they find trust together.
