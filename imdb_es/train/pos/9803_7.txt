This Batman movie is not as good as the Batman mask of The Phantasm and Batman and the subzero Freeze of Butman. But it's still a good part of Batman cartoons. I say it's just as good as Batman Beyond The Movie. This movie is good for all the same reasons. The story is good, not as good as the other story, but it's still pretty good. The animation of the actors is good. The voice of the actors is very good, like Kevin Conroy and Batman. / Bruce Wayne, Tara Strong as Barbra Gordon, Efrem Zimbalist Jr., Eli Marienthal as Robin. The villains are good, like Kyra Sedgwick as Batwoman, David Ogden Stiers as The Pequin, Hector Elizondo as Bane. So I'm sure you will not be disappointed with Batman Mystery of The Batwomen. So be sure to rent or buy the Batman movie Mystery of The Batwoman because it's really good. <br /> <br /> Overall score: ******* of ********* * <br /> <br /> *** out of *****
