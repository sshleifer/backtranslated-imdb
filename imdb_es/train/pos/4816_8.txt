I enjoyed the movie very much. It will certainly leave the audience wanting to know more, and there is much more to discover historically! <br /> <br /> Did the production team fall into the temptation of excessive dramatization, especially of the shooting event? There is a lot of interesting precise material hinted at? The contribution of Prince Albert to the United Kingdom and the monarchy guarantees a film in itself, but it is granted that apparently it was not part of the intention here. <br /> <br /> The suits and sets are especially good, but I'm just thinking that this production (what to judge by the length of the titles at the end was not, of course, a cheap one) did you want a expert in historical etiquette of the British court beyond the Duchess of York? that is, did Princess Victoria really put a whole truffle (?) in her mouth while talking to the Prime Minister in the company of His Majesty with his mouth full? <br /> <br /> 'I could never really feel sympathy for Victoria in this movie, or even in her shoes. However, I loved the casting of the directors, whose performance was convincing, so the script really allowed us to know them well? I always felt like an external observer completely unattached and uninformed, much more than with "Mrs. Brown" or even "The Queen". However, to be honest, I still could not take my eyes off the screen, except that it is some of the most avant-garde camera techniques that distracted from time to time.
