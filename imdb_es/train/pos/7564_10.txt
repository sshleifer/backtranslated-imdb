In my line of work, I am occasionally contacted by independent filmmakers who try to make their film known. When I can, I watch these low-budget movies and often make me think that the future of Hollywood is going to the dogs. From time to time, however, there is a film that is born of pure passion and desire, as if it had been created with the purpose of reminding the film industry that good movies are still possible. The short film BROKEN, directed by Alex Ferrari, is a real surprise and it's worth taking a second look. <br /> <br /> In just 20 minutes, BROKEN tries to tell a compelling (but surreal) story with almost no return history. The audience drops in the middle of the action without any clue as to what is happening. A young girl (Samantha Jane Polay) wakes up from a dream to hear a gunshot and then is kidnapped from her home. When she wakes up, she is surrounded by a group of mercenary thugs who seem to be at home in a comic book. These unpleasant boys and girls are bigger than life. All are guns and knives. No exit. <br /> <br /> The trick here is that, despite being a low budget movie, it does not play like one. From the beginning, the feeling is that B R O K E N has been filmed, edited and produced by professionals. It seems that something Quentin Tarantino could have done on his day off when he was playing with the Wachowski brothers. The film is crisp and fresh, it looks good and feels like something big. <br /> <br /> The acting is much better than I usually see in these smaller films. Polay and Paul Gordon (who plays the main murderer, Duncan) were well chosen. As two of the few roles they speak in the film, it is up to them to take the film. No special effect, no matter how good it was, would have saved this movie from acting badly. Fortunately, Polay manages to convey a real fear and Gordon manages to emerge as a true psychopath. Some of the more limited roles seem to be occupied by a lesser talent, but almost not shown. <br /> <br /> The disadvantage of B R O K E N is that it only lasts 20 minutes. The story ends with a Twilight Zone twist that seems a bit artificial and is barely subtle. Seeing it, I felt that it was supposed to have some revelation, but I just had the feeling that it was much more mundane than I expected. The film strives to be one of those puzzles that leaves the audience talking for hours at the local coffee shop, but it is unsatisfactory. I still think that these are the first 20 minutes of a longer movie. <br /> <br /> MY QUALIFICATION: 8 out of 10.
