Okay, I'll admit that the cast in the movie is REALLY strange, part of this is due to the plot, but I still had some trouble believing that Pierce Brosnan interpreted this advantage (although he really did a good job). <br /> <br /> It is based on the true story of an Englishman who went to live with the Canadian Indians at the beginning of the 20th century. He claimed to be an Indian of mixed blood. In fact, he was so successful and well thought that people came from all over to listen to his lectures and be taken to his travels in the desert, although he was not an Indian of mixed blood and all his knowledge was of books or false! The film focuses on this and what happened when the deception was discovered. <br /> <br /> The acting and the sets were great and I really liked the movie (once I suspended the disbelief about Brosnan). It did not have a widespread distribution, probably because it was quite cerebral, not a Bond movie or a romance, just a really strange movie about a remarkable man.
