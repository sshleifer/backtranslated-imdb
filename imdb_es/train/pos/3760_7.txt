I may not have been ready for the academy awards and, no doubt, it's pretty cheesy, but it's a lot of fun! Nothing makes me smile like Bill and Ted. Adorable, optimistic and hilarious, Bill and Ted are an excellent way to relax. <br /> <br /> Although I love Excellent Adventure, Bogus Journey is more fun for me. Death is very funny and Bill and Ted are even more attractive. People are sorry for loving this movie, but only the really pretentious spectators will say that it is not even a bit entertaining. If you like this, you're probably also a fan of Wayne's World, Dude Where's My Car, and Dumb and Dumber. Admit it, although silly, make you smile and turn the tickle box over. So just watch them for kicks and giggles!
