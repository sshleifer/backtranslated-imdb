This is almost in the same league as 'The Black Cat', although I give it a 9 instead of a 9+. It's a compliment for a movie that has been so underestimated that it's amazing! <br /> <br /> `'The invisible ray' 'is partly horror, partly drama and certainly science fiction. For a movie made in 1936, the elements of science fiction were far ahead of their time. The mixture of horror, drama and science fiction is a perfect combination, while the performance of Lugosi and Karloff could not be better. <br /> <br /> Director Lambert Hillyer captures many elements that James Whale did so often. What I am saying is that this movie is mysterious and well filmed. The scene with the gargoyles outside Lugosi's room is a perfect example of the mood. It is a highlight in the film, which unfortunately is missing in the films of today's genre. <br /> <br /> As with 'The Black Cat' and 'Island of Lost Souls', I can not understand why this movie has not yet been released on DVD. When you consider that part of the trash that has already been transferred to DVD is much more disconcerting. <br /> <br /> Anyway, look at this movie if you have the opportunity. When it is published on DVD, paste it quickly and place it in a place of honor within your DVD library.
