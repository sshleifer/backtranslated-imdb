An excellent period of melodramatic murder, with Fontaine effectively playing against his naive type of wallflower, in a role Olivia DeHavilland reportedly rejected. That's fine, because Fontaine is wonderful. Written by Charles Bennett, who had written for Hitchcock in the thirties and also later wrote the excellent script of the classic British horror film The Night of the Devil. The opening scene, where Ivy visits a sinister fortune-teller played by the wonderful Una O'Connor (the squeaker of James Whale's fame), is a tour de force, and the film maintains interest during the numerous and sinister machinations. I hope to see this movie on DVD some day, but I'm desperate for that to happen, because it seems to be a movie that is not worth it. Fortunately, I was able to see it at AMC about seven or eight years ago, but I have not seen it since. Catch it if you can!
