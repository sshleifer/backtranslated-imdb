I really wanted to see this movie, since it has been announced as a movie that has to be seen for people who love movies about nature. The film shows different climates and the animals associated with them, starting at the North Pole and going south as the film progresses. The images of this film are often incredibly beautiful and I often wondered how on Earth they could have taken some of the shots underwater or in the sky. However beautiful, a large part of the images I had already seen in the television series 'Planet Earth', narrated by David Attenborough. I found that Attenborough's narrative of Planet Earth is much better than Earth's narrative. 'The Earth' is an easier movie. It omits many of the scientific details that Attenborough covers in his series 'Planet Earth'. For example, the Earth will tell you that a tropical sea is an ideal nursery for a young humpback whale, because there are few predators. Planet Earth will tell you that a tropical sea is a good nursery, because water is low in oxygen and does not contain enough nutrients to support very large animals, such as large sharks, etc. For me, that is an important difference. That, along with the very superior voice of Attanborough, makes Planet Earth a much better documentary than Earth. However, I think it is worth seeing the Earth for the beautiful images and the fact that it is easier to understand also makes it interesting for children.
