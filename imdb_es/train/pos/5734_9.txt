I consider myself a great admirer of the works of David Lynch, as it provides viewers with absolutely unique moving images with the typical "Lynch elements". Having seen most of his works, I naively thought I could predict Lynch's next step. I was completely wrong. Dumbland is something I could never have imagined under the name of David Lynch. Still, after recovering from the first shock, I began to contemplate this extremely primitive main character, and came to the conclusion that all the absurdities, cruelty, brutality and disgust that are presented here are reflections of reality, which are emphasized by distorting it. . There are things in our lives that we almost never emphasize, because they are disgusting or horrible, however, they surround us, so I dare say that Dumbland focuses on these fragments. This is not a movie to enjoy, although sometimes you will laugh at a strange and perverted sense of humor, this is an animated reflection of all the things we prefer to refuse to observe, with its simplicity, morbidity and absurdity. Take it as it is, you do not have to like it. It simply exists. And finally, if you're attentive enough, you'll also find typical Lynch elements. I recommend it for tolerant people !!!
