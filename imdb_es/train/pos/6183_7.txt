Paramount, economically tied, pulled out all the stops for this adaptation entry to the '34 stage: big budget, big cast, extravagant production and Mitch Leisen labeled as the director. What happened? Two things: Busby Berkeley did not work for unfocused rock and a murder mystery script that did not deserve to be in the same trash bin as Charlie Chan's worst project on the street. I have to believe that Leisen was left out of the cut, since the number of the great Duke Ellington is savagely cut, but that does not mean it's not worth seeing: the number of 'Sweet Marijuana' with topless choir is an idea. blower, considering the upcoming production code and also has the dazzling Toby Wing (who, unfortunately, fed on horrible lines and played the silly blonde prototype) as a chorionist for a Jack Oakie otherwise worried. The performance of Carl Brisson is bland as Melba Toast but he is a competent singer. MacLaglen reaches new platforms like a stupid stereotyped detective. And try to locate Lucy in the choir. This qualifies 7.0 as a curiosity. February 2010, reconsider: I recently gave the film another look and now I feel I was wrong to criticize Busby Berkeley's lack of production numbers. I can understand Leisen's argument to get more realistic production numbers within the context of the plot. I still have huge problems with editing though. Paramount, the largest studio in the city, faced major problems with the Production Code at the worst possible time in its history, financially speaking, and made all the stops in this one (also see the Beauty Search of 1934). A must for the pre-code buffs.
