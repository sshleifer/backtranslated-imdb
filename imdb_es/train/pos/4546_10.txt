This film will go down in history as one of the greats, right next to Citizen Kane, Casablanca and On The Waterfront. Someone please convince Leno to make a sequel! Leno and Morita are a comedy duo, as they have not seen since Abbot and Costello. The evil that emanates from Chris Sarandon, Tom Noonan and Randall "Tex" Cobb will give you chills. The character of Dingman as the off buffoonish goes back to the days of Shakespeare's comedies. And the climax. My God, the climax. I will not ruin it for you, but the explosion of the Death Star pales in comparison. If you can trace this hard-to-find gem, do yourself and your family a favor and buy immediately. I still hope for a special edition DVD one of these days.
