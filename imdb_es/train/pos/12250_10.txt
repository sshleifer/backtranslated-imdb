Kate Beckinsale steals the show! Bravo! Too bad Knightly is not as handsome as Jeremy Northam. Mark Strong did a fabulous job. Bernard Hepton was perfect as Emmas' father. I love the final scene (which is an addition to the novel, but it is well written) when the harvest begins and Knightly dines with his workers and friends of the high society. Emma must show that she accepts this now. She is a changed woman. That's too fast, but it's fine. I'll buy it. Samantha Bond plays the former governor and confidant of Emma. She is wonderful. As I would have imagined it. I think when the United Kingdom does a Jane Austen it is the best. The American versions of English literature are made for money and not for quality. Watch this!
