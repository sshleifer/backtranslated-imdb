['There is a legion of enemies of Mick Garris out there who feel that he could not direct a quality horror movie if he had to. And, SLEEPWALKERS (script written by Stephen King) is often used as an example of this. I like the SLEEPWALKERS, although I am aware that Garris simply says F # ck it and lets all the hell break loose around fifteen or more minutes of the movie. Forget the development of the character or plot, who needs them anyway. It is a violent chaos and a bloody carnage when a mother and her son are couples of &quot;sleepwalkers&quot; (... changing creatures of feline-human forms that suck the life force of innocent virgin women, who move from city to city , living a nomadic, truly powerful existence). Looks at a teenager who does not give up without a fight. Before all is said and done, many will be killed like a mother who will not tolerate the possible death of her beloved son. <br /><br /> Garris loses a little time preparing those who will be executed, as a teacher (Glenn Shadix), suspecting that the handsome and charming American Charles Brady (Brian Krause) is a completely different character than he says, they rip his hand and tear him the neck. inside. Charles draws the pretty virgins into his arms, drawing his energy, in turn &quot;feeding&quot; his hungry mother, Mary (Alice Krige). The new new target is Tanya Robertson (Mädchen Amick), and it seems that she is easy to take, but this will not be the case and when Charles is seriously injured in a fight (... thanks to an officer&#39;s cat, Clovis), Mary&#39;s revenge Will be harvested in all those who get away with it. Mary, in hell or in the water, will recover Tanya with the aim of &quot;refreshing&quot; her dying son. <br /><br /> Like many teenagers, I was in love with certain actresses I saw in the movies. Like Amy Dolenz, I fell in love with Mädchen Amick. She is simply adorable in this movie and I love how she bites her lower lip, showing an obvious attraction to Charles, without realizing her hidden motives. I only knew that Mädchen Amick would be destined to be a screaming queen, but this would never be the case. Pity because I would have received it in the genre with open arms. <br /><br /> Krige is delicious as the threatening bitch, damn sexy, but vicious and petty that destroys all the police force and poor Tanya&#39;s parents at once, in less than ten minutes. She stabs one on the back with an ear of corn! She takes the fingers of poor Ron Perlman, before breaking his arm (... a protruding bone), leaving him unconscious with his own elbow! She throws Tanya&#39;s mother out of a window after breaking a vase of roses on her father&#39;s face! Charles (Cop-kebab!) Stabs an assistant in the ear and falls to the pencil to give him an additional impact. Poor Tanya is dragged by her hair from her house by Mary, driven to Brady&#39;s house, and forced to dance improvised with the crippled monster! The sheriff is thrown into a fence and we see how cats fight sleepwalkers unlike humans. We see the skills of Mary and Charles to &quot;soften&quot; themselves and their car using a power of invisibility. The writer Stephen King even finds time to include himself and his fellow directors of terror in a sequence of the crime scene with Clive Barker and Tobe Hooper as forensic officers, Joe Dante and John Landis as photographers. <br /><br /> The film was filmed in an ironic tone and left it all on one side with music that properly hammers this technique at home. It is about extreme violence, as simple as that, with a disorderly behavior and a jet black humor that complements the direction of Garris and King&#39;s script. The incestuous angle of sleepwalkers is a bit jarring and on your face. Without a bit of complexity, this is closer to King&#39;s own MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE insane than to his more serious works.']
