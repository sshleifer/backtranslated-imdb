Eric Valette is obviously a talented filmmaker, and so are the two guys who wrote the script. Therefore, Mal√©fique is a great movie, made with only a few dollars but also tons of imagination. Well, I am a little exaggerated, but nevertheless I am sincere. So, if you like dark and bloody movies, go see this one. Really worth it.
