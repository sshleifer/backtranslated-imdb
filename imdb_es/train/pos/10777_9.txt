Radiofrequency is a film about all of us, about our dreams, our friends, our obsessions, our addictions, our fears. It is a brilliant film where a group of friends like us all lived through the difficulties of growing up in a small city in one of the most significant decades of the last century. The film does not have a happy or sad approach to things, it just tells us a story, one that we could all have experienced. One of happiness and emotion, sadness and grief. The power of this story is that we grow to love the characters, it's one of those movies you'll see again and again, feeling closer to the small town in Emilia Romagna where it develops. Hoping one day to finally be able to walk through its streets next to Freccia and her friends, listening to the music that changed the world through the crackling sound of an old radio on Radio Raptus International, touching her dreams, our dreams. The radiofrequency will make you laugh, it will make you cry sometimes, it will surprise and comfort you, it will give you and it will take you away. Personally I think he played an important role in my life and in that of my friends, and I suggest you see it and let it become part of yours.
