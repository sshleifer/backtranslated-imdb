Once again, Jet Li takes his charismatic presence to the movie screen in the movie Black Mask. In this film, Li plays Tsui, a fugitive from a super soldier program that seeks to recover the humanity that the program had taken from him. To do this, Tsui decides to become a librarian to live a normal and peaceful life, but fate demands that he cleanse the problems of his past before he can continue to seek peace. Other members of the super soldier program had escaped at the same time as Tsui, but want to equate with the world instead of finding inner peace. Thus, Tsui becomes the only thing that can prevent his former teammates from divulging information that could cost the lives of many innocent people. This movie screams through the screen at a frenetic pace and never lets its audience go. Martial arts are amazing, but because they use cables, the American public may not appreciate them as much as they deserve. If you like action movies that have an interesting story and demand good acting performances because they deal with psychological and physical conflicts, then Black Mask is for you. I am pleased to see that some of Jet Li's films are finally released in the United States and I hope to see how the changes that this release will require (things like dubbing and soundtrack) will affect the film. This is one of Li's best movies, go out and watch them on May 14 when they premiere in America.
