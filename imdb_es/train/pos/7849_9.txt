This short is a bewilderment. The words fail me here, since this is almost indescribable, technically exceptional after more than 90 years (the images are amazing and even sometimes amazing), this is not something you see if you like mundane or "normal" things, because most certainly is not either. This can be a strange, gang. It's worth taking a look, but if things like Ren and Stimpy make your head hurt, you may want to skip it. Recommended.
