I gave him an 8 just because he had received so many votes ... this is really a 5.5 ... Ummm ... it was a bit bloody, he had nice and shallow characters, and he had some really hot babies in that. I like the eclectic murderer, because he did not kill people in the same way every time ... he sometimes gets old.
