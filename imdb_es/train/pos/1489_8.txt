In general, the movie is fine. I think it's better than Sepet and much better than Gubra in terms of its history, its sentimental value. <br /> <br /> There are some scenes that move me. Yes, I agree that the boy (Mukhsin) acted very well. Sparkly. I can say that his performance is almost natural. <br /> <br /> However, the song 'Ne Me Quitte Pas' by Nina Simone really "" menaikkan' my 'bulu' 'roma' ". <br /> <br /> I love the song. the song "Ne Me Quitte Pas" and "Hujan." I just downloaded the song, beautiful. <br /> <br /> And we greet Yasmin, the final credit of the film moves me again. he really appreciated his parents in a unique way. <br /> <br /> I think the film deserves the Grand Jury Prize at the Berlin Film Festival. <br /> <br /> I give 8.5 of 1o stars
