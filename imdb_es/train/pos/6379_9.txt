The movie "Atlantis: The Lost Empire" is a brilliant jewel among the rubble of the films produced by Disney Studios recently. Parents who have had to sit in "The Jungle Book 2" or even in a Pokemon movie will surely appreciate this one. <br /> <br /> The movie is one of the few that tries an original story; The previous feature films were simply stories of existing stories. Movies like "Toy Story", "Finding Nemo" and "Monsters Inc." all do the same, but it must be borne in mind that all were created by Pixar and only distributed by Disney. The recent films of the Disney studios are published mainly in video, and are the sequels of an existing successful film. The quality of those films is assigned to profitability. A new era began with "Atlantis", then "Mulan", "Lilo & Stitch" and, more recently, "Open Range". The writers have created all the original stories instead of the fairy tales of the past. <br /> <br /> A good part of the film is dedicated to the search for Atlantis, a task that has captured the imagination of many for hundreds of years. Including the young Milo Thatch, with the voice of Michael J. Fox. Milo is a museum employee in Washington D.C. His grandfather was a renowned archaeologist, who had dedicated his life to discovering Atlantis. This was seen as a waste by his peers, and they want Milo not to follow in his footsteps. After failing to convince the museum's board of directors to sponsor his expedition, Milo returns home and finds a woman in his dark apartment. She takes it to her employer, Mr. Whitmore. Whitmore was a close friend of Milo's grandfather, and wants to send Milo with a team to locate Atlantis. Mr. Whitmore is very rich and has paid for the best of everything. The crew that will accompany him is the same as his grandfather. The trip is full of many obstacles to overcome and it is very fun to watch. The spectator is caught in if they reach Atlantis. The plot takes an unexpected turn after the discovery of Atlantis, not just the discovery of people. It is enough to maintain the interest of the largest audience. <br /> <br /> The animators have done a wonderful job in the depth of the animation. The film is very successful in combining traditional animation with computer-generated images. A feat that is not easily achieved, most audiences quickly realize the difference in the two. The characters are credibly human. There are some nice chase type scenes, with a lot of action going on. Some moments of calm are full of jokes that children may not understand. <br /> <br /> Writers' creativity really shines. The culture of Atlantis is highly developed, including a complete language. The film uses references to Atlantis from historical sources, such as Plato. The disappearance of Atlantis from the world is explained. Credible, even for a younger audience, that magic really exists. The powers of the people of Atlantis do not present themselves exactly as magic, but they can best be described in this way. <br /> <br /> Although established in 1914, the level of technology used is not realistic. The trip takes place in a submarine reminiscent of Captain Nemo's nautilus, complete with sub pods that fire torpedoes. The giant excavators are driven by steam boilers, so they tried some technology of the era. The female characters are empowered in a way that women of the age would not have been, even having roles in leadership. This is not a bad thing. It is a good example for my daughter, instead of a male cast. <br /> <br /> One of the reasons why this movie is one of my favorites over other Disney films is that there is not a single song, always. A tradition that began with the first feature film, "Snow White", and continued until "The Lion King", almost all Disney films are full of optimistic songs. This is great and all, what would the Seven Dwarfs be without "Hi, HO!"? After the millionth time, it would almost be better without him, but this one forgives the father. Not once every person on the screen suddenly knows the words of a song that nobody has heard before and breaks into a song. For my part, I am grateful. <br /> <br /> The plot and depth of the animation will surely keep the attention of both parents and children. It is a film that I am willing to see again and again with my children.
