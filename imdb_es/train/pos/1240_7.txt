Eddie Murphy plays Chandler Jarrell, a man who spends his time finding lost children. When the beautiful Kee Nang (Charlotte Lewis) enters his life, she tells him that he is the chosen one and that he must find the Golden Child. Skeptical and driven purely by lust and intrigue, Jarrell becomes involved without realizing that he is about to embark on a fantastic journey, one that involves danger and worst of all, the demon Sardo Numspa. <br /> <br /> Is the golden child a product of his time?, by which I mean, was Eddie Murphy and the popularity of The Golden Child exclusive to the audiences of the late 1980s? Because I can vividly remember how much this film entertained people in that decade, its box office cost $ 79,817,937, which made it the eighth largest source of income in 1986, but since the 1980s it disappeared from memory, has become the only thing to deny Eddie Murphy. Comedy comedies that actually once had. The Golden Child does not agree with the most accepted photos of Murphy's 80s, such as Trading Places and Beverly Hills Cop, but by revisiting the film recently, I personally find that it contains Murphy in his thunder, jokes and the best charm . Seriously! > <br /> Taking advantage of a fantasy action formula that was revitalized and stimulated by Raiders Of The Lost Ark in 1981, The Golden Child presses all the required genre buttons. Pretty girl, bold and reticent hero with a joke in his armory, villain gallardo (Charles Dance, so English, I could kiss him myself), a wonderful color and a cute child with mystical powers. The movie only asks you to get involved in the fun. , not to dissect and unravel its value as a cranial fantasy image. Yes, the CGI demon looks squeaky now, and yes, the genre had much better photos in the 80s, 90s and more, but really if you agree with the shameful rating of 5 here on this site, then you may be taking this genre a bit too much. serious, serious 7/10
