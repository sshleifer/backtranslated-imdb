['No, not really, but this is a very good movie, and unfortunately it is a forgotten gem. Black and white adapts to the movie. <br /><br /> Direct formula, a man had the plague and the authorities have to track down all the people with whom he had contact before dying. <br /><br /> Very well directed, and the acting is great. Richard Widmark as a male leader is good, but he is completely outdone in Paul Douglas&#39;s acting stakes as the police captain, and Jack Palance (never better than this) and Zero Mostel as the bad guys. Unfortunately, Palance went on to play similar characters in some second-rate gangster or war movies.']
