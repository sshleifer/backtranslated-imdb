When I heard for the first time that Hal Hartley was doing a sequel to Henry Fool, I was excited (it has been my favorite for years), and then I distrusted when I heard it had something to do with terrorism. However, after having seen it, I was surprised to find out that it worked, although it was still a completely different movie from Henry Fool's. Both the writing and the direction were correct and the performance was magnificent ... special congratulations to Hartley for reassembling practically all the cast, even Henry's son, who only had four in the original. However, as I said, this movie is quite different from the first, but it works: I reconciled with the change of tone and the theme by the fact that 10 years have passed and the characters would have found themselves in very different situations since the first movie ended. In this case, an unexpected adventure occurs ... and that is all I will give ... not to mention the fact that I will have to see it again to really understand what is happening and who is crossing to whom. While it was undoubtedly one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, it suffers many sequels with its ending, as it seems that Hartley is planning a third and the movie leaves you hanging. I will make sure to buy my tickets for part 3 ('Henry Grim'?) In 2017.
