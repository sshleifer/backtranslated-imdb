Ettore Scola is one of the most important Italian directors. My parents and I saw together "C'eravamo tanto amati" on a summer night: we liked it, but we did not love it as we love "A special day". I think Ettore Scola is quite underestimated: we often forget to remember him, maybe because his latest films were disappointing. And so, last night, my mother and I sat on our sofa to enjoy this masterpiece. The writing, the direction, the cinematography, the score and the production design were sober and precise, but what I liked the most was the chemistry between Loren and Mastroianni. Both are excellent actors and play the main roles of Antonietta and Gabriele. Antonietta is a housewife: she is married to a fascist fanatic, has six children, but her husband wants to have another child to get a prize for the huge families. Gabriele is simply an antifascist. They spent a special day together, that special day of 1938 when Hitler came to Rome to visit Mussolini. I do not want to spoil the plot anymore: go find this movie!
