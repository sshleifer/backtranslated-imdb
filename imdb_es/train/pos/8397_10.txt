This movie won each of the ten votes I gave him! Thanks guys for making a movie that is worth seeing. He showed the world, can still write, direct, produce and star in a black film without negative stereotypes. The poetry was also incredible, congratulations to the poets and musicians. <br /> <br /> I saw it last night, as I fell in love with my love again and again. I will add it to my movie collection today and recommend it to my friends and family. <br /> <br /> Please continue to produce quality, do not worry about the amount ... <br /> Thanks again, and best wishes and blessings to you!
