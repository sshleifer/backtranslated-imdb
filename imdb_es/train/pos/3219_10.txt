It's a good movie. It has a captivating story, an impressive main character, very good acting and murderous action. This occurs mainly in the year 2036, but shows scenes that took place in past years to explain the story. <br /> <br /> The story is very well done and there are no holes. Kurt Russell is a soldier named Todd who is trained from birth to death and, like all other soldiers, has never had a normal life. Finally, the army introduces newer, younger, faster and stronger soldiers. Jason Scott Lee is one of them. As a result, they have no need of old soldiers like Todd. They test the new soldiers by making them fight against some of the old soldiers, in the battle, Russell is wounded and is supposed to be dead. The military leave their bodies and others less assume that all are dead, but what they do not realize is that Russell is alive. <br /> <br /> Todd finds a camp full of civilization on this planet that the military left him in. For a while he lives there but can not adapt to normal life. Rarely does he say a word and, sometimes, he is very aggressive with other people. When they feel that he is a danger to them, they send him to the desert. <br /> <br /> Just when Russell is leaving the planet, he is attacked by the new soldiers. What the military forgot was to train the soldiers to be smart like Todd and the other old soldiers. So while these new soldiers are faster and stronger than Todd, Todd easily overcomes them. The military begins to realize this and Todd kills all his men except one. That's Jason Scott Lee and at the end you see a classic fight scene between Russell and Scott Lee. Russell, obviously, is at the top. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best action movies I've seen and I've seen a lot. This has everything you could ask for in a movie, including some great lines. The writer also did not forget that Russell had never seen a woman before, since he calls the women "sir". There are no holes in this movie, every minute has a purpose and is very entertaining. <br /> <br /> An amazing one-man army action movie for fans of Rambo, Commando and Missing In Action. This is highly recommended for all Kurt Russell fans and action / science fiction fans.
