This is by far one of the best made movies and it did not disappoint me at all. The sound track along with the work of the camera in hand finely filmed was exquisite. There are always possibilities that a film does not hold its beliefs as well as others, but I felt that the rhythm of this image and the moment was excellent. Dakota Fanning is fast becoming a staple of the movie that requires a child with an old soul personality and has never let me down with her talent. As for Mr. Washington and, of course, Christopher Walken, both overcome the challenge of showing the darker sides of humanity trying to move towards the light.
