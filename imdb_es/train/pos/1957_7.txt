Yes, I'll say it before I start commenting, this movie is incredibly underestimated. <br /> <br /> Sharon Stone is excellent in her role as Catherine Trammell, as is Morrissey as Dr Glass. He is an analyst sent to evaluate her after the death of a sports star. Glass is attracted by a seductive game that Trammel uses to manipulate his mind. <br /> <br /> The acting was good (apart from Thewlis) <br /> <br /> Stone really has a talent with this role. She is cunning, mischievous and seductive and does not seem a day older than in the first. It really impressed me (like in Casino). Morrisey was good too. He showed a lot of vunerablitity in a role that needed it. Thewlis however was lame. He ruined his character and was exaggerated all the way. It really stunk. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie is not as good as the first one, but Stone is a pleasure to watch it. Only ignores Thewlis.
