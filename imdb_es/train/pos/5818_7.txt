Actually, this film has fun moments, both in the part of the legend and in the part of Joe Pesci and the children, and it is much worse than other MJ movies like "The Wiz", "Captain Eo" and "Ghosts" . But as a Michael Jackson fan for almost eleven years (Yes, that's half my life, guys!), I can not complain too much. Just seeing this charming guy and listening to his wonderful music is a trip to heaven for me. But as a movie, it's not good, and I'm afraid, I'd get a much lower rating for me, if my dear Mike had not been the protagonist. But since nobody else than Mike is the moonwalker, he has to get 7 out of 10 of me.
