FLAVIA THE HERETIC is a strange entry in the genre nunsploit: equal parts, feminist journey and "history" while we follow Flavia on her strange journey. <br /> <br /> We start with Flavia in a convent. She is not very happy there because she does not believe in all the "rules" dominated by men and in the machismo of the world that surrounds her and escapes from the convent with her Jewish friend, Abraham. Both are trapped and Flavia is returned to the convent where she joins another "non-believing" nun to accelerate a Muslim invasion. Flavia joins with the Muslims who take the convent and "occupy" with the nuns in a strange set of scenes. Finally, the deployment of the Muslims and Flavia is punished as a traitor of Christianity in another singularly brutal scene ... <br /> <br /> This has almost all the things that I like to see in a movie of the 70s - some good blood, including the removal of the nipple, and a good skin scene that is covered with the legs, some decent nudity - including the full frontal requirement, and also a decent story. I'll say he crawled in some places, but not enough to really get bored. I would definitely recommend this to the exploits fans of nunsploit / 70 ... 8/10
