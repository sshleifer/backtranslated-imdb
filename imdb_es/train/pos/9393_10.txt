Some movies that you know you're going to love from the first seconds. This is one of those movies. Tracing its roots back to "Double Indemnity" and "The Postman Always Rings Twice" in the 40s: this was a great example of Modern Film Noir in the 90's. Nick Cage plays the main character "with bad luck" who becomes entangled in a husband and wife murder plot, and his luck goes from bad to worse as he tries and tries to get away from the people, the city, the violence and The threat of Red Rock West. Many twists and turns, excellent performances by Cage, Hopper and Walsh, a hypnotic musical background of sliding guitar and a perfect direction make this a real pleasure. Favorite line: When Cage looks at the empty gas gauge in the car that is pulling away, he shakes his head and says: "F *** in 'story of my life."
