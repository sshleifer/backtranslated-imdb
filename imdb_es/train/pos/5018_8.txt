If you are like me, then you will love this great teen movie of coming of age. I think it's on the list of pranks / love book / high school in EE. UU / scream / calendar / crybaby / all the great films that are developed in the 50s and early 60s and has a wonderful soundtrack. There are not as many songs as in some of these types of movies, but it's still great. Sometimes it is very fun and has a great love interest. All the young people are great. They were more kind of these wonderful movies. My favorite movie of all time has gone back to the future when Marty Mcfly Gos returned to 1955 and in these wonderful films he remains in the fabulous 50 (early 60's) there are some films of this type better than this but not many
