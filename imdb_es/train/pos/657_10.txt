The Maman et la Putain must be seen as a film that is related to the time it was released (post-68) and eternal in many aspects. It's true that the actors do not "act" ... It's true, they talk a lot ... But what they talk about is what makes it worth living ... or dying. The long monologue spoken by Françoise Lebrun is perhaps the most precise and moving text that has been written about femininity, masculinity and love. Although it is not easy to translate accurately. This movie is a statement about the difficulty of being a man and a woman (or two women in this case). And in my humble opinion, Jean Pierre Léaud is one of the best French actors.
