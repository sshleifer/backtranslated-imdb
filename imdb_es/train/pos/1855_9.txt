Not having seen all the movies released in 2002, I can not say that this is the best movie of the year. I can say it's the best movie I've seen all year. <br /> <br /> Most American films that show black people are obsessed with American concerns about "race relations", or fall into clich√©s in the downtown ghetto, with all imaginable stereotypes emitting a lingo with phrases of ebony. Antwone Fisher is proud to be alone in this regard: race is irrelevant, except for a fight that may or may not have been provoked by a racial insult. <br /> <br /> The story of Antwone Fisher is one that should find resonance in Any empathetic individual. He is underestimated, and thoughtfully, portrayed by Derek Luke. Denzel Washington, although obviously using his star power to make the film, remains in the background for the most part, and allows the film to be the story of Antwone Fisher. <br /> <br /> At a time when BET, and popular culture in general, want to keep the ghetoization of a large number of Americans (and Canadians too, you know), this is a film that talks about humanity in general. of us. I only hope that the non-black audience will see this film for that humanity, instead of avoiding it because they feel that there are no characters or actors in the film with whom they can identify. That would be a sad commentary on race relations in North America itself. <br /> <br />
