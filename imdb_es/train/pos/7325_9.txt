The Halloween of John Carpenter is frankly a masterpiece of terror. Tells the immortal story of the escaped mental patient Michael Myers, who returns to his hometown on Halloween night to stalk and kill a group of nannies. <br /> <br /> This was the first and undoubtedly the best in the Halloween franchise. . Carpenter shows great moderation in the rhythm of the story very slowly and building nice characters; unusual for a horror image. <br /> <br /> Even more unusual is the non-existence of blood and blood, and yet it remains the scariest Halloween to date. Get that! <br /> <br /> Halloween marked the film debut of Jamie Lee Curtis and a defining moment in the career of the late great Donald Pleasance. A true classic.
