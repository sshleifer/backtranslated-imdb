Delirious, almost without plot, and if it is more inspired by LSD than the Devil, we must remember when it was done! After a surprising opening of SM (which even in itself is not what it seems) we move to a soft focus and dream or imagine or remember ??. Many literary and cinematographic references, and in fact this is Franco's film that Lang himself praised. Beautiful and fascinating, the film develops at a leisurely pace but has a richness within each fold. A rare movie to languish inside. Jess could do them when he tried. Fine central performances too, including the indomitable Jack Taylor and Howard Vernon. I have not even mentioned the locations of Lisbon - ah!
