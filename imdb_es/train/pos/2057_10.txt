There was not a day in 2002 when I was not being chased by a scarecrow. I felt that this movie handled a serious problem well. <br /> <br /> It brought back many memories, as it was very realistic. <Br /> <br /> Even today I have nightmares about corn on the cob, and I can not even get close to canned things for fear of my life <br /> <br /> However, I must admit that, in a given time, The movie I had to turn off because it hit too close to home <br /> <br /> For those of you who have never been attacked by a scarecrow, by watching this movie you could receive information on how you felt with us . victims <br /> <br /> This movie teaches us not to take life for granted or to play with corn, believe me, I've been there and I have scars <br /> <br /> Watch the movie, it's amazing and educational
