I'm not going to lie, this is a great movie. I saw it about 4 months ago at my local theater. I saw it a second time, and I was a little bored in the slow scenes. Sid (the lazy one) is not so flattering, but Diego (a mountain lion, I think) is really good at the movie. The animation is outstanding, and the story has a touching ending. It is worth taking children under 10, but teens may find it a bit boring. In addition, the uniqueness of the characters is very interesting. Like I said, it's a pretty good movie, but I would rate "Toy Story 2" or "Shrek" higher. 8/10
