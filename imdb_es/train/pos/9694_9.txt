I was fascinated by this moving and hilarious movie, not to mention the surprise. I was also surprised to discover that Paulie's voice was played by Jay Mohr. The performance was so subtly nuanced that he did not become a braggart or become too harsh under the arrogance of New Jersey, which I thought must be an unrecognized old professional, not Mr. Mohr, who had a baby face. A very impressive performance, in fact, and it is gratifying to see that his talents are taken seriously in a series of extravagant and independent films.
