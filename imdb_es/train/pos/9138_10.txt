I own this movie and have seen it several times over the years since it was released. Prince does not surprise us with his phenomenal acting style or anything, he's a musician and I think that's what he shows here, he's the best at telling this story through influence. Most of this film is direct and young, but that's the fault of the directors / writers, even so it's a great movie with even better music. The principles and moral convictions in Purple Rain are quite strong and if more films were based on the basic concepts that teach us as young children, we will have a better overall environment since art reflects the life that art reflects.
