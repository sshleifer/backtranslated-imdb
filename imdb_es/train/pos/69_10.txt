One night I woke up late to watch the cable channels and I found this movie about 10 minutes before I started. Every time I thought about going to bed, something kept telling me to keep seeing it even though it was far from my bedtime. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been another easy anti-cannon movie, but instead they chose to examine the side effects of the shooting. And even better, the movie continues with real life: just when you think they are going to take the easy and obviously devised path, a turnaround appears that changes the general perspective of the film. This film not only does not follow the formula, but also shows how other events often lead and / or affect what happens next. <br /> <br /> I just wish that the filmmakers have explored the problems related to antidepressant medications. more: the Columnbine children who did the shootings were with them for years and it was terrifying to see the way Deanna attacked them every time the nightmares started. Until recently, they were distributing things like candy and only now begin to understand what long-term effects the medications have. It was very refreshing to see that the mental illness aspect of the story was quite filmed, having a family member who suffers from a mental illness, I can say that the film was completely crazy in all aspects of mental illness. Bravo to the director and writer who obviously did his homework on those subjects. And for those who think that certain things could not happen in a hospital (I do not want to tell any data), they are also wrong, I have been there. The script was so real that it was amazing. <br /> <br /> GO TO BUY this movie and show it to your teenagers before it's too late. Someday they will thank you.
