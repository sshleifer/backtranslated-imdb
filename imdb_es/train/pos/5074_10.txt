Originally conceived as a solo vehicle for Dudley Moore, 'Not only ... but also' saw his former collaborator Peter Cook, 'Beyond The Fringe', guest on the first show, and so well received was the driver of the BBC-2 insisted that he be in it every week thereafter. They were a classic comedy team: Cook was tall, handsome and witty, while Dudley was short, charismatic and with musical talent. The sketch that knocked down the house had them in a pub, wearing flat caps and mufflers, fantasizing about movie stars like Jane Russell and Greta Garbo. It's still one of the most hilarious parodies of all time, and even when Cook is a corpse, he's still very close. <br /> <br /> Those characters, Pete idiot and Dud even bigger, found their way into every episode of the show itself, seen in a different environment, like a zoo or an art gallery. In the latter, they ate sandwiches while discussing works of art. "That caricature of Leonardo DaVinci ... I do not see the joke!" Says Dud. Pete points out that when he first became known, he probably had people in shape. Dud almost choked on his food. "You're really enjoying those sandwiches!", Ad libs Cook. The couple bounced their humor in a way that was happy to contemplate. The sketches set new standards for comedy, standards that would not be matched until the arrival of 'Monty Python'. <br /> <br /> As the popularity of the program increased, so did the quality of the guest stars. Peter Sellers, for example, and John Lennon, the latter presenting an article filmed based on his poem "Deaf Ted, Danoota, & Me". 'One Leg Too Few' - had Dud as 'George Spigott' (a name that was later reused in the movie 'Bedazzled'), a man with one leg, who heads to the office of film producer Cook for a audition for the role of 'Tarzan'. Cook tries to disappoint him as best he can. "I have nothing against your right leg!" He says. "The problem is that neither do you!" <br /> <br /> Dud would occasionally interview the eccentric Sir Arthur Streeb-Greebling (Cook), who when he was not teaching the crows to fly underwater, was planning to open. a restaurant called 'The Frog & The Peach'. Another classic was 'The Leaping Nuns' (also reused in 'Bedazzled'). But my favorite of all time has to be 'Superthunderstingcar', a perversely funny (and accurate) parody of 'Thunderbirds' by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson. Pete and Dud played all the roles, and the latter performed a "Lady Penelope". 'Ludwig' had Ludwig Van Beethoven as the star of a style variety show 'This Is Tom Jones'. 'The Immortal Bargo' was a fake documentary about the life of the lonely film star 'Emma Bargo'. In an unforgettable moment, he drove through London, shouting through a loudspeaker: "I want to be alone!" <br /> <br /> One feature of Season 3 was 'Poets Cornered' with characters like Ronnie Barker, Spike Milligan, Barry Humphries, Willie Rushton and others suspended over a gunge tank. Each of them had to improvise the line of a poem, and anyone who could not make it rhyme turned into something bad. <br /> <br /> Three seasons were produced in total, produced (at different times) by Joe McGrath, Dick Clement and Jimmy Gilbert. Unfortunately, very few editions survive. To make matters worse, the scripts were also destroyed. It is believed that this situation was allowed to happen. <br /> <br /> The program ended in 1970. Then, the comics reached Broadway and created the infamous 'Derek & Clive' films, but Cook's growing alcoholism separated them. . Eight years later, Cook announced that a new series was in sight, but it turned out to be an illusion on his part. His former partner was making films in the United States and had no intention of working with Cook again (at least at that time). <br /> <br /> Enough recordings were collected for a BBC-2 replay season in the early 90's. As expected, some items had not stayed as well as others. Cook died in 1995 and, as a tribute, B.B.C organized a program compiled from several "Parkinson" interviews and "Not only ... but also" programs. It ended pretty well with Pete and Dud meeting in heaven. "Bloody hell!" Exclaimed the latter. Moore died in 2002.
