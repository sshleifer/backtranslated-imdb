Well, Tenko is undoubtedly the best British television program, the performances, the direction, the casting, the suspense, the drama ... everything is fantastic about it. <br /> <br /> Although the program fell A little later in its final season, this final film picked up the threads very well and produced an excellent story for the show fans and the newbies. I can not recommend this movie anymore, find it and see it. But I do advise to watch the series first, since the first 2 seasons are even better than this fantastic movie. <br /> <br /> An obvious (10/10)
