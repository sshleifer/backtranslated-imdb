I did not know what to do except, so I think it was much better not to have excepted much. Do not get me wrong, it's not a bad short film. Tess Nanavati is a relatively new director and writer, so I think she deserves a lot of congratulations for making this movie. It can be said that it has been an act of love for her. The performance (outside Dominic) is a little cheesy and the quality of the film is not excellent either, but for a low budget movie it is good. There were times when the story line twists and there are parts that go on, although I do not think that this detracts from the ability of the person to understand the film. If you love Dominic Monaghan as much as I do, I tell you to do it. The joke was fun, I will not spoil it, but there is one particular scene that makes it worth buying the DVD so you can watch it over and over again. If you like the movie, check out The Pink Mirror, a movie also made by Jagged Edge. I know that Dominic fans will enjoy this little piece of heaven.
