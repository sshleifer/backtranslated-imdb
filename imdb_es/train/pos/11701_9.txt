This is a great movie for all Generation X'ers. What a different world compared the America of 1972 with our psychotic Siglo XXI. You can have an idea of ​​how an America of 1972 was, watching this movie. I discovered that clothing and car styles brought back fond memories of a much better country than we have now. Just think ... back then there were only 4 or 5 TV stations to choose from. There was no AIDS, Muslim terrorists, road rage, 911, bird flu, highway snipers, etc. The Vietnam War had just ended. There will still be 7 years before Star Wars comes out. The personal computer and the Internet would still be 29 years away. <br /> <br /> When this film first came out, the producers had to market the film themselves, since no other film company wanted it. So he started touring small Protestant churches across the country that showed up in movie projectors (this was the days before VCRS, of course). The pastor of a church that would be interested in showing a thief in the night to his congregation would get a copy of the film. Then he organized an evening to show it in the meeting area of ​​the church or in the dining room. Members of the congregation would invite "unsaved" friends and family and it would be a social event of the week. <br /> <br /> If you can overcome the limited production values ​​of the film and simply see it for its nostalgic value, then I think you'll enjoy the movie more. Of course I'm talking like a xer gene. <br /> <br /> If I had a time machine, I would go back to 1972 and I would be fired from the 21st century well that we have now.
