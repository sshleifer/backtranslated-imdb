Romantic comedies can go either way, you know? You will see one that is really boring, and you will think that you want something more realistic. Then, you will see one that is realistic, but could be too boring to keep you interested. Or maybe you see one that does everything right, but that does not make you smile. Romantic comedies are difficult movies. Enter them with many expectations and, in general, if you like it, it is simply a matter of whether the films anticipated your expectations or those of the boy or girl next to you. <br /> <br /> Of course If you have a girl by your side and you're a guy like me, it probably does not matter much if the movie is good, you have other things in mind. For you, I say, "Go for her, Tigre!" For the rest of us, I say: "Look _A Guy Thing_". It is fun. <br /> <br /> Because _A Guy Thing_ knows that you're going to this movie with expectations, so he does not pretend that "Guy about to get married meets the woman of his dreams, and is not his wife!" The plot will make everyone happy. Sure, maybe you like it, but it may not seem true, or you think it's cruel. _A Guy Thing_ covers that. What _A Guy Thing_ does is fill the screen with the best support distribution I've seen in a long time, so if it's not the main plot, you still have something to make you smile. <br /> <br /> Whether we're talking about experienced veterans of the big and small screen, like Larry Miller (Pretty Woman, Best in Show), James Brolin (Traffic), Julie Hagerty (Airplane!), David Koechner (Saturday Night Live and Conan O'Brien regular, Dirty work, Austin Powers II) or Thomas Lennon (The State and Viva Variety), or new faces like Shawn Hatosy (The Faculty), or Colin Foo (Saving Silverman), we are talking from a lot of very talented and skilled actors who know exactly how to take advantage of the inspired characterization of the film, steal the show, again and again, and still frame the piece with an energy and a joy that are rarely seen in romantic comedies in this days. <br /> And that is not to detract from the romantic line and the stars that carry it, because it is very sweet and terrib. Very well done. Jason Lee (Mallrats, Amy Chasing, Dogma, etc.) is poignant as the young professional whose life may be out of control, and Selma Blair shows a brilliant sobriety in portraying the aspiring socialite and sophisticated career woman with whom everything Man wants to get married, except for the guy he really is. <br /> <br /> Much of the success of the film, however, falls on Julia Stiles, the right girl in the right place at the wrong time, and she gets along well. Not since then, I do not know when, I've seen an actress in a romantic comedy that has made falling in love with her so easy. Of course, everything is in the foreground, the voice and the subtle smiles, but it's magical, and it's one of the big reasons why we go to the movies in the first place. <br /> <br /> But Julie Stiles would miss an unconventional sophistication if it were not for the fact that the rest of the cast is incredibly in its classic simplicity. This is a movie that paints a broken world of irreconcilable types of actions, makes them fall on each other to make you laugh, and then comes with a lot of heart. <br /> <br /> A Guy Thing is a movie You've definitely seen it before, and the filmmakers knew it clearly when they prepared to do it. We have not seen new romantic comedies since Shakespeare; The relative success of this or that depends entirely on the execution of the classic story of boy with girl. Guy Thing accepts that with a bit of metacematic advantage, often taking the scenes to absurdity to give the audience the opportunity to recognize the powerful emotions and the old plot devices at play. <br /> <br /> For The Record, she even manages to poke fun at the rather traditional structural notions of sex and gender that form the center of every romantic comedy, so that even local feminists could be pulled out of quicio <br /> <br /> And guys, I think we can all agree that we want our friends to be as cool as Jason Lee's friends in this movie. I'm not going to spoil it for you, but when you try to explain to your girlfriend why the pharmacist and the employee of the clothing store are among the coolest types of movies, I suggest you say "It's a boy thing" and leave . in that
