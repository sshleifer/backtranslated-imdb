This is the only movie to see if he is getting married or if he is a married couple. The film portrays a couple in Italy and deals with difficult issues such as abortion, infidelity, juggling and family. <br /> <br /> The so-called "culture of death" that we are experiencing today in the world is terrible and This movie will surely make you think. <br /> <br /> A must see. I hope it is distributed as it should be. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to the cast and the director. <br /> <br /> Two thumbs up and a 10 star rating from me!
