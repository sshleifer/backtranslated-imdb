I remember seeing this movie when it first came out in 1982 and I loved it. Approximately 4 years later, I had the privilege of seeing Luciano Pavarotti sing at the Metropolitan Opera in New York (in Tosca), so watching the end of this film reminds me of that great night. What do I not like about this movie? The music is brilliant and Pavarotti (Fini) was at his best and he still looked great. The story is actually very funny in parts and the "food fight" scene is still one of the most fun I've seen in my life. The balloon flight over the Napa Valley was beautiful, as was the song he sang "If we were in love" (one of the few times that Pavarotti sang in English). And when hearing the duet of santa lucia beautiful. Get real friends, this was a film about an opera singer named Georgio Fini, who has just been played by Pavarotti. Kathryn Harrold and Eddie Albert were excellent in their supporting roles. <br /> <br /> I'm VERY happy that I still have this almost-worn VHS tape from this movie, but I would love it to be released on DVD, especially now that Pavarotti is no longer with us because I think this includes the best performance of Nessun Dorma sung by him, still in the movie today!
