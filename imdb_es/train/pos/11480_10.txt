Attacking the persecution: this is one of the most surprising and intense movies I've seen in a long time. The first movie in years that left me absolutely amazed. I could hardly leave the theater, I was so overwhelmed. <br /> <br /> I've been looking at the screen for about fifteen minutes trying to find a way to describe the power of this movie, and just failing Highlighting any aspect of it: the documentary-style video journal format, the unbreakable image of the events, the strength of the characters, just seems to trivialize everything. Some may find it ridiculous that any murderer can be characterized as normal. But then not all murderers are furious lunatics in the mouth. Many are fairly regular people, unpretentious. They are simply wired differently. <br /> <br /> And that is perhaps the most chilling thought of all.
