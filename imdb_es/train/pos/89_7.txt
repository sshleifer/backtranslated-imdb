To be honest, I had no idea what this movie was about when I started it. This is how I watch movies when possible. Without preconception. I thought this was going to be a movie about rocks in the woods or something like that. I was wrong, a little. <br /> <br /> At first, the load was somewhat boring, but once it started to get going, it really got me hooked. I know the feeling of being absorbed by something dangerous where you feel helpless, but to do things you do not want to do. <br /> <br /> Another user commented that this movie was silly and implausible, but I allow myself to disagree. . This kind of thing happens. I'm sorry, but not all live in a dream world in which nothing bad can happen and crazy situations are "implausible." I am very sorry, but the reality of the WORLD is that they do happen. Both the creator of this film and the actors did a great job of portraying how things can go wrong and how people can make really bad decisions. Sometimes things go well, sometimes they go wrong and that's the way life is. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie.
