Wow, this was a movie that captivated me completely. I could not believe I started waking up so late to see her, but she was late. I started to see that I could not stop. He had a full range of very good cast members, including Eartha Kitt and Ruby Dee Forrest Whittaker and James Earl Jones and many other well-known actors and actresses. This was more than a look at the story, it was a revelation in another part of society that people do not know and may even be ashamed to speak. I have never heard of a book or movie about this before and this is something that black history never addresses, just look down because they were privileged and mestizos, I recommend this film
