This movie was amazing, it's the kind of movie you watch and, instead of watching other movies by actor, you see other movies by director / writer. Sandler did a good job working a character out of his comfort zone and the always good Cheadle also did a great job. This movie is ideal for a mature intelligent audience. The acting was fantastic and can only be overcome by the writing and direction of the film. This film focuses on real Americans, the previous generation, without stereotypes or racism, only people who have come together and realized the true meaning of life. This film is about loss and coping. Instead of choosing Psychiatry, you define it, not as someone who heals you magically, but because of the need to express your feelings to someone impartial whom you can trust, will not judge you, but will guide you through your thoughts. This movie is amazing!
