['People are being very hard on the movie. Sometimes we should just sit back and enjoy the story without trying to &quot;check&quot; it. <br /><br /> All this happens when Hackman decides not to pull the trigger, but his goal continues to fall. Then the fun begins when everyone around him also &quot;goes down&quot;. <br /><br /> Just think about JFK and all the people related in some way to his murder, who ended their lives abruptly and questionably and will appreciate what this film implies. <br /><br /> I think it&#39;s an excellent interpretation of what may well have happened. Although the EXACT storyline has not been followed (in retrospect here after reading Jim Maars &quot;Crossfire&quot;), it is what is implicit that is of interest. <br /><br /> I would love to get a copy to see it again. In light of what is known today, the Domino Principle is right.']
