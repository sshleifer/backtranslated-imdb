I really love this show! I've always liked the 1990 Space Ghost shows! This program was hilarious and I can not believe why Cartoon Network's Adult Swim would take a fun program like this one. I hope they put this show on DVD or something. The program is about Brak (from the cartoons of Space Ghost, SGCC and Cartoon Planet) who lives his daily life with his mom and dad and his best friend who likes to go a lot, Zorak. My favorite episodes were in which Zorak gets this really good singer voice and then his voice does not give him any money that Zorak has made singing. Another episode that I like is one in which Brak and Zorak did not finish their homework and then return from Sunday to Friday and simply leave and then return the day the task was invented and then, when they return to the current task It existed! Another episode I like is one in which Brak's father and his next-door neighbor, Thundercleese the Robot, continue to get into this instrument and then eat a giant worm. Another episode that I liked was that Zorak makes a bully fight and then a new guy took over his position. I also like many other episodes! One thing that never fails to make me laugh is when Zorak is being beaten, ruined and beaten!
