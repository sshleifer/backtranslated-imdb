This is a very beautiful movie. Color photography is beautiful, as it shows the splendor of the Metropolitan Opera House in bright colors. Other interior scenes in several mansions, etc. They are equally bright. As for music, what else can be said other than that Lanza's voice was at its height when he sang many of the most well-known and loved arias in the world? The wonderful Dorothy Kirsten is also a joy, since her soprano voice mixes with that of Lanza in a charming harmony. Of course, Hollywood took its usual liberties with Caruso's life story. There is very little in the story line that relates to real events. For example, the facts related to his death are totally invented and have no relation to the truth. There are some very good websites that tell the true story of Caruso and contain several pictures of him. These websites can be located by using any good search engine. There are also several books available about your life story. But, the story line of fiction does nothing to spoil this beautiful film. The voices of Lanza, Kirsten and the members of the choir are the true stars of this film. Enjoy, I know I sure did.
