I just watched this version of the Frank Loesser's Guys and Dolls movie for the third time with my mother who had never seen this before. She was pleasantly surprised by the singing voices of Jean Simmons and Marlon Brando. And she thought that the sequences of Havana where Simmons and Brando dance during a storm were excellent. Those also impressed me a lot and, in general, they were the highlights of the movie. Directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, this film that originated as a Damon Runyon story takes a while with the slow pace of non-musical scenes at first, but it attracts you after a while. The other story with Frank Sinatra and Vivian Blaine was not that convincing to me, but still had its charms, especially during the "Sue Me" number. He also loved the number of "Sit Down, You're Rocking the Boat" by Stubby Kaye and the performances of Sheldon Leonard and B. S. Pully. With a theatrical look, Guys and Dolls is not a great musical movie, but certainly a very good one.
