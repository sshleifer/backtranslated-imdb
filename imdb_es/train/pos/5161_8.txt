Kirk and his crew land on a solitary planet where the sun is about to explode. They intend to evacuate the inhabitants, but find the place deserted, except Mr. Atoz, who operates a kind of high-tech library. Despite trying to get a direct answer from him about the whereabouts of all, Atoz is indifferent to their questions and insists that they must "make a selection quickly while there is still time." They have no idea what they are talking about, but they wander to look at the mirrored discs in the spectators and see images of the planet's past. Then, while there is a disk in the viewfinder, Kirk goes through the door and is transported magically in time to what on Earth would look like the time of Louis XIV (the 1660s). When McCoy and Spock follow, there is a different disk in the viewer and they are sent to an ice age hell. Too late, they realize that the library is a time travel machine and a repository. <br /> <br /> While Kirk's visit is quite short and not so exciting, Spock and McCoy's are much more agitated, as Spock falls head over heels. for Mariette Hartley, who was sent to this horrible place as punishment. The scenes with Spock are exceptionally interesting and very atypical for the normally logical type. <br /> <br /> The departure of Spock from the norm, the inventive script and the very different scenarios make this an exceptional episode, which is worth seeing. <br /> <br /> FYI - Ian Wolfe, the excellent character actor, played Mr. Atoz. I am a big fan of old movies and I have seen him as a bit player and support in countless films in the 30s and 40s and he looked almost exactly like in this episode of 1969. Interestingly, despite appearing old, he lived! Another 23 years - dying to more than 95 years of age!
