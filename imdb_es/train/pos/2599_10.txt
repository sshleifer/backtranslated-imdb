After having enjoyed Joyce's complex novel, I prepared to be disappointed with the script by Joseph Strick and Fred Haines, given the complexity of the original text. However, the film was very well made and a good translation of the tone, naturalism and lightness of the book. <br /> <br /> It is certainly useful to have read the original text before watching the movie. I imagine that the latter would seem disjointed, with very strange episodes apparently mixed randomly, without a previous reading of the text to help understand the plot. <br /> <br /> It is surprising to see how "dirty" the film is, given that it was filmed in Dublin in 1967. The Irish film only censorship finally banned its viewing by the general public in Ireland until the year 2000 (It was shown to restricted audiences in a private film club, the Irish Film Theater, late seventies). Joyce's eroticism is not simply naturalistic and aggressive, but offers many tremendously "perverse" episodes. It does not matter that many of these fetishes were unacceptable when the book was published in 1922, they were still completely taboo when the movie was made in 1967. <br /> <br /> It is amazing and encouraging to see the cream of the Irish profession of In the 1960s, all respected players dared to pronounce and enact Joyce's enormously transgressive text with such enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> Bravo!
