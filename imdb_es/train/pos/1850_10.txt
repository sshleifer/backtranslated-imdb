This is my favorite movie. I've seen it at least 10 times and I cry every time. My family begs me not to look at it, so I will not have a crying spell. I think I love that it's a true story written by Antwone himself as much as I love the movie. The acting is top notch, and the actors were perfect for their role. Denzel Washington is one of my favorite actors. But this is my favorite movie that he has done so far. I took care of a child who was also born in prison. He was the most precious child he had ever met. Now he has been adopted by a wonderful family that fought for him for almost two years. I watched this movie while the fight went on and his future was unsafe and I am very happy that he is safe and loved. And I am so happy that Antwone is happy and found his family. <br /> <br /> I would love to know more about him and how he has been since I met his family. I just can not say enough about this !!
