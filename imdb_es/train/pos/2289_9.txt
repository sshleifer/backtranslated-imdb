I am a pretty pedestrian, with somewhat low tastes. However, occasionally I try to raise the level of my cultural awareness. This movie was one of my attempts. I was amazed throughout the entire movie. I liked it so much that I got my own tape to be able to see it again. This is a very reflective and emotionally surprising film. I saw it as a big question for the viewer: What is the depth of sacrifice to duty that one can accept, can he be asked to accept, should he accept? As a military member, this is, of course, an important question for me. This question weighs heavily on the viewer of this movie. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
