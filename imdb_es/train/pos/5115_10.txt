['I did not see this movie in the theater. I confess an anti-Vinnie Barbarino prejudice. Who the hell was John Travolta to make movies? I remember the transmission of the Oscar that year, with Travolta looking absolutely devastated when he did not win. How dare he, when there were &quot;real&quot; actors in the race? I&#39;m sorry John, you should have won. After seeing this movie on cable for years, I fell in love with the whole movie. Bud, Sissy, Uncle Bob, Wes, all wonderfully done. I, too, confess that I never passed when I channel surfing. I have to stop and look. Over the years, I have learned to do most of the dialogue, dance with my thumbs on my waist and learn to appreciate Travolta more. The only disappointing thing for me was the carelessness, on the soundtrack, of part of the Urban Cowboy music. &quot;Looking for love&quot; defines the film, but Urban Cowboy was full of classics that did not reach the soundtrack. It should have been a double CD ........']
