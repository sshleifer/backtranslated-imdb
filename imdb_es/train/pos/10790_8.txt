This incredibly formula film from the "Walker, Texas Ranger" squad contains some of the most incredible scenes seen in a television movie. In addition, one can predict the result from the first moment. However, it's a funny little movie that does the job: it entertains. That's all he was meant to do and he does it. The acrobatics and explosions are fun and exciting and the plot is not so bad. The acting is also decent, which is not a big surprise, because everyone knows that Chuck Norris is not Steven Seagal. If you are a fan of the genre (and "Walker, Texas Ranger"), you will definitely love this. If not, then do not waste your time. 8/10
