Dick Tracy was originally a comic created in 1931 by Chester Gould. He is a plainclothes detective who tracks down a group of villains, from all kinds of visually original characters like Flattop to The Blank to Big Boy Caprice. (These villains became so popular in the 1940s that Warner Bros. created his own version of Tracy-style villains in cartoons like Daffy Duck). Tracy's comics were known for their liberal use of the weapon game and current technological advances. notably the wristwatch communicator), which had its fair share of screen time in this excellent movie. The music was beautifully done by Danny Elfman, and Madonna's original songs were interesting, but they were not the highlight of her career. It's weird because when you watch the movie and see the suspenseful moments, the movie looks a lot like Batman due to the memorable Elfman sound in his pieces. <br /> <br /> I love the hard-talking guy, the Pacino character as Big Boy Caprice (and that chin!), Madonna's take on villainy, and the cinematography and direction were impeccable. This film was very professional and features a lot of great actors who were known as great actors for a while before this movie was made (Warren Beatty, Al Pacino, William Forsythe, Dustin Hoffman, Kathy Bates, Mandy Patinkin, Catherine O 'Hara, Dick Van Dyke). The movie was directed by Beatty himself, which was interesting. It's almost like Beatty saw himself as Tracy in a past life or something because he really fit the role. <br /> <br /> I had to give this movie an 8/10 for everything it brought to the cinema that was overlooked. (for any reason). There have been many misunderstandings about the classification of this film in IMDb, and I still do not understand why. The characters were completely original and vibrant, as well as the style of the sets, the costumes, the lighting and everything in this film. Go buy it today. You will not regret.
