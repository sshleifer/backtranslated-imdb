What can be said, really ... "The tenant" is a first class thriller forged with equal amounts of suspense and full-blown paranoia. It is an intricately drawn film, every detail seems to be included for a reason, even though the plot rarely makes sense, and much of it is not even addressed objectively. Therefore, we are left with Trelkovsky (Polanski), increasingly unstable, a Polish man who has obtained an apartment due to the suicide of the previous tenant, to guide us through a world of fear and increasing uncertainty. After a party by a group of annoying co-workers, Trelkovsky is subjected to a greater and apparently inexplicable scrutiny on the part of the fellow occupants in his building; the rest of the film narrates his mental deterioration and gives us a complete mind on par with the subsequent efforts of David Lynch. "The tenant", however, is more melancholy and sinister, with unexpected comic relief, excellent performances and a really disturbing score. It's a movie that has more experience than the one described, so get on it.
