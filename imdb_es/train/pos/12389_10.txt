Bored of normal, normal movies to see this Halloween that I've seen again and again, I took my chances in "The Sentinel", hoping that my horror juices would flow again. Of course, had just returned from watching the remake of Dark Castle from "The House on Haunted Hill": a complete and absolute shit. Fortunately, "The Sentinel" BLEW ME AWAY! In a fascinating story about a model moving into a spooky building in Brooklyn Hights, the film offered everything I hope to find in a good movie: (1) Campy and fantastically juicy characters, exchanges and dialogues, including hilarious twists by Christopher Walken , Jeff Goldblum and especially, Martin Balsam, as a distracted teacher - (2) Horrible horror! It is not to give a frame, but there are scenes in this movie that cooled me to the pancreas: (3) fantastic blood, great makeup and an extravagant (although very uneven) direction of Michael Winner, which flows quite well with this unreal deal. If you loved "Evil Dead 2", "Dead Alive" and "Deep Rising", this will be your favorite queen. Just to emphasize my love for this movie: after seeing it for the first time, I was speechless, I rewound it and I saw it again. Now it is one of the favorites of all time. Do yourself a favor and take a look!
