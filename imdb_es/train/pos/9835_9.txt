Outside of the blocks, let me tell you that I am a big fan of zombies, so I do not make statements like the previous one lightly. Secondly, let me say that this is an Italian zombie movie and Fulci only directed 15 minutes before delivering it to Bruno (Rats, Night Of Terror) Mattei. This is not the people of Dawn of the Dead. <br /> <br /> That said, it's easily one of the most entertaining zombie movies I've seen in my life. <br /> <br /> The script is wonderfully horrible. Just take a look at the two scientists who are trying to find an antidote ("Let's try to put these two molecules together"). <br /> <br /> Zombies come in all varieties. From moaning shufflers, to machetes brandishing maniacs, to birds! <br /> <br /> The gore is abundant. The legs are torn, the arms are amputated and the stomachs are opened. <br /> <br /> The pace is fast, flying from one zombie attack to another. <br /> <br /> Then there is the head in the fridge. Oh the head in the fridge! One of the best moments of horror since Ash had his hand in Evil Dead 2. <br /> <br /> You should already know if you're the kind of person who is going to like this kind of movie. Get some friends and a little beer and you'll have a fun night. <br /> <br /> Did I mention the head in the refrigerator?!?!?
