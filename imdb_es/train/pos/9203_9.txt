This is one of the films by Dev Anand that gave excellent films to the Hindi film industries, such as Jewel Thief and Guide. The story is short (if you ask me what the story is), the plot is simple: a brother looks for his lost sister. The sister has joined the hippies who smoke in the pot and sing Hare Rama Hare Krishna. However, the film portrays some of the significant events that the world experienced in the 70s. The hipie culture, its submission to drugs, freedom, escape from duty, family and the adoption of something new like Eastern religion (which was new for whites). They have been handled perfectly. Zeenat gave his best and Dev, as usual, was remarkable. The songs are the ones that are best used (as opposed to being abused for having songs) in this movie. They have not been spoiled. A perfect example is 'Dekho or deewano ... Ram ka naam badnam na karo'. Every word in the song is very philosophical and meaningful. The ending is tragic but that is not the essence of the film. In general, Devji, who believes in making different films, has succeeded in showing what he wanted to show here. A must to experience the hippy culture and the beautiful Nepal of the 70s.
