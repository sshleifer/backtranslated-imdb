['This movie is great entertainment to watch with the wife or girlfriend. There are laughter in abundance and some very interesting little nudist stories are happening here. The actresses are all very interesting and definitely worth seeing in their natural beauty. Maslin beach life is full of various nudists and personality types. The landscape of the Australian coast is simply splendid to see. What a place to visit, to say the least, and one day it can become my hiding place. I really enjoy this movie and every time I see it I enjoy it more. I would love to see more of these characters and I always wonder what happened to them. Although the plot is somewhat soft, this film is, of course, a great excuse to simply sit on the sofa and enjoy the wonderful and famous beach of Maslin with these wonderful nudists and their own personal stories.']
