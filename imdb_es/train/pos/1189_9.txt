The Last Hunt is one of the few westerns that have been made to deal with Buffalo hunting, both as a sport and as a method to win the plains of Indian wars. Before the white man set foot on the other side of the Mississippi, the plains used to have herds of American Bison as large as some of our larger cities. At the time of the period in which The Last Hunt was established, the buffalo had been almost eliminated. The twentieth century, due to the efforts of conservationists, saw a resurgence in the population of the species, but it was not as it once was. <br /> <br /> Robert Taylor and Stewart Granger are co-starring in a second movie together and this is far superior to all brave brothers. Here, Stewart Granger is the good man, a tired buffalo hunter of the world, who has to return to a job he hates because of financial considerations. <br /> <br /> The partner you have chosen to collaborate with is Robert Taylor. Forgetting Taylor for the time being, I doubt there has ever been a soul more cruel and unpleasant than Charlie Gilsen, whom Taylor plays. In Devil's Doorway he was an American Indian who fought against the prejudice provoked by a racist played by Louis Calhern. In The Last Hunt, he is the racist here. Kill both buffaloes and Indians for pleasure. Kill an Indian family when the mules are stolen and take the widow of a captive. Like a barbarian conqueror, he awaits the pleasure of Debra Paget's sexual favors. Actually, he gets angry when Paget does not see it that way. <br /> <br /> No matter how often you refer to Russ Tamblyn as a mestizo, I was never really convinced that he was part of any Indian. It's the only weakness I found in The Last Hunt. <br /> <br /> However, Lloyd Nolan, the old and scruffy buffalo that Taylor and Granger bring, is great. Nolan steals all the scenes in which he is with the cast. <br /> <br /> For those who like their real westerns, who want to see a side of Robert Taylor never seen on the screen, and those who do not like cheap heroics, The Last Hunt is the ideal hunt.
