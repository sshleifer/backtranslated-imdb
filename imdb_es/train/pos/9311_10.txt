This was the worst movie I've seen, but it was also the best movie. The original Sci Fi movies are supposed to be bad, that's what makes them fun! The line, "I like my dinosaur meat well done!" It's probably the best quote of all! In addition, the plot sounds like something out of a dream induced by the pot. I can imagine it now, the writers wake up after a long night of drugging and playing the dance, the dance revolution, and then they put together ideas for this: the space marines arrived at the alien planet, which is infested with dinosaurs and has Medieval houses on it. Protect a scientific team studying the planet. The best idea of ​​all! In fact, it fits the checklist of the original Sci Fi movie: weapons, dinosaurs, medieval times, space travel, terrible performances. <br /> <br /> So watch this movie, but do not buy it.
