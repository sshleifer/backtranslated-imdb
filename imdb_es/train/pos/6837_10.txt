The typical De Palma movie made with a lot of style and some scenes that will take you to the edge of your seat. <br /> <br /> The most important thing is that this movie is better than the best thriller, it's the style. It has some brilliantly edited scenes and some scenes that are truly stressful that will take you to the edge of your seat. The best scene is from the movie; The museum scene and the elevator murder. There are some minor erotic scenes and the pace of the films may not be fast enough for the casual viewer to fully appreciate this movie. So this movie may not be suitable for everyone. <br /> <br /> The story itself is also pretty good, but it's really the style that makes the movie work! It can only be for the fans, but also the occasional spectators must appreciate the tension that accumulates in the film. <br /> <br /> There is a good character represented by a good cast. Michael Caine is an interesting choice for the casting and Angie Dickinson acts as well as she is beautiful (not bad for a 49 year old!). <br /> <br /> Pino Donaggio's musical score is also typically De Palma. I like it and it adapts very well to the film, as well as its score for the other De Palma movie, "Body Double". <br /> <br /> Brilliant suspense game that breaks nerves. I love De Palma! <br /> <br /> 10/10
