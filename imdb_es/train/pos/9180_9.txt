I felt compelled to see the adaptation of "Jane Eyre" by Timothy Dalton / Zelah Clarke in 1983 because I had just written an article about "Jane Eyre" of the BBC in 2006 for TheScreamOnline. <br /> <br /> So, I approached to see this in the same way that I approached to do the homework. <br /> <br /> At first I got irritated. The lighting in this version is bad. All / everything is erased with a bright white light that, in some scenes, casts shadows on the wall behind the characters. <br /> <br /> And the sound is badly recorded. I felt I was listening to a high school play. <br /> <br /> And the pancake makeup is too heavy. <br /> <br /> And the sets do not completely transmit the Gothic atmosphere. of the novel. They're too fussy, too, Martha Stewart. I just can not see Bronte's Rochester complying with Martha Stewart's domestic arrangements. The Rochester of Orson Welles lived in a gloom, very appropriate for the gothic atmosphere of the novel. <br /> <br /> And yet ... with all those objections ... not only this is the best "Jane Eyre". seen, it may be the best adaptation of any novel I've seen. <br /> <br /> This "Jane Eyre", despite its technical flaws, gave me the feeling of reading "Jane Eyre" for the first time. <br /> <br /> Critics of this production say it is too close to the book. For me, someone who valued the book and did not need it to be less "neat" or less "Christian" or more sexed, the fidelity of this version to the novel that Bronte actually wrote is his best asset. <Br /> <br /> Bronte wrote a good book. There is a reason why it has lasted more than 150 years, while other more polished, more attractive and easier texts have disappeared. <br /> <br /> As a fan of "Jane Eyre" for a long time, I was prejudiced against Timothy Dalton as Rochester. Rochester is, famous, not handsome; Jane and Rochester are the famous ugly couple of literature. And Timothy Dalton is nothing if he is not incredibly handsome. <br /> <br /> But Dalton offers a fascinating performance like Rochester. He simply left me speechless. I have never seen anything like his absolute devotion to Rochester's role, text, dialogue and love for Jane. Dalton brings the Rochester from the page to the trembling life on the screen. <br /> <br /> Rochester is destined to be a little scary. Dalton is scary. Welles also had a bad streak, for example, when he shouted "Enough!" After Fontaine plays a small piece for piano. But Dalton is scary more than once, here. You can not really tell if you are going to hurt Jane, or yourself, in your despair. <br /> <br /> Rochester's perversity, his humor, his anger, his vulnerability: Dalton transmits everything, sometimes seconds apart. Is awesome. <br /> <br /> And here's the key: the actor who plays Rochester must convey that he has spent more than a decade of his life desperate, alone, living with an ugly secret that destroys lives. <br /> <br /> No other actor who has seen this part attempt to transmit that black hole of despair as Timothy Dalton does. The favorite of the current fans Toby Stephens does not even try. Dalton hits him outside the park. If I saw Timothy Dalton playing Rochester in a singles bar, he would say, "That guy is a problem, do not even look at him." He is that radioactive with a hurried agony. <br /> <br /> Zelah Clarke is not only, in general, the best Jane I've seen, it's one of the very few Janes that the producers were willing to cast when the book throws Jane. . No, people who know "Jane Eyre" only from the 2006 version, Bronte did not describe a sculptural and robust Jane with finely arched eyebrows and full lips. Rather, the Jane of Charlotte Bronte is, in fact, poor, plain, dark and small, and NOT pretty. <br /> <br /> Zelah has a small mouth, closed eyes and a little nose. She is really "little". She is not a fashion model. And she is the best Jane, the most faithful to the book. <br /> <br /> Some described it as a cold or boring. No, she is faithful to the book. Jane de Bronte is not a hot mother, she is a private and protected adolescent whose inner passions appear only at key moments, as Zelah does here. Jane, the book, is someone you should look at slowly, carefully, patiently, carefully, if you really want to probe its depths. You must see Zelah, here, to know who she really is. <br /> <br /> I would have liked to see more fire in Zelah in a key scene, but that is a five-hour scene in which it is, for the rest, very good. <br /> <br /> Despite its closeness to the text, this version, like all the other versions I have seen, avoids fully explaining the openly Christian themes in "Jane Eagle." Christianity is not an incidental subtext in "Jane Eyre", it is central. <br /> <br /> Helen Burns instructs Jane in Christianity, which gives her a subversive and countercultural way of reading and living, seemingly condemned, pinched life. It is Christianity, and a Christian God, who convinces poor, simple and obscure Jane of equal value, her need to fulfill her ideals and her rejection of a key marriage proposal. Here it is not clear. <br /> <br /> In any case, Charlotte Bronte wrote an excellent, complex and rich novel, and this adaptation of it, of all the ones I have seen, mine and honors. The novel is the best adaptation I've seen, and that says a lot. <br /> <br /> Other versions, which do not fully honor the book, end up being a task to see in many places. If you do not care what Charlotte Bronte has to say about child abuse or the hypocrisy of a culture based on appearance and money, your adaptation of much of the book will be something that people will move quickly to get to the kissing scenes between them. Jane and Rochester. <br /> <br /> This version, like Bronte's novel, realizes that everything Bronte wrote, about Jane's experiences in Lowood and her relationship with St. John, is part of what makes Jane is related to Rochester So explosive and unforgettable as it is.
