An angry child who has tragically lost his parents is looked after by his grandfather. Together they find common ground in Gaelic folk tales that have been passed on orally from generation to generation of islanders. Although tragic episodes, such as Highland authorizations, appear in stories, there is a surprising amount of humor and joy in them. Everything is filmed in Skye, so there is a double dose of beauty. The mountainous landscape is impressive, and it is a rare opportunity to hear Scottish Gaelic. I'm English, so I had to read the subtitles, but the sound of spoken Gaelic is wonderful. The performances are exactly what you would expect from non-carefully selected actors; in other words, he is seeing the real: the people who care deeply about Gaelic folklore and history. The Gaelic community, especially in Skye, made innumerable minor miracles to make this film. Anyone who has the least interest in Gaelic, popular history, popular music, oral culture, Scotland, British history, multiculturalism or social justice should go see this movie.
