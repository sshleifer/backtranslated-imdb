I would not have known about this movie if it were not for his Oscar nomination "surprise" for the Best Animated Film. Fortunately, I could see that I could see this little animated treasure. <br /> <br /> The story is about the child Brendan, who was the nephew of the imposing and overprotective abbot of the Township of Kells. The abbot's main prior occupation is to build a wall to protect Kells from the attacking Vikings. One day, Aiden, the renowned Iona illustrator, sought refuge with them. Aiden opens Brendan's eyes to the art of illustration and the appeal of the outside world. On the way, Brendan became friends with the white spy of the Aisling forest, while trying to recover an ancient glass of great value for the meticulous art of book illustration. <br /> <br /> "The secret of Kells" is different from most published animations. these days. It is a kind of retrocession, since the illustrations are made in lines and geometric designs without much care of realism, as much as symbolism. The movements of these lines are reminiscent of the simple but fluid animation style used in the initial sequence of "Kung Fu Panda". However, the magnificent use of color is the main source of astonishment for the public. The reds used in the Viking invasion sequence are unforgettably unforgettable. <br /> <br /> Try to catch this silent jewel of a movie. It is a welcome respite from all the foolish bombardment of the current animated fare such as "Monsters vs. Aliens" and the like. The scant Celtic musical score is effective to evoke the sense of fantasy that permeates the film. OK, the story can be a bit superficial and the end a bit difficult. I would have liked to know more about the Book in which Brendan and Aiden were working. But the clear star of this movie is clearly his amazing stylized artwork, which is said to be based on the work of art in the true Book of Kells.
