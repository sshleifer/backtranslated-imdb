['There was some doubt on my part about what this movie had to offer. To begin with, the casting did not seem right. Kiefer Sutherland had already done very well in &quot;24&quot; and the preview did not seem to offer anything to him or the audience. Eva Longoria appeared out of place, and the rest did not seem very interesting. <br /><br /> When the film finally ended, I was not completely upset because I had seen a decent thriller that could have been much better, if the responsible parties had taken a little more care of the narrative gaps and had paid more attention to the development of the character. We have seen threats of this kind before, and that made the main conflict much more challenging for the writers. As an audience, we do not want to see the same old story again. We want to see something different, be excited and entertained. <br /><br /> There is nothing wrong with the casting. From Kim Basinger&#39;s delicious first lady. She behaves with enough grace and sex appeal to make the part memorable. Michael Douglas has been and has done it before. Unfortunately, the president is a great entity that does not care about his fate. Sutherland emphasizes his &quot;24&quot; hard guy approach with enough power to make it big enough for the big screen, and Eva does an acceptable job, like the newcomer. <br /><br /> Do not expect as many twists and fireworks as some of the established classics (&quot;North by Northwest&quot; and &quot;The Fugitive&quot; come to mind). Leave your expectations outside and enjoy the trip for whatever it is. It&#39;s okay']
