'Ifigenia' is the great achievement of Michael Cacoyannis. This masterpiece is brilliantly adapted for the screen and brought to life by a wonderful cast. Cacoyannis achieved the impossible. He managed to film a Greek tragedy on the screen without losing its effectiveness and importance. A stellar Greek cast helps him in this. The newcomer Tatiana Papamoschou is extremely impressive as Iphigenia. Equally impressive is Irene Papas, who although sometimes seems exaggerated, is very realistic. A wonderful Greek film, beautifully adapted and directed by Michael Cacoyannis, with excellent music by Mikis Theodorakis, which is ideal in all scenes. <br /> <br /> P.S. Rumors say that the movie lost the best foreign language movie Oscar for only 1 vote !!!
