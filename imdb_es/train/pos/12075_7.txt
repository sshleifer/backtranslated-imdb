Nina Foch insists that "My Name is Julia Ross" in this 1945 film, also starring Dame May Witty and George Macready. It's short, and because it is, the movie suffers. It could have lasted about fifteen minutes to half an hour more. <br /> <br /> Growing up, Foch was an accessory on television, playing a neurotic woman, the wife of the unfaithful husband. The nervous shipwreck. She became one of the great acting teachers in Los Angeles. Here, she is a naive young woman who plays the main role. Julia responds to an announcement from a secretary and is immediately hired by Mrs. Hughes and her son Ralph. Little does she know, although we learned immediately, that the employment agent is a front, configured to get the right woman for this task, a woman without a family and without a boyfriend. <br /> <br /> It's a life - in situation; Once Julia arrives at the house, she is drugged, and when she wakes up, they tell her that it is Mrs. Hughes and that she is not allowed to leave. <br /> <br /> The acting is very good. Low budget but still entertaining: some things, especially in the end, happen too fast, that's why I said the movie is too short. However, I recommend it.
