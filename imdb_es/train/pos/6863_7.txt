An excellent thriller with a fantastic slow motion work that adds to the dramatic makes it a pleasure to see and enjoy. The director and writer Brian de Palma makes a super impersonation of Hitchcock (many called it a "scam") with this movie and the 2.35: 1 widescreen DVD is a must to appreciate the work of the camera (and several scenes with people hidden in each that are lost in TV format tapes). <br /> <br /> The disadvantage of the film, at least for anyone with some kind of moral standard, is the general sordidness of all the characters, including the police played by a New York pre-police Dennis Franz ( that has hair here!). <br /> <br /> The opening scene is still shocking with a fairly long scene of Angie Dickinson, which is quite explicit, even 25 years after its release. The film has several erotic scenes as Dickinson (if that is really his close-up) and Nancy Allen is not shy to show their bodies. <br /> <br /> There is not much dialogue in the first 20 minutes and there is no bad language until Franz enters the picture after the murder. The first 36 minutes are fascinating and, although it is clear who the killer is, the suspense and fun to see everything is still very good, especially for men who eat naked women with their eyes.
