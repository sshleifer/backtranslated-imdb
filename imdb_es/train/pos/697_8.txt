This is one of the first independent films I've seen. For such a low budget, it was done well; As an insomniac, I can sympathize with the main character, although my sleeping problems have never been so intense or so disturbing. <br /> <br /> Well directed, well acted, of a theme that I have not seen much in the cinemas, illuminating and configuring both perfect for the film's setting. There are some notorious errors, but they can be intentional; You will see it after watching the movie. The movie is very personal, and it's worth watching twice. No movie is impeccable, but a Hollywood version could not make history better. in general, 8/10.
