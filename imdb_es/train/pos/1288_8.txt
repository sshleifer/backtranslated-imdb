['Preston Waters has had a bad summer. In addition to his birthday, nothing else seems promising. <br /><br /> First you have to share your own room with your brothers who are going to run a business. They can not do it in their rooms because they do not have enough space. For a birthday party, you only get $ 6 chips while others get $ 32, $ 35 and even $ 50. When one of your birthday cards arrives early, you only receive a check for $ 11. <br /><br /> When you go to the bank, you learn that you need at least $ 200 to open an account. When leaving the bank, a bully steals the check. Pursue the child almost runs over him (definitely his bicycle is ruined) by a criminal named Quigley (played by Miguel Ferrer). Quigley just came from the bank also because he gives the owner $ 1,000,000 to give to this guy tomorrow. Quigley begins to write a check for the damage, but only manages to write his name before a police car circulates in the area. Fear, he gives Preston the check, informs him to give it to his dad to finish. <br /><br /> That night, however, Preston tells his dad that he does not want a new bicycle, that he wants his own room returned, even better his own home. His father locks him in his room for the rest of the night. Being depressed in his room, Preston thinks that things can not be worse, he realizes that he forgot the check since it is still in his shirt pocket. It is blank <br /><br /> Using the computer and after careful consideration, he does so for $ 1,000,000. The next day, while trying to collect it at the bank, he takes it to the owner who believes he is the person who must give the $ 1,000,000 and he does it. Not so, since the real person named Juice arrives a moment later. <br /><br /> Now the three have to track Preston. <br /><br /> Meanwhile, Preston has fun buying all sorts of things, including his own house and even dating a bank woman in disguise who is actually an agent of the FBI (who is trying to track down the 3 bad guys). He makes this person named Mr. Macintosh for whom he works and even plans a party for him on his birthday. <br /><br /> But eventually things catch up (the money runs out, the bad guys catch it). <br /><br /> In general, a pretty funny movie. Miguel Ferrer fulfills his role very well. If you enjoyed it in Another Stakeout, you will love it here. He does all kinds of crazy, evil things. <br /><br /> Rick Ducommun (the stressed boss of Ghost in the Machine) plays a wonderful and kind driver in this movie.']
