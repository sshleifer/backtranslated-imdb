This is one of those movies in which, after seeing it, you will continue thinking and returning even months after seeing it. The performance is spectacular for starring two children (I usually hate movies with the performance of a whiny child). Bill Paxton is amazing, his directorial debut is even better than I expected from an actor whose most memorable line is "The game is over, man! The game is over!" (from the movie "Aliens"). <br /> <br /> The best part of the film is the dichotomy between those scenes in which the actors play a family and when they do their "work". It really makes the film credible and memorable. <br /> <br /> Keep it up, Bill. I'll be waiting for more movies that I'm sure to love!
