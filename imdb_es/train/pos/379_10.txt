1985 was a good year for the movies, maybe even great, but this losing a gong was a long way to convince the fans that the old Oscar is little more than a bell ornament for members of the good party. <br /> <br /> 11 nominations and not a single title: such was the disdain of the Academy by one of its best directors; and one who had to wait another 8 years before the prejudices prevented them from giving him the statue before allowing them to give him 7 for Schindler's List, which is not so good (and I am half Polish). br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, Schindler was a classic. And I'm not calling 'Out of Africa' (which won that year); but it was, in my opinion, a class behind it: an epic story of suffering and hope that made me cry, and I'm not a big thief. <br /> <br /> Maybe it was the music (superb), or the cinematography (sumptuous), but more likely just the acting: Whoopi, who showed us all that she was much more than a comedian; Danny Glover, whom he had never heard of before; and, of course, Oprah. <br /> <br /> The rest is history; But, at that moment, who knew?
