This movie reminded me that some old black and white movies are definitely worth it. <br /> <br /> Initially I had some reservations, however, from the beginning of the movie until the end I was captivated. I was VERY impressed with the mix of drama, suspense and comedy. <br /> <br /> Arthur Askey (Tommy Gander) is HILARO and he had me at all times. <br /> <br /> Definitely add this Movie for your movie night to get a slight relief from the sometimes depressing and "too" powerful or too "fun" movies of today.
