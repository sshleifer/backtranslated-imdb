Set in 2017 (although one could easily mistake it in 1987, judging by hairstyles and clothing), The Running Man sees the good and complete man Ben Richards (Schwarzeneggar) framed by a crime he did not commit. After a daring escape in prison, he is captured and admitted as a participant in the brutal television program The Running Man, along with some fellow fugitives and the beautiful female, Amber (Maria Conchita Alonso). <br /> <br /> Used by the totalitarian government as a way to control the masses, the program confronts the convicts against a range of colorful (and often quite comfortable) opponents, each with their own style of killing Dynamo fires electricity from a special suit, Buzzsaw uses chainsaws, Sub Zero has an ice hockey stick with very sharp edges and Fireball prefers a flamethrower to take down the contenders. But these murderers are not rivals to Ben Richards, who sends them each in a suitably frightening manner (followed by ingenious wit). <br /> <br /> Towards the end of the film, Ben joins a group of freedom fighters. a battle against the authorities, and revenge to take revenge of the unpleasant presenter of the program, Killian. <br /> <br /> Twenty years ago, Arnold Schwarzeneggar ruled the universe of action movies and, for his legion of fans, could do without error. The Austrian cake had a successful formula that almost guaranteed box office success for its films: the comic book plot plus a logic without an argument, plus a more ingenious female companion with a single line, and an ability to act equal to big profits . The Running Man faithfully followed this highly successful recipe to an audience and the audience of Arnie (mostly male) included it (myself). <br /> <br /> Now, two decades later, and I just saw the movie again. For the first time in years, it seems like a strange movie: one that lacks any technical merit, decent acting and convincing effects, but somehow totally entertaining. Directed by Paul Michael Glaser (better known as the Det. Dave Starsky of the cult police program of the 70s, Starsky and Hutch), and adapted from a short story by Stephen King (written under the pen name, Richard Bachman), The Running Man is cheesy The tattoo of the 80s seems incredibly cheap and very outdated, but despite (or perhaps because of) the poor quality of the film, it has a special charm that is hard to describe. <br /> <br /> Without any attempt to create a realistic environment. In the configuration of the future, the film offers many involuntary giggles. Take a look at the scene where Ben discovers Amber's secret hiding place from forbidden cassette tapes (!); Marvel at the 'futuristic' trash of the graphics used in billboards and in the game The Running Man (as a graphic designer, I found them particularly fun); be surprised with the clear lack of convincing technological advances. <br /> <br /> The Running Man may be complete nonsense, but it's hugely entertaining that I will not hesitate to recommend to Arnie fans and sci-fi action. in general.
