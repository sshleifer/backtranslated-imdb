I would not call "We're back! The story of a dinosaur" simply a children's version of "Jurassic Park." I found it more interesting than that. Like the first, it calls into question the security of bringing beings from one era to ours. But it really opens my eyes when I see who provides the voices: John Goodman, Rhea Perlman, Jay Leno, Walter Cronkite, Julia Child, Kenneth Mars, Yeardley Smith, Martin Short and Larry King. To paraphrase that: a certain actor, the wife of "Cheers", the host of "Tonight Show", the most trusted name in the news, a famous chef, the police chief of "Young Frankenstein", Lisa Simpson, one of the Tres Amigos and Chico from CNN. <br /> <br /> But I guess I should not focus on the cast alone. I thought that this movie had something both for children (purely fun) and for adults (natural history). It is true, it is escapism, but of a perceptual type. I would really say that John Goodman doing the voice of Rex here is a kind of precursor to his voice work in "Monsters Inc". Worth seeing.
