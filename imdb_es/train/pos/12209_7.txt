['I was very impressed with this small image, made independently. The story, about a pair of social pariahs that meet, they become friends and provide a system of mutual support that both seemed to lack children, sometimes they are fun, sometimes sad, but always provocative. The music, mostly from underground bands, was used to great effect, as well as experimenting with camera angles, filters and slow or fast movement techniques. The performances (the protagonists are played by the writers and directors of the film) are some of the best I&#39;ve seen in recent years. If you ever felt like a square peg forced into a round slot, I really think you&#39;ll appreciate &quot;By Hook or By Crook.&quot;']
