In my opinion, A GUY THING is a hilarious, witty, sexy, romantic and totally beautiful girl movie that the boys will also enjoy. I thought that Jason Lee and Julia Stiles were dazzled like a baffled boyfriend and his cousin in a hurry. If you ask me, they light the screen like magic. You can also feel their chemistry among them. Before finishing this, I would like to say that the performances were of high grade, the direction was impeccable, the production design was pleasant, the casting was perfect and the suits were perfectly designed. In conclusion, to anyone who is a fan of Jason Lee or Julia Stiles, I recommend this movie. Many laughter and emotions await you, so go to the video store, rent or buy it, relax with a friend and see it.
