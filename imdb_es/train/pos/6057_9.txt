Claro, for its super images and its incredible sound, is a great disc of "show off" of home cinema, but it is also a moving drama, as well as an informative documentary. The parallel stories that intertwine throughout this film will keep all viewers interested. Young, old, boys and girls alike will find that deep down, we are all fanatics of the automobile, especially the high performance indy machines that are the result of generations of blood, sweat, tears, wit and perseverance. The sound tracks of Mark Knopfler and Ry Cooder are perfectly adapted to the images and content. I do not want to reveal the ending, but Quincy Jones' final sequence in "Days Like These" could bring a tear to your eye. Enjoy it!
