['This James Bond game is the best bonus game I&#39;ve played in my life, it&#39;s my favorite James Bond game so far because: <br /><br /> The missions in this game are very fun, can be very difficult, which makes it more fun to play missions. There are many actions that the weapons you use are really good. The cars in this game are amazing, the missions of the cars have a lot of action and they are very fun to play. The voice over the actors is really good and it&#39;s great that Sean Connery is the voice of James Bond, as well as the appearance of Bond is really great because he looks like Sean Connery when he played James Bond in the movies and the other character looks fairly good. The same as the look in the movie. The graphics are pretty good in this James Bond game. Also, the game follows the movie a lot, but not everything, but most of the time it does, which is great. <br /><br /> general score ********** of **********']
