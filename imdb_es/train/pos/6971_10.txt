Of course, the average "Sci-Fi" fanatic Battle Star Gallactica will hate this. That makes me happy. I do not like those cheesy sci-fi shows, especially the battle star Gallactica, and that's why I like this show. <br /> <br /> The creators of the program received a lot of heat for doing this (the unconventional book). -fi way) and it was worth it. I read on Wiki that they wanted to attract everyone, including women and not just sci-fi nerds. <br /> <br /> This is probably the most promising program since Lost. It has the most interesting, intelligent and profound script of any program at any time and it is truly unique. <br /> <br /> What I like most about the program is that it behaves like a great Anime. From young teenagers shooting firearms, to extremely well balanced and complex scripts, to robots, it reminds me of something that came from Japan, except a little better (most of the Anime is too confusing).
