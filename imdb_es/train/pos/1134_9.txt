The only part missing in this film is Shue's part as the daughter who wants to follow in her "aunt's" footsteps like a soap star during the day. Otherwise, it would be a perfect 10. <br /> <br /> It seems that all the actors enjoyed their part and acted in an exaggerated way to fulfill their own enjoyment and the script. I have to wonder if a bit of advertising was not "taking place in parts." It was well cast and there are some classic lines that will stay with you. <br /> <br /> It's a fantastic movie that everyone should see at least once. I recommend not drinking anything that could sting your nose. <br /> <br /> You will definitely want to see the last scene up close, 'Nurse Nan' has a little secret that she would rather not have shared with you. <br /> <br /> If you love day soaps or despises them, this movement is fun in all the right places.
