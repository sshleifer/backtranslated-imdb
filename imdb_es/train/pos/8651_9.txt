Kalifornia left in 1993, just when 3 of the 4 main characters rose and reached the levels of fame they now have in 2006. This is a good psycho-thriller that should attract all the fans of David Duchovny due to his dryness and intelligence. stories that find their way into his work, as in most episodes of X-Files, Playing God and Red Shoe Diaries. <br /> <br /> people who were rejected by the strong southern accent of Brad Pitt and the characters of Juliette Lewis have obviously never spent much time in the south. For every "Brian and Carrie" in the south, there is an "Adele and Early" and in 2006, that is the true horror of this movie. <br /> <br /> Aside from that, I think the film was written with a cult film intent: as with Carrie's photography, it is not suitable for mass consumption. But if you have a copy of this in your personal library, I think it says something positive about your tastes for strange movies.
