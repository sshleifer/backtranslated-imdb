I appreciate every picture of this beautiful movie. It's about normal people, people we all know, who suffer a bit in their lives and have some luggage to carry. Like all of us. Robert DeNiro, Ed Harris and Kathy Baker give life to their performances and they are excellent, but Harris is especially heartbreaking and, therefore, very real. You would swear that he really is a truck driver who drinks so he does not have to feel anything. Baker, like her sister, also has some delicate moments: when DeNiro gives her flowers in a scene, it seems that she had never been given flowers before and probably not. Very valuable
