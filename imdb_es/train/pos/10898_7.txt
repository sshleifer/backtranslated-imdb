This movie is not as bad as I heard. It was nice, fun and I love that it revolves around the holiday season. He has me completely in the mood to go shopping at Christmas and listen to Christmas music. When this movie comes out on DVD, it will take the place of the Christmas holidays in my collection. It will be a movie to watch every year after Thanksgiving so that he is in the mood for the best time of the year. I heard that Ben's character was a bit crazy, but I think he just adds to the movie and why be so serious all the time. Take it as it is, a Christmas comedy with a touch of love. I loved it. No, it's not Titanic and it will not beat your heart with anticipation, but it will cause a laugh or two. So go and laugh and have fun :)
