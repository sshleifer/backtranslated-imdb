First of all, I would like to point out that the people who have criticized this film have made some flagrant mistakes. Anything that has a rating lower than 6/10 is clearly nonsense. <br /> <br /> Creep is an absolutely fantastic movie with amazing cinematic effects. The actors are highly credible, the narrative provokes the thought and the horror and the graphic content are extremely disturbing. <br /> <br /> There's a lot of mysticism in this movie. Many questions arise as the audience reveals itself to the strange and monstrous creature that makes habitat in the dark tunnels of rats. How was 'Craig' created and what happened to it? <br /> <br /> A fantastic movie with a great cold factor. A film with so many unanswered questions and a movie that should be appreciated along with others like 28 Days Later, The Bunker, Dog Soldiers and Deathwatch. <br /> <br /> We expect more of these fantastic movies!
