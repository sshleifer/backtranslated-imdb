Joe Don Baker is one of the few actors who is often better than his material and almost always unappreciated. He has been in many movies as heavy or as a hero, and has the kind of strong and solid presence that Wallace Beery made half a century before him. Baker can deliver material that would sound ridiculous when leaving another actor, and that's what he likes most about him. He really seems to want to say what he's saying, no matter how clich√©, obvious or silly, what puts him in a league with Tommy Lee Jones, Oliver Reed and Don Stroud. It's what made the WALKING TALL trilogy work so well, and that same magic is here in JUSTICE FINAL. This was a huge success in theaters and videos in the 80s, and it has aged much better than many of the best known action movies of the time. By moving the Texas action to Europe, there is a real timeless quality that does not take you away from the on-screen action. To be honest, I've always liked the films of Greydon Clark, who is a sensible director in the same way as Clint Eastwood in the 1970s, and this is one of the best. FINAL JUSTICE is one of the lost gems of the late 80s, similar to MAN ON FIRE in its true guts and violence. I suppose if you remake this with The Rock, a whole new audience will come to love you as much as I do.
