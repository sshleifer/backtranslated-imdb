Guy Kibbee gives a lot of laughs to the viewer. Like most candidates, he knows almost nothing. Warren William, a very underestimated actor, is excellent at giving instructions to Kibbee; that is, it teaches him to say something that does not mean anything to the voting public. A campaign based on no comments, "I'll take it into consideration" and "Maybe yes, but again, maybe not" is the almost perfect way to win an election. Succinctly, the more foolish the candidate is, the greater the probability that he will win. After all, the public can identify with that person. With respect to the movie, it makes a lot of comedy.
