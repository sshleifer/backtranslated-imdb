"I did not want this to get complicated, Leese, I have to assume that she's going to read that." Fear rises to 30,000 feet in this tense action thriller. A night flight to Miami quickly becomes a battle for survival when Lisa (Rachel McAdams) realizes that her seatmate (Cillian Murphy) plans to use her as part of a chilling murder plan. As the minutes pass, he's racing against time to warn potential victims before it's too late. <br /> <br /> One of the many reasons why I love this movie is because of the chemistry between the two stars, McAdams and Murphy, who are also two of my favorite actors. For example, the first scenes at the airport are more like a romantic comedy: two people continue to clash with each other ... I also had to give them to both of them, to make a movie like this one. Especially, the character of Murphy ... Jackson, who really seems to be a bit complicated in that way, acts charmingly and innocently, but tries to do his job and make Lisa feel physically and mentally trapped. I mean, in certain parts, he really seems to be worried about Lisa. <br /> <br /> A great emotion all the way. A lot of movies that I would like to see a prequel or a sequel, but I really would not mind a prequel to this, which would be carried out with Jackson watching Lisa. The favorite scene is probably that head-butt scene, because it was so unexpected. There was also a good accumulation in the famous "pen" scene. When are you going to make her move? There was also a nice change in McAdam's Lisa, where she herself changed from being a victim to defending herself. I also loved the scene where she sits in the food court and pretends to ask some women a survey about the food court. How good was Murphy with all his pain .....
