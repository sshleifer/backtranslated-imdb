The Five Deadly Venoms is a great kung-fu action film wrapped in a crazy mystery. There are all the usual telltale signs of a kung fu movie: a great choreography, a dreadful dubbing, different "styles" of struggle and a wide range of very exaggerated, often cheesy human emotions. However, the plot is certainly better than average. It's interesting and keeps your attention throughout the scenes without a fight. Occasionally, he is even able to encourage the audience, as when character X receives a horrible injustice. <br /> <br /> Another thing that I love about the Five Deadly Poisons is the beautiful simplicity of morality and the themes of the film. Almost everyone receives what comes to them. The cowards, greedy and corrupt are losing. The bad ones, consumed by selfish greed, are finally destroyed by their own betrayal and stabbing. Good people use teamwork, planning and integrity to overcome the odds and reach the top. <br /> <br /> Poison of the Rock Clan!
