This movie has great stars in its early years: Ingor Stevens never looked more beautiful; Yul Brynner was a very convincing Jean LaFitte, he was in conflict with his piracy and wished to maintain neutrality with the United States. Charlton Heston did a pretty good job like Andrew Jackson, but some moments were a bit forced. It's really a good movie for students to learn that part of our story, and it shows that all happy endings DO NOT include the lovers that come together, sometimes the happiest ending is that they sail and find similar background companions that I will understand them. better in the long term. I've seen it every year at least twice for 16 years; and although it's not the best movie I've seen, I love it every time!
