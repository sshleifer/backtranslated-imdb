I will rush to address the themes of the film here: it was a very interesting story about the destructive qualities of the passions that consume everyone; a young Italian woman who can not emotionally connect with her imprisoned radical political fianc√© (due in part to her apolitical attitudes and her carefree approach to life) finds comfort and passion in a new young lover with whom she embarks on an explicitly sexual relationship . The anxieties, the anger, the tenderness and the passions that swirl in the atmosphere of the story are equal to the dispassionate silence that seems to engulf the two tracks. It brings to the film a disturbing state of mind that pervades all the political struggle that, otherwise, is lost on the spectator (unless he has a deep knowledge of Italian politics during the 80s). The film seemed convincing ... what ruined her a bit is a free oral sex scene that the actress plays with the male protagonist ... it is not simulated and leaves little to the imagination. There are other scenes of sex in the film, which I think were necessary because they describe the madness and loneliness in which the characters live. But the oral sex scene, I think, derails the focus on the real story. It was smooth sailing until then and once the infamous sex scene (which caused a lot of discomfort in your day) appears, it's like hitting a barricade. It is discordant and unnecessary, and I am in the camp that believes that the film would not have been damaged if the scene had been eliminated. And what is unfortunate is that this particular scene can dissuade people from watching this intriguing movie, which I think is worth seeing because there are many things below the surface, emotions and more disturbances in the subtext. <br /> <br /> In general: Wonderful movie hampered by a very unnecessary sex scene.
