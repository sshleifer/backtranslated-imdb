The choice to turn this SNL sketch into a movie was much better thought out than other recent ones. The humor involved in the character is not the annoying mood, and it is also motivated enough to extend for one or two hours. <br /> <br /> Oddly enough, the sexual content seemed like it could be avoided, but that may have been because the limitations of live television taught me not to expect it. I guess he was thinking more about "Leisure Suit Larry" risky than the producers ... <br /> <br /> It's definitely not a PG-13 movie, which will probably hurt him when he reaches the heights of his predecessors more successful, but even better premise and writing than their saddest. <br /> <br /> I liked it, but I doubt it's a resounding success ... (which is sad, since Tim Meadows tends not to do characters that bothers me quite often that other SNL alumni tend to )
