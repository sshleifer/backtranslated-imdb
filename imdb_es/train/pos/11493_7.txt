The Unborn is a fairly good, low-budget horror movie that exploits the fears associated with pregnancy. He is very well acted by the always good Brooke Adams and the unconditional James Karen, although the cast of cast is quite average for a b-grade. Music, by Gary Numan of all people, is also good. The script by Henry Dominic is pretty smart for this kind of thing, although there is a hint of misogyny about it. The Rodman Fender address is merely adequate, and there are some unnecessary cheap fears. If you are a fan of Adams, whose film career is not as illustrious as it should be, take a look; She is great, as always.
