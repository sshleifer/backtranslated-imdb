I loved this series when I was in Kids WB, I did not think there would have been a Batman scandal since the original program ended in 1995 and this program came in 1997. First of all, I loved the idea of ​​Robin leaving Batman to solve the crime on your own. It was an interesting perspective for their relationship. I also liked the inclusion of Tim Drake in the series, and once again, like his predecessor, this program had a great story, a great animation (better than the original), a fantastic voice work and, of course, a writing sparkly. The only thing I did not like was that when I was in the USA. UU I used to run episodes in a 15 minute story. I just wish that some of the episodes could be longer. My favorite episode of any Batman cartoon comes in this series, and it's called "Over the Edge", in my opinion as good or no better than "Heart of Ice" and "Robin's calculation of accounts". In general, a good follow-up, together with Superman, this show made my childhood very happy.
