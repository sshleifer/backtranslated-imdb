Well, what can I say, this movie really caught my attention, is not so bad, as many say, I loved it, although the idea seems so simple and quite boring, it is not. First of all I enjoyed the soundtrack (Bryan Adams), it really goes with the movie. Second, the simple story, and the drama of the Spirit calls your attention. One thing I like most is that they did not give the stallion a human voice to interact with the other horses, it makes the film more realistic, there are not many animations that look realistic now, right? Knowing, making animals talk is so ... lame. <br /> <br /> One of the most beautiful animations of 2002, in my opinion, I recommend it to all, not only the children :), because it is very relaxing.
