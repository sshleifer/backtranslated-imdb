Excellent movie that shows the pathetic life of two crazy old women. They could not live together, nor separated. Babbling constantly, sometimes at the same time, they crushed and crushed the past again; and goes on and on about what could be. Sometimes I laughed, but in general I was surprised how sad and abandoned these two women were. Watch this.
