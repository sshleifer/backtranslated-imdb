['Finally I could see the infamous &quot;Ice Age&quot;. Besides not being as fun as I expected after seeing the brilliant teaser, there is not a bad word I can say about it. Sure, it&#39;s not as glamorous as a Disney production (it&#39;s also Fox&#39;s first attempt at a full CG movie) but it has a huge heart and on some occasions (like the look in Manfred&#39;s eyes after we see the sad glance of his past) I found myself on the verge of tears. But when they reunited the baby with their father, I could not contain them anymore. A film that has no problem walking in the thin line of sappy and clich√© and manages to get more than the best of it; The final result is one of the most moving animated creations I&#39;ve seen. The great fun-looking characters that grow quickly in you (and also the great voice talents) and many funny and memorable scenes, especially from Scrat, make the movie a reason more than enough to try. In addition to the Dodo scene, which is my favorite personal funny scene of 2002. <br /><br /> Honestly, I do not understand, but for some reason it really seems that CG animation will take the lead in the future. But if it only means that there will be more movies like this (and who can forget the creations of Pixar), then I really do not care, at least for now. 9/10']
