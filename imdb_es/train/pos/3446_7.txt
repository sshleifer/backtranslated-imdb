Yesterday I attended the world premiere of "Descent" at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York. I had a great time. All the main stars were sold out and attended, including my spacer partner Marcus Patrick. <br /> <br /> I give the movie 7.5 starts of 10 possible stars. <br /> <br /> The movie Begins with Maya (Rosario Dawson) at the university. You can imagine the typical atmosphere of the university with wild parties and flirting. The photography in this movie was excellent. She meets Jared (Chad Faust) and they become boyfriends. It appears like any other relationship at the beginning. The man is looking for the attention and affection of the woman and the woman is playing hard to get it. Both played this well. Very innocent flirting between the two. He invites her to his apartment and everything collapses. <br /> <br /> The apartment is very sad and dark. Eventually they end up in the basement, which is extremely dark and lit by numerous candles. This really reminded me of a dungeon. This is where it shows its true colors and proceeds to violate it. This is a very dark and gritty rape scene. This scene is not for the young or weak of heart. The rape scene is a bit long and difficult to take, but it is necessary for the rest of the movie that follows. <br /> <br /> Maya now begins to lose her soul for drugs and sex. She falls into her own abyss. She starts attending the wildest parties and wakes up one morning in a room with no memory of how she got there. They tell him to go see Adrian (Marcus Patrick). The first thing I remember about this character is that they say "he is the person who saves anyone who needs to save". He is actually the one who introduces Maya to drugs. They begin a dependency relationship that comes into play later in the movie. The scenes of the club at this point of the film are photographed with extreme experience. I thought they were fine and I realized that the director of photography was applauded at the end of the exhibition during the credits by the audience. <br /> <br /> Maya returned to the university as a technical assistant and who is in her class - Jared your rapist !! You could see the confusion and emotion on Maya's face. That I have to do?? What do I do next? The shots of his face and emotions are priceless. <br /> <br /> What develops next is not really what is happening. She acts interested in Jared. She seems to be looking to relive the relationship and be dating again. I was sitting there saying that this could really be happening. It was not Nothing could be further from the truth. <br /> <br /> She invites him to her apartment and, of course, appears. Now his apartment is dark and sandy. She has him undressing completely. Think you will have "luck". She then makes fun of him as any woman can. She is caressing him everywhere and he is getting excited. Note: for anyone who plans to watch this movie, this scene is a complete frontal nude; It may not be suitable for the younger viewer. <br /> <br /> Then, she changes the situation and becomes the beast and proceeds to rape. the. Once again, the scene is dark, sandy and very approximate. <br /> <br /> If you are going to watch the movie and do not want to know what happens next, skip this paragraph and continue until the last paragraph. <br /> <br /> This is where Adrian returns to the image. Maya has made Adrian save her (?) Performing extremely hard male sex with Jared. She thinks that this is the final revenge. Adrian continues to take all of Jared's manhood and stripped his dignity to nothing. Marcus, like Adrian, plays this scene as credible as anyone can. He is a strong actor who plays a strong character and strength appears on the entire screen. After the movie, during a question and answer session, Marcus explained that this scene required a lot of trust between him and Chad. Maya believes that this revenge will save her, but I do not think she will. One of the final scenes has a close-up of Mays's face and you see a tear rolling down her cheek. This was a fabulous close-up scene and evokes the constant discussion of anyone who is going to see this movie. Did she get the revenge she wanted? Was it as satisfying as she expected? In my opinion, it does not. It only makes things worse. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent movie, it will have well-interpreted roles and I recommend it to anyone who is thinking about going to see it. I would only doubt a little if I was less than 17 years old. Rosario, Chad and Marcus should be congratulated for the work well done. The address and the photograph must also be praised. It was a night that I enjoyed.
