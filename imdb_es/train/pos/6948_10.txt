The first time I saw this episode was like a shock to me, it was actually the first time I saw "24". The speed with which things are happening is amazing, and it's so amazing, exciting and even interesting, that it's almost like you're reading a book; Once you start it, it is very difficult to stop. From the moment that Richard Walsh was talking privately with Jack about the possibility that they had a mole inside the CTU, I was sitting at 6:40 am, which means 10 episodes! (It sounds funny and crazy, but I'm the kind of person who can not stop when interested) This series is one of the best in its class. And it is built in a way to have some different stories that are connected to each other. Recommended in every way!
