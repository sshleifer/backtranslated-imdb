I do not know how or why this movie has a low rating in IMDb. This film, accompanied by "I Curious: Blue" is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The only thing that will disappoint you in this movie is that if you do not like the process of the film, not like psychology or if you are expecting a violent pornographic attack. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie you want to watch to relax; It is a film that you want to see like any other masterpiece, with time, attention and care. <br /> <br /> ****** SUMMARY, IT CAN CONTAIN A SPOILER OR TWO ******* <br /> The main thing about this film is that it combines the whole movie inside a film, but he does it in such a way that sometimes he forgets that fictions are not real. <br /> <br /> The film is like many films in one: <br /> <br /> 1. A political documentary, about the social system in Sweden at that time. Which in many ways are still relevant for today. Interviews conducted by a young woman named Lena. <br /> <br /> 2. A narrative about a filmmaker, Vilgot Sjoman, making a film ... is about a relationship with his star in the film and how he should never have been involved with people with whom he is supposed to to work. <br /> <br /> 3. The movie that Vilgot is doing. This is a young woman named Lena (IE. # 2), who is young and very politically active, is making a documentary (IE. # 1). She is also coming of age and in her sexuality, and the freedom from that. <br /> <br /> The magnificence and brilliance of "I Curious: Yellow / Blue" is the way these three elements combine. At one point you're watching an interview about politics, and the next you're seeing what the interviewer is doing behind the scenes, but he does that so well that sometimes you forget what the narrative is. <br /> <br /> Another thing is the dynamic between "Yellow" and "Blue", that if you see one, you should see the other one. "Blue" is not a sequel at all. I will try to explain it as best I can because, as far as I know, no other film has done it, although it is a great technique. <br /> <br /> Think of "Yellow" as a living being, real events in 14 scenes A complete story. <br /> <br /> Think of "Blue" like all things BETWEEN the 14 scenes in "Yellow" that you did not see, it's a complete story by itself. <br /> <br /> Essentially they are parallel films ... the same story, told in two different ways. <br /> <br /> It was not until I saw the first 30 minutes of "Blue" that I did not understand "Yellow" <br /> <br /> I hope this has been useful for people who are discouraged by various influences , because this movie changed the way I saw it. <br /> <br /> Thanks for your time.
