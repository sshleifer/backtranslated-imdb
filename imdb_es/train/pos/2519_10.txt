This movie is really special. It is a very beautiful movie. What begins with three orphans, Sho, his brother Shinji and his friend Toshi, are poor children, live on the street, but one day they managed to steal a bag full of money, and then they can live, buy. A house, and his life seems to be much better. They are making new friends, friends of life. But something went wrong and they are becoming enemies and in the end they all end up killing each other. <br /> <br /> At first I was negative with this movie, because when the singers (Gackt - Solo, former singer at Malice Mizer, Hyde - soloist, singer at L'Arc ~ en ~ Ciel, both very famous in Japan and Wang Lee-Hom - Taiwanese singer) who try to become actors, but this is not like the other singers. -films. They are doing a great job and with no previous experience in movies (except for Lee-Hom, who had been in two movies before). <br /> <br /> This is absolutely one of my favorite movies. Maybe it's a bit because I'm a big fan of Hyde, but it was this movie that made me discover it. <br /> <br /> Well, Gackt (playing the main character - the orphan Sho) was a part of the group that wrote the script, and it was he who insisted that Hyde should play Sho's friend, the vampire Kei. At that time they did not know each other, at least not as friends. But after the movie they became very good friends, and that also shows us that they really worked hard on this film and that they had good cooperation. <br /> <br /> The movie has many different feelings in the story, Love, Hate, sadness, pain, loneliness, happiness and so on. I think the first hour is the best, it's so beautiful. After people are dying, Kei leaves and everything changes a lot. But it's still a great movie, it's the only movie that made me cry, it ends so sad, but still beautiful. <br /> <br /> So if you have not seen this movie, you really should. Because it's wonderful, but sad. You will not regret. ^^
