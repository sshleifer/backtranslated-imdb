This is one of the best drama and crime movies of the late nineties. It was filled with a great cast, a powerful story, and many of the players involved gave excellent performances. Pacino was great; I should have been nominated for something. John Cusack was also good, as long as the viewer does not mind his Louu-siana accent. It can be annoying if you can not stand this dialect. The way in which Pacino's character interacted with Cusack's character was believable, dramatic and slightly comical at times. Danny Aiello was magnificent as always. David Paymer was great in a supporting role. Bridget Fonda was good but not memorable. There were times when this image mentioned so many characters, probably too many. You can take a second observation to remember, "what Zapatti was which one?" After so many cross-references, one has to stop and think just to recap. The end did not have much sting. It was built for so long and then it was a bit disappointing. This was one of the few problems with the movie. Since the film was not cataloged like a great success of "great blockbuster", it caused that some forgot that this film even existed. Pacino and Aiello were great, but the lack of "splash" from the movie in the theaters may not have had any nominations. It was almost successful in the local market, and viewers are still learning that this title is available. Made in 1996, it still stands and will remain popular for many years. <br /> <br /> So prepare yourself a lemon pudding (you'll see) and watch this movie!
