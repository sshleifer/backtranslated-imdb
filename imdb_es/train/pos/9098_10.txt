Domestic importation was a great movie. I laughed all the time. It was fun on many levels, from the crazy outfits to the fun situations. The performance was great. Alla Korot, Larry Dorf, Howard Hesseman and everyone else did an amazing job. Because it is an independent film written by a writer for the first time, it does not have the clich√©s that are expected from other comedies, which was a great relief. It was unique and interesting and you fall in love with the characters and the moving story. I heard it was based on a real story? If so, then that is hilarious (and amazing!). I recommend this movie.
