['I rented this Netflix movie for two reasons: I was in the mood for what I thought would be a silly 1950s science fiction movie and because it is the first Superman movie. Needless to say, after about 15 minutes, I found myself completely engaged and very pleasantly surprised. <br /><br /> An experimental oil well has penetrated about six miles into the earth and the sponsor is closing it. Lois and Clark appear to get the scoop, but are disappointed that the deepest hole ever drilled will no longer be operational. A day later, the strange events at the well make it a more appropriate story for Superman than Clark Kent. It seems that radioactive Mole Men have invaded from their six-mile-deep home near the core of the earth. <br /><br /> Supermen and the Mole Men is a simplistic but well made piece of social realism. Launched in 1951, starring a leading actor who served in World War II, the moral of the story seems to be that Americans are as capable of becoming fascists as any other person. To take this point home in a typically simple Superman way, Reeves even accuses the lynch mob that persecutes Topos men of being &quot;Nazis&quot; at any given time. <br /><br /> Even in the 1950s, the science behind this movie was nonexistent. Six miles of drilling through the continental crust would not even have penetrated into the upper mantle, let alone into the &quot;hollow center of the earth,&quot; which, in any case, does not exist. Forgetful: keep in mind that this movie is based on a comic of the golden age. <br /><br /> The movie is a bit of uneven rhythm. While the Molemen are interesting, a little creepy and are very well represented, there are several scenes of Corman-esquire that spend too much time showing us in a redundant way their strange behavior. The script is smart and economical. By today&#39;s standards, the costumes are poor to fair, but at the time, the special effects and costumes of this movie were pretty good. The cinematography is also generally very good, and the acting is much better than one might expect. I was particularly impressed with Reeves, Jeff Corey and Walter Reed.']
