As part of the celebration of the launch of Casino Royale, this film with the new protagonist of Bond was shown by the director Roger Michell (Notting Hill). I almost turned it off for being a bit boring, but I'm glad I followed it. Basically, May (Anne Reid) is a single mother of Helen (Anna Wilson-Jones) who hardly sees anyone and has not had a boyfriend in years. Her daughter says she might want to marry her new boyfriend, Darren (of course, Daniel Craig). After meeting only a few days, May and Darren have a secret adventure. And at his age, with a 30 something, and the new Bond? Anyway, they obviously want to keep it a secret, but May repents and wonders if Helen will find out. When he does, Darren has fewer problems than May. In fact, Helen asks for permission to hit her. Also starring Peter Vaughan as Toots, Danira Govich as Au Pair, Harry Michell as Harry, Rosie Michell as Rosie and Oliver Ford Davies of Johnny English as Bruce. Very well!
