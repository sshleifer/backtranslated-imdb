It is not always easy to explain how a movie is, but this time I think I have found it. It reminded me of two films: Trainspotting (small-time criminals who wrote down some drugs and did stupid things in Schotland) and The Blair Witch Project (due to the filming style). <br /> <br /> It's about the loyalty between Two friends, one of them is getting out of jail, the other has not been captured yet. With a stolen vehicle, they drive through the Scottish countryside but run out of gas. While they try to find some fuel, they find a farm in the middle of nowhere. The farmer thinks they want to rob him and points a gun at one of them. That everything goes wrong. One of the friends accidentally shoots the farmer's daughter and they have to flee. What follows is a man who hunts through the fields and forests of Schotland. The two friends literally have to run to save their lives. <br /> <br /> Apparently this movie was filmed in only 12 days. Ok, that's not exactly amazing because most of this is always in the same place: the Scottish countryside, but I still find it quite surprising. Especially because this is not really a bad movie. It may not be the best movie in history, but you can still be proud of what you achieved. I had a great time watching it and in general I enjoyed the movie. I give it a 7/10.
