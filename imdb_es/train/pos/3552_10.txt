I just want to add my value of two cents and forgive myself if I'm repeating something that has already been published, but I think it's worth it to remind people of the genius of Damon Runyon. Without the wonderful streets, the hilarious writings of Damon Runyon, this film would never have been made, nor most of the other great classics dealing with players and similar things since before 1960. Damon Runyon worked as a journalist, and was from Colorado. but he sure got the street scene from the east coast. If you're not a fan of the old Hollywood comedies, I would recommend some other films from the writings of Damon Runyon; "Lemondrop Kid" and "Little Miss Marker" have Bob Hope, who, apart from his politics, has always been a fun man. (As a liberal on the west coast, his policy is also quite funny!) Damon Runyon lives!
