Anyone who has experienced the terrors of divorce will identify with the protagonist of this independent film, a frightened child who believes that a zombie is hiding in his closet. Is Jake (a hypnotizing Anthony DeMarco) simply "transferring" the trauma of two parents quarreling to an understandable picture? Or could the creature be real? Writer / director Shelli Ryan carefully balances both possibilities and keeps the audience guessing. Your choice to use an environment, a suburban home, adds to the feeling of despair and claustrophobia. <br /> <br /> Brooke Bloom and Peter Sean Bridgers are very convincing as angry but loving parents. However, they are the creepy minor characters, Mrs. Bender (Barbara Gruen), a deranged nanny and Sam Stone (Ben Bode), a shoddy realtor who remain in the mind. Jake's Closet is a childhood portrait of dark inspiration as a special kind of hell.
