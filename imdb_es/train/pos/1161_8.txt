It was an extremely low budget (in some scenes it seems that they were recorded with a homemade video recorder). However, it has a good plot and is easy to follow. 8 years after shooting her sexually abusive stepfather, Amanda is released from the psych ward, with the help of her doctor with whom she has a secret adventure. The doctor ends up renting a house and buying him a car. But within the first 20 minutes of the movie, Amanda kills him and buries him in his backyard. Then, she sees that her neighbor Richard looks at him and does not stop until she has it. She acts innocent, but after another neighbor, Buzz, discovered that Amanda killed that doctor and tried to assassinate Richards' wife, Laurie (this is after he and Amanda put him in the jacuzzi). Then he stops acting so innocent and kills Buzz and then tries to kill Richard, whom he supposedly loves and cares for. And you'll have to rent the movie to find out if Amanda dies or not. In general, a good movie reminds me of a large part of my life that you know that everything falls in love with your neighbor and does not stop at anything until you have it.
