Excellent endearing film with Peter Falk and Paul Reiser joining forces as father and father. <br /> <br /> Dad shows up one afternoon to declare that after more than 40 years of marriage, Mom (Olympia Dukakis) has left. <Br /> <br /> The rest of the film shows the father and son on a day trip to make dad's thoughts go away from what has happened. With them away, daughters can play detectives. <br /> <br /> The story shows the adventures of father and son in their discussion of life, what it should have been, why Mom complained about dad while discussing their life philosophies. <br /> <br /> We see an unexpected fishing trip and games in the pool that leads to a close fight. Both men seem to leave their daily lives. <br /> <br /> The ending is a disappointment as we learn why Mom left suddenly. It becomes a story of courage and the human spirit in the face of adversity. It is never too late to change.
