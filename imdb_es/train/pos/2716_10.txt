['Everything I remember was excellent ... excellent cast with Sam Waterston and George Innes (before it became more familiar to audiences in the US) ... excellent scripts as only English can do - Edwardian Sherlock Holmes / Lord Peter Wimsey / Albert Campion type mysteries, but with a touch of Jules Verne. Something like MacGyver would have been in England 80 years before ... just at the beginning of the twentieth century scientific / technological revolution. <br /><br /> I often wonder if the creators of MacGyver saw these programs. MacGyver was first broadcast about 3 years later. <br /><br /> I still have 1 episode on a very deteriorated tape.']
