As I had never heard of this movie until I saw the rental DVD I as somewhat skeptical, in the past there have been many movies with good set deals that can not do anything to film a bad script, and in some cases they do not seem . <br /> <br /> Well, I just saw it, there was no reason not to give this movie a theatrical premiere, it's good. History like most in this genre may seem a bit forced at times, but it seems that here too there is a good amount of realism that allows for momentum. I was pleasantly surprised by the good work that Justin Timberlake does here with such an important role, it's fine, it's not Oscar's material yet, but he will learn with each role and shows a LOT of promise for the future here. Dylan McDermott was also incredibly good in his unexpected and unpleasant role and is definitely the cream of the crop in this film. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, try it. You will not be disappointed, you will not get bored, in fact, I think you will be more than happy with the final result.
