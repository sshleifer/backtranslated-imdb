This is a very unusual movie since the star with the best brand does not appear literally halfway through the course. However, I was hooked with the Phantom Lady's hook. Curtis, although competent as the falsely accused Scott Henderson, seems a little hard to be understanding (perhaps he should have shaved his mustache) and his behavior when he returns home should have convinced the police at least to some extent of his innocence. . While another commentator had a problem with Franchot Tone as Jack Marlowe, I found that his representation of the character is impressive. He is not a common villain. The magnificent character actor Elisha Cook Jr. is back in top form as the 'little man with big ambitions'. Their drums in the musical numbers added a nice touch of eroticism. This film, however, is carried by the very capable and kind Ella Raines, since the devotee would be Henderson's lover, Carol Richmond. She definitely has talent and her presence on the screen is in the tradition of Lauren Bacall. This is the first of his work that I have seen and I am definitely inclined to see his other roles. The rest of the support cast is also more than competent. In general, it is a very satisfactory mystery of black cinema that, when seen today, fully transmits the dark and complex urban world to which it is destined. Recommended, 8/10.
