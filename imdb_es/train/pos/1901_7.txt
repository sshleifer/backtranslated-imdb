It's hard to put your finger on this. Basically, I suppose it is a comedy about a rich and inactive drunk who falls in love with a (comparatively) poor girl, with whom he wants to get married at the risk of being disowned by his family. <br /> <br /> Have fun moments Romantic moments and emotional moments. Dudley Moore is funny and somehow makes his egocentric nature endearing, Liza Minelli is a convincing conviction as the opposite fighter she attracts, but John Gielgud steals the show as Arthur's wonderfully sarcastic butler. <br /> <br /> It's cheesy but very funny with a memorable soundtrack, and ran for almost 3 months at our local fleapit.
