I grew up with this as my favorite movie of all time. The special effects are incredible for the time, and they won prizes. I can remember the dialogue as if I had heard it yesterday. It is simply a great timeless adventure. The music is by Miklos Rosza, who is the best in the history of cinema. Sabu is the thief. Conrad Veidt is the great villain. I have a copy within reach, for the next trip down memory lane. Whoa there! Rex Ingram wants to get out of his bottle genius!
