['This is undoubtedly one of the best movies I&#39;ve seen in my life. The first time I saw him he was about 9 or 10 years old. I started looking at some point before the rape scene. And when I saw it, I was very surprised to think &quot;What kind of sick movie is this?&quot;. Today I have seen it from the beginning and I really understood how great this film is. It is exciting, frightening, shocking and, in its own unique, disturbing way. But the best of all is the end where the audience is shown that this experience will chase the characters for the rest of their lives. It will torture their conscience and worry about the rest of their lives for the bodies that are in that river. And there&#39;s nothing you can do about it, it&#39;s something you have to live with. This ending is one of the most unhappy endings in the history of cinema and is very intelligent, brilliant and horrible. <br /><br /> And the acting is also great, especially Jon Voight and Burt Reynolds. Gorgeous performance in this movie. All in all, John Boorman has created one of the best movies in film history based on Dick Chaney&#39;s novel. A must for all movie lovers.']
