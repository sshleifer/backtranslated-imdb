Mark Frechette plays Mark, a radical leftist of the university. Mark is accused of killing a policeman during a riot on campus, and flees into the desert. He does it by stealing a small plane at the local airport, and he flies it himself. <br /> <br /> Once he flies over the desert, Mark sees a car from the air. A young woman named Daria goes out and sees Mark spinning around on the plane. Mark passes the plane very low several times, which causes Daria to bend or be hit.

But with Mark evading the law, they realize that he needs to keep running. So the brief quote from Mark and Daria is quite moving, as it does not become a true romance. <br /> <br /> Zabriski Point was the Eraserhead of the early 70s.

A few years after arriving at Zabriski Point, Frechette stole a bank in real life. While serving his prison sentence, Mark died an ignoble death. He was killed by a 150-pound weight, which fell on him when he was lifting weights. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie was the splendid cinematography and the special visual effects. The incredible slow motion scenes of debris floating in the air after an explosion were a stroke of genius.

I recommend it, for those who like the avant-garde films that show the agitation, of early youth rebellion the 70
