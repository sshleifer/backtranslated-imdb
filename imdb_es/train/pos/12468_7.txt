Okay, this movie starts as a cheesy movie for life and does not improve until almost through the movie. The script is full of "cheese" and "fluff" and the cast is not well directed for the most part. During the first half of the movie, the girl irritated my nerves. I do not think this is one of his best works as an actor. The only reason I bought the movie is because it was for sale and I had Ellen Burstyn in it. She is great, but this is not one of her best acting performances either. The story is based on real events and that helps the movie. Actually, at first I did not even like the movie and I was disgusted when I saw the still images of the balloon traveling, I mean ... that it gets to where it's supposed to go and ends with that! But everything is forgiven when it reaches its destination and the story comes to an end. If this does not bring a tear to your eye, nothing will! It's cheesy and predictable, but it also makes you feel good about the world again.
