If you're a T-Rex / Marc Bolan fan, I recommend you look at it. It shows a capricious side of Marc Bolan as well as Ringo Starr, who apparently have a great time shooting some of the scenes that are not part of the concert, but which are fun to watch, which leaves you with the feeling of knowing them as Solo people, and when the concert is shown, a talented, playful and professional musician who is cool and seems to impress the screaming girls. When you see him in a concert, you would never know that being a rock star is a job, but having a good time playing some great songs with some good friends, like Elton John and Ringo Starr that appear in some of the live performances. It is true that some songs that I would like to have seen there are missing, but as in any album, it can not have everything. I just bought this in 2006, but if I had known it came out in 1972, I would definitely have bought it years ago. Sad and strange that a man with so many songs about his love for cars, would never learn to drive and die in a car accident!
