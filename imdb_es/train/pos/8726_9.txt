Now this is what a family movie should be! There are few films of recent years that have been directed to families or children that really are worthy of their television audience; but this is one of them. My whole family moved away from the film, amazed, entertained, dazzled and happy. We are still quoting small anecdotes from here and there. The children LOVED it and we too (Hubbie and I have 36 and 32, respectively)! <br /> <br /> Apart from its beautiful and surprising animation, the characters (small as they can be, and imaginary as they are) are very well developed. There is not one of them you can not empathize with. The personalities that give life to these little creatures are well-cast voices, combined with the skill and art of some of Disney's best entertainers. This is a film worthy of Walt Disney, himself. I think Mr. Disney would wholeheartedly approve this new movie ... Flick, Dot and his fellow little heroes can become as popular as Mickey and Minnie in our time. <br /> <br /> This is one of the family comes out of the theater wanting to see again .. and buy to buy on video or DVD. I'm anxious to see him again ... to pick up what he might have missed the first time. (I've never seen my children so vividly identify with the characters and hug them ... my daughter is still talking about the little "Point".) <br /> <br /> This movie is fun, moving, intelligent and great . Fun for all the family!
