['It was once suggested by Pauline Kael, never a fanatic, that Cassavetes thought not as a director, but as an actor. What Kael meant was his supposed lack of sophistication as a filmmaker; to take that comparison even further, for me, it never feels as if Cassavetes was directing himself in a movie, it feels as if Cassavetes were implanted within his own creation, like Orson Welles. Cassavetes is as genius as Welles, but much more important than a true artist (unlike a technician or rhetorician). This is like a cross between Italian passion (although Cassavetes was actually Greek) and Scandinavian introversion. Never before have the inner demons been so physically exposed. <br /><br /> It is about the mystery of becoming, acting and acting. Like a haunted Skip James record, it has the echo of ghosts everywhere. The breakdowns of Rowlands, which are amazing and almost operatic, surprisingly coming from Cassavetes, are accompanied by a disturbing and disturbing piano. Who is this dead girl? The metaphysical possibilities are endless, and it is amazing to find this kind of thing in a Cassavetes movie, only the manifest display of intelligence (there is also a bit of a voiceover at the beginning). But then, he was always smart, he just never stirred him to praise him easily. This is not &quot;Adaptation&quot;; Here, the mixture of reality and fiction and drama is not to show intelligence but to show the internal confusion and confusion that it creates. <br /><br /> There is too much to do. Pure and cheerful love when Rowlands greets his porter; the horror when she hits herself ... The scene in which the girl talks about how she dedicated her life to art and music is one of the most effective demonstrations of understanding what it means to be a fan of someone. You can see some roots of this in &quot;A Star Has Been Born&quot;, and Almodovar borrowed it for &quot;All About My Mother&quot;. I think the ending is a bit disappointing due to the fits of laughter, but the preparation that leads there is almost disgusting. (You can shoot me, but I think that alcoholism, despite its urgency in many of the scenes, is a relatively small point about the film). <br /><br /> It&#39;s a living thing, it breathes, and it feels like a process: it could go in any direction at any time. Like &quot;Taste of Cherry&quot;, we are reminded that &quot;you should never forget that this is just a work&quot;. However, it is dangerous: when Rowlands says that line, is it a great drama? How will the audience take it? Are you being reflective or just do not care? His breakdowns (of the characters) are incorporated into the performances, and ultimately into the film, in such a way that it is like watching a woman James Dean. 10/10']
