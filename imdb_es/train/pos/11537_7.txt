Neil Simon had an ability for dialogue and nowhere is this more evident than the lines he gives to WALTER MATTHAU and JACK LEMMON as opposite types in THE ODD PARE, a mix of comedy and sadness that depends entirely on the credibility of two Such incompatible friends who share an apartment. <br /> <br /> Lemmon is the neatnik Felix Ungar, committed suicide after divorcing his wife and reluctantly agreed to share an apartment with Oscar Madison (Matthau) with somewhat disastrous results. It seems that everything that Felix says and makes Oscar go up the wall and neither can stand the other's habits, with Oscar being the most unpleasant man you can imagine and Felix the exact opposite. <br /> <br /> The funniest scene for me was when the laughter The sisters pigeons in the apartment above visit them at a dinner party. The inestimable interaction between Lemmon, Matthau and Carole Shelley and Monica Evans is enough to put stitches. The talented Pigeon sisters are the girls who heard the voices of the Gabble Sisters (a couple of geese) in Disney's THE ARISTOCATS, and here, their comedic timing with Lemmon's sad story of despair is enough to make the movie come back hilarity. -where he stays most of the time. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Neil Simon and have enjoyed other screen treatments of his work, this should not be missed. Matthau and Lemmon have a perfect cast (although they considered exchanging roles before the shooting began) and, of course, it's easy to see why it became a first-rate TV show later on. <br /> <br /> Summing up: Simon's Comedy Top, which should not be missed.
