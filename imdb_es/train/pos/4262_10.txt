['I saw him as many times as I could before he left the scene. A lovely and entertaining movie with some of my favorite stars. I just wish I could find him again! I would definitely buy it / see it if I could. Please, someone, bring it to me. Fred MacMurray was perfect in his role as patriot during World War II, and his main ladies, Joan Leslie, and especially June Haver, were beautiful and charming. It was a musical, but also romantic, fun and intelligent. This was my favorite movie starring June Haver, although I always liked it. His dazzling smile illuminated the screen, and his beauty and talent were an asset to any movie. The support cast lent credence to their individual roles. A well balanced and cheerful film; I just wish we had more like him!']
