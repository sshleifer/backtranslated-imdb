This is a true story of an Australian couple who is accused of murder when their baby disappears. Meryl Streep is excellent, as always, and manages to maintain our interest even though she plays a character that is not particularly nice. <br /> <br /> The media frenzy surrounding this case in Australia resembles that of Sam Sheppard. Case of murder in Ohio during the 1950s. These real-life situations show that the media, in fact, can affect the way a criminal case is handled. I remember well the Cleveland Plain Dealer with a huge headline that says "Why is not Sam Sheppard in jail?". The prosecutor finally succumbed to this relentless pressure, and Sheppard was tried and convicted. Only after years in prison was he exonerated. <br /> <br /> I love movies that tell a real story, make them in an interesting way and represent an important point in the process. This is one of those movies. Other good movies that tell the story of innocent people accused of crimes include "Hurricane", "The Thin Blue Line" and "Breaker Morant". In particular, the latter is another Australian film that is highly recommended. <br /> <br /> 8/10
