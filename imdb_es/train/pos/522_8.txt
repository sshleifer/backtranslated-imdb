A wonderful movie by Powell and Pressburger, whose work I now want to explore more. The film is about what we perceive as real and what is real, and how the two can be so difficult to distinguish. Beautifully filmed and acted, although David Niven does not seem to be 27 years old, as his character says. Fun to see a very young Richard Attenborough. This movie made me think, while I was watching it, and later.
