I loved this soap. It has been one of my favorites. I strongly recommend :) ... I love Brazilian soaps, they deal with real life events. I'm really sad because the soap is over, but I'm sure I can find it somewhere. For those of you who have not seen it, please see it. I loved the characters, the plot and how things ended for the villains. The only thing that would have changed is the end for Xica and her love for life. I can not wait to see it again and I highly recommend it. Xica has been, by far, the best soap I've seen in my life. Forget everything else :) GO XICA .. I hope everyone likes it too.
