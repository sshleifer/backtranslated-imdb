As the B films progressed, I was well above average (I warn the reader now that I can reveal certain key elements of the plot or other parts of the movie, although I am trying to minimize any tendencies). As the sequels are often, it was absolutely fantastic (despite a "cookie cutter" approach to trying to copy certain elements of the original movie.) Despite this sometimes tedious tendency, it seemed to work in this particular movie, provided that the viewer could Divide their attention from the comparisons with the original "Scanners". <br /> <br /> The film was similar to the "Superman" series, in terms of the description of the main character of his early childhood and the relationship with his parents (who seemed to follow the same model as Kents in the "Superman" stories) and the theme of a morally pure hero who possessed extraordinary powers from an early age, etc. The description of deep feelings of alienation from prodigies or Form children, adolescents and / or adults was a theme that reminded me of films like "Real Genius" and (in a more superficial level) "Doctor Mordrid" and played a particularly strong chord e. <br /> <br /> The movie had a positive message. E, and it was fun to watch. I found some of the ideas and accuracy (in terms of representing certain aspects of paranormal experiences) fascinating, and even deeply moving at times. These moments occasionally appeared from among all the big fanatics of formulas and free sex (quality, in this case, how sexual elements were made with good taste) and the violence that makes B movies (or Shakespeare's plays) , Really!) Be very important. Fun to watch! <br /> <br /> This is a mandatory watch for all comics, science fiction, "remote viewing" enthusiasts and horror fans! With the correct exposure in the right circles, the film could develop a large number of cult followers, along with the original "Scanners".
