OK, here is my personal list of the best Nicktoons shows like today: <br /> <br /> 1. All adult pants / Spongebob <br /> <br /> 2. My life as a teenage robot < br /> <br /> 3. Invader Zim <br /> <br /> 4. CATSCRATCH / Rugrats <br /> <br /> Note a word with only capital letters? That means that this is Nick's program that I'm going to talk about. <br /> <br /> "Catscratch" is basically a simple but great animated comedy about three well-off cats, Mr. Blik, Gordon and Waffles, who receive in rare and REALLY surreal situations, from trying to join the slumber party of Human Kimberely for root beer to save a planet of slugs from the evil spaceship. This is a Nick show that will simply tickle the funny bone sooner or later! The theme song is catchy and memorable. Voice actors, including Wayne Knight from the "Seinfield" franchise, bring the characters to life with very extravagant personalities. The stories are nice (fan episodes would be "King of All Root Beer" and "Gordon's Lucky Claw"). And the humor is all done in some Jim Earthworm style. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, "Catscratch" is one of the Nicktoons series, like "Invader Zim" and "MLAATR", which becomes very, very popular all over the world in just 3 seasons or less.
