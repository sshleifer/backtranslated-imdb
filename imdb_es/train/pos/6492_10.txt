I'm not a very good writer, so I'm going to be brief. World at War is the best documentary of the Second World War I've seen. I have seen different World War II documentaries (not only English / North American) and this documentary seems to be the most complete World War II documentary I have seen. I think I could talk a bit more about the Great Depression and why / how Hitler came to power, but he does a very good job of covering the war. It seems to be complete and objective / fair for everyone. It does not exaggerate or diminish the roles of different nations. It has a lot of original images, which include color images and many eyewitnesses (it was done in the 70s when many more were alive). He has good music and a narrator. All-in-All I gave this 10/10, because it's very good. (I have not seen special offers on the DVD version, so I can not comment on them)
