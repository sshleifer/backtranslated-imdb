This was a great movie that had many underlying problems. These were questions of mischief and class. But, he also had a message to know himself and take responsibility for himself. This movie was very deep, it gave you the message that you and only you can control your destiny. He also showed that knowing yourself and feeling comfortable with who you are is the only way you will fit into society. What others think of you is not important. I think this movie did a wonderful job of showing it. The actors that I think were able to convey each character wonderfully. I just thought it was amazing how deep this movie really was. Just by looking sideways, you would not see how deep the film is, but if you look further, you'll see the main meaning of the movie.
