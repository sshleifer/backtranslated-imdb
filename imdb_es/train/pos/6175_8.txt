I saw this pilot when he showed up for the first time, and I'm sure that countless "Spirit" fans hate him because, like Batman, the Green Hornet, etc., he took the character to the "camp" address. But obviously I never got tired of Batman, because I thought it was entertaining, somehow, in the same way we showed it. There are two parts that stay with me. First, when Denny's partner has been mortally wounded, and he delivers a dramatic speech about how he always defended the law and obeyed the exact letter of it. Then, he says something like: "Boy, I was stupid!" What is his way of telling Denny to become a vigilante, what he does (although he is the type of TV Batman). Then there is the scene in which he tries to seduce the villain so that she lets him go kissing her, but she is not deceived, because he is too honest to kiss her convincingly! This was a great example of "camp," which was also "underestimated," by both the actor and the actress.
