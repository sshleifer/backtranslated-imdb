Certainly, there is an emotion between the two main characters as they explore their relationship, one based primarily on physical attraction from the start. And there is also emotion in the inner workings of the Mathieu family that deals with their mother's problems, and how that affects their relationship. But the problem is that it leaves many things unanswered (unless it's too silly to catch them). Why is Mathieu in a psychiatric hospital? What led to the breakup of the boys? And the flicker between the present and the past is a bit difficult to follow at the beginning. It seems that the main reason to rent this movie is to enjoy some homoerotic vicarious emotions, or some male nudity. But as a love story or a study of the character is deficient and unsatisfactory.
