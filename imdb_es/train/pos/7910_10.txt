When this came out for the first time, my dad took him home. We were very surprised It was very different from everything we had seen before. Last night I was looking for a specific movie and I found 'The Eye of the Mind' again. The box is falling apart, and I'm surprised the tape still works! Although it's not about 'Looking for Nemo' quality graphics, it's still very good. They should sell this again, it's a milestone for computer animation images. Highly recommended!
