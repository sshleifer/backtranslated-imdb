This was just broadcast on the BBC and I am absolutely delighted to have seen it. As the credits went, only the cast made sure that I would try. After only five minutes, I was completely immersed in this beautiful film. <br /> <br /> Yes, it was a formula and it was predictable, but that somehow added to its charm. The flashbacks of the forties were placed beautifully and captured an equal feeling in few productions. <br /> <br /> A true movie to feel good, marked with outstanding music. When it's released, I'll buy it!
