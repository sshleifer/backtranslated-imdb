Having reviewed some of the other comments here, I have a major complaint with this presentation. <br /> <br /> The two main characters are attractive in their own way: the beautiful "victim" and the handsome, obviously extremely "off-center", the blue-collar protagonist (even if it is not the "totally deviant" ") - they take turns to win over each other, a kind of Caucasus Kabuki stage. <br /> <br /> This is fine, and this is, of course, mainly a "turn of the tables" story. The complaint is that I believe the director was caught up in his desire to show Farrah's known and obvious physical attributes, starting with his attractive attire in a thin tunic and a series of scenes that show more than is necessary for any dramatic effect, although They are immensely pleasing to the eyes, they distract from the level of drama's poignancy. <br /> <br /> Their roommates, I am sure they offer performances as they are written and directed, however, their respective skepticism and babbling and sobs his Trionics do not sound true, according to Farrah's previous experience with this boy, the obvious evidence that he has come to his Locals with only the worst intentions, and that he would have absolutely no reason to exaggerate what happened. <br /> <br /> But this is a film and a story, so convincing in spite of, as because of, The director's job.
