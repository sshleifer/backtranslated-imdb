It seemed that the year 1984 was not the Orwellian nightmare that was calculated with George Orwell's science fiction novel! 1984 turned out to be one of the happiest moments in the history of the United States! The resurgence of the economy and the resurgence of basic American values ​​cultivated an idealistic aura of resumption of innocence, which was viewed by the American people with a very auspicious disposition. There have been many versions of classic movies in the past, but originals are almost always considered superior. "Purple Rain" is a movie in this category! Made in 1984, "Purple Rain" provided a doggerel of the eighties, music of carefree quality, which they incorporated into the making of this excellent film. Certain artifacts indicative of the eighties are in fact classics! Comedies of fuss, clothes with neon accents, and of course, music! The music of the eighties is considered by experts as the best decade for music in the history of the United States! Located in Minneapolis, "Purple Rain" allowed the use of naive entertainment with the changing times of the city. When I was little, I lived in Minneapolis for about eight months, at that time, the non-white population was less than 3%. By 1984, African-Americans had made some on the roads to Minneapolis, and, therefore, they also established a firmly embedded culture of their own !! The film "Purple Rain" evokes a style of clothing from the eighties and a set of music that effortlessly captivated the audience of the film. I loved the music of "Purple Rain", and, the innovative approach of this film for the success of confrontation, is really brilliant! Watch this movie if you have not seen it yet !! Prince became an icon of the eighties with this masterpiece !! For a short time, he went out with Kim Bassinger, he must be doing something right! "Purple Rain" put Prince on the map! This film gets my emphatically assertive verdict from THUMBS UP !!!!
