If you are a fan of Chuck Norris or Judson Mills or both, then this is the movie to watch. It has a lot of adventure. It's a great follow-up for President's Man. The chemistry between the three main stars (Chuck Norris, Judson Mills, Jennifer Tung is amazing.) My personal opinion.This movie, along with the original, has worked so well, that networks should consider converting it. In a regular series If you've seen President's Man, I recommend this movie for you If you've seen President's Man: A Line In The Sand but you have not seen President's Man, let me suggest you do it. two.
