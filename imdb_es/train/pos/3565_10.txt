['Guys and Dolls is a unique work based on the characters. Sky masterson <br /><br /> (Marlon Brando) is a high class player who takes a bet with Nathan Detroit (Frank Sinatra) for a thousand dollars. Nathan needs the money so he can <br /><br /> Run your usual shit game and make a fortune. The bet was that Sky could not take any girl to Havana, Cuba and the &quot;doll&quot; she chose was Sarah <br /><br /> Brown (Jean Simmons) who was in charge of a missionary. Sky finally bribes <br /><br /> Sarah enough to go to Havana with him. They end up falling in love with each other, but then she accuses him of something he did not participate in. Nathan ran a dice game on the missionary the night they left. Nathan&#39;s 14-year-old fiancee, Adelaide (Vivian Blaine), disapproves of Nathan&#39;s play and tries to stop him from doing it. However, when the movie ends everything ends happily with a double <br /><br /> Wedding. <br /><br /> The songs in this movie are wonderful no matter who sings them. Marlon <br /><br /> Brando has no voice to sing and it is true that they could have nicknamed him, but it did not really matter. He did a wonderful job as an actor (obviously, since he is Brando) and played his character very well. I&#39;ve seen some movies with Jean Simmons and I thought that this movie was the weakest, and could not <br /><br /> sing to all However, the song is composed by Frank Sinatra, Vivien Blaine and Stubby Kaye. Vivien Blaine and Stubby Kaye were also in the original <br /><br /> Broadway production of Boys and Dolls. Vivien Blaine had a great voice and was the perfect Adelaide. If you like the musical, and even if not, I advise you to see this.']
