I know that originally, this movie was NOT a blockbuster, but in the light of the latest Hollywood releases (most of which have been decidedly loaded with formulas, it draws less, it does not make sense, "guarda-la-rubia- girl-no-matter- that "silly", Feast of All Saints, certainly in this unfortunate context deserves a second opinion.The film, like the book, loses its anchorage in some of the historical antecedents, but describes a dilemma exclusively American against the American institution of human slavery, the only one in its totality, and some of its tragic consequences (and fun and moving). <br /> <br /> And worth noting is the young Robert Ri'chard, elected as the main character, Marcel, whose idealistic enthusiasm is truly universal, as he demonstrates at the beginning of his "coming of age", only to be cruelly disappointed with what turns out to be his true education in the roads of the plantation world of southern Louisiana, at the apex of the pre-war period. When I saw Ri'chard's previews of blond hair (feared), I expected a buffoon, a fop, a caricature, I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee, the latest Ben Vereen, Pam Grier, Victoria Rowell and even Jasmine Guy lend vivid images and formidable skill as actors in the background tapestry, tack, voodoo, "aristocracy" criolla and the Haitian revolt woven into this story of human passion, hatred, love and family. and the racial perplexity in a society that supposedly has gone away and, nevertheless, somehow is still with us.
