Gundam Wing for me is a good anime. A bit of slow movement (especially around the middle of the series), but above all nice. Now, before someone jumps on my case and calls me "extreme", I must admit that I have seen all the original Gundam, Gundam 0080 and 0083, The 08th MS Team and Gundam SEED. <br /> <br /> I admit that there were some problems with storytelling and that some characters seem to be "scams" (ie Zechs Marquise to the original Gundam Char), but this is a show of the alternative universe based on the original series. how is SEED? <br /> <br /> If you want to watch this series, be sure to first see the original Gundam and then know that you are viewing an AU series.
