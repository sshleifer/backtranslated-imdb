['Let me state from the beginning that I have cerebral palsy and I entered this film expecting to have to make concessions for the main performance. I left the theater half convinced that they had chosen an actor who had cerebral palsy on paper, even though I knew that was not the case. The performances were generally excellent, with a special nod to Brenda Fricker and Hugh O&#39;Conner (I think that&#39;s her name) as the young Christy Brown. Christy is talented, shameless, arrogant, sometimes vulgar and petulant, in other words, human. This film, along with Gaby: A True Story and the documentary King Gimp, are excellent portraits of life with CP. In no way is it a complete portrait, but good examples of the disabled as human beings. Highly recommended']
