A young woman who survives as a prostitute. <br /> <br /> A cheap scammer who wants to get the big score. <br /> <br /> They are in Thailand. You may think that by the initial titles it will be a violent movie, but it is also a love story with two people in their own struggle to get the money for a better way of life. This movie feels like an essay sometimes due to its image changes, but it's still refreshing. This story is also about Eros and Thanatos. "It's not an original joke, but it's well told," says one character, and that also applies to this: we've seen the story but in this way we see it. Thailand appears in warm tones, and photography goes from one color to a multicolored place. And capture the city as the cage of these imperfect people. There is also a good use of music to splash actions.
