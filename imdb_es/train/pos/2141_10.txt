Masayuki Suo, who directed this good movie, is on paper. After the decent "Fancy Dance" and the classic university sumo comedy "in Japan", Shiko Funjatta, Suo has followed his own huge steps with overwhelming success. <br /> <br /> The story is captivating. We both laugh often (Naoto Takenaka is hilarious, since it's in Suo's two previous films) and he really takes pride in the characters. But for me, the big advantage is the aspect that this film gives the viewer in Japanese society: real life in Japan. Suo has a gift for showing real life activities with an entertaining style. The result is a movie that will attract you, make you laugh, make you think and entertain you and give you an idea of ​​Japan today. <br /> <br /> He also searches for the 8 main actors of Shiko Funjatta, as they all appear again in various roles, from supporting characters (Takenaka) to short cameos (many).
