['Why a stupid, boring and despicable series of movies like &quot;Star Wars&quot; gets all the hype, and a truly amazing movie like this goes totally unnoticed ... it&#39;s beyond me ... This movie will really open your eyes to the dark, disturbing, sad and terrifying world in which we live ... <br /><br /> Unlike the dull &quot;Elephant,&quot; this movie is not one of those &quot;just a typical day until someone pulls the trigger.&quot; This film focuses more on what happens AFTER the event ... <br /><br /> Deana, played by the very hot and very talented Erika Christensen, is a happy and healthy heterosexual student with great friends and a great life ... until ... she is injured the day of the shooting, when she is shot. the head ... Fortunately she is not killed, but she is seriously injured and has to be in the hospital for a while, which causes her a lot of emotional pain, in addition to the physical ... <br /><br /> Meanwhile, Alicia, played by the also very beautiful and talented Busy Phillips, is an unpleasant, cold, rebellious and antisocial goth girl who does not have a single positive trait in her ... and is unharmed when the shooting happens ... because it turns out that she was FRIENDS with the shooter and she knew he was going to do what he did ... what makes her take her to the police station and ask her some questions ... When she refuses to tell him , if she knew that the shooting was going to happen, they would come constantly to her house to try to convince her to say something ... and she still does not, so the school principal makes her attend a funeral of one of the dead students, and after she leaves in that ... the director decides that it is enough and forces her to visit Deana in the hospital. Of course, she also refuses to do it, but the director says that if Alicia does not do this, the cops will keep trying to get her to say something ... and so she goes to her ... <br /><br /> The lonely, traumatized and wounded physically and emotionally, Deana is more than happy that someone visits her, but, of course, Alicia is something BUT happy to see her ... Deana tries to give her a friendly welcome, but of course, Alicia responds with nothing but harsh and hurtful comments and a harsh statement about how she is only here because they are forcing her, and she has no intention of being friendly with her at all. But sooner or later, that intention will change ... (and that&#39;s all I&#39;ll say :) This is really one of the most moving movies in history, as well as one of the darkest and most disturbing. Actually, I think I would tie this with &quot;American History X&quot; as equally disturbing and touching at the same time ... <br /><br /> WARNING: Watch this movie at your own risk! It contains VERY graphic scenes and images! Excellent and criminally underestimated movie! I feel so embarrassed that I am practically the only one who knows it!']
