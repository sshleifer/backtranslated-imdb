I finally saw this classic TV movie on an unofficial record recorded from an old VHS, it's a classic piece of horror. It's a shame more than this corner of careless horror in terms of official releases on DVD and VHS ... the horror movie for television. Recommended for all fans of the television movie of the 70s, like the trilogy of terror. Those interested should get the book on the subject of David Deal - Television Fright Films of the 70's. Send me an email to have the opportunity to see it ... it's great to see it again. <br /> <br /> It has problems, like many TV movies that have to be quite inventive in the effects department and even in 70 minutes it may seem to drag, possibly we are all used to the most modern edition, but we are still excellent and much better than many of the theatrical highlights released today.
