Made by the French brothers Jules and Giddeon Naudet, and narrated by Robert De Niro and firefighter James Hanlon, this is a heartwarming and heartbreaking story of how the best of New York shone on the darkest day. I saw it for the first time when I was a 12 year old naive girl, and at that age it still moved me. Knowing how serious September 11 was, seeing this expanded the whole effect of September 11th. We were discovering who the heroes were, how the daily lives were composed and how they risked their lives in a situation in which most people simply ran and were saved. These brave men risk their lives and seeing this only increases my admiration for them. Look if you can, this is the best documentary I've seen personally.
