This comedy with a lot of pain and underlying sadness succeeds where most others fail. There have been many films of this genre with more notable actors trying to achieve this elusive mix that has not approached either the depth or the dexterity of this. This is probably because the exceptional cast with outstanding performances by Reg Rogers and Ally Sheedy seems so spontaneous that the reality of their characters quickly captures their interest and their emotions and keeps them throughout the film. At first, the action seems quite outlandish and far-fetched, but one gradually learns that these two pathetic, badly damaged people are trying desperately and unwillingly to heal themselves, albeit reluctantly, one from the other. Rogers's heartrending facial expressions of drowsy pain and Sheedy's outbursts are so eloquent that one feels them as one observes them. He will worry about these two nice people but they suffer a lot and he hopes that they will succeed because he is in doubt and everything depends on a tenuous emotional thread. Hopefully audiences can see more of Reg Rogers and Ally Sheedy as this film demonstrates its merit as very successful actors, beyond all doubt.
