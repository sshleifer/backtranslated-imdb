I remember when I first saw him, I was really laughing so hard, that as with many other movies I've seen, no sound came out! Curly is really great in the opera "singer" in this, I'm surprised he has not considered a career as a professional singer, because he was really good! <br /> <br /> If you noticed, this was filmed near the end of Curly's career as a Stooge, you could really say he had changed, because he had lost weight and was thinner, his voice was deeper , his face was lined with wrinkles, although he could still achieve it, it looked like he was fifty years old at the age of forty. This was because he suffered many minor blows before his big stroke that ended his career. He still managed to achieve it in his last! <br /> <br /> If you do not mind the fact that Curly was really very sick at the moment, this is one of her funniest shorts. I know I did not care about the fact that Curly was really changing, because he still thought it was great! <br /> <br /> 10/10
