This was, without doubt, the most disturbing movie I've ever seen. The first part of the film, although strange, has a light and fun quality. The trip begins with such a peaceful note, which details and highlights the beauty of the Appalachia hills. But that is deceptive beyond belief. The obvious social problems (endogamy) and the deformities of the inhabitants of the countryside are only the first disturbing aspects of the film. I can still hear Bobby moan in pain, and I shudder at the thought. Lewis's leg made me shudder. However, although the film was, in general, very disturbing and distressing, it posed some interesting questions. When is it moral or right to take the life of another individual? What can morality do or not do in some cases? And are dignity and moral integrity more important than life itself? Whatever conclusions one may draw from the film, it is an achievement in itself (despite certain aspects that were terribly real and frightening).
