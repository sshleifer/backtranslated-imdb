This is a movie to feel good and nothing more. And for that, it's very fun to watch. Of course, it borders on political issues. And that? I'm sure she was not trying to make 'Good night and good luck' here. Let's not try to do anything other than what it is ... light food. <br /> <br /> And very nice in that! <br /> <br /> Do we remember how it was 1984? According to the media, we have become very sophisticated about what we see or do not see. I tend to differ at this point. Goldie knew that this was fun, and he went ahead and did it. <br /> <br /> As its lightest rate: Protocol, Boat, Housewives, Wildcats, Private Benjamin, It seems like the old days, Foul play, Death becomes it, First Wives Club and the remake From Out-of-Towners, GOLDIE knows what she's doing ... play all the roles for the camp that you can avoid! Goldie knows herself very well and knows what she can do really well. <br /> <br /> He has always made me laugh with joy and innocence. I loved her in Laugh-In and all the things she's been in. He has never tried to be anything other than who he is ... and that is the girl next door who is very pretty and has a smile. and a laugh that will always make me want and will remind me that life is quite short and that you should simply be happy because before you know it ... you are old, wrinkled and suffer from one of the inevitable diseases of life. If you arrive so late. <br /> <br /> I appreciate Goldie for what she is: a comical and kind actress.
