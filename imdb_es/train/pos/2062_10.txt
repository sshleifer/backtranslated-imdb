First of all, I'll be the first to admit that the scarecrow is a bit exaggerated. An attenuated scarecrow, perhaps less acrobatic, would have made this film much less corny. But overall I think it's one of the best series movies. Tiffany Shepis is absolutely wonderful, not to mention incredibly beautiful. Although this film lacks the important nudity factor, there are several other movies to watch it. But here it gets all evil, especially towards the end, as it moves away from the scarecrow engulfed. Also Richard Elfman does a great job as a sheriff and as a drunken boyfriend. Yes, it's a low budget B movie. But of all the ones I've seen, this is definitely one of my best favorites.
