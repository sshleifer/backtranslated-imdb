I saw it subtitled as it was in Russian, but I really enjoyed it. The main character of Sasha was born cursed, with a deadly weapon as an extension of his body. He lived his whole life unhappy because he was different and because anger made him do mortal things. <br /> <br /> When Sasha finally found love in a young girl named Katya, everyone tried to take her away from him, ending in a deadly battle. There was a good amount of blood, but not too much for the weak with the stomach. <br /> <br /> Not for people who like the old Hollywood movie, but for those who enjoy independent films. Kinda had the feeling of an Asian fantasy movie.
