There was not a dry eye among the audience yesterday afternoon after I left the cinema, after having seen this movie jewel in a house sold as part of this year's Hamburg Film Festival. And the tears shed were laughter. This movie was hilarious, there is no other way to say this. There was nothing boring, I really laughed and with me, all the others, three hundred lovers of the French cinema. <br /> <br /> Alain Chabat was absolutely great. A great clown if necessary and serious if the situation requires it. Of course, the performance was completely exaggerated, but this was exactly what the story needed and what made it work so well. Equally great was Charlotte Gainsbourg, who I love seeing so much, and the mother was also a very strong performance. The sisters could have been a little more detailed as to the character of the script, but apart from that there is nothing to regret. I had a great afternoon watching this movie while Hamburg was drowned in the rain outside, and I hope that films like this one in France will receive a regular premiere in Germany. But the distributors is that this country does not seem to understand that the French make good movies. At least I can not wait to find a DVD that offers subtitles (Hello Australia? Please?) Because that movie I need at home to see it several more times.
