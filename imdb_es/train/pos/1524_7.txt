This movie is a classic that it should be. It's not perfect, certainly. The rhythm, while perfect for the stage, is presented in the form of a slow film like a turtle with arthritic knees. Jean Seberg is misguided to be too sweet and too soft. She shows the talent, skill and ability to interpret convincingly the ingenious, passionate and confident Joan, but, unfortunately, the director did not understand the point of the character. George Bernard Shaw is my favorite playwright. In no other game has his dialogue been more acute, nor the more musical lines. However, processing this movie requires that you see her as a lawyer. This movie is a case, and the viewer is the judge. This is how this image should be enjoyed. 7/10.
