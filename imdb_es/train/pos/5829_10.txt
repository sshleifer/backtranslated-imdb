This is one of my two or three favorite Stooges shorts and, without a doubt, the best performance of Christine McIntyre with the trio. She is good at many other shorts, but here she is absolutely brilliant. His singing is not fun at all, in fact it is absolutely beautiful, but the plot is constructed in such a way that the song enhances the humor instead of subtracting it. We listen to McIntyre sing the entire Voice of Spring no less than three times, but he never gets old, partly because we do not get tired of his voice and partly because he combines very well with the antics of the Stooges. The use of operatic soprano in a comedy recalls the role of Kitty Carlisle in the Marx Brothers' "A Night At The Opera", but singing is much more of the comedy here than in "Opera" and McIntyre (perhaps more so in other performances here) exhibited a comical talent of its own that Carlisle never did. The buffet of The Stooges, the McIntyre chant and a well-constructed plot combine for 5 out of 5 stars.
