This episode introduced the Holodeck in the world TNG. The Jarada must be contacted and a precise greeting must be delivered, otherwise it would be an insult to them. A tired Picard decides to take a trip to Holodeck and begins a wonderful adventure. The settings are excellent and almost like a movie. Unfortunately, the Jarada probe sent soon after damages the holodeck and all its security devices stop working. Picard and now the guests must mock the mobsters of the United States of America and return to the Jarada appointment. Picard greets the Jarada correctly and begins a new day between Humanity and the Jarada. This jewel of an episode of the first season sets the holodeck for many interesting and unusual adventures to be had there.
