['The widowed man from the Dan Burns family (Steve Carell) writes the column &quot;Dan in real life&quot; giving advice to families in The New Jersey Standard and raising his three daughters alone. Jane (Allison Pill), the oldest, has just obtained her driver&#39;s license, but Dan does not allow her to drive; Cara (Brittany Robertson) is in love with her high school classmate Marty; and young Lily (Marlene Lawston) misses her mother. When Dan and his daughters travel to Rhode Island for a family reunion, he meets Marie (Juliette Binoche) in a bookstore and they spend hours talking to each other. They are attracted to each other, but Marie receives a phone call and leaves Dan, first giving her phone number. Dan immediately falls in love with Marie, but when he returns to his parents&#39; house, he discovers that Marie is the girlfriend of his werewolf brother Mitch Burns (Dane Cook), who is also in love with her. Throughout the weekend, the attraction between the clumsy Dan and Marie increases and they have to make a decision. <br /><br /> &quot;Dan in real life&quot; is a big surprise and a lovely movie, with comedy, romance and drama. The chemistry of the beautiful Juliette Binoche and Steve Carell is amazing and it is very easy to know why everyone loves Marie. The trio Allison Pill, Brittany Robertson and Marlene Lawston is fantastic and their characters are responsible for some of the best moments of this story. The script is wonderful and the performances of the talented actors and actresses are impressive, with a realistic behavior of a family reunion. Follow the advice of Dan&#39;s column and plan to surprise you with the Burns family reunion. My vote is eight. <br /><br /> Title (Brazil): &quot;Eu, Meu Irm√£o e Nossa Namorada&quot; (&quot;Me, my brother and our girlfriend&quot;)']
