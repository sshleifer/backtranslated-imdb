When Braveheart first came out, he captivated me, and it was true that he was one of the most rabid fans in the movie. When Rob Roy came out, I was intrigued and, although I enjoyed the movie, I did not think it was a great movie. However, with the passage of time, my appreciation for Rob Roy has increased and my enthusiasm for Braveheart has diminished. Braveheart is great entertainment, no doubt, but there are also flaws. The most significant, in my opinion, is the unflattering portrait of Robert the Bruce, who was undoubtedly the greatest king of Scotland. Another is the historical inaccuracy of the film, which tarnishes the film in proportion to the many historical distortions. I think I'm also annoyed by the fact that in this movie, seen only (at least by me) in retrospect, the beginnings of Mel Gibson's egomania can be clearly seen. In contrast, Rob Roy has grown in me over the years. Partly because it largely avoids the flaws that matter most to me in Braveheart. But also because Rob Roy is like a good wine, increasingly mature and complex with each visualization.
