So this made for the TV movie a score of only 7.6 on this site? Bah! Humbug! Undoubtedly, this 1984 version of the classic Dickens tale is the best one ever made. And yes, The Hound has seen the 1951 version that was also good, but not enough. The lack of color is perhaps the biggest flaw in that version, although the performance was wonderful. <br /> <br /> George C. Scott is simply amazing as Ebenezer Scrooge. We all know the story of this stingy businessman who is obsessed by the ghost of his dead partner, and then by three other spirits that night. Scott is correctly brusque like Scrooge. Too sharp, in fact, for some critics who claim that he can not project the newly discovered joy that he woke up on Christmas morning after the spirits taught him a valuable lesson. But hey, this is George C. Scott. He will never go dancing in the street in a fit of joy. He has too much dignity, and his Scrooge projects his emotion in a realistic way. <br /> <br /> The support performances are uniformly excellent, as are the costumes, the music and the stage. 19th Century London comes alive in the visionary style of Clive Donner. The film even borders on fear in several scenes that involve the spirits. However, the important history of morality shines in every painting. <br /> <br /> Often you will not find this version on TV anymore, and that is a disappointment. The 1984 version of A Christmas Carol should be an obligatory part of the festivities for all households. When the decorations come out of the basement, this movie must find its place in the DVD player at least once during the season. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> The Hound.
