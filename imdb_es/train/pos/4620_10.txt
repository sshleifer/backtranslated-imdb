This movie is cool "Jen, sexy as always, and Polly wow, we were really as young as this movie can still touch the hearts of many teenagers that need to be put on DVD soon or it will become a classic." I really enjoyed growing up this movie I've always been in love with Jen now I'm too old, but this movie is made for all the gens> you know that I come from the 80s, I had to see all of them live the life I wanted but through movies I can do again once again, I guess I hope and hope that this film will not be lost in time, but will be reborn in youth so that they can enjoy the emotion of the heart they learn about hormones and dating problems and how Get rid of things that seem so important back then, but do not refer to anything now, so this movie is a dating tool.
