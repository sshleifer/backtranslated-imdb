I came across this movie on the cable and I was totally hooked. The story of a group of surfers riding big waves, monstrously huge waves, waves that would make any rational person flee in terror is one that manages to be spectacular and makes you understand why people spend their lives chasing waves. There is nothing special about the film, other than that it brings together some very interesting people who are in love with what they do and allows them to talk. Of course there are scenes of them surfing, but what makes this movie so special is the people. Here is a group of guys who are so enthusiastic about what they do that they come across people who look at them. Halfway through this movie you will want to go and learn to surf too. Few documentaries have ever managed to convey the passion these people have and their cinematic ability to make us feel what makes this a great movie. Look at it.
