Life begins, and ends, in a maternity / recovery room typical of the 1930s, where we see 48 hours in the lives of several pregnant women at high risk, played by Loretta Young, Glenda Farrell, Clara Blandick (Auntie Em ???), Vivienne Osborne, Dorothy Tree and Gloria Shea, while waiting to give birth. While the film has plot devices that seem very outlandish today when maternity wards are much more controlled and restricted, it offers us a look back in time to see how it was delivery in a typical hospital in the city in 1932 for our grandmothers and great-grandparents. Grandmothers I found the film fascinating and exceptionally moving. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, the most outstanding performance in this film comes from a male cast member, young Eric Linden as Jed Sutton, Grace's husband (Loretta Young). What an actor! As a father for the first time, Jed feels distressed and uncomfortable with the hospital staff who seems to ignore his worries about his wife, as they could shake the crumbs from the cafeteria table. I felt each of your concerns. I would like to see more of this actor's work. He had a very emotional voice, which was used for an unforgettable effect on Gone With The Wind. In that film, Eric played the young soldier whose leg was amputated without anesthesia, who shouted "Do not cut! Do not cut!" While Scarlett fled the hospital in horror. Chilling Another great performance is by Aline MacMahon, who plays Miss Bowers, the nurse. His character is a kind of salt of the earth, the kind of nurse we all hope to get for our hospital stays, which breaks hospital rules constantly to show a more humane side of the medical profession. <br /> <br /> Loretta Young did another excellent job as an actress here as well, a very authentic and deeply felt performance like Grace. My, she is very good in these previous codes, I have really learned to appreciate her more as an actress in recent months. <br /> <br /> Glenda Farrell played her role a bit as a lonely single mother. To my taste (did anyone know in 1932 that drinking a brandy from a bottle of hot water could be dangerous to the health of unborn babies?) but his character redeems herself in the end. <br /> <br /> Also in the cast Gilbert Roland, an unproven silent film star, was an Italian husband in a duel. His time on the screen was brief, but remarkable. <br /> <br /> Life Begins is a mandatory code that must be seen, try to catch it at some time in TCM, but remember to bring some handkerchiefs to mourn. 9 out of 10.
