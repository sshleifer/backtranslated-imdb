Yes, incredible as it may be, in 1968 a musical won the Academy Award for best film, and it was the third musical to win that prize in a period of five years, the first was My Fair Lady in 1964 and then The Sound of music in 1965. The difference between My Fair Lady, The Sound of Music and Oliver! However, it is Oliver! It is immensely better! Without comparison. The first two films are insipid wet noodles compared to the extraordinarily robust Oliver! The acting is great; the songs are great. The story is great and the dance is great. This film is dynamic, thematic, relevant to the human experience and, unlike the exaggerated New York Gang, Oliver! offers a portrait of poverty in the nineteenth century in London, England, which evokes sympathy without being condescending. Oliver Reed was a great actor and he shows it in Oliver! The other actors and actresses, especially Ron Moody and Shani Wallis, are equally wonderful and offer powerful representations of characters that evoke sympathy and warmth without being caricatures.
