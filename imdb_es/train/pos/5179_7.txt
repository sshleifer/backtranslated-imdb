Indian Summer is a warm movie of multiple characters, which would make a good movie in the afternoon (with a little editing). <br /> <br /> The film starts in the past with a group of children who are shown an elk, which sets the tone perfectly before interrupting the present, when a group of adults of the "golden age" "from the camp they are invited again to spend a few weeks on vacation by the head of the camp, Uncle Lou. Then, the film allows the viewer to spend time with these characters while they remember their moments in the camp, and form new memories in their last stay. <br /> <br /> The film succeeds in the excellent way in which it transmits its characters in this precious environment, and allows them to develop without having to worry about plot developments. Seeing these people remember, and their relationships with each other, is what the film is about and why it works so well. It never reaches the top and is melodramatic, always maintaining its warmth, charm and realism. I have never seen a movie in which nostalgia is captured so well, and I found myself trapped despite not having gone to one of these camps as a child. <br /> <br /> For a film of warm and nostalgic characters, I sincerely recommend it.
