I saw this movie 12 years ago on TNT. It was Susanah York's birthday and they were showing this movie as a double film with Tom Jones (1963). I have not seen this movie on television since then. I was interested in seeing this movie because one of the stars is the very funny and talented Jim Dale, like Lusty the sailor. I think Dale now does the narration of the Harry Potter books in Casette, but it's pretty fun anyway. This is a fast-paced comedy. It is not on VHS or DVD. Columbia Pictures should review its movie collection and consider restoring and releasing this movie to DVD. Christopher Plummer is as funny as Lord Fopington, Ian Bannen is also quite funny as Ramble the sailor. This is an obscene comedy, the kind of film that one no longer sees, with great production values. *** 1/2 stars out of ****
