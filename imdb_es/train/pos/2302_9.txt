Reese Witherspoon's first outing on the big screen was memorable. She appears as a new and young "small" face, light and smooth, but, without a doubt, Reese. <br /> <br /> I have always liked him as an actor and had no idea that he had started so young with his career, imagine. In fact, I gained some respect for Reese by knowing who she was so early. I say that because every time I've seen her act, the characters so far, in each performance she also seemed to have her own person who lived with that character, in fact, very well. <br /> <br /> Anyway, my first film experience with Reese was the parody of Little Red Riding Hood that Reese did with Kiefer Sutherland. Somehow, I assumed it was his first time "at bat" Not very well, well done Reese
