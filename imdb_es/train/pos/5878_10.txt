['Garam Masala is one of the funniest movies I&#39;ve seen in a long time. Akshay Kumar is excellent as the womanizer who has relationships with 3 girls and is committed at the same time. John Abraham is funny at times and this is one of his best works so far. Paresh Rawail is excellent as always in most of his films. The director Priyadarshan has delivered great films in the past. Hera Pheri, Hungama and Hulchul are some of the best. Garam Masala is his funniest movie he has done. The three newcomers are average. Rimi sen does not have much scope in this movie. I was impressed to see how Priyadarshan made a movie with a simple story of a boy who has an affair with 3 girls at the same time. The 3 girls have a day off on the same day and end up in the same house. Filled with loads of laughter, this is a non-stop entertainer.']
