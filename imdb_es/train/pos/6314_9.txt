I went to the movies with two of my friends and chose this movie, not knowing what to expect. And it becomes a very pleasant and fun experience! It's an excellent movie with a very unexpected story, very good dialogues and crazy humor. All the characters are obviously made in the style "Alan Ford" (Italian satirical comic), but that has not bothered me for a second. In fact, this kind of alignment of the losers made a movie quite unique and interesting. Sam Rockwell gave a very good and convincing role, Willian Macy too, Clooney is barely recognizable and brilliant. But the real star is actually Guzm√°n. He played a part in his life in this movie! The scene when his character, Cosimo, dies in the movie, is so hilarious that it made me choke and almost die with him. Highly recommended for all "Alan Ford" fans!
