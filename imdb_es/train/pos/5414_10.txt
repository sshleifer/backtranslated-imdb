This carefree 1939 military bluster, based largely on the memorable poem by Rudyard Kipling, as well as in his novel "Soldiers Three," qualifies as first-class entertainment about the British Imperial Army in India in the 1880s. Cary Grant releases more hits with his wrinkled fists than he did in all his movies together. Located in faraway India, this six-fist thread is based on the exploits of three British sergeants and their native water bearer Gunga Din (Sam Jaffe), who is confronted by a bloodthirsty cult of murderous Indians called Thuggee. Sgt. Archibald Cutter (Cary Grant of "The Last Outpost"), Sergeant MacChesney (Oscar winner Victor McLaglen of "The Informer") and Sergeant Ballantine (Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. of "The Dawn Patrol"), are a competitive trio of alpha males who drink, fight and love fun, whose years of sapling are about to become history because Ballantine plans to marry Emmy Stebbins (Joan Fontaine) and enter the tea business. Naturally, Cutter and MacChesney combine several schemes to derail Ballentine's plans. When their superiors order them to return to action with the sergeant. Bertie Higginbotham (Robert Coote of "The Sheik Steps Out"), Cutter and MacChesney drug Higginbotham not to accompany them and Ballantine must replace him. Half the fun here is seeing the directors trying to make fun of each other without hating themselves. Director George Stevens celebrates the spirit of adventure with great style and scope while our heroes get entangled with an army of Thuggees. Lenser Joseph H. August received an Oscar nomination for his outstanding black and white cinematography.
