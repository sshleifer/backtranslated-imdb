When two writers write a horror version of Breakfast At Tiffany's, you know something is going to work out. Drew Barrymore, Patrick Highsmith, Leslie Hope and Sally Kellerman are excellent actors. The FBI agent was a terrible actor. The scenes in which Patrick saw Holly up and down as a kind of objectifier, were simply strange. Drew Barrymore is very hot. Intimate Strangers, where Sally Kellerman worked, was a big part. The weird gummy worm was just weird. Nathan was a very handsome cat. But what was that scene in which Patrick followed Holly to a well and Mr. Gooding attacked him? And the scene with Dr. Wallace? What was he doing groping there? And not all men have a woman, as Sally Kellerman said. And when Patrick and Elizabeth saw Drew outside Victor, that was weird.
