In a time of magic, barbarians and demons abound in a diabolical tyrant named Nekhron and his mother, Queen Juliane, who lives in the ice kingdom and wants to conquer the region of fire ruled by King Jerol, but when his beautiful daughter, Princess Teegra, has been kidnapped. by the thugs of Nekhron, a warrior named Larn must protect her and must defeat Nekhron to take control of the world and the kingdom with the help of an avenger named Darkwolf. <br /> <br /> An animated fantasy epic very well done and excellent underestimated that combines live actors with animation drawn on them (rotoscoping), it is the second best movie by Ralph Bakshi alone with "American Pop" being the number one and "Heavy Traffic" being third and "Wizards" being the fourth. Without doubt, it is better than his "Cool World" or "Lord of the Rings", the artwork is designed by the famous artist Frank Farzetta and the animation has a good coloring and there is also a hottie for the boys. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to fans of fantasy and animation everywhere, especially the new Blue Underground 2-disc limited edition DVD. <br /> <br /> Also recommended: "The Black Cauldron", "The Dark Crystal", "Conan The Barbarian", "The Wizard of Oz", "Rock & Rule", "Magicians", "Heavy Metal" "," Starchaser: The Legend of Orin "," Fantastic Planet "," Princess Mononoke "," Nausicca: Valley of the Wind "," Conan The Destroyer "," Willow "," The Promised Princess "," The Lord of the Rings (1978) "," The Sword in the Stone "," Excalibur "," Army of Darkness "," Krull "," Dragonheart "," King Arthur "," The Hobbit "," Return of the King (1980) ), "" Conquest, "" American Pop, "" Jason and the Argonauts, "" Clash of the Titans, "" The Last Unicorn, "" The Secret of NIMH, "" The Flight of the Dragons, "" Hercules ( Disney) "," Legend "," The Chronicles of Narnia "," Harry Potter and The Chalice of Fire ".
