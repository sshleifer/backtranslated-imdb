Then, the neighbor was killing the neighbor. It reminds me of Iraq. As I watched how they dragged the American flag (50 stars in 1864?) Behind the horse, I realized why burning that piece of white and blue red does not bother me as much as our destruction / indifference to the Bill of Rights. I'm a Southerner and I must have some historical memory. <br /> <br /> Watch the character of Tobey McGuire learn to respect the dignity of a former slave, while watching the scalp of blacks and Germans (their ethnicity) betting on a poker game ... it was interesting. Many twists in this movie. The wife, who is forced to marry, shows lust and a strong will, characteristics that we are not accustomed to seeing in the respectable "victorianas of the victorian south". <br /> <br /> The crazy crazy Southern renegade gave me some information about why my cousin, head of the horse thief gang Copeland, Inc. in Mississippi, was hanged at that time. Bands of homeless men roamed the countryside, armed. Does it remind you of Iraq? And how similar are we under the facade of religion and ethnic origin? And why Southerners STILL struggle in today's civil war. <br /> <br /> Too bad we can not use the same knowledge in our handling of the country that we have just invaded and are occupying, fomenting civil war everywhere. That is Mesopotamia, now called Iraq, which has the misfortune to keep the oil. The wide-eyed assassins in Missouri, by assaulting Lawrence, Kansas, could easily be the insurgents we are now fighting unsuccessfully against. <br /> <br /> Another anomaly was the father's tribute to the Yankees who move to Lawrence and a school is set up "even before building a church, and for that reason, they will win." Eh ????? They taught me history in Birmingham, Al and they taught us that the North was much more industrial and richer ... that's why they won. Of course, they also LITERALLY had God on their side. As seen here, when the freed slave indicates that he is leaving to free his mother, sold into slavery in Texas. God, what a horrible legacy slavery gave us. <br /> <br /> Acting pretty well, a lot of blood and blood while the warriors rode happily in the battle (but they did not hear any rebellious shouts, so they remember football matches in Alabama). You also have a real sense of how stupid the war was, since the bushwackers and the jayhawkers gather their forces for another incursion. They have lost sight of why they are fighting, and so are we. Only more killings without meaning. <br /> <br /> They also put you up to date with the limbless children who come home from Iraq, since the bushwacker (ah, what connotations) has his arm completely closed, trying to save him. , then he has amputated it, and then he dies. So much suffering for such a stupid cause. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is fantastic. Now I have to go back to the DVD and get the production notes, one of my favorite parts of any movie. I suspect that this movie was written by a Gore Vidal, since the spoken language is of a type that you would associate with that era, if you knew History. The dialogue is definitely provocative. It's not your ordinary war movie of blood and guts, by any means. You see the soldiers wounded but still in active service, still fighting because they have nothing else to do. You see the assailants from the south, living off the land, stealing indiscriminately. However, at the beginning, you have seen the battle stop, so women could be evacuated from danger. As I read the growing number of women and children dying in Iraq, I think: "Where did we lose our sense of honor as a people?" I forgot why I looked for this movie and bought it after 20 years, but some book somewhere praised it. With good reason. Tobey at his best, pre-Spideyman. Buy the DVD or rent it. And tell me why others praise him, not just the liberal cest moi.
