Start slowly, showing the sad lives of the two housewives who decide to rent a castle in Italy for the month of April, but do not give up. Not much happens, but time passes exquisitely, and there are numerous crafty jokes (my favorite is the carriage ride in the storm, which I find hilarious). The film is wonderfully romantic in many senses of the word, the landscape is beautiful (as is Polly Walker), and the resolutions in the film are very satisfying. <br /> <br /> The film takes a couple of liberties with the book, the biggest being with the Arbuthnot / Briggs / Dester business, but actually I preferred the movie version of this (it can be more sentimental, but I felt that it was more consistent with the tone of the story, and anyway I like the feeling when it is well done). <br /> <br /> An excellent movie, especially as a dating movie during bad weather.
