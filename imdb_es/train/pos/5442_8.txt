It's a good movie. In the same genre of the "Memphis Belle". I've seen it about 10 years ago. And I would like to see it again. There is a link with the history of the hells angels! How the pilot team fights against the Germans in WO2. And most of the changes form pilots for the Harley rs engine cycle. The movie is in a way really happened.
