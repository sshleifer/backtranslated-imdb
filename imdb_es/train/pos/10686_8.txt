And I'm a fan of Nicole Kidman. I would pay to see her and listen to her read the Moscow phone book, which, as far as I know, she could have been doing when she spoke Russian in this movie. <br /> <br /> The four directors are excellent, but the film itself is a series of good images and better scenes that are held together for nothing. <br /> <br /> Although one is always ready to suspend disbelief While watching a movie, this question too much to the viewer. <br /> <br /> It could have been very funny (it's in parts) or quite scary (it's in a scene) but the director did not seem to know which way to go.
