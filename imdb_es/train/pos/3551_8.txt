['This is a masterpiece by Frank Loesser with funny lyrics, competent themes and a solid construction of those who adapted the material of Damon Runyon to the &quot;book&quot; of the musical. What is surprising about the film is the fluidity with which the musical numbers of the story flow. Abe Burrows made the book with contributions from Loesser; Michael Kidd was the choreographer, and the outstanding artistic direction was contributed by Joseph Wright. The story can be told in two sentences. Nathan Detroit, played by Frank Sinatra, needs money to finance his permanent floating junk game to amuse Big Julie, a Chicago Mob Boss. He bets the odds player Sky Masterson, well presented by Marlon Brando, that he can not get a girl from the Salvation Army to go to Havana with him; Masterson wins the bet, saves the Mission, falls in love with the girl, gets the punters and rowdy in the dice game to attend a service, and tells everyone that the lady was impervious to his charms: a complete lie. Of course it ends with the lady; and Detroit marries his fiancee, Vivian Blaine. Others in the cast include Stubby Kaye, Johnny Silver, Robert Keith, BS Pulley as Big Julie the Mobster, Sheldon Leonard, Regis Toomey, Mary Alan Kokanson, Kathryn Givney as leader of the Salvation Army, Veda Ann Borg and Jean Simmons as the tepid Salvation Army girl, Sarah Brown. The famous musical numbers of this award-winning Broadway hit include &quot;Fugue For Tinhorns&quot;, &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;, &quot;Luck Be a Lady&quot;, &quot;I&#39;ll Know&quot;, &quot;A person could develop a cold&quot; and &quot;The game of the oldest floating Permnanet garbage established in New York &quot;. Joseph L. Mankiewicz of &quot;Cleopatra&quot; and &quot;Letter to the Three Wives&quot; Fame directed the procedure; and the work flow is very interesting and keeps moving successfully. He is equally adept at achieving a good dialogue by acting and directing numbers as big as &quot;Luck Be Lady&quot;, the varied and challenging fight section, the Havana section &quot;A Woman in Love&quot; created for the film that precedes it, the presentation of the title. the song &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; and &quot;Pet Me, Poppa&quot; set in the club where Blaine works. The acting is very uneven. Simmons seems wrong for the part sometimes, Brando manages to sing and is very good most of the time instinctively, charmingly and understated, even in comedy. scenes Sinatra tries hard but is wrong in the paper for several reasons like Nathan Detroit; Blaine is too theatrical to sell her numbers, which of course she sings professionally. Leonard, Toomey, Kaye, Keith and Pulley do what is asked and more on all points. The stylized opening and closing are made to work well; In short, this film is a triumph for the kind and subtle lyrics of Loesser, for director Mankiewicz as master of ceremonies and for the genre of musicals itself, so well justified in this case. Charming and very different.']
