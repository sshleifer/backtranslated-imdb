I knew about this as a program similar to Jackass, and I saw one or two episodes in Freeview, and it's the same, but more extreme. Basically, three Welsh men and a British madman met for love of the skateboard and a complete disdain / masochistic pleasure for harming themselves, their health and safety. They have vomited, they have eaten pizza covered with pubes, they have jumped on nettles, they have put on naked paintballs, they have joked with the smaller boy while they sleep and they snore heavily, they do acrobatics in a workplace, for example. Army, cowboys and many more crazy tricks that cause bruises, bumps, blood and vomiting, maybe not just for themselves. Starring Matthew Pritchard who does almost anything, Lee Dainton is also in favor of almost anything, Dan Joyce (the Brit) who just does a lot of physical things and has an OTT laugh, and Pancho (Mike Locke) who does a lot of things, but it is more popular for being short, fat and lazy. It was number something in the 100 best fun moments. Very well!
