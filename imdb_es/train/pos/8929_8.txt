First of all, I really liked the central idea of ​​locating the "intruders", others in the fragile Being, on several levels, mainly subconscious, but sometimes more allegorical. In fact, the intruders are omnipresent throughout the film: on the Swiss-French border where the pre-Pagista leads an isolated life; in his recurrent dream and nightmare; inside his sick body after a heart transplant ... In the last half of the film, he himself becomes an intruder and returns to the old French colony with the hope of expiating the past. <br /> <br /> The general tone is more bitter than pathetic, full of regrets and guilt, the feeling of failure being more or less dominant. This is a rather grim picture of an old age, apparently self-sufficient but desperately empty and lonely inside. The manager composes the images more to convey passing sensations of anxiety and desire than any explicit meaning. Some of them are fascinating, although not lacking in humor, a kind of absurd game that only a sleepwalker can visualize.
