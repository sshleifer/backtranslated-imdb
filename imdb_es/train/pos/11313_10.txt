Gino Costa (Massimo Girotti) is a handsome young vagabond who arrives at a roadside bar. Meet the young, beautiful and dissatisfied wife Giovanna Bragana (Clara Calamai) and her old and fat husband Giuseppe Bragana (Juan de Landa), owners of the bar. She changes her mechanical skills for some food and lodging, and has an affair with Giovanna. Both decide to kill Giuseppe, forging a car accident. Their relationship is affected by the feeling of guilt and the investigation of the police. This masterpiece ends in a tragic way. The black and neo-realist film by Luchino Visconti is exceptional. This is the first time I see this version of "The Postman Always Rings Twice". I loved the 1946 version with Lana Turner and the 1981 version, where Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange have one of the most popular sex scenes in film history, but this is undoubtedly the best. My vote is ten.
