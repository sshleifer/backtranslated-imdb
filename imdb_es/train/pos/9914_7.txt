Revised at the screening of the world premiere on September 9, 2006 at the Isabel Bader Theater during the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF). <br /> <br /> I had an interesting premise but it seemed to last too long with too many piles of electronic waste (recycled computers, keyboards, cables, etc., sent to China per ton and then classified and converted into new products to sell ) and another desolation. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers tried to get more interviews with people to improve the human element, but they were often prevented from doing so due to Chinese censorship. Still, what was there was interesting. The fragments of a Shanghai high-level real estate agent who strutted around showing off their luxurious mansion and gardens, interspersed with the scenes of other people living in medieval conditions, were especially striking. The opening shot of a 480 m factory floor was also quite good. The scenes of the activity in the Three Gorges Dam project were also a complement to the films of Jia Khang-je in TIFF (the film Still Life / Sanxia Haoren and the documentary Dong) that were also developed around that topic. <br /> <br Director Jennifer Baichwal, producer Nick de Pencier, director of photography Peter Mettler and subject Edward Burtynsky were on stage for a question and answer session after the world premiere. Producer Noah Weinzweig was introduced to the audience and was thanked as the most important person who helped land access in China.
