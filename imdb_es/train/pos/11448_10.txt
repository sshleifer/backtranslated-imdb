The first time I saw this absolutely fascinating documentary was in its initial release in 2001, and it really had a profound effect on me, so much so that I annoyed several of my friends to see him with me on the exams. The conclusion: none of my friends was disappointed (never!). This star movie is about the Scottish conceptual artist, Andy Goldsworthy, who creates some absolutely beautiful pieces of art using natural materials (wood, water, flowers, rocks, etc.) to create pieces that eventually return to their natural form (a statement in the temporary state of everything?). We got to see Goldsworthy create several temporary works of art, as well as some of his long-term installations in the main galleries around the world, as well as some pieces in the natural world. The German filmmaker, Thomas Riedelsheimer directs, photographs and edits this meditation on the creative process that is a true pleasure for both the eye and the ear (with an environmental musical score, composed and performed by Fred Frith, whose music is generally experimental avant-garde / Noise Textured guitar, as well as a set of capable musicians, although this movie has been available on DVD for some years, if you can find a movie that is highlighting the resurgence of this good movie, look for it (it's a movie that was composed for the big screen, with a competent sound system to truly experience this movie in the right way.) Unrated by MPAA, but contains nothing that offends (unless the birth of a sheep on the living screen is intended to offend or bother)
