What a GREAT British movie, a screaming laugh and the sexy Gary Stretch too, and oh, many bicycles and the lovely Welsh countryside. <br /> <br /> Members of our club, ARROWHEAD Bike and Trike Social Club appear as extras! Hurrah !! <br /> <br /> There are some really funny fragments, good acting, a good idea. <br /> <br /> We met the director, Jon Ivay at a presentation in Wareham, Dorset. A great man, down to earth and a good laugh. This film must be compatible, as all the great British films should! <br /> <br /> So go and see if you can, they have a website with cinemas that show it, so look for one near you! <Br /> <br /> I can not wait to get the DVD. Some of our biker friends have already seen the movie two or three times and do not get tired. <br /> <br /> Amanda
