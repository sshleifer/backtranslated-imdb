Vince Lombardi High School has a new director: the evil Mrs. Togar (Mary Woronov). She intends to ban rock and roll music all together. She runs into Riff Randall (P.J. Soles) who LOVES the Ramones. In addition, the head of the school football team (Vincent Van Patten) seems unable to connect with any girl, without realizing that the beautiful Kate Rambeau (Dey Young) is in love with him. <br /> <br /> A midnight instant movie. This was published in a general version and almost immediately it was bombed, but like a midnight movie it was a great success and it was maintained throughout the eighties. I remember having attended more than a few when I was in college, it was like a party! People sang along with the songs, laughing out loud with every joke and, in general, simply having fun. <br /> <br /> Seeing her now as an adult, I can not imagine why I liked it so much. The script is youthful and full of moans that I could not believe I was listening to. The characters change randomly and the movie is jumping everywhere. What saves this are some really fun lines and wonderful performances by Soles and Woronov (who are really having fun). In addition, all are full of energy and are playing their roles EXTREMELY (as they should). As for the Ramones ... I was never a fan. I like the title melody, but the rest of the songs never got me. If you are a Ramones fan, you could give it a higher rating. <br /> <br /> SPOILER WARNING! This is mainly for kids (it has a PG rating) that you will probably find silly but fun. Especially I think you'll like the end when high school breaks! SPOILER END !!!! <br /> <br /> So, if you're in the mood for a stupid midnight movie of the 1980s, you might like this. Otherwise, stay away. I give him a 7.
