Love is overwhelming ... In all its manifestations ... Beautiful, absolutely beautiful ... Tudor Chirila, Maria Popistasu and Ioana Barbu, a truly dramatic story about love in all its forms, a story about the indecipherable forms of young hearts about life and lost innocence, all directed by the skillful eye of Tudor Giurgiu. With a magnificent soundtrack with Faultline & Chris Martin and Vama Veche, it surprises in every way, leaving behind the bitter taste of a misunderstood love ... Truly remarkable ... Is it me or the Romanian cinematography advances slowly but surely and wins? respect? This is a brilliant movie ... Two congratulations to everyone involved.
