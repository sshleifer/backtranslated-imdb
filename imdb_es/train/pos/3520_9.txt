This is a "Series B" movie, and my vote reflects your membership in that genre. I saw this movie last night at a movie theater on the left bank of Paris, where it opened a two-week black film career. The movie has some flaws, yes, but there are too many delicious elements to ignore. <br /> <br /> As the previous critic commented, the percussion scene is incredible! (The B films could step where the entry to movies A was banned!) And the plot is intriguing. Regarding Franchot Tone, however, I beg to disagree: for me, he is suitably mysterious; Just the right chilling tone. Keep in mind that here is a kind of German expressionism (the director, Robert Siodmark, was a German who came to Hollywood during the war), so an air of exaggeration fits into this whole movie. At least he does it for me. <br /> <br /> However, it is the beautiful Ella Raines who, in only her third accredited performance, kept this viewer fascinated throughout the film. A type "Girl Friday" with a great resemblance to Gene Tierney, is a wonder that has not become a household name. But it's so good here that I just ordered another movie of yours ('Impacto') off the Internet, and I can not wait to see it too.
