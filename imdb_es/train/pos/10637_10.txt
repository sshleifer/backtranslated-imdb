Harem Suare is the best movie I saw in the year 2000. Bravo Ferzan Ozpetek. Harem Suare is a bold film that addresses interracial romance, which is a taboo in Hollywood. Women of all shapes, sizes and colors populate the film. Isolated from the outside world, women entertain themselves by telling stories about intrigues, rivalries and jealousy within their ranks.
