I have not seen this movie in about 5 years, but it still haunts me. <br /> <br /> When they ask me about my favorite movies, this is the one I always mention first. There are certain movies (works of art like this movie, "Dark City" and "Breaking the Waves") that seem to touch a place inside you, a place so protected and hidden and so sensitive, that they make a lifelong impression. in the viewer, not as a life-changing event, such as the end of a serious relationship or the death of a friend ... This movie "shook" me when I saw it for the first time. It left me with an emotional hangover that lasted several days.
