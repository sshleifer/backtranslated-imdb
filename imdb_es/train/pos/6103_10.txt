I watched the movie recently during the Boston Film Festival. The movie was very entertaining and it is something that I believe the world, and black America is ready to see. It has comedy, drama, the soundtrack is great. It is a good movie for everyone. The characters were well developed and the film had a variety of prominent actors, such as Wood Harris (Remember the Titains, Paid in Full), Brian J. White (Trois 3, Mr 3000) and the wonderful Zoe Saldana (Drumline, Pirates of the Caribbean). The film addresses many relevant issues in today's society in a short period of time, and does so with class and grace. This is not just a story about life in the hospital, however, it is a story about people and their personal journey to discover who they are or who they will be.
