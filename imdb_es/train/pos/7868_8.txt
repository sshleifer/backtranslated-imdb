Once again, Madhur Bhandarkar takes you on a walk to the wild side. And a remarkable one is, literally and figuratively. <br /> <br /> Mumbai's high society: stars and stars, glamorous dolls and sorcerers, business magnates and types of runners, yes, the whole heap that sucks, are in sharp focus here. In the typical form of the tabloids, their worlds unfold, with each colorful story as an intelligent sub-frame in itself. <br /> <br /> A fighter star abandoned by the producer after becoming pregnant, the stewardess and her high-profile husband, the pedophile businessman and his neurotic wife, the reporters and the police captain; all the nuances on display and innumerable intermediate nuances. <br /> <br /> Bhandarkar does a great job of unearthing the filth of the drama kings, the dancing queens and the undead. Atul Kulkarni punches, as do Boman Irani and Sandhya Mrudul. Konkona Sen Sharma is effective as an ex-crime reporter, but could have been arranged a little in keeping with the change of job and the party circuit. <br /> <br /> Highly focused (run time 140 min) and different refreshing film, well worth the money.
