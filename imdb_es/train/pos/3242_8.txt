I saw this movie with my dad. I must have been pretty young, around 15 years old. I was in Star Movies one afternoon. The movie started a little vaguely, but you could tell that the thieves were gathering for a score. It really accelerated after the first half hour. <br /> <br /> All the actors are great, especially Blades and Lou Diamond. I guess it's the whole, they just play so well together. I can watch this movie at any time. I think it's the relative stupidity of the plot and the characters that try to deal with a very strange score. The jokes are not corny, but they are subtle and extreme at the same time that they make them so funny. <br /> <br /> A perfect comedy for an afternoon of leisure.
