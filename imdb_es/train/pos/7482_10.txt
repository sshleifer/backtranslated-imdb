"Vanilla Sky" was a wonderfully designed movie. Or rather, "Abre Los Ojos" was well thought out. One night I saw that movie, excited for what was to come. I was not disappointed. By the end of the movie, I was stunned. I could not get it out of my mind. The general idea of ​​that left me speechless. The ending was more of a surprise that Shyamalan could never do. The plot line was also something that kept me completely interested. The cast, excellent. It was a wonderful movie. The kind of movie you can watch over and over again and you will always find something new. I've seen it four or five times and I always find something new. It's a movie to keep you interested forever.
