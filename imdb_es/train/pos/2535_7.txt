Prof. Janos Rukh (Boris Karloff) discovers Radium X, a powerful force used for atomic energy. Unfortunately, Rukh has been contaminated by the radio and begins to shine in the dark, and his touch causes instant death. Dr. Felix Benet (Bela Lugosi) develops an antidote, but Rukh begins to go mad because of the radio And the antidote and is about to kill everything he thinks has done him wrong. <br /> <br /> The plan is silly and the "effects" that make Karloff shine in the dark are ridiculous, but this is a fun little chiller. It moves quickly, it has a great atmosphere (note the "house" of Rukh and the film starts on a dark and rainy night) and Karloff and Lugosi (as always) give excellent performances. There is also a good performance by Franic Drake (as Rukh's wife) and Violet Kemble Cooper (as his mother). So that's fine, but just one notch below all the other Karloff / Lugosi movies. The plot is too exaggerated for him to swallow it. Still, I liked this. I give him a 7.
