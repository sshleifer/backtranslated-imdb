COME ON!!! They did it on purpose! Two of my current favorites on television (Meloni from "Oz" and "L and O-SVU" and Janel from "West Wing") are hooked for a good study of characters and people. The plot is nothing special, but the performance is correct. Tim Busfield appears for some sorted bits. Worth a look.
