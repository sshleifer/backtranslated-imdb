I was lucky to see Day Zero last night. It is an incredible movie. A very disturbing one in that. <br /> <br /> In a way, Zero Day is very comparable to "The Blair Witch Project". It was completely shot with handheld camcorders. It is about 2 children. Only your average children. Andre and calvin. They start a campaign against high school titled "Army of 2". <br /> <br /> The whole story is told in the form of a Video Diary, of the 2 children. It shows that there are relationships with parents, among other people, that show that these are just normal children, as well as the people we know or have met. We learn that the last mission of the Army of the 2 will be day zero. They plan to shoot there until high school. <br /> <br /> You see how they have access to their weapons, how they plan it, everything. They emphasize that the media have not affected them at all, and there is no reason to do so. As I said, all this is counted in the form of a Video Diary, and then they store the tapes in a safe box to see them after Day Zero. <br /> <br /> The actual shooting is shown in the Survival Chambers throughout the school. . In fact, chilling. The movie is very scary. Some of the things they say, how they plan, you should see for yourself. An appointment that I remember is the only time that Calvin is by himself. He says: "Andre believes that they would only leave in an escape car, doing this to numerous schools across the country, I do not know what he is thinking, but the only way out of school is in a black plastic bag." . <br /> <br /> I'm probably not even giving you the correct idea of ​​this movie. You really need to see it yourself. It's about festivals at this time. <br /> <br /> A +.
