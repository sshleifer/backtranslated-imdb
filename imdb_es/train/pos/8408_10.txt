"It was not me! It was, er, my twin brother Rupert!" Bobby tells Dugan when he faces being in Sally's place. I have used this line dozens of times over the years (however, no one has yet to believe it). <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the best of all time for pure fun and lack of credibility. Steven Oliver was perfect for the role of Dugan, so much so that he was in "Malibu Beach" in 1978 as the same character (although not as much as screen). <br /> <br /> "Nobody calls Dugan a hooligan!" It's another line for ages. This classic movie was definitely worth the price of admission.
