The casting of Michelle Rodriguez as Diana was a stroke of genius. She is perfect. His acting inexperience actually works in his favor. We've never seen her before, so it really feels like her story. She also brings genuine hardness. This works against her, because we never doubt her. You never have to encourage her to win because she never faces a fighter that we do not believe she can win. So, like a boxing movie, it fails. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this is not really a boxing movie. How do you make a movie about a girl who wants to be a boxer who is not a boxing movie? You do not But Karyn Kusama has it anyway. Like many independent films, "Girlfight" defies classification or genre and stands out for itself as folklore that could almost never happen in real life. <br /> <br /> Diana is going badly at school. She hits people she does not like (all the other girls in her school, for example). She does not fit. His father is forcing his little brother Tiny to learn to box so he can defend himself when things get tough. He gives Tiny money for his boxing sessions and gives Diana nothing, as if she did not need to defend herself, or anything worth doing in her life. Tiny wants to go to art school (clich√©, disgust), so he gives his boxing assignment to Diana, who really wants to box. Things get complicated when Diana falls in love with another boxer, Adrian (Santiago Douglas), who seeks to become a professional. From there, the story is directed towards the inevitable ... the two are in the fight for the amateur title. <br /> <br /> What made me cold was that I never found any of this interesting. Everything is too credible. Children with difficult lives growing up in difficult urban areas resort to sports. Many professional boxers have risen from these circumstances. The mental and physical resistance that this education requires lends itself to a game like boxing, where anger is your friend. So this time it's a girl. Big Deal. <br /> <br /> Or there is another position to take: finally, a boxing movie about a girl. Female boxing has been around for a long time. The brutality that we usually see in boxing movies is replaced here by discussions about people's lives and feelings. The whole fight is used as a platform from which to paint a larger image. Respect. Overcome adversity. Self-discovery <br /> <br /> I recommend "Girlfight" because it has a good spirit and is an example of a great director's work for the first time. The dialogue never rises above the quality of the telenovela, but the story itself changed my opinion about some things. Yes, the world now seems a better place. A movie did that. <br /> <br /> Grade: B-
