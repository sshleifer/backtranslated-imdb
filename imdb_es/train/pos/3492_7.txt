It's not a movie as bad as I thought. <br /> <br /> It has a good cast. It's good to see Roger Moore again on the screen, as well as the use of other British actors. <br /> <br /> I would like to see more of Olivia D`Abo in future projects. Maybe he's in front of his cousin the sexy Maryam D`Abo. <br /> <br /> It is also a good use of hidden places like Luxembourg. <Br /> <br /> We hope we will see more co-productions from the UK and Europe like this one.
