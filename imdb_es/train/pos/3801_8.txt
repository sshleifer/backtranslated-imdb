['This is an animated CGI movie based on a 2D animated series in French. The series was published briefly on Cartoon Network, but its execution was so brief that its inclusion as one of the possible Oscar nominees for the best animated film for this year left most of the people I know as &quot;Huh? is the story of Lian-Chu, the friendly heart muscle, and Gwizdo, the brains of the operation, who along with Hector his dragon, looks more like a dog, travels the world offering his services as dragon hunters, but They never charge Zoe, the loving niece of a king who is going blind, comes to their lives It seems that the world is being devoured by a huge monster and all the knights the king has sent have never returned or if they return they return as Ashes in desperation, the king hires the dragon hunters to stop eating the world Zoe of course tags along ... <br /><br /> What can I say differently? Why is this movie hidden under a rock? This is a very good small movie that is completely off the radar, except as an unlikely Oscar candidate. It is a beautifully designed movie with a fantastic look (The world in which it develops has floating lands and crazy creatures) that constantly made me &quot;Wow&quot;. The voice in English with Forrest Whitaker as Lian-Chu (one of the best vocal performances I&#39;ve ever heard) and Rob Paulson as Gwizdo (I think Steve Bucsemi) is first class. Equally great is the script that is not directed to your audience, using some real expressions that are not normally heard in animated films (neither Disney nor Pixar). Everything is very well done. <br /><br /> It&#39;s perfect No, some of the bits last too long, but at the same time it&#39;s very entertaining. <br /><br /> If you have the opportunity see this. It&#39;s one of the best animated films of 2008, and it&#39;s on my nice list of surprises for 2009.']
