It turns out that I lent this movie to a friend who knew nothing, and it turned out to be an excellent documentary about a trip on an old ship across vast expanses of the ocean. Thor Heyerdahl had developed the theory that the ancient Incas in Peru managed to travel thousands of miles across the ocean to Polynesia, based on certain relics found in both places, certain types of ancient maritime ships that we know they had available, analysis of the ocean currents and the wind, and the knowledge that the Incas traveled, in fact, in an indeterminate amount in the sea. <br /> <br /> To test his hypothesis, Heyerdahl and his crew build a ship as close as possible, to what the ancient Incas had available, using only balsa wood and other materials available at that time, and departed from Lima, the capital of Peru, to try to reach the Polynesian islands, some 5,000 miles away. <br /> <Br /> Your theory, like many things in ancient history, is impossible to prove with 100% certainty, but the coverage of your trip provides strong support that you are right. The film is really little more than the narration of the images taken during the expedition of more than 100 days, but it is a very detailed description of how it went and the trials and tribulations that faced. I would often like the Academy Award winning documentaries to be easier to find, and this for more than 50 years is still as interesting and informative as I am sure it was when it was first released.
