I do not care if you want my comment or not, but I think that you write that the movie is not good ... you are so obsessed with Hollywood movies that you can not see how good this is. The movie is not a fan of Jay Chou, but I like his game and not just his ... and you might think that there is not much sense in the idea and you might think it's not that interesting, but look deeply there. it's more than action in the movies more than love, passion and tears, there's more than the United States in the world and it's good :) really good. And it's hard to do so, so do not criticize the actors, the directors, because you do not know how difficult they are to be happy in this hour and a half looking at them, thanks :)
