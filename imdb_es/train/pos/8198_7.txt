Dirty Harry has to track down a rape victim who takes revenge by shooting his assailants in the traps before killing them. Probably a more appropriate punishment would be to let them live after the initial shot and let them suffer forever, as she and her sister have ... Anyway ... a story full of action again in San Francisco and Santa Cruz. The main rapist, played by Andy Drake, is suitably vile and receives his punishment at the end (of course!). It's not a classic movie, but it's better than the others, except for the original Dirty Harry.
