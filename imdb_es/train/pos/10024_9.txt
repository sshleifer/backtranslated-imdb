There are so many things to fall in Aro Tolbukhin. In the murderer's mind (inside the murderer's mind), it is very difficult to talk about it without giving any kind of warning. Let's say that this movie is like an exercise in the movies but very, very well done. It is made with super 8, shots in black and white, 35 mm, color, interviews, flashbacks. Aro Tolbukhin is like a documentary made film or vice versa, whose most peculiar aspect is based on the doubt that leaves you wondering: did it really exist? The film follows the later life of a Hungarian sailor who arrived in Guatemala, worked on a religious mission and then killed some people. An act for which he was caught and sentenced to death. The film begins because some French documentary filmmakers became interested in this character, so they interviewed him before his death. Today, some more people got involved and conducted a deeper investigation of the character. The one we are witnesses to -the movie. <br /> <br /> For the most part in the story, we are guided through a semi-slow phase to look inside Aro's mind, mainly to decipher why he did it. what he has done However, the important thing is that the filmmakers never give us a lateral point of view; they left the trial for all of us and, although we understand their actions, we clearly never justify them. So, the first half is based on the collection of information; later, things become Aro's childhood, which gives the movie such incredible strength (even the hard one does not weaken or become boring). <br /> <br /> I do not want to say, and I do not want to, spoil anything; so the only thing left to say is that if you happen to get this movie near you, believe me, the trip to see it is more than worthy.
