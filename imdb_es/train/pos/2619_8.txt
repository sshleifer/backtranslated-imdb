['If the Lion King was a Disney version of Hamlet, then the Lion King 3: Hakuna Matata is a Disney version of Guildenstern and Rosencrantz is dead. Like Tom Stoppard&#39;s seductive film, we can see the action from the point of view of two of the secondary characters in the original: Timon, the meerkat with a penchant for singing in the blink of an eye, and Pumbaa, the boar with flatulence problems. By following his story, instead of Simba&#39;s, we can see why all the animals bowed when Simba was introduced from Pride Rock. We discovered what made Timon and Pumbaa decide to follow Simba back to Pride Rock to expel Scar. And we discovered how they dealt with the hyena once and for all. Nathan Lane as Timon gets most of the best jokes, but Ernie Sabella supports him with skill like Pumbaa. It&#39;s also good to hear Matthew Broderick and Whoopi Goldberg pick up their roles. Julie Kavner and Jerry Stiller lend their distinctive voices to two new characters: Timon&#39;s mother and uncle. The only drawback is the constant advance, backward movement, rapid advance of the device that does not always help to progress in history. Having said that, there is a bright zoom near the beginning of the movie. Hakuna Matata is worth seeing, with more laughs than any other movie in the third part of a Disney series, if only because of the hot tub scene, which is still fun despite being a bit predictable.']
