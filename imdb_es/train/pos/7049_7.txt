In this satire of commercialization and the 'unconcern' of the war, John Cusack plays Brand Hauser, a murderer sent to 'Turaqistan' to get Omar Sharif out, who is doing an oil business that will create problems for the former vice president of Own company from the United States. In addition to this, Hauser must juggle his false position as producer of a trade fair, a wedding for the princess of pop Yonica (Hillary Duff) and a curious liberal journalist, Natalie (Marisa Tomei). <br /> <br /> Evaluating the Technical Aspects: <br /> <br /> - The performance (by the main characters, at least) was good, as expected. Part of John Cusack's dialogue was obviously not written for him, since he often felt uncomfortable saying so. . . Maybe unreal is more accurate. Joan presented a great and, often, hilarious performance. Marisa Tomei, although I've never been a big fan of her, was more than adequate for the role and it worked well. Hillary Duff, however, was quite terrible. They needed an attractive pop star from the Middle East (or Russian, or what that accent was supposed to be). Unfortunately, they went with 0 for 3 with her. <br /> <br /> - As I said before, the writing seemed a little stiff and did not match the points, especially in John Cusack's dialogue. Not much of that, mind, but something. The story also got a bit ridiculous at some points, which is fine for a satire, but it took it to a whole new level here. Fortunately, Cusacks and Tomei maintain a relatively cool and calm attitude, and that makes it a good mix of the film's madness and the good sense of the actors. <br /> <br /> - Joshua Seftel, who previously had a drought of real credits in his name, did a good job with a broad-spectrum movie. He handled the small budget ($ 10 million) very well, stretching it so that it seemed to be much more. Seftel also managed to mix the humor of the story well. . . With the painful and hard to see parts of the real war (including the massacre of civilians, etc.). <br /> <br /> - In regard to general satire, its exaggerated aspect about the commercialization of the war is very well done, especially the 'Golden Palace Poker' ads on American tanks. At some points, it becomes a bit too much, but, in the end, it remains accurate and portrays what it is for a young 'Mel Brooks' style of style. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is very well made for the meager budget and it is definitely worth checking out. It will not fall as one of the great satires of cinema, but it is certainly not the worst. <br /> <br /> 7/10.
