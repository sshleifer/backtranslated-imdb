"A mouse in the house" is a very classic Tom & Jerry cartoon, true to its tradition but with its own jokes. It's hysterical, hilarious, very entertaining and quite fun. The illustrations are also of good quality. <br /> <br /> This short is not just about Tom trying to catch Jerry. Butch lives in the same house and he is also trying to catch the mouse, because "there will only be one cat in this house in the morning, and that is the cat that catches the mouse." <br /> <br /> If you ask me, there are many funny jokes in this caricature. The funniest ones for me are, for example, when Mammy Two Shoes sees the two lazy cats sleeping and says sarcastically "I'm glad you're enjoying the nap" and that she expects you to be satisfied because she is not doing it. Two cats pant. Another funny joke is when Tom disguises himself as Mammy Two Shoes and hits Butch with a frying pan and then Butch does the same trick to Tom. Of course, even more fun than this, is when they appear the real Mammy Two Shoes and both cats (fools!) They think that they are being disguised as Mammy and then both attack in the "rear" - hahaha. Naturally, she gets angry and once she gets angry, she is not someone to get involved with. But even Jerry does not win this time, because he is also expelled by her.
