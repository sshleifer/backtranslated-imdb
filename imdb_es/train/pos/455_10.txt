"Magic" is not too strong a word for the spell that this film weaves. You find yourself relaxed and seeing others with a more benevolent light ... Any film that has that civilizing effect on the viewers deserves serious attention. We are rarely soaked in beauty like this. As if that was not enough, it's funny. The presentations are, without exception, extraordinary, but a special mention must be made of the miraculous Miranda Richardson and the superb Josie Walker, both open as roses. <br /> <br /> Why is NOT this movie on DVD? He deserves to live forever.
