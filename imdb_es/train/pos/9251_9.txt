What can I say? Mrs. Erika Eleniak is my favorite blonde girl, and as an American of Italian origin, number one fan of female beauty, I can not forget this movie. <br /> <br /> You know you really do not remember much about the plot, or the situations or the other actors. I can only remember about Erika, the beautiful dead woman, and that in this movie she looks better than ever, I do not really care if it was a bad movie or a good movie, I only care about the good times when I was a teenager in Brooklyn Just contemplating the beauty of Erika. <br /> <br /> Well, to conclude, if you're an admirer of Erika's beauty like me, this movie is definitely for you.
