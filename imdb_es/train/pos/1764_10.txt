Steve Carell has his first leading role in the 40-year-old Virgin, and he only had supporting roles in films such as Bewitched, Bruce Almighty, Anchorman and his work in the Daily Show, we had just tried a bit of the comedy that Carell truly endorses. It can be said that Will Ferrell influenced his "comic air", but Carell takes him to another level, everything he does is innocent, kind and hilarious. I would not hesitate to say that Steve Carell is one of the next great comedians of our time. <br /> <br /> The 40-year-old Virgin is two hours of non-stop laughter (or 4 hours if you see her twice). as I did, a cast of perfect support and great actors love the audience throughout the film. The script was perfect with so many great lines that you want to see the movie again to try to remember them all. The music matches the tone of the movie, and you can say that the director knew what he was doing. <br /> <br /> Full of sexual jokes, some nudity and lots of language, this movie is not for everyone, but if you liked the Wedding Crashers, Anchorman or any similar movie, you will love The 40 Year Old Virgin.
