That 70s Show is the best television show of all time. It's up there with the Andy Griffen Show, Saturday Night Live and The Simpsons in my book. That program of the 70 continued for 8 seasons, all of which focus on a group of adolescents / young adults who have relationships, separate from their parents and their futures in general. <br /> <br /> The two main characters, Eric and Donna, are two teenagers who live side by side. They have been living next to each other for most of their lives, and only begin to feel more feelings for each other at the beginning of the first season. A large part of the show revolves around the functioning of their relationship. <br /> <br /> Two other characters, Red and Kitty, are Eric's parents. Red was in the service, so it really pushes Eric. Kitty is the opposite. Even though she drinks a lot, she treats Eric and his friends very carefully. Bob, his neighbor, is obviously Donna's father. Bob laughs with several women throughout the history of the show. Bob also bothers Red in all its extension. <br /> <br /> The rest of the character, Hyde, Kelso, Fez and Jackie, are Eric's friends. They also play an important role in the history of the program. <br /> <br /> Well, the first season is great. This is when the characters begin to feel new things to each other. The first season is original, fun and enjoyable. <br /> <br /> The second season is good, although it is not as good as the first. It is a basic continuation of the First. Eric and Donna are together, and everything is working very well. <br /> <br /> The third season is my favorite. He returned and captured the feeling and mood of the First Season. I also think that the chemistry of the characters improved a lot, making the show more fun to watch. <br /> <br /> The Fourth Season is not so good. Eric and Donna are not in this together, making the show a little less pleasant. It's still fun, although I did not enjoy it as much as the previous seasons. <br /> <br /> The Fifth Season is the last season that I enjoyed until the end. It's the last year of the gang, which really helps with the story. The Fifth Season also had the best end of all seasons. <br /> <br /> The Sixth Season is good for the most part. It is extremely funny, although it does not capture the feeling that the other seasons had. The gang is out of high school, so I think it did not hit the teenager the feeling that had the previous seasons. I also did not like the last three or four episodes, since they had a great drama. <br /> <br /> The seventh season captures the same feeling as the fifth season in some way, although it did not. Do not do it all the way. I enjoyed the Seventh Season as I did with all the others, and the end is great. <br /> <br /> The Last Season stunk. Eric was not in that, which ruined him. Kelso was not in that either, for the most part, which did not help. I hated the eighth season until the last episode. I thought the last episode was really good, and an appropriate ending to the series. <br /> <br /> So, in general, if you like comedy, try That 70s Show. They stopped making new episodes, but they're still on TV a lot. I also recommend buying seasons 1-7. It depends on you if you want to buy season 8.
