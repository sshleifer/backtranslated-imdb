['I like old black and white films of this type, films by Will Hay and Abbot &amp; Costello, especially because they are my favorites. I picked up this movie on a DVD because it used the same idea as &quot;Oh Mr Porter&quot; by Will Hay, which is one of the best comedies ever made. I just finished watching this movie less than ten minutes ago (the movie finished at 12:45 a.m.). It seems to me that films of this type, related to phantom trains, etc., look better at night with the lights off. That way, you enter more into the story and the nighttime visualization works well with this movie. <br /><br /> The phrases of the film may seem a little outdated for some viewers, I guess this depends on the viewer. Although they are not dated with me. I am 28 years old and although I am not old enough to have appeared when this movie premiered (although my dad was). I still have a lot of appreciation for some of the old movies of this type. Sit in the room in front of the TV with some snacks and drinks, and rest and relax at night while watching these movies, there are not many things that can overcome the feeling you have while doing this. It is an escape from reality for a time. <br /><br /> I noticed that one of the men in the movie (he has a black mustache) appears three-quarters of the movie after his car crashes and is looking for a woman who was followed at the station. This man was also in Will Hay&#39;s classic &quot;The Ghost of St Michaels.&quot; I just thought about pointing it out in case nobody noticed :) <br /><br /> The pieces of the film are very atmospheric. Outside the abandoned station it looks good and as if there is not a soul for miles in any direction, and the interior of the station is very welcoming, looking away from the rain storm that is outside. I felt that I would have loved to have been there in the movie with the cast. The atmosphere in this movie is something that is missing in many movies now. It keeps you hooked from the moment the movie starts until it ends. <br /><br /> We need more of these types of movies in today&#39;s market. But, unfortunately, it could be overlooked in favor of movies with nudity, insults and raw humor. For me, this kind of film age (The Ghost Train, Oh Mr Porter, etc.) is the golden age of cinema.']
