Aardman does it again. Next to Pixar, the Aardman animation demonstrates again and again how to make the animation correctly. <br /> <br /> I had a great time watching the first episode of Creature Comforts. I thought it translated well for the American public. My only concern is that most audiences will not get the subtle humor in this show. <br /> <br /> Having been a fan of the BBC version and the short film, I knew where I was. When I sat down to watch this. The animators did a great job matching prerecorded voices with a perfectly matching animal. Watch the first episode with the Goat, which sounds drugged, and the dogs on the street that are still called "dawg". <br /> <br /> Is this for everyone? Not for a moment. In fact, I would be happy to see the program last a full season. But as I said before, the public is not going to understand it.
