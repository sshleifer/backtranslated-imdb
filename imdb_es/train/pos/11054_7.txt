My brothers and I came across The Champions when our local station aired their repeats one summer in the 1970s. We absolutely adored it. There was something so exotic and mysterious about it, especially compared to the usual US repeats (Petticoat Junction, Green Acres ... you get the idea). It had a similar feeling to that of The Avengers (not a big surprise, since it was also British and in the spies / adventures genre). <br /> <br /> I would love to see her now, hopefully. Holds. I have mentioned this program to others and no one has heard of it, so I began to wonder if I had imagined its complete existence. But the wonder that is the web has allowed me to track information about it. Hopefully you will find a new generation of fans.
