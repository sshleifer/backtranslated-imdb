I love this program! Blick, Gordon and Waffle are very different cats from each other, however, they refer to themselves collectively as "brothers". I often find myself trying to imitate the tired and sighing accent of his butler, Hovis, or even the Scottish district of Gordon. There should be more episodes done about Human Kimberly. The episode about cats disguising themselves as preadolescent girls to enter the slumber party of Human Kimberly so that their thirsty legs take their favorite drink, Rootbeer, is a hilarious classic. Now we can not drink root beer in our house without making the Catscratch voices or the Hanson Brothers of the movie 'Slap Shot'. Classic future. Where can I get the first two seasons on DVD?
