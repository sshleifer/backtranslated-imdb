In 1967 I visited the glider port of Lake Elsinore and flew in a yellow Pratt Read sailplane. Returning to Germany, the serious ones were published on television and one of the segments was about high-altitude flights in gliders in California in the early 50's. (The real-life pilot was Bill Ivans, I do not know who interpreted it in the series). It turned out that the glider of the movie was the same (the same number N) as the one that had flown in Lake Elsinore. Since I saw that segment, I've been looking for it and I've been wondering if it's available somewhere. (Other segments in that were serious about Baker's Choice Seat, an instrument to find victims of avalanches, etc.
