This is one of the best Jackie films, that is, without the opera partners Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao. It has one of the best openings in any action movie and continues that way. Jackie shows some high-quality acrobatics. The only criticism is that in the middle it becomes a little slow, but it appears during the last 25 frantic minutes of the film and the final credits show what a crazy Jackie Chan is to keep movie addicts happy.
