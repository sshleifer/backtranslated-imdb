Reviewed by critics at that time but loved by fans, this movie has now become a classic. Mixing allegedly 'surreal' images taken at John Lennon's house among other places with live images of Marc Bolan & T.Rex at its best, this film is not just a necessity for everyone who has liked Marc Bolan, it offers a fascinating vision of the time. . <br /> <br /> It was a time when Marc rubbed elbows with characters like Ringo Starr of the Beatles [who directed him] and you could even find a short place for a Reg Dwight [Elton John] hitting The Ivory in a version amazing [and never officially released] by Tutti Frutti and rocking and ballad versions of Children Of The Revolution. <br /> <br /> There are also wonderful scenes with Chelita Secunda [who is said to have 'created glam rock' with her use of brightness, etc.], Mickey Finn and even the Catweazle actor !! <br /> <br /> The best scene for me is in the garden when Marc leaves the dining room table, sits cross-legged in front of a string section and removes acoustic versions of classics like Get It On and The Slider . <br /> <br /> Very, very recommended !! FIVE stars [out of five]. <br /> <br /> Rory
