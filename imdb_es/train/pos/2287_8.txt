['This movie surprised me pleasantly. It has a poignant, slightly off-center approach, which never loses its attention. This is a movie that I never heard of, but if you want a &quot;sleeper&quot;, here it is. Great writing, production and acting. I recommend it for audiences who want something thoughtful. Nick Nolte, Sheryl Lee and Alan Arkin are wonderful. Why was not more of this movie made?']
