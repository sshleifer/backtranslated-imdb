Definitely a very good idea, the script was fine. It could have been better. The positive is that you do not get bored if you are a lover of adventure. A new idea about the lost world of Atlantis. The negative is that I personally feel that this idea had much more potential than this. They should have ended up with a better adventure than this one. It was not bad, but it would have been much better with a little more execution time. Although I enjoyed it a lot, I can not. say it was boring or it was not good ... A good one for people who like adventure animations like Sindbad, like The Road to El Dorado. This movie is also recommended for people looking for a little adventure with a very happy one. ending.
