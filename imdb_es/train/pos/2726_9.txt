This movie is up there with the classics of all time. The music, the camera shots and the acting are excellent. Showing the film in black and white gave it a much better look and perfectly complemented the music, like Psycho. It's amazing how few people have commented on this movie. My guess is that it is a difficult movie to find. I gave the movie a 9. Look at the movie and you'll know what I'm talking about.
