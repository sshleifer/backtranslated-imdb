British comedies tend to fall into one of two main types: quiet, introspective, generally romantic study and ridiculous social satire. The configuration, the characters and the concepts vary, but certain characteristics place the great majority of the shows in one of the two categories. The butterflies is perhaps the epitome of the first type. <br /> <br /> The scripts are very verbal, including the long inner monologues of the main character Ria, a basically happy but restless housewife who is curious about what might have been lost when she embarked on a completely conventional life. When he meets a successful but awkward and emotionally accessible businessman (who makes his interest in her very clear), he plays with the idea of ​​discovering what the other path could have offered. <br /> <br /> Acting and scripts are always in the money, which makes one's reaction to the show almost totally personal: it did not surprise or turn me off. My mother, on the other hand, loved this show. I think that the degree to which one identifies with the Ria dilemma is the most important factor in determining one's reaction to butterflies.
