['Gandhi, the Great: <br /><br /> Greatness in the world is associated with people like Alexanader the Great, Ashoka the Great, for his greatness lied in being glorified as more than humans. Gandhi is considered excellent for not being really a Great but for being more human, because I always believe that taking humanity out of us is where the greatness of the human being resides. Gandhi was a human with humanity and one who fought for humanity ready to sacrifice himself. In the battle for humanity but not its enemies. Let me move on to the critique of the movie now. <br /><br /> About Gandhi my father: <br /><br /> Gandhi My father is a film that is not about Gandhi, but about his son Harilal Gandhi. In telling the story of a son whose father was one of the best humans to walk on this earth, the director manages to portray the story. The film manages to tell the story of a deceitful son of a father who led a nation to greatness. The film is called as a criticism of Gandhi&#39;s failure as the father of his son. I prefer to say that it is a sacrifice that Gandhi had made as the father of a son. Do justice as the father of a nation. <br /><br /> I hope that the essence of this film will prevail not only in India, the land of Gandhi, but through the hearts of all the people of this world. <br /><br /> Gandhi the true human.
