I've seen this movie only the only time about 25 years ago, and to this day I've always told people that it's probably the best movie I've ever seen in my life. Taking into account that there was no verbal dialogue and only a dialogue of thought, I found that the film was exciting and I even found myself holding my breath to make no sound. I recommend this movie, I would like it to be available on DVD.
