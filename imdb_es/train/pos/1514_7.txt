With some of Hammer's stars, this highly effective slice of British horror revolves around a house and the fate of its previous tenants, whose stories are told to a Scotland Yard detective, in search of a missing actor. <br /> <br /> Story number one, which is probably the least impressive of the four, is about a writer and his wife who have just moved into the house and plan to stay alone for a short time so he can write one of his books. horror novels. He creates an insane character named Dominic, who is a creepy looking creepy, and soon he goes crazy when he starts to see this beastly looking man wherever he goes. After his wife convinces him to seek psychiatric help, he presents a secondary plot that, frankly, did not work for me. I will not spoil it for you. <br /> <br /> The following story (the best one in my opinion) is starring the wonderful Peter Cushing as Philip Grayson, a man who moved into the house for his retirement and soon will. his way to a nearby wax museum (which deals with the macabre) where he is surprised to find a wax figure that looks exactly like a woman from his past. Soon after, an old friend (who also has a history with this woman) is in town on business and comes to see him. The two men enjoy a rude awakening, as they soon discover that there was more to this woman than meets the eye. <br /> <br /> Story of three stars, one of my favorites ... Christopher Lee, who plays John Reid. After moving into the house with her peculiar daughter Jane, the nanny she hires becomes very suspicious about the way Reid represses her daughter. Well, come find out ... if she knew what Lee did, she certainly would have understood. <br /> <br /> The final story is a rather cheerful vampire tale starring John Pertwee and Ingrid Pitt. After buying a mantle from a mysterious merchant, actor Paul Henderson is becoming the same creature he has played several times in his career. <br /> <br /> In general, the pace and direction were very good, as were the highlights. of the performances. There were nice gothic touches here and there and an effective score to complement the environment. This is a guardian, and it is highly recommended.
