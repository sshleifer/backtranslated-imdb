I want to add to the praise for the production of this film, especially the luminous cinematography. The light of the fire that shines from the smooth and muscular skin creates incredibly beautiful images. The film was nominated for (and won) a single Oscar, the first given for its edition. Mala's performance is changeable, penetrating and powerful.
