I get tired of my daughters of 4 and 5 years are constantly subjected to see Nickelodeon, Disney and others. Everything seems to be the same as the tired old cartoons repeated over and over again. When my daughters could not go to the fair this afternoon because one of them was sick, I wanted them to relax and rest for a while. I turned on the television and, looking for something different, I turned on the channels. My finger stopped navigating the channel the moment I heard Harvey's voice. I love all the solitary things that this man has done and when I saw that he was doing a voiceover for a duckling ... well, I could not change the channel! My daughters were instantly fascinated by the caricature and the more we saw the show JUNTAS, the more I fell in love with the message that was being represented. It is not necessarily an advocate of "gay rights", but rather of any person who has ever been excluded as a child by NOTHING. I had friends who were chosen for one thing or another ... too fat, too thin, too feminine, being a bully, not being smart enough, just having a father ... whatever! As a rule, children can be very cruel to each other, so I was glad to see an entertaining caricature that really conveyed a MESSAGE OF LIFE to your audience. My daughters already accept others as they are and do not choose others because they are different. My eldest daughter really defends her friends if they attack them (one of them has a single mother and that girl is very often, my heart warms up when Kassie defends her!). <Br /> <br /> Then, those of you who condemn this program because you feel that you are an advocate of "gay rights" or that you are being forced to "accept certain opinions", clearly and without understanding the point of this touching little caricature. <br /> <br /> And if you need to be explained ... well, you need more help than any TV show could offer.
