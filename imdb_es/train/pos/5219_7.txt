Gere and Danes star in 2 workers for the public security department who track the released sex offenders. Gere, who plays Babbage, refers to them as his flock. Gere is too obsessed a watcher who is dating. He is training, the newcomer Allison, to take charge of his work. Gere sees his flock as very sick and disturbed puppies. He asks them questions that are not on the list and tries to act like the police and solve crimes. He continues to receive warnings for this behavior, hence the reason he is being replaced. During her last days at work, a young girl disappears, and Babbage is sure that it is one of her flocks that she has lost. He and Allison reduce a list and discover that some of the criminals have left without permission. Then, he decides that he needs to trace the missing girl instead of helping the police. That part is a bit exaggerated. <br /> <br /> There are some sick and twisted things that are shown in this movie. Like when Babbage and Allison go to this building where a group of sick people do disturbing things to each other. In addition, there are the people who kidnapped the girl. At the end of the movie, we see how crazy they are. However, I would not call this film excessive because it does not really show much in the movie. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERDICT: If you like thrillers and movies about serial killers and cops that chase the killers, then you'll like this.
