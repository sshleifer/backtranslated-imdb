A Scanner Darkly, Minority Report, Blade Runner, Sin City and Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow? If you're a fan of any of these, it's worth checking out. <br /> <br /> The French animation project 'Renaissance' took seven years with a very small budget and tonight I could finally see it in a private screening for the Stockholm International Film Festival. My spontaneous reaction is amazement; My additional reflection is 'eh, neat' and a closer analysis unfortunately gets a resounding 'meh'. It is a magnificent triumph of science fiction on the surface, but scratching it or even hitting it a bit and its unnecessarily complex plot becomes evident, as do the flat characters. <br /> <br /> However, it is clear that the people in the Onyx movies have done something spectacular with the aforementioned surface. The images are amazing. They have used the live action movement capture included in the keyframe animation, with jet white and bright white contrasts and a very grotesque rotoscopic background. For those of you who do not agree with the 'technical jargon', the movie seems like a completely animated Sin City. Its fluid, transparent, dark and stylized template is complemented by a large spooky lightning bolt. It is a vision. However, much credit is also due to the sharp sound effects that take the form of futuristic weapon buzzes, suspenseful music, strong raindrops and fragments of glass that break. It is the wet dream of every nerd technician ... <br /> <br /> The film focuses on a Paris of disturbing, dark and gloomy future, in which a large corporation called 'Avalon' has begun to weave in the citizens' lives with vigilance (think about the transparent transparent screens of Minority Report) and genetic engineering. The latter leads to a mysterious abduction of the young researcher Ilona (expressed by the lovely Romola Garai). Cut to our hard cop copied in suspension and to the protagonist Karas (Daniel Craig)? A man who takes the law into his own hands? To whom the case of finding and recovering ilona is assigned. During this case, he receives help from Illona's sister, with whom he also begins a loving relationship. A story of half love, if I can say it. <br /> <br /> The world of the Renaissance is extraordinary. The director Christian Volckman takes a good blow by melting the noir themes and the result is an urban jungle full of cads, rats, fatal women and lonely detectives who hide in the shadows of the poor neighborhoods. The problem is that the creators, no doubt, felt the need to have very clear and detailed archetypes in the story, or the film would have been "too surreal" for the general public, due to its spooky animation format. It follows that we have a multitude of clich√©d characters, like villains who laugh at evil, sordid criminal bosses and hard chicks who smoke smoke whenever they can. It pushes noir in our faces, and it is not necessary. <br /> <br /> What is worse is that the dialogue is a bit artificial. It seems that each line exists for the sole reason of driving the plot. This is not fatal because the plot is so complex once it gets under way that it needs a clear direction. Daniel Craig also helps here by providing a sensible attitude to his police character. At one point in the Renaissance, he is seen in a vivid car chase that is surely one of the most adrenaline and high-level sequences of the film. Unfortunately, the novelty of sci-fi visuals has faded after this car chase and 'Renassaince' could benefit from being a bit shorter. In short, a very interesting but defective futuristic comics experience. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10
