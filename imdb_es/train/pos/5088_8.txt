I never saw an idea while watching the movie that was meant for the idiot box. I always thought that this was a very successful movie of the late 90's. But after seeing on the Internet that this was meant for television, I was surprised because for a television movie, it's absolutely fantastic! <br /> <br /> What worried me most was the length. I felt that the one-on-one battle scene should have been eliminated since it was completely unnecessary. In addition, he began to crawl towards the end, as it seemed that the adventure was never going to end. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, there is a strong plot, very interesting and captivating with great performances from everyone. I just felt that Patrik Frayze looked a little haggard. I also felt that Gogool, who seemed insane, became a little stupid in some scenes. <br /> <br /> I was delighted with the beautiful landscapes of Africa. Also, the first half of the movie would have made me give this movie a 9. Still, it's a great movie for television. 8 out of 10.
