It's no wonder that writer / director Michael Powell considered "A Matter of Life and Death," the fascinating fantasy of him and Emeric Pressburger of 1946 as his favorite of his films together. Launched during the aftermath of World War II, this colorful and romantic adventure would have provided the tonic for a traumatized and recovering nation that needs a good upheaval. <br /> <br /> Following a series of other patriotic war movies' The Archers made it the most peculiar, scary and patriotic of all. For excellence, British to defend the British heritage (Shakespeare, beer, fair play, good manners), is also visibly Americanized in its baroque compositions, technical ingenuity and an excellent multiethnic cast. <br /> <br /> Strangely resonant in another 1946 classic, "It's a Wonderful Life", AMOLAD opens up into a huge sky, with one of those joyous voice-overs that preach about the earth and the heavens, and on what Such a great and wonderful world we live. <br /> <br /> Then he cuts inside a British cabin, badly beaten, in flames and with the copilot already dead. It sounds badly conceived, but the connection soon becomes lucid with the events that follow. <br /> <br /> In almost 5 minutes, the rapid exchange between the British pilot Peter (David Niven) and the American radio contact June (Kim Hunter) is impressive in his privacy. However, Peter, resigned to death, exhausts a lot of vigor, charm and confessions, and his warm affiliation with June closes with a mutual exchange of "I love you". <br /> <br /> Continuing with the magic of the moment, Peter, by neglecting his Driver 71, whose job was to transport him to the 'Other World', escapes death and finds himself trapped on a beach. Later he meets June on a bicycle, and instantly combines the body with the voice. <br /> <br /> But realizing his mistake, the supreme court wants Peter to be returned, and orders the French driver (Maurice Goring) to bring him back to earth to get it back. But Peter is convinced to live because of June and the error of the Driver, and intentionally keeps his corner. <br /> <br /> The destiny of Peter finally resides in the celestial court and the American public prosecutor (Raymond Massey), whose jury is made up of several deceaseds. War heroes and elegant British delegates. The surrealistic judgment, which dissolves from b / w in Rich Technicolor, once the verdict is announced, may well be a dream, but the final shot in the hospital validates the predictable outcome. <br /> <br /> The summary, The filling of the "stairway to heaven" (the American title of the film) is used twice: the first time in b / w, when it elevates Peter and his enigmatic French guardian upwards, crossing giant statues of Peter's possible lawyers for the trial, including Abraham Lincoln and Plato. The second time, the softly lit color staircase provides the stage for what is an iconic image in the cinema: Peter and June frozen side by side, their marvelous eyes fixed forward in the frame, their fate sealed. <br /> <br /> The unlikely affection shared between Peter and June never becomes soft or verbose; It is treated with nobility and the perception that the couple is already adequate enough to get married and simply needs to convince people of their love, so that they can keep them together. <br /> <br /> The French conductor, who can freeze people's time and bodies, obstructs many of their key moments together, giving lectures to Peter about history and among his malicious tricks, pinching the book "The 100 best tricks games" of Peter and his coffee. Cup. <br /> <br /> As visually inspired as other Powell / Pressburger collaborations, this was the first time they combined color with b / w? the latter has a cheerful quality when used for scenes from the sky, and both are equally captivating. <br /> <br /> The outstanding script coincides with the imaginative set design, with a dialogue that sounds so immediate that it does not seem to have been written or made for the screen. Fun and witty, Powell / Pressburger's writing deserves the same acclaim with its strong color and composition. <br /> <br /> Made in 1946, "A Matter of Life and Death" is one of those films that challenges its age. fresh and inventive, even in this time when CGI would increase its artificial effects, probably stripping them of their emotional wonder. <br /> <br /> Other discordant changes would include the need to reduce the average number of seconds to be cut and the inevitable reason for shortening the dialogue so that it can maintain the low attention span of most audiences. Powell weaves a spell that unconsciously absorbs the viewer from the first frame, giving him the freedom to experiment with images without betraying the logical development of Peter's situation.
