['Everything is very simple. Jake goes to jail and spends five years with cheating and chess masters. They become compassionate with their record of losses and failures, and the misery in which they live because of their belief in their mastery of small tricks and control of the rules of petty thieves. They decide to give Jake maximum freedom: from his most intimate fears, from what he thinks he is himself. for that, they take him on a journey in which he has to let go of all fear, all pride, all hope, to be reborn as a true master of his will. <br /><br /> It is an intelligent film about the journey of enlightenment, about the endless bets and games we make with and within ourselves. 10/10, without a doubt.']
