"Deliverance" is one of the best exploitation films that emerge from that wonderful decade of the 1970s from which so many other exploitation films emerged. <br /> <br /> A group of friends embarks on a canoe trip down a river in the south and become the victims of a group of toothless barbers who almost try to ruin their lives. Is incredible. <br /> <br /> We are treated for anal rape, vicious blows, murders with bow and arrows, shots, broken bones, etc ... It is very similar to the "Texas Massacre" of 1974, for say that "Deliverance" is credible it would be immature. This would never happen and could never happen, even in the dark ages of 1972. <br /> <br /> "Deliverance" is a very entertaining and action-packed trip. It is one of a large number of exploitation films from the early 70s and (possibly) is based on that pile with its great performance, excellent cinematography and excellent writing. <br /> <br /> 8 of 10 children
