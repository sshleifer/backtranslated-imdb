I came to Nancy Drew expecting the worst ... because of the bad reviews from everyone else. I thought: although I do not read the books, it does not look like the Nancy Drew I've heard of. But I was wrong. Sure, it was not a carbon copy of the books, but when you make a movie of something, you have to modify it to become entertainment on the big screen. The plot was nice and exciting with many real fears and I thought Emma Roberts was really believable in her way of representing this classic character. There were several funny moments and, contrary to many affirmations, at no time in this movie did Nancy come out as a ditz. She was intelligent, conservative, educated and genuine. One thing that went well with this movie was balancing everything with a mix of comedy, romance, suspense and sincere moments. I really liked that movie. What a movie, what a movie! And if you are wise and you decide to trust me and go see this, get ready for some SCARY moments like hell because I was going crazy! Go see it or be a vagabond and let other people decide what you think of this movie for you ... an error that I almost commit. I love, I want to own this movie! I also love Emma Roberts now. She is like a mini-Bree Van De Kamp from DH. I love it, I love it.
