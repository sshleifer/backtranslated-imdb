While the sparkling chemistry between Ryan and Robbins alone is reason enough to see this film, the supporting cast (including Matthau, Fry, Shalub, Durning and the hilarious trio of Jacobi, Saks and Maher) is an additional advantage. Matthau shines like Einstein, Fry is perfect as Ryan's clinical fianc√©, and Shalub's line on the Einstein gonads is, as noted, one of the film's highlights. The speech that Robbins makes in his first appearance in public is pure poetry. Congratulations to the writers for handling this foam with wit and lightness. I also thought that Keene Curtis was wonderful as Eisenhower. This could be considered a girl movie, but I think everyone will love it. Eight very solid points.
