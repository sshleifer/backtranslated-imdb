['(SPOILERS IN FIRST PARAGRAPH) The anti-German sentiment in this movie seems painfully outdated now, but it&#39;s a shining example of the great wartime propaganda. It was done when Cecil B. DeMille was still a great director. (Ignore all his recent Academy Awards for Best Picture, he never made a very good sound movie). This movie lacks the comedy of most of Pickford&#39;s other films, and it really was DeMille&#39;s film, not Pickford&#39;s. The vilification of the Germans can be compared to the way in which &quot;The Patriot&quot; of 2000 did the same with the British. The only good German in the film was a reluctant villain who had the ironic name of Austreheim. They even made Pickford take a bad trip on a luxurious ship that was torpedoed by a German submarine. So, what is going to make Americans feel more at war? The sinking of the Lusitania, or seeing how the favorite Canadian import from the United States sinks into it? Throughout the film, DeMille takes his protagonist from one type of horrible calamity to another, almost without escaping death, hypothermia, depravity, rape, execution and explosions that occur in the right place for keep her unharmed. The way he escaped from a firing squad is no more credible than the way humans in the &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; were rescued from the velociraptors. If I were more gullible to such propaganda, I would punish myself for having a German ancestry. <br /><br /> Was it a good movie? Apart from a comical joke about Americans who think they are untouchable, apparently it was a joke even back then, you may not be entertained. You will find it more than a little melodramatic, and obviously one-sided, but the first thing that came to my mind after seeing it was that years passed before Potemkin&#39;s false representation of a massacre revolutionized the language of cinema, as well as a potential of the movie for propaganda. It made me wonder: what became of Cecil B. DeMille? Somewhere between the advent of sound and &quot;The Greatest Show on Earth,&quot; he seemed to lose his ambition. Ben Hur seemed expensive, but not ambitious. In a sentence, this film is for 1) film historians, 2) silent moviegoers, 3) Mary Pickford fans, or 4) DeMille fans, if such a person exists.']
