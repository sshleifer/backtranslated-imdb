The team of Merian Cooper and Ernest Schoedsack produced a documentary of 50,000 people from Bakhtiari and her animals about summer migration to winter grazing. The basic value of this film today is like a time capsule of a "forgotten people" and how they lived during what in the West we knew as the "twenties". Could not imagine a more drastic contrast. The raging river and the crossings of barefoot mountains are brutally realistic and, in fact, the animals that disappear under water die. To make sure that the audience of the time believed that the story took place, in the end a signed certificate of authenticity is offered. The version I saw had a fascinating Iranian music that can be independent and appreciated without the film. Having said all this, the film is probably of more value to the anthropologist than to the casual viewer in search of a good evening of entertainment. The team barely had enough material to take the shots they recorded and there is no elegant camera work as a result of multiple shots. Western intertitles detract from the experience but, in fact, are part of the record, as they show how Hollywood tried to turn the lives of indigenous peoples around for the public to appreciate. Off-duty entertainment by the desert police becomes a "police ball". The producers went on to do the docu-drama Chang (1927) and the fully commercial King Kong (1933). The issue of migration is used again in People of the Wind (1976) and Himalaya (1999). Recommended for those who know in advance what they are getting into, and then highly recommended for them.
