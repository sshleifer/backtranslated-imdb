What can you say when you see a good French film that tries to draw a suspense story in line with the social background of the characters? The main point is that we believe in those characters and, once they have met, we want them to stay together. It is simple and really efficient. The background story is less important. Why does the script go from the side of a thriller to half develop? It helps not to get stuck in those social demonstrations that most French moviegoers like to do. It is not too ambitious, to the right: South mes l√®vres is just an entertaining French film with a good characterization. <br /> <br /> For all the intelligence points at the end of the script, the ending is too easy. It is as easy as in the back window (an obvious reference and definitely not a black film) but with a less convincing context. What surprises me is to see that the character of the parole officer has not been erased. It contributes very little to history; when it appears we only wonder if we have not lost a part before. Jacques Audiard is not a newcomer yet. Strange and strange.
