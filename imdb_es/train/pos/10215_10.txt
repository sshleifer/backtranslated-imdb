Most people who pursue movies that show Audrey Tautou seem not to understand that Amelie was a character; it is not really Audrey Tautou's real life personality, therefore, each film in which he participates will not be Amelie part 2, part 3, etc. <br /> <br /> Now with that said, I also chose this movie simply because Audrey was in it. Yes, it's true, there is a big void after the first scene in which it has not been seen in anything for about 45 minutes, but I did not even miss it because I was having a lot of fun with the other characters. The guy who lies about everything is too funny, the guy who justifies the people who run out of their cafeteria and skip the bill looking for coupons and make up for the loss, actually ... entering all the characters here could take a good time, but this is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> The character of Audrey Tautou, Irene, is not the exaggerated sugary girl that was Amelie. In fact, like Irene, her rudeness to a bum who asked for a change caught me off guard at first. In this film, Irene is a girl with good intentions, but in the course of one (very terrible) day, her disposition becomes increasingly bitter and pessimistic. <br /> <br /> What makes this film is really cool is you Have all these stories and plots really interesting ... very entertaining to watch, great scenery and shots, very colorful and never too slow, and all the Characters can act. The best part of the film comes with about 20 minutes remaining ... this is when all the plots start to fit and the journey really starts, everything comes together and makes sense, and the whole butterfly effect blooms. I swear, they were the best 20 minutes of film I've seen in a long time, and the end ... It made me think that "I was really lucky to find this movie". The end of this movie is top notch. Whoever wrote the script for this is brilliant, because not only are all these other subplots happening, but they somehow make them all come together (and in a sensible way, as is the case here), but also so that Each character feels human and comes alive, not just an old person used as a crutch to create this butterfly effect ... very impressive. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie, since it is a great movie to watch at any time, in any mood, with any company or alone.
