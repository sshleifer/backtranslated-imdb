A chance meeting between a salesman and a hit man changes their lives. This is a strange movie that works, an awesome effort for writer and director Shepard. In a daringly unattractive role that is far from James Bond, Brosnan is surprisingly effective as the lone hit man who begins to give in to the stress of his job, but can not connect emotionally with anyone to help him cope. Kinnear is just as good as the salesman, a decent guy with a void in his life. Davis is fine as Kinnear's flirtatious woman. Mainly a study of characters, the film is rewarding because it feels fresh and unpredictable, an extremely dark comedy.
