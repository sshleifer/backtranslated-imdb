['This work is surprising in its accurate representation of adolescent life at the time of its execution. Although this is a broad generalization, parents at that time were too self-absorbed to be real parents, and those at home tended to be too distracted from real problems, as far as their children were concerned. <br /><br /> This film teaches us how to let go, even when it is painful, and does so with a sweet, melancholy, but informed style by which Foster speaks philosophically about feeling the pain of life. I loved that scene. It was my favorite scene in the movie, actually. <br /><br /> The transition from the funeral to the wedding was meant to show that life goes on, and we must too. Baio skateboarding through a group of thugs and overcoming them was intended to show us that difficult times will pass, and we are destined to overcome them, to better times. <br /><br /> All the metaphor of &quot;move on&quot; and the procession of life, is present throughout the film and serves to give us hope, in the end. <br /><br /> I like this movie, although I do not see it often, since it tends to make me melancholy. <br /><br /> Young children should not see it, and probably only those who grew up in the 70s and 80s would want to see it. <br /><br /> Rate a 7.4 / 10 from ... <br /><br /> the demon:.']
