"Fear Of A Black Hat" is all that (CBB) 4 (much weaker) MUST have been. The satirical eye of Rusty Cundieff is ruthless, as it folds, positions and mutilates all aspects of hip hop trends and culture. Does "FoaBH" look like spinal puncture? Yes a little bit. Is it derived from Spinal Tap? No, not really. The goal is more focused, the satire is better focused and, to be honest, it's more fun.
