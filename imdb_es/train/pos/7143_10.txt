"Holes" is my favorite movie of all time! So far I've seen this movie three times in theaters and I want to buy it on DVD next September. I read the book after watching the movie and I was surprised at how similar the book and the film were. The director of this movie did an excellent job of recreating the book in the form of a movie. In addition, all the actors selected to play the roles did wonderful acting their characters, especially Max Kasch as ZigZag. We support all those involved in making this film, it was a real success! 10 out of 10 stars, I definitely recommend it for everyone to see it!
