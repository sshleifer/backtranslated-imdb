I saw this movie recently. 2 hours later, my head still hurt to laugh. The plot was so horrible, the jokes were very bad, but the ones I did not count on were: <br /> <br /> 1. the 2 scenes before and after the movie in which Pat and Jay posed (which caused more that enough laughter) <br /> <br /> 2. The kick through the windshield that beheaded the evil one. <br /> <br /> This movie is about 20 times better than the Rush Hour series, and my copy even came with a warning message saying that if you did not like the movie, send certificate to HBO. Although I considered it, the date on which he had to send it was in January of 1991 (which also caused an oversight to occur).
