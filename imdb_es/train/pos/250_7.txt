Those who know that they know the "legend" of Kelly and hope that this film is an accurate representation of his life can be disappointed with the creative license that was taken with this film (for example, the character of Naomi Watt never existed in reality). ), but if you look at it simply as a piece of entertainment, it holds up pretty well. The performance of the Ledgers in the main role is quite solid, taking the mantle of the best Ned of the cinema (not difficult considering that the previous Ned include Yahoo Serious, Mick Jagger and the former champion of Carlton (Australian Rules Football), Bob Chitty, a great football player but a bad actor, a film in the area where I live, Bacchus Marsh on the outskirts of Melbourne, as well as Clunes and Ballarat.
