A very well filmed movie in the early 60s communist Yugoslavia. The five young actors who are teenagers at the center of the story give strong, sincere and emotionally profound performances. A clear representation of how the natural confidence and naivety inherent in adolescents can be easily manipulated and how that affected the rest of their lives. Highly recommended
