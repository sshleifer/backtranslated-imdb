This is really a funny show, done in a creepy way, like a Tim Burton movie. It is worth seeing, since it is much more creative than most of the shows this season. Best of all, it is not a "reality show". I wonder why the public is so willing to accept programs like that (which lack creativity) and ignore wonderful programs like this that really have a creative bent. <br /> <br /> Although some denounce the premise, I think it's really unusual. Much nicer than "Ghost Whisperer" and "Medium". I think it's the funniest tube thing since "My Name is Earl". <br /> <br /> Oh, and the narration and the music are wonderful. If you like programs that are a little out of the ordinary, I recommend it. It's not as strange as Twin Peaks was, but it has a serious problem.
