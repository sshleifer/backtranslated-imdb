Blonde and Blonder has Pamela Anderson and Denise Richards in almost every scene and if you want more than one movie, you are being absolutely unreasonable. It feels like the end of the Carry On era, when the series was no longer making its way, it was even more fun than ever, think of Behind or England and it will not be so far from the brand. Pamela and Denise are bubbly, charming and clearly aware that this is not a masterpiece they are doing, although you can give me many things that I have been told to like. Support actors are energetic, even if some of them are not particularly good; I can not see a couple of duffs in a movie that is almost forgotten and that makes a lot of difference in anything, so smile. I really believe that Blonde and Blonder is an ace and I hope you hate me for that.
