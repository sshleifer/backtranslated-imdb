I thought Mr. Dreyfuss was perfect for his role as an actor and dictator. His co-star, Mr. Julia, played his equally perfect role. It was interesting to see how reluctant Richard Dreyfuss was to replace the dictator against his will. But he became more confident and comfortable with the paper as time passed. Since everything happens for a reason in life, I think he was forced to replace the dictator because he was destined to remain there for the whole year he did it. I guess he stayed because he was supposed to see how good his life was compared to the poverty he had witnessed at the Parador. I think he took too many things for granted in life and needed to get a real grip on reality by staying in that country as long as he did. <br /> <br /> But ......... .. anyway ........... that's why I gave this movie a 7 out of 10.
