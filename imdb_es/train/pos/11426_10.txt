I think this movie would be more pleasant if everyone saw it as an image of colonial Africa in the 50s and 60s instead of a story. Because there is no real history here. Just one vignette on top of another as small points of light that do not mean much until you have enough to paint an image. The first time I saw Chocolat I really did not "understand" it until I thought about it for a few days. Then I realized that there were many things to "get", including the end of colonialism, which was just around the corner, but there was no plot. Anyway, it's one of my favorite movies of all time. The scene at the airport with the brief shower and the beautiful music was pure poetry. If you like "exciting" movies, do not look at this, you'll get bored to tears. But, for some of you ..., you can thank me later for recommending it.
