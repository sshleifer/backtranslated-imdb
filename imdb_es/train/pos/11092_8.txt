52-Pick Up never received the respect it should have. It works on many levels and has a complicated plot that can be followed. The actors involved give some of their best performances. Ann-Margret, Roy Scheider and John Glover are perfectly distributed and offer deep representations of the characters. Also notable are Vanity, who should have turned this into a serious acting career given the unexpected ability it shows, and Kelly Preston, who is the character that will chase you for a few days. Anyone who likes the action combined with a complicated story, will enjoy this
