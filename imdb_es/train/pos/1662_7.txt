['Artemisia&#39;s film can be considered treason, or as a true artistic license. <br /><br /> What could be an aver? <br /><br /> In the documented history, Artemisia Gentileschi was subjected to a hand screw, and she even claimed that she was a reporter, as Mary Garrard and Gloria Steinem have eloquently affirmed. <br /><br /> In the film, under a different torture, she refused to condemn her lover / rapist. <br /><br /> How can a film deviate so much from the received history, and still inform the human heart? <br /><br /> The answer is not that hard to find. In the film, the director and the cast had filled a huge hole in the historical record, with the power of imagination. <br /><br /> That led to a conclusion that differs from the record. <br /><br /> So be it. I think both the record and the film are convincing. <br /><br /> Both in the film and (apparently) in the story, Artemisia was a painter, first of all. <br /><br /> For that vision, framed in a dazzling cinematographic composition (sic), I am truly grateful. <br /><br /> Rarely have I seen a movie that forced my eyes. <br /><br /> David Broadhurst']
