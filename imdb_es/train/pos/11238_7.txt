Hidden Frontier is a show made by fans, in the world of Star Trek. The story takes place after the Voyager has returned from the Delta quadrant. It has some characters from the official Star Trek shows, but most of them are originals of the show. The show takes place in the Deep Space 12 base and in several spacecraft, which gives opportunities that official shows do not have. The characters have the opportunity to move up the hierarchy, which the characters that are shown with only one ship do not have. The show has a good computer animation of spaceships, but the action takes place in front of the green screen and gives a green glow to the actors. Not all actors are equally good, but most do well. The episodes are driven by the character and the characters develop over many episodes. That's a bit more like in Babylon 5, than in most of the official Star Trek shows. Hidden Frontier takes taboos that even the official series has not used. In general I enjoyed watching it.
