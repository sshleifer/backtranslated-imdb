Besides the fact that my list of favorite movie creators is: 1) Stanley Kubrick 2) God Allmighty 3) the rest ... this movie is better than the book (and the television miniseries, although it's an easy feat, taking account to the director). Impeccable filming style, acting and (Kubrick's number one skill of all time) music make it the masterpiece of horror. A few years ago I saw the television miniseries, I liked the story and I had a lot of hopes when I made it. I LOVE ME! It is much better than I had ever imagined. It starts slow (registered trademark of Kubrick) and has a lot of downtime that accumulates the suspense. The introduction scene is a classic by all means and I saw it about 20 times just because of the sharp atmosphere that induces the whole movie. In addition, the film does not offer much blood (it only has enough and it is not at all insipid) a tendency that I hate in the horror films of the last days. Just look at it!
