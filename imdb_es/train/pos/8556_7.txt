This movie is simply fun. I have nothing to do with the original America Pie, but it's fun to watch. <br /> <br /> Another attempt, but better than Band camp and The naked mile, at least more fun. <Br /> <br /> Right after the first five minutes, I started to laugh, so I decided to call my friend and we would see him together. We had a few beers and had fun. <br /> <br /> You will not find any deep message in this movie, but it's worth seeing. <br /> <br /> Then, lie back and enjoy.
