Only 9/10 on my part, a perfect ten would have been if there were more than one plot of the film, but to this day, Moonwalker is still a fun festival of music, dance and entertainment. Beginning with the montage of the videoclips of Jackson's long career, he reminds the viewer why he is often considered "The King of Pop." From his success "Te quiero de vuelta" to "Somos el mundo", the award-winning charity album for the benefit of Africa. After this, a short film of all kinds, but without a gloss in an Oscar-winning script, offers a fantastic and entertaining drama for the audience. Finishing with a perfect interpretation (sexy!) Of 'Come Together'. Something that the whole family can see and enjoy.
