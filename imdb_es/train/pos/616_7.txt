If any style of movie could be called my "guilty pleasure", it would be this kind of generic fantasy. However, guilty is the wrong word, since I am pleased to be an escapist from time to time. "Stardust" is a good fantasy material, like the one one should expect from Neil Gaiman (or Gaiman's adaptation, so to speak). It's not Mirrormask's visual dream, it's not the adult pretense of Pan's Labyrinth, and it's not the classic fun-loving The Princess Bride, but it contains exactly what the fantasy lover is familiar enough to be completely comfortable with. the whole vision. Fantasy lovers should rejoice: the special effects work has finally become good enough and cheap enough for this material to be in regular production now. <br /> <br /> The story of Stardust involves a young man named Tristan who, in order to win the love and approval of the most beautiful girl in his small town of Wall, goes on an adventure to recover a fallen star. However, to make things difficult, the fallen star of Tristan is actually a woman named Yvaine, and he is not the only one who is looking for her ... some witches have their greedy eyes on the immortality that the heart of the star can give , and the fight of a brother by the magical kingdom leads the murderous princes in his direction. <br /> <br /> From there everything is quite predictable, but it involves some attractive fantasy elements, some warm comments about the nature of love and the best part, Robert DeNiro. like a gay pirate In that sense, DeNiro's performance is right ... it's not the excess of brightness that most actors use to portray gay people, but a surprisingly effective one used by someone who is used to being seen as a typecast character and typecast (therefore, ongoing joke surrounding his character that coincides with the opening of DeNiro in alternative ways of acting). DeNiro has not been so exclusive of his own image from Brazil, and that is saying something. <br /> <br /> Stardust is the kind of movie, perhaps, that will linger on the shelves of children and fantasy lovers for a long time. . I can not say I offer something new, but it's not really there. In fact, those who are most familiar with their tropes are the ones who will most enjoy it. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
