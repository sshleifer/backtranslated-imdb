I took some old musicals out of my garage and this is another one of my favorites. It was written by Jay Alan Lerner and directed by Vincent Minelli. He won two Academy Awards for Best Film of 1951 and Best Screenplay. The story of an American painter in Paris who tries to succeed. Nina Foch is a sophisticated media lady and is very interested in helping him, but soon discovers that she loves man. Meanwhile, Gene Kelly falls in love with the lovely damsel, Leslie Caron. Your main dance partner, and I must say they are fantastic together on the floor and otherwise. The famous French singer Georges Guietary also sings. So if you like good smooth dancing and fun scenes full of Oscar Levant's nimble piano fingers, George Gershwyn's songs will live forever in this colorful jewel. 8/10
