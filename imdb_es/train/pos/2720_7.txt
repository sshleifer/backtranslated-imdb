IN COLD BODER has to be classified as a first-rate film, even if the subject is as bleak as it is in the fantasy world, but black film fans should definitely find this exciting work, based on a crime wave of real life. <br /> <br /> It opens with the music of Quincy Jones under the dramatically dramatic credits and visions of a highway bus heading for Kansas City, effectively shaping the mood of the movie Even before they finish the credits. The black and white photography of Conrad Hall does an excellent job from the beginning. <br /> <br /> It's also clear from the beginning: ROBERT BLAKE and SCOTT Wilson are born actors. They do a great job portraying free energetic friends looking for the next thrill. "Have you ever seen a millionaire fry electric hair?" "Hell no, there are two kinds of rules in this world, one for the rich and one for the poor," says Wilson, taking a drink of alcohol at the wheel. <Br /> <br /> Both are destined to cross the path of a family of farmers, without showing mercy and without leaving witnesses behind. <br /> <br /> Blake, remembering the movies and thinking about looking for gold in Mexico, says: "Remember Bogart in 'The Treasure of the Sierra Madre'?" (An ironic moment, because Blake was in the movie when he was a little boy selling lottery tickets). "I have you looking for a killer by birth," Wilson tells Blake. <br /> <br /> JOHN FORSYTHE is one of the leading detectives in the case, upon discovering that the four members of the family were tied up, with a shot to the head. and one's throat was cut. "The people here do not close the doors?" asks PAUL STEWART. "They will do it tonight," is the brief response. <br /> <br /> After the murders, the killers discover that "there is not a big safe on the wall," as the prison informant told them. Then, in the end, it was really a stupid and senseless crime. The question is: WHY did they do it? And this is something that the second half of the film explores in depth. The film takes an hour and a half before the detectives catch up with the killers and begin the interrogation. <br /> <br /> It is these final scenes that bear the greatest conviction and the greatest interest, according to the children. I have made numerous mistakes and left a living witness. Actual events up to and including murder are saved until the end. "It does not make sense," Blake tells Forsythe. "Mr. Cutter was a very nice gentleman, I thought so until I cut his throat." The script by Richard Brooks is concise and to the point, and so is his address. <br /> <br /> Summing up: Brilliant depiction of two young people aimlessly in a crime wave that made no sense then or now for a single $ 43.
