I was hooked from start to finish. The great horror comes from the disturbing images and the organic shocks that are created not to make you jump, but to make you go "What the hell did I just see?" All the other commentators gave brief summaries of what the film is about, so I will not repeat what has already been said. I told other people about this film days after having seen it only because it was still chasing me. I even had a bad dream after seeing it, and I'm a true horror fan, who does not easily scare me with guts like "The Grudge" or even "Silent Hill". What gave me the bad dreams was the uneasiness I felt for what I would do if I were in that cell with those guys. What would be my personal horror? My subconscious took me there, and it was not pleasant. That my friends is what makes you a good horror movie! The best part of this movie is that it is subtle. It's not about Bogeymen jumping on you, alien invasions or tons of blood. It's the opposite. The horror that you create in your own mind. The irony of the four characters is that the horror does not come from an external force that asserts their power over them. Simply, men ask for the only thing they want, and they get it ... but not in the way they imagined. Then, on the one hand, they get what they want from a hidden book, but ultimately they may wish they had not. Sometimes being locked in a cell is the best place to be!
