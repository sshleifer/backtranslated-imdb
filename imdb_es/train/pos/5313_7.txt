Since I'm not a fan of almost any of John Waters' "Desperate Life" movies, I was excited about "Pecker." After he emerged from hiding, Waters produced versions of his earlier works ("Cry Baby", "Polyester", Hairspray "lite") that for the harder fanatics looked and tasted like watery liquor. "Pecker", which does not try to regurgitate the first successes, is a light, calm and humble commentary on the whims of celebrities and the pretension of the art world. Waters clearly knows this topic well because he has also exposed and sold (at ridiculous prices) some of the Edward Poplong is fine as "Pecker" and Waters' non-histrionic style is at ease with the amateur "pop art" that he never imagined someone I could give it away if it was not adorned with the "name" of Waters. the topic.
