Like The Jeffersons, Good Times was one of those classic American comedies that never aired in the UK, not to mention that it emerged in the 1970s, a decade in which it had not yet been born. <br /> <br /> But like most of the program's fans, I saw some episodes on You Tube, and then, I loved it. <br /> <br /> The Evans family is headed by James and Florida, two parents who try to reach their end meet, and who despite their lack of qualifications, encourage their children, who have their own aspirations in life, to meet them and take risks. James was the strict but loving father, who did not dare to discipline J.J, Michael and Thelma, in case they overstepped the line. Whereas Florida, in contrast, was a fair, kind and considerate mother, and a loving wife, although in many ways it was similar to James, with respect to his attitudes toward fatherhood and family values ​​from an African-American perspective. <br /> <br /> The children were as lively and entertaining as the parents: JJ was an aspiring artist with a silly personality and a crazy sense of humor, who often wore suits of various colors, and whose "DY-NO -MITE "The phrase is as contagious and familiar as the 'Whatchoo talking' about Arnold Jackson about Willis? of Diff'rent Strokes. Michael was the smart alec, who dreams of becoming a lawyer, while Sister Thelma had her own dreams and hopes. His verbal jokes with JJ were mostly fun, as was the love / hate relationship between brother and sister, which was very well played by Mike Evans and Bernadette Stanis. <br /> <br /> Throughout the seasons, there were a few appearances, mostly by Janet Jackson, Debbie Allen and a young Gary Coleman as himself. In fact, I prefer Good Times to say, The Cosby Show, which was a program of the 80s because a) I prefer the Evans family over the Huxtables, both in terms of a) characterization and b) since I felt that it addressed serious social problems and difficult, in a way that resonated with many viewers. It was a comedy, but it was also a social commentary whose goal was to highlight the lives of the working class, the African-Americans in the United States of the seventies. The Cosby Show attempted to cater to the general audience in a 'candy-coated' manner, since the Huxtables were portrayed as Blacks that easily assimilated into a high-class culture in the United States with which we would associate the Whites, while that Good Times, on the other hand, was much more 'Edgier' and was not afraid to address issues such as drug and child abuse realistically. In fact, I found that although The Cosby Show can be fun to watch sometimes, it lacked that part of "sassiness" that Good Times has and which made it more modern and fresh. <br /> <br /> The show jumped to perfection. Shark during the last few seasons, as he continued after the character of John Amos, James died in an accident (actually, it was known at that time that John had left Good Times forever.) And so, the death of his character was written as is in the show). Without John, the program suffered and, unfortunately, lost much of its charm. <br /> <br /> Even so, for a sitcom, Good Times fulfilled all the requirements. If only they had shown this in the United Kingdom during the 80s. As it certainly is, as JJ would say, 'DY-NO-MITE !! <br /> <br /> My rating: 8 and a half
