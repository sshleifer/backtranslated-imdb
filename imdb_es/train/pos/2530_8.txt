One of the joys of collecting the recent collection of Bela Lugosi is to be able to watch lovely films like The Invisible Ray. Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi come together in a film that delves into meteorites and radiation, and while science is perfectly absurd (especially the camera technique that Karloff, as Janos Rukh, used to determine the site of a certain meteorite) and frankly laughable, I did not care about the lease because the movie is very nice. The effects are well done at the moment, the performance is excellent and the finish is particularly strong. It reminds me of the comics and science fiction novels of the 1940s and 50s, complete with lightning weapons and ridiculous science. You must see this movie!
