['I saw this movie when I was little, it was called &quot;Glacier Fox&quot;. I was totally traumatized by that! Follow a nice family of little foxes around. The beginning was great and I remember that I became very attached to the little foxes. I also remember that my mother took me out of the theater when I was hysterical. I will not tell you what happened, but let&#39;s say it does not end well for all the foxes. I was used to Disney-type nature movies where animals do not REALLY die. Oh man This movie made me cry for hours. It was a good movie ... I think it was very small and the truth, all I remember is to be happy for the foxes and then watch one of them die. Rent it if you can, but do not show your children!']
