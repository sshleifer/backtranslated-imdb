Do not expect a representation of the "truth". However, the accounts of these veterans of the Iraqi and Afghan wars require careful consideration. <br /> <br /> The film's greatest strength is that it vividly portrays the words and war wounds of these veterinarians and their post-war struggles to rebuild a certain degree of normalcy and functionality in their lives. <br /> <br /> My main criticism of the film is twofold: it is unilateral and advocates anti-war activism, but only to correct the serious deficiencies of the Military and Veterans Affairs programs to help those that 'I have suffered and continue to suffer the traumas of war. These are NOT fatal flaws of the movie. <br /> <br /> As a veteran, I know that the horrible consequences of war are real, and these young men and women express it very well. These veterans vividly describe the pain and physical and mental torment experienced by most veterans and that ordinary people need to understand why the horrors of ALL wars are so traumatic and disturbing.
