I saw this movie on Thursday night after having had a really boring day. I had no expectations, the ones I had were quite negative. Being that the only movie I've seen Jimmy is the American version of Taxi with Queen Latifah (?) ... Do not ask why! But seriously ... this movie is so cute! Drew Barrymore is always sweet, but I almost fell in love with the character of Fallon. Why can not I meet a cute nerd like that? :) Movies like that are excellent. Simple, sweet and necessary. Sunday on Thursdays. I'm not even a sports fan, but it's something about American movies with baseball that fascinates me. Probably the fact that we do not have that sport here in Norway. <br /> <br /> (My first comment ever). LOL.
