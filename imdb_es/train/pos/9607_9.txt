This is a movie that should be seen by anyone interested, affected or suffering from an eating disorder. It is an incredibly accurate and sensitive portrait of bulimia in a teenager, its causes and symptoms. The girl is played by one of the brightest young actresses working in the movies today, Alison Lohman, who was then so spectacular in "Where the Truth Lies." I would recommend that this film be shown in all schools, as you will never see a better one on this topic. Alison Lohman is absolutely exceptional, and one marvels at her ability to convey the anguish of a girl who suffers from this compulsive disorder. If the barometers tell us the air pressure, Alison Lohman tells us the emotional pressure with the same degree of precision. His emotional range is so precise, that each scene could be measured microscopically by his graduations of trauma, on a scale of growing hysteria and desperation that reaches an unbearable intensity. Mare Winningham is the perfect choice to play his mother, and he does it with immense sympathy and a range of emotions as sharp as those of Lohman. Together, they make a pair of sensitive emotional oscillators that vibrate in resonance with each other. This movie is really an amazing achievement, and director Katt Shea should be proud of it. The only reason not to see it is if you are not interested in people. But even if you like movies more than nature, this is, after all, animal behavior on the edge. Bulimia is an extreme version of how a tormented soul can destroy his own body in a frenzy of despair. And if we do not sympathize with people who suffer the depths of despair, then we are dead inside.
