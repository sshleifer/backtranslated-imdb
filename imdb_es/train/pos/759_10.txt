For many people, Beat Street has inspired their lifestyle in something creative related to hip hop culture. <br /> <br /> Young Lee lives in New York in the 80s, when hip hop was in its infancy. He is a member of the crew of "Beat Street" -a crew of b-boy. The movie follows Lee on his average day, dancing, doing graffiti, etc. <br /> <br /> The director has managed to make a movie with an argument and at the same time present hip hop to the rest of the world. The movie has old-school features like <br /> <br /> Afrika Bambaataa & the Soul Sonic Force, Grandmaster Melle Mel & the Furious Five, Rock Steady Crew, New York City Breakers and many more ... <br / > <br /> Neither the Beat Street movie nor the spirit of Beat Street will ever die.
