In my opinion, this is a pretty good celebrity parody show. I enjoyed watching Greg Kinnear as the host. There are many reasons why I said that. Even though Hal Sparks was a good host, sometimes I wish Greg Kinnear had not left. If you ask me, it seems that no one is left with a television program during his entire career. However, I enjoyed watching the various hosts and other people cheating celebrities. If you ask me, that was pretty fun. Before finishing this, I must say that I miss this show a bit. Now, in conclusion, I strongly recommend this program to all the fans of the sketches shows. You will really enjoy it.
