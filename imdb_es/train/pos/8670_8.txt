WWE Armageddon, December 17, 2006 - Live from the Richmond Coliseum, Richmond, VA <br /> <br /> Kane vs. MVP in an Inferno game: So this is the fourth game of inferno in WWE and it's Kane vs. MVP (I wonder why it was the first game on the card). I only saw the final parts where Kane sets fire to MVP's ass when they're on the apron and then MVP runs down the sand while screaming. Finally, the referees put out the fire with a fire extinguisher while the MVP extends around the entrance ramp. Final fun and visually quite entertaining. 7/10 <br /> <br /> WWE Tag Team Championship: originally it was supposed to be William Regal and Dave Taylor against Brian Kendrick and Paul London (c) in a regular tag team match. However, GM Teddy Long arrives in the ring and announces that it will be a Fatal 4-way tag team ladder match. MNM and The Hardys are launched and everything is in chaos. A word to describe this revelation? Wow. Man, I really can not remember how many sick spots there were in this game and the words can not do it justice. There was a particularly notable place where The Hardys placed a ladder in a rocker position and Jeff jumped off the top rope while Matt held MNM to kill, and then WHAM! Nitro flew away while Mercury apparently ruined it and bled like hell with lacerations on his face. He had to be retired and Nitro continued the game alone. Another place was when Jeff attacked London while jumping off the ladder. There were other impressive high-flying places too many to remember. London finally unbuckles its belts to win this rave show-stealer. 8.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> The Boogeyman vs. The Miz: The two men are thrown in and around the ring until Boogeyman blows up a powerbomb for victory and then drool worms into The Miz's mouth as usual. . 5.5 / 10 for this three-minute question mark. <br /> <br /> Championship of the United States: Chris Benoit (c) faces Chavo Guerrero in another typical match of Guerrero. Some good places included a superplex of Chavo's upper rope and an unusually long string of Benoit German suplexes. Vicki Guerrero comes in the ring with the belt to nail Benoit, but Benoit scares her and it takes a long time to decide whether to put her in a Sharpshooter or not. This allows Chavo to go for a roll-up but Benoit rolls it up once more and Chavo is locked in the Sharpshooter. Game over. Beautiful battle fought but sometimes slow. 7/10 <br /> <br /> WWE Cruiserweight Championship: Gregory Helms (c) against Jimmy Wang Yang for this, in a fairly moderate match. The party had some good high-flying spots? most notably the Helms movements of the upper rope? but the crowd did not seem interested after witnessing the match on the ladder, and Yang needs to fly more. Helms won the game after flying to Yang with a facebuster on his knee. 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> The Undertaker vs. Mr. Kennedy in a Last Ride match: After a series of matches between these two, this time it's a Last Ride match, the second of its kind and the winner has to accompany his opponent out of the arena in a hearse. Pretty good for what these two could offer. Kennedy mistreated a good Taker and even freed himself from a chokeslam to throw Taker from Armageddon that was about 15 feet deep; and thank God for Kennedy, otherwise it would have been brutal. Kennedy almost got the victory until Taker climbs back into the hearse (I liked the view of the camera inside the hearse). Then, Taker missed a steel tube shot at Kennedy and instead broke the hearse's window, but then pulled Kennedy out with a chair and followed with a consecutive chokeslam and Tombstone on the roof of the car. Kennedy was unconscious and Taker pulled him out of the arena to win. In fact, I found myself really interested in the willingness of these guys to take / give really sick vaccines. 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> Santa enters the ring, I say "what the hell?" Like many of the children in the crowd, and then the word "lingerie contest" comes to my ear. Break time. <br /> <br /> Batista and John Cena against Finlay and King Booker: talk about charisma against technicality. This game was actually a pretty good main event, with an impulse that changed rationally from one team to another and kept a good suspense. Even Finlay got some good, legitimate punches against his opponents this time (I doubted a bit of his strength against the champions), and he and Booker could not cheat? except at a point where Booker plunged his scepter into Cena's throat. Batista hits the bomb at Booker for victory, he could not see the F-U; Dinner performed the 5 Knuckle Shuffle anyway and I think he also did the STFU. This was probably the best technical match of the night and the participants did incredibly well for what they could without a 7.5 / 10 ladder. <br /> <br /> Being WWE fans, I have to accept that Armageddon was tied with numerous flashy, and the stair fight finally swallowed half the show; The Last Ride game presented some pretty heartbreaking points, and the main event also did very well for its category. All other parties also lived up to their bills, except maybe the Boogeyman vs. The Miz and the always useless lingerie contest. Overall, Armageddon was a very pleasant pay-per-view and, despite some major setbacks in the PPV chronology, Armageddon wishes this year's goodbye in a respectable way. PPV rating: 8/10.
