As a child I saw this many times, and I remember having whistled the song "Happy Cat" quite often. All the songs are great, and really memorable, unlike many musicals for children, where songs are trapped without any real reason. The scenes and the costumes are splendid, and the performance is very well done, which is not surprising, considering the cast. Christopher Walken is very similar to a cat, and does not need a stupid makeup, or a cat costume for the viewer to believe is a cat transformed into a human. And Jason Connery is so cute, like the shy and uncomfortable son of Miller, Corin, who falls in love with the beautiful and daring Princess Vera. This is a very funny, entertaining and fun movie, in which, unlike most fairy tales, the characters receive personalities. Some of my favorite parts are when Puss makes Corin pretend he's drowning; in the dance when everyone starts dancing a country dance, since it is "all the rage abroad"; when Walken is in the kitchen, dancing at the table (he is also a good dancer!); and when Vera tells Corin all the things she used to do when she was young, like pretending she was the daughter of a miller. I recommend this movie to children and parents alike, who love magic and fairy tales. And it's really a movie that you can watch together, since it will not make adults go up the wall.
