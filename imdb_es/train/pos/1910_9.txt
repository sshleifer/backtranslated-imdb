Already. That is what I think. Of course it was still a great show with John, but personally I think it is much better without him. <br /> <br /> I love that CJ and Grandpa live in the house because they are very funny together. <Br /> <br /> When John was still around, I really did not laugh as much as I do now. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that it is not done anymore. (I do not think ...) because I would love to see new material. <br /> <br /> My favorite character must be Rory. Poor Rory almost always gets left out. It's always about Bridget or Carrie. WHAT HAPPENS WITH RORY? Honestly, this is a great show and for anyone who has never seen it, you should go see it. I almost guarantee you will laugh. Well, even laugh.
