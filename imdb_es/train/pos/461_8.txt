Since this movie has many good entertainment qualities, I think it should have more credit than it has been given in Imdb. <br /> <br /> It's your "who did it?" Thriller with sex and murder but it keeps you guessing until the end. I like this type of film and I certainly think that it meets the standard. <br /> <br /> For me it was worth seeing more than once, so I will give you an 8 in imdb.
