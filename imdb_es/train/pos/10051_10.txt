Family problems abound in real life and that's what this movie is about. Love can keep members together through trials and tests, and that's what this movie is about. A man, dad, has the maturity and strength to support the family in the face of adversity. Children grow up, one being everything, in the most difficult way, to realize that no matter how old they or their parents are, parents still love their children and are willing to provide them with a mattress when they fall. All the actors that portray their characters made outstanding performances. Yes, I shed a tear on the road knowing that I had had similar experiences, both as a young adult and later as a father. This reality of life is something that all young adults and parents should see, although some will not realize until they are also parents. A must for those who care about their families.
