Here in Brazil it is very rare to see a good Brazilian movie, and Brant's new movie is exactly one of these gems. There are some flaws in the movie, of course, but they are very minimal. The direction and the acting in this movie are very good! <br /> <br /> I can not wait to see another new Brant movie!
