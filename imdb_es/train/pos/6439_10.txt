I went to see this movie twice in a week and I can only summarize it in one word (which I do not normally use lightly): Wonderful! In my opinion, the best movie ever made. Who deserves the Oscars and other awards if not this Swedish team that has created cinematic perfection in the last scenes of the film, when everything that is said (and left unsaid) throughout the story is drawn together ? Just as the character of Daniel Dareus evokes so many feelings and feelings repressed for a long time inside the people that surround him, the film does the same with its spectators: you leave with your head upset and your heart full. Good thing! The next time you ask yourself "what is the meaning of life", maybe you think about how you feel after a sumptuous experience like In Heaven: happy, happy, satisfied. To say it with Mrs. Dalloway of Virginia Woolf: "Such moments are enough".
