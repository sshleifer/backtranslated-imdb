This is a jewel of a movie, not only for people who like fun and quirky facilities, but they love the history and traditions of science fiction movies and classic Hollywood movies. Each alien of the Martian crew is the embodiment of a classic science fiction character or member of Hollywood royalty and it's a pleasure to see them bounce off each other and with the residents of Big Bean.
