There are too many new styles of sitcom, but the one that works best is the old style with an audience and an indoor stage. The Show of the 70s is a great example. When the show aired, no one really knew about Kurtwood Smith and Debra Jo Rupp, much less the teenagers played wonderfully by Topher Grace and Ashton Kushton (both will leave the show this year to pursue other interests). I would like Topher to stay around because the show started on his character, Eric, and his close circle of friends. Ashton is already the John Travolta of our time. Remember that when John was in love with Diana Hyland of Eight Is Enough, think of Ashton with Demi Moore. We never met the cast of actors, which is good because a famous cast member can spoil it. I miss Mo Gaffney, who played Don's girlfriend, Joanne. I miss Lisa Robin Kelly as the original Laurie, the replacement could not match her and I regret it. I liked the casting of Tommy Chong as the lost and beloved father figure of Steven Hyde. I loved seeing Tanya Roberts in addition to Charlie's Angels. I loved Brooke Shields playing Jackie's mother. She really showed her talent as an actress before heading to Broadway. This show has been a delight with many surprises. I hope this program lasts longer even if two of its cast members leave, but I hope they do not get too far away. I would like the creators of the show, Bonnie and Terry Turner, who also created my other favorite show, Third Rock from The Sun, to be more successful on Fox than on NBC who sabotaged their show. The Turners are not stupid and I hope they create more programs like this in the future.
