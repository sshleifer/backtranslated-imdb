['I rented Zero Day at the local video store last week. I had never heard of the film and had my reservations about it. Just looking at the box, I knew that the film was an independent film and, therefore, the quality was going to be inferior to a conventional film. <br /><br /> I can tell you that after I finished watching Zero Day, I started doing it right away from the beginning. The film clearly followed the basic outline of what happened at Columbine High School in April 1999, but what impressed me was how credible the two main actors were. The first time I saw this movie, I was not completely sure if what I was seeing were real tapes left by shooters in Columbine. In the back of my mind, I knew that what I was seeing could not be real, but at the same time the performance was so convincing that you had to keep shaking your head. <br /><br /> Is the film disturbing? Absolutely! Are you going to see things that will make you question the merit of the movie? Probably. I think what most people find annoying is that they will actually feel feelings for the two main characters, Calvin and Andre (played by Cal Robertson and Andre Keuck). Why is that problematic for some people? Calvin and Andre are planning a massacre at their high school. I know for myself, I felt an immense sadness for Andre and Calvin. He had empathy for them because their lives had reached such a horrible point. They had fallen so deeply through the cracks that they had started a journey down a road that could have stopped, if only the people around them had noticed their plight. <br /><br /> Zero Day is a phenomenal movie. It gives you a close and personal look at the events to which most of us will only see the conclusion in the news. It leaves you thinking about the lives involved. And it leaves you puzzled how people get to this point. A week after watching this movie, I still think about it. <br /><br /> Those of you who have not seen Zero Day, consider the following: The film is independent, with little or no budget, and the film was shot on video cameras. The material in the film is disturbing. This is not the mainstream of Hollywood and there is no happy ending. <br /><br /> But if you can put all that aside, Zero Day is a movie that will stay with you and maybe help you open your eyes a little.']
