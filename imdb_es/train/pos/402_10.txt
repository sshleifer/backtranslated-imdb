I have previously seen Zu: Warriors from the Magic Mountain. In that movie, the scenario takes place in the mountains of China, the Legend of Zu seems another dimension! Thanks to Tsui Hark for the extensive use of CGI effects. He is able to portray his vision of mountains floating above the clouds, a land where beings fly freely, and powers ranging from sharp wing blades, divided swords and the ultra cool Orb of the Moon. <br /> <br /> While there are many characters in this, the focus is mainly on King Sky and Enigma. The romantic aspect is there, although the film seems much darker than its predecessor. Cecilia Cheung is beautiful and her presence on the screen makes it worth seeing this movie. At first, I like how she looks like the Countess (from Zu Warriors) and she likes to play Enigma when she faces her past life. Oh, by the way, did I mention that Cecilia is very attractive to the eye? <br /> <br /> In truth, Zu Warriors had more comedy elements and their special effects were limited due to their time in 1983. Tsui Hark takes it to a whole new level and sets a new standard in filmmaking.
