A lovely little film set in the United Kingdom about the reunion of a swing band of almost all the girls of World War II. An excellent cast of older people bring joyful perspectives on life to this funny story with an award-winning performance by Dench and Laine, always excellent "pips". Time well spent and a fun watch for everyone.
