Dear readers, <br /> <br /> The final battle between the Rebellion and the Empire. The Second Death Star is about to be completed and, when completed, will mean the downfall of the Rebel Alliance. Luke Skywalker, now a Jedi Knight, returns from Tatooine with Han Solo and Princess Leia, now revealed as Luke's twin sister! They agree to lead the attack on the shield generator on the moon of the Endor forest, while Lando Calrissian leads the attack on the Death Star. Little do they know that a very ingenious trap has been set for them and Emperor Palpatine personally supervises the construction of the Second Death Star. <br /> <br /> The Return of the Jedi is my favorite of the Original Trilogy. It has action, drama, romance, great battles, fantastic acting, amazing fight scenes and incredible music by John Williams. Mark Hamill has fully matured into a Jedi Knight, the naive peasant has left and instead there is a calm and relaxed Jedi determined to save the galaxy. Leia is still good in this movie, like Han and Lando. 3P0, R2 and Chewie fulfill their role in a T, while James Earl Jones is still the best villain in the cinema: Darth Vader. Ian McDiarmid is also an excellent villain as the clumsy and brutally ruthless Emperor Palpatine. The action sequences of this movie are incredibly amazing and the sword fights are serious and gritty. The score of John Williams is still great and improves the film in several levels. <br /> <br /> Signed, the Constant DVD collector
