['Like Dr. Alan Feinstone, Corbin Bernsen presents a wonderfully deranged performance in &quot;The Dentist.&quot; <br /><br /> With his already obsessive compulsive tendencies at full speed, the IRS harassed him and a very suspicious acting wife; Dr. Alan Feinstone is losing his sanity more and more every day. <br /><br /> When Doc really realizes that his wife is having an affair with the local pool boy, it triggers a series of events that lead to torture, murder and total chaos! &quot;The dentist&quot; is a solid movie! Bernsen makes the character of Dr. Feinstone relatable and hateful at the same time. Even though he is completely out of his pumpkin, the public will still feel sympathy towards him. That my friends ..... is very good performance. <br /><br /> A good solid cast of supporting actors completes this gem of a movie. Excellent direction, good murders and gore, and an effective rhythm will keep you entertained throughout the film. <br /><br /> VERY RECOMMENDED!']
