Yesterday I saw "El Mar" and I thought it was a great movie. It begins with an infantile episode in the life of the 3 main personages: Ramallo, Manuel Tur and Francisca. After that, we skipped about 10 years to a hospital where the 3 friends meet again. <br /> <br /> Religion, illness, love, violence and sexuality throughout the film create an intense film full of tension. <Br /> <br /> I see people complaining that the movie is too bloody and I think they did not understand the point of the story. It is a violent, intense and sad story. It is expected that people suffer. Cry. Injure. To bleed. And I think that what the film shows is not done by pure shock value or presented in an unpleasant way. I know some people like their "clean" movies, even those that have violence in them. But sometimes, a movie needs to make you feel uncomfortable to work with. This is one of those movies. And it's a great movie. <br /> <br /> The only flaw I found was that there were 3 or 4 moments in which some details of the plot were not 100% clear, and only after thinking about them at the end of the Movie, did it make sense. But it was not very important for the general story, so I still give this film a 9.
