When I was a kid, I always hated "Cinderella", as my two sisters rejected me when my parents were considering what Disney movie to buy. I wanted "Dumbo", but my sisters won and we got "Cinderella". They enjoyed the movie very much while I sulked in the back of the room playing with my Star Wars action figures. <br /> <br /> A lot has changed since then. My love for Disney theme parks allowed me to do an internship at Walt Disney World, and now I have two nieces. I like to show Disney everything I can, and recently we saw "Cinderella" together. With my new appreciation for all that is Disney, I saw "Cinderella" with a new perspective and I was impressed by what I saw. <br /> <br /> From the beginning of the movie, however, I did not fully understand it. Why was Cinderella trapped in such a horrible situation? Why was she so enslaved to her adoptive family and why could not she just run away? I did not like Cinderella too much, but as the story progressed, I found myself immersed in the story. Maybe the flashy animation or the funny characters attracted me, or maybe it was the timeless songs. Listening to songs like "Bibbidy-Bobbidy-Boo" and "A dream is a wish for your heart" took me to the theme parks. I can imagine myself in that carefree and amusing environment while I watch the impressive Cinderella Castle. <br /> <br /> Something about this movie simply evokes the magic of Disney. That can make a lot of people laugh, but go to the Magic Kingdom and see all the girls dressed as Cinderella who are excited to be in this fantasy world, and you'll know what I'm talking about. The images of Cinderella and the glass slipper, as well as Mickey Mouse, Winnie the Pooh and Tinkerbell, represent the reason why Disney is one of the most loved companies in the world. <br /> <br /> While "Cinderella" may not be the strongest story, it is something iconic in Disney and in the history of the movies. It represents the funny, idealistic and fantasy wonder we had when we were children. I imagine that this movie has a lot of meaning for many, many people. It may not be my favorite Disney movie, but it represents everything I love and admire about the Company. <br /> <br /> My IMDb rating: 10/10. My Yahoo! Grade: A (Outstanding)
