['Cinderella was one of the first films I saw, and for me it is timeless. It is a beautiful film, with a beautiful animation. My favorite animation scene was the dress scene, I love those mice. The songs are also beautiful, not as good as those of Snow White, but they are a delight to sing, and they remind us of Tchaikovsky. A dream is a desire and then this is love? They are outstanding. The characters are also a delight. Cinderella is idealistic and strong, and the mice provided great comic relief. The stepsisters were also well-made, as was Lucifer. But I loved the stepmother the best, she was really evil, compared to a great character in the name of the Fairy Godmother. It&#39;s true, the movie dragged a bit, with the antics of the mice, but they were really fun, so I do not care. I do not think he&#39;s overrated, underestimated, do not you want to say? It rarely plays on television, but the really bad sequel does it at Cinemagic on a regular basis. If you want a great adaptation of Cinderella, try the wonderful Ever After, or the luxurious Slipper and the Rose, which is not so good. But whatever you do, avoid the sequel, I have the mistake of owning, because you will thank me. 9/10. Bethany Cox']
