A thriller of suspense that bears a certain resemblance to Deliverance in terms of landscapes and scenarios. There are also some scenes with very innovative shots and good music, although the silly and sometimes seemingly careless attitude of one of the characters is not appropriate for the situation, although this is not a serious problem. It also raises interesting questions about the justice of revenge and the limits of friendship. <br /> <br />
