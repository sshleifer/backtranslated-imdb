The Scots excel in storytelling. The traditional genre Many years after the event, I can still see in my mind an old woman, the mother of my friend, who retells the Battle of Culloden. She makes the characters come alive. His passion is that of an eyewitness. One of the events in the field drenched about a mile from where he lives. <br /> <br /> Of course, it happened many years before she was born, but you would not guess by the way she tells it. The same story is told in bars throughout Scotland. As I commented with a friend one night in Mallaig, a local court to give his version. The discussion continued until the closing time. <br /> <br /> The stories transmitted in this way become part of our being. Who does not remember the stories our parents told us when we were children? They become our invisible world. And, as we get older, they may still serve as inspiration or emotional reserve. Fiction and fiction merge with aspiration, role models. Warning stories. Archetypes Magic and mystery <br /> <br /> "My name is Aonghas, like my grandfather and his grandfather before him". Our protagonist appears to us. And it also introduces the history that goes back to the generations. Produce stories within the stories. Stories that evoke the impenetrable marvel of Scotland, its rugged mountains shrouded in mists. The stuff of the legend. However, Seach'd is rooted in reality. This is what gives it its special charm. It has an approximate beauty and authenticity, tempered with some of the best Gaelic songs I have ever heard. <br /> <br /> Aonghas (Angus) visits his grandfather at the hospital shortly before his death. It burns with frustration. A part of him yearns to be in the 21st century, hang out in Glasgow. But he is raised on the western coasts between a Gaelic-speaking community. <br /> <br /> However, there is a deeper conflict within him. He longs to know the truth. The truth behind the old stories of his grandfather. Where does fiction end? And he wants to know the truth behind the death of his parents. <br /> <br /> He is drawn to make one last fatal trip, to the top of one of Scotland's most inaccessible mountains. Can you tell the truth? Or is everything in stories? <br /> <br /> In this story about stories, we take up bloody battles, poisoned lovers, the folklore of yesteryear and the sometimes more treacherous folklore of accepted truth. In doing so, we all connect with Angus, since he lives the story of his own life. <br /> <br /> Seachd: The Inaccessible Pinnacle is probably the most honest, unpretentious and genuinely beautiful film in Scotland. Like Angus, I got a little angry on the pretext of hanging stories in more stories. But, also like Angus, I forgave this once I saw the "bigger picture". Forget about the box office pastiche of Braveheart and its like. You could even give up the just-famous dramatization of The Wicker Man. To see a film that is loyal to Scotland, this is probably unique. If you think about it enough, you can even re-evaluate the power of storytelling, and the old question of whether there are some truths that can not be told but can only be experienced.
