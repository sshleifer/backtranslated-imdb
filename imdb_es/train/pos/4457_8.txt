Yes, this is one of the great musical films that I have grown up with, with great artists such as Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly, not to mention the small and glorious voice of Kathryn Grayson. The music and dancing is excellent. I understand that Frank took lessons from Kelly; And there's Kelly dancing with Jerry Mouse, which is quite unique for the time. Betty Garrett plays the waitress who falls in love with Sinatra. She is one of the great underestimated stars of Hollywood. I saw this again on A & E TV and I also have it on my old VCR tapes. Never get tired of these old musicals. What happened to Hollywood?
