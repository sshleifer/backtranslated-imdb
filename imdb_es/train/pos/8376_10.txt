One of the best movies out there. Yes, maybe the cinematography was not the best, but an excellent plot and concept. Ideal for time and bright and creative ideas. Something different from the usual movies and very funny. One of my favorites and I would recommend it to anyone who likes creative and imaginative films. After the 3rd World War and fighting in gigantic robots, the actors gave a great performance and made it worthwhile. The sets are not amazing, but simple and worked for the general appearance of the film. This movie is very hard to find on DVD, but also on VHS. Check it out because I've loved it since it came out. It's not a conventional movie and I do not like anything you've seen. Look and think like a child. It is a great view and very fun.
