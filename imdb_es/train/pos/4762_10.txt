['I thought &quot;The River of Souls&quot; was a very good Babylon 5 movie, with some exceptional performances by Martin Sheen, Tracy Scoggins and Ian MacShane. If this were an episode of the series (without humor), it would probably be one of my favorite favorite stories of the series. <br /><br /> Personally, I&#39;ve always preferred Scoggins to Christian, although he conceded that JMS did not write it too for much of the series and had to endure the plot of Byron / Telepath. If you take the good humor out of the brothel and the &quot;poorer&quot; actors in those scenes, then this movie is solid. Probably my third favorite of the four films, but by no means is it bad at all.']
