I know I would like this movie, and I do it for the most part, but as others have said, it's a bit long on the tooth. I also found that the furious hormones of the male crew are a bit annoying. It's a miracle that they did not start panting and howling at the moons too. I also have to say that in general, the movie leaves me cold. It is a very sterile environment that permeates the film. On the positive side, the effects are excellent (in addition to the cartoon monster), as are the effects, accessories, costumes and, of course, Robbie. If the robot was not in this movie, I do not think it would have been as popular as it was / is. The second half of the film is filled with steam when we begin to investigate the forgotten devices of the "Krell". The times I've seen this movie, the Krell still leaves me scratching my head as to who or what exactly they were. Based on what was happening at the time, in addition to "This Island Earth," Forbidden Planet is miles above the average of science fiction movies of the time. Being filmed in color also adds to your enjoyment. Certainly, a classic in itself, flaws and everything, and deservedly so.
