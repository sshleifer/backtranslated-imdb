Despite the occasional performance and the "seen all" story, this is a pretty compelling movie. <br /> <br /> He has suspense, the scenes with the devil are really quite creepy, some of the images the effects are superb and best of all is that there is no humor ridiculously badly placed to detract from the film, since there are too many horror films (aspirants) now <br /> <br /> honestly, this is not the best movie ever made, but in reality it attracts you and at least you try to develop the character <br /> < I'm glad I saw it
