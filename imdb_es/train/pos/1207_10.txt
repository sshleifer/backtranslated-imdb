I still love it 17 or more years after the first time I saw it, in fact I discovered that I had lost my copy of this and I was very upset. Although it is not associated with the original (which as a child I never noticed and as an adult I do not care), this is how cartoons should be *. Only dark enough to be interesting and clear enough for everyone to enjoy. I am more than happy that my parents have educated me in this kind of thing instead of the cartoons we see today that do not teach anything to our children. The music is great, and it gets stuck in your head forever ... I downloaded the entire soundtrack at one time or another.
