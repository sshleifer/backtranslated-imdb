I loved the October sky. What he loved most had to be music. It worked in two ways: in the first hour of the film, it gives the viewer a time frame. This is done by playing songs from the late fifties. In the second hour, an instrumental score takes over. The music now perfectly adapts to the mood of the film. <br /> <br /> I not only enjoyed the music, but I also enjoyed the cast a lot. Jake Gyllenhaal as Homer Hickam was especially a surprise to me. He gave a first class performance, like Chris Owen (Quentin) and Chris Cooper (John Hickam). <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie about how to escape from the life I've already drawn you twice, and both times I had a lot of fun.
