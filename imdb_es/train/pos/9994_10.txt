"Life sucks" is a parody of life and death, happiness and depression. Black and white always present in our lives. Mel Brooks' performance is brilliant as always, and the work of the other actors is also fine. This movie has a certain Capra flavor, that's why it's so good. <br /> <br /> There are some unforgettable gags like the one that Brooks tries to earn some money dancing on the street and all the people that pass by. just ignore him, or when he meets a funny nut who thinks he's Paul Getty and then starts arguing and slapping himself. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen it, you do not know what you are doing. I've missed <br /> <br /> This film tells us about the eternal and eternal struggle of the poor against the rich. <br /> <br /> The only difference between this movie and the reality is that this movie has a happy ending and the reality is not. <br /> <br /> Yes, life sucks.
