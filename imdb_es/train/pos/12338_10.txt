['Joan Fontaine stars as the villain in this film from the Victorian era. She convincingly interprets the married woman who has a lover aside and also sets her sights on a rich man, Miles Rushworth, who is played by Herbert Marshall. Mr. Marshall is pretty good like Miles. Miss Fontaine did her part perfectly: she was at the same time cunning, calculating, innocent-looking, frightened, and charming. It takes an actress with extraordinary talent to achieve it. Joan Fontaine looked absolutely beautiful in the elegant costumes of Travis Banton. Also in the film is Joan&#39;s mother, Lillian Fontaine as Lady Flora. I highly recommend this movie.']
