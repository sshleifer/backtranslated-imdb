['The genre &quot;gangster&quot; is now a worn issue that is too often subject to parody. In retrospect, the series is the culmination of previous clich√©s that have been used in its genre. Fortunately, writers have advanced in this flaw by creating a realism that has been applied to them. The Sopranos is a saga of epic crimes that illustrates its content with the psychological depth that is characterized by subtle nuances, humor and unvarnished violence. The key protagonist, Tony Soprano, is perceived as a general danger devoid of fear and moral values on the part of his crew, however, Tony is of one person, which is bestial, while the other is in conflict with the fault and the resentment. Without inhibitions or contradictions, I still firmly believe that The Sopranos has the best set of recent memory. After all, I could make an elaborate statement about the series, but I will not. If there is ever a visual dictionary in global consumerism, look for these vital, ambiguous, implacable, epic, intransigent definitions and the shattered face of the sopranos will be smiling.']
