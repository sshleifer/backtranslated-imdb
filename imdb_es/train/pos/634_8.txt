I was one of the 200 people who had the good fortune to see a preview of this movie. <br /> <br /> Stardust follows Tristan, a young man on a quest to find a fallen star and return it to the woman he loves to show his love for her. The only downside is that the star has fallen to the other side of the wall, a door between England and a magical kingdom known as Stormhold. <br /> <br /> This movie was a joy to watch, it has something to do with it. It is for everyone, all the action scenes are beautifully represented and the comedy is spread throughout the film making it fun without being cheesy. If I had to compare the tastes with another movie, it would probably have to be The Princess Bride, a classic. <br /> <br /> All performances are exceptional, the beautiful Claire Danes makes you love her in her portrayal of Yvaine Michelle Pfeiffer, a naive and undervalued star, offering stellar performance over top performance as Larnia ... but the performance to talk about is Robert De Niro ... In every scene where he finds himself incomparable, he steals the program ... <br /> <br /> If you're in the mood for a funny fantasy love story, this it is the movie. The boys are not discouraged by the description, there is enough action comedy and, not to mention many sweets with Claire Danes and Michelle Pfeiffer, to keep you entertained. The cinematography is up and is maintained with the feeling of the movie ... nothing of the film seems forced.
