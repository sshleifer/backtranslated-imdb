I read so many comments that I also shared about remembering this movie and wanting to see it again but I did not know the name of the film. Fortunately, because I did a search and found the title on this site, I read the comments that were left here and I realized that this was the movie I remembered. Then I did a search, I found the movie and I was very excited to see it once again 40 years later. Because of this site and your comments, you helped me and I want to thank you all. I want to share how I could find this movie for all of you who were also looking for a copy. It was in the VHS version of "Call it Courage" from Wonderful World of Disney, which contained 2 movies, the second is "The Legend of the Boy and the Eagle". Now I was moved as much as 40 years ago and now I have my own copy. I think it's only available on VHS. I found it on ebay and I have seen several copies there. Enjoy it, I know I did it! <br /> <br /> It's a wonderful story about the love of a child and the eagle that he cared for. When the time came to sacrifice the eagle, the boy released the eagle because he could not allow himself to be killed. After the child was forced to leave the tribe to be punished after releasing the eagle, the eagle also saved his life and, more than that, taught him how to survive. The closeness that the boy and the eagle shared in the desert was very moving and the filming was really remarkable. How wonderful this era was. I've never seen anything that comes close to this movie!
