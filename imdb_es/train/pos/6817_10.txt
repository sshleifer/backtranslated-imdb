I love the movie, it was a very interesting fantasy movie b / c of the true meaning of the family in it, the history of our country, the fun-filled action shown in the film. I look at the hour at the top of 4 X a week and I love it! I wish I had made a sequel to see more of Susan's father in the past and see how Susan delt with her new sister and without a phone, computers, gameboys or anything of the 21st century. I hope everyone else has liked the movie as much as I do, I guess you could say that I'm a fan of the best and I do not care. The little boy in the movie Robert Lincoln Walker was simply adorable. I wonder who he is and how old he is today. Does anyone know if he has played in more movies or television shows?
