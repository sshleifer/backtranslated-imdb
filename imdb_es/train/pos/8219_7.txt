The Dirty Harry series started with a very rough police action, and almost immediately went on for "Magnum Force". By the time "The Enforcer" turned around, Dirty Harry was little more than a television police program (saved only by Tyne Daly). After a break of seven years, Dirty Harry has finally returned to his roots. Maybe he left for a long time this time. <br /> <br /> Clint Eastwood makes Harry's first film well directed since Don Siegel did the first, which helps considerably. Harry is a darker character once again, not the good cop he had become. Once again, you can say things like "Go ahead, make me the day" and I really mean it. "Sudden Impact" is a true sequel to Dirty Harry. "The Enforcer" should never have been done. <br /> <br /> 7.2 out of 10
