As we all know, a romantic comedy is the genre with the ending already known. The two drivers always have to get together. At the end of the third act, I was trying to figure out how this will end and how they will end up together. A clue was given from the beginning, but you will never notice until the end. It's a simple hook, but it works. It had to be. You cover a lot of the usual terrain, but take a turn when possible. I liked all the characters from New York and I loved the places. It's a postcard from New York. It was also nice to see a movie and not find anything offensive in it. So, if you like a good old-fashioned romantic movie ... then this is for you.
