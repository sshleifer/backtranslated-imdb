I really loved this movie and also the audience I saw it with in Los Angeles. After the movie, many people cried and said how much the movie had affected them. I can see why it was a great success in your country, Sweden. The film is masterfully directed and each character is brilliantly drawn so that in the end you really know these people and care about them. The music is very natural and the main song of the film is very heartbreaking but inspiring. I would definitely recommend this movie for all to see, even people who do not normally go to subtitled movies. Definitely deserved the nomination to the Oscar due to the deep themes of the film reflected without pretenses in a community of a small town with people of the daily life. It is a film that unites us in this divided world and shows us the potential of the human spirit. YOU MUST SEE IT!
