The third and final film of this trilogy is finally crystal clear. It's a political movie more than just entertainment. Jason Bourne will finally know who he was and will discover and remember the tortures he was subjected to to kill his former identity: he really killed someone who became his corpse. But the film finally reveals that all of this had been organized and planned by the CIA within a Blackfriars program that is also clearly revealed in this film with the aim of eliminating all US citizens who tried to impede the control of the entire society from a established way. Limited group of people. Who was an essential CIA official until 1980, when he became vice president? That is in accordance with what is said on the Internet. Then the truth will come thanks to Jason Bourne himself, but the main person who can bring that truth to the public and the only authority that can make a decision regarding the CIA is a woman and that woman makes the Senate get involved in a general . investigation. A woman and the Senate; Read my lips. In the United States, politics is fought in the media and two media are essential for any presidential campaign: it is music and film. At this time, Hollywood and beyond intelligence, academia and intellectuals are using film in general, and this film in particular, to build in the public the idea that salvation will come from a woman and the Senate. So go and watch the movie. It is quite entertaining and has the sweet fragrance of the end of a period and the great change that some expect and others expect, but no one can pretend that it will not come: the only point is to know how deep and serious it will be. <br /> <br /> Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU, Paris Dauphine University, Paris 1 Sorbonne University and Versailles Saint Quentin University in Yvelines
