Yes, the plot is not plausible and very thin. YES, the performance varies from medium to laughable. Yes, it has been done so many times before. However, what we are dealing with is a film that is not afraid of these facts and pretends to be nothing more than what it is. In fact, there are some original death scenes and the tension increases throughout the film. Besides, you're never more than a few minutes away from a bloody murder. I urge everyone to watch this movie with an unguarded eye and see it as it is supposed to be; A horror movie, funny slasher with a melody of insurmountable subject.
