Fragment of the life of one of the first painters to reach the historical renown, "Artemisia" tells the true story of the passionate search for the artistic expression of a young Italian woman and the vicissitudes she encounters. The film presents costumes and sumptuous ensembles and a good cast and performance. However, he is confused in his attempt to represent the esoterics of art and time and has no inspiration in his depiction of the artist's passion as it is painted on canvas and explored through his relationship with men. A good movie for those interested in Renaissance painting or vintage films.
