['This has to be one of the best, if not the best movie I&#39;ve seen in a long, long time. He had enough action to satisfy a fan, and yet the plot was very good. I really enjoyed the movie and I was hooked from start to finish. <br /><br /> I added blood and blood there, but it brought the realistic nature of what happened at the front of the film, and I even had a tearful end for many people, I should think. <br /><br /> It is a must for anyone. Seen many comments, appeasing the film, but to be fair, most of the films that receive negative comments turn out to be the best. This proves it once more. <br /><br /> Rent this movie, buy this movie, go out and watch this movie. You will not be disappointed.']
