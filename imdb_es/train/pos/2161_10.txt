['How many of us want to be able to get rid of social and cultural obligations and be free? Most of us, I suspect. We Dance? It&#39;s not a movie about dancing. It is about learning about ourselves, recognizing what we are looking for in life and having the courage to seek it. Mr. Sugiyama is a middle-aged member of a Japanese society where ballroom dancing is considered inappropriate behavior. <br /><br /> One day, Mr. Sugiyama sees a beautiful girl who looks out the window of a dance academy. He is fascinated by her and finally enrolls in dance classes. He is ashamed of his dancing and afraid of ridicule. Hidden that attends dance classes of colleagues and family. <br /><br /> There is a hilarious scene in the mens room in the office when Sugiyama and Watanabe, a co-worker who also dances, are interrupted by practicing some dance steps. There are many other funny and good-hearted scenes. <br /><br /> The ending is not a fairy tale, but it leaves the viewer feeling good. <br /><br /> This movie helped me understand the Japanese a little better. It&#39;s a warm movie and it&#39;s worth seeing.']
