The real story (happened in Kansas in 1959) of a murder (Perry and Dick, two ex-convicts who burst into a remote house on a rainy night to steal and kill everyone they met). Richard Brooks directed the creepy and disturbing book of Capote on the reasons that led these children to crime (Are they natural killers of birth?). The scenes of the crime are very brutal and disturbing due to the lack of senses and reasons for which we were witnesses. Impressive black and white cinematography by Conrand Hall, excellent country music and music by Quincy Jones, incredible performances in two main roles by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson and first time in a movie. A sad commentary on the death penalty in the last moments before his death. . Jones, Hall and Brooks (as director and adapted screenwriter) are nominated for the Academy Awards. Exciting, magnificently directed and terrifying, one of the best films of this decade.
