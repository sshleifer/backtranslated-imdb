I loved Long Road Round and did not even know about Race to Dakar until I saw it on the shelves of my local supermarket. I bought it and, after a first episode slightly "hmm, will it be this good?", I decided it was. Charlie Boorman was great as were the other members of the crew. I'm glad to see you with Ewan again. There was a bit of an oath, but that did not bother me. As for not being mentioned in the package. That's more to do with the fool certificate of Excempt from Classification that has the BBFC. They should have given him 15 for the language alone. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended series, I want more!
