I am disappointed that Reiser (who wrote the film) felt the need to use so much blasphemy for no reason. Maybe that's your idea of ​​"adult" movies, a lot of unpleasant words with bathroom humor? I thought it better and I did not think about him for this movie anymore. <br /> <br /> Falk's acting and some humorous moments, as well as some possibly important themes, are what made me give him such a high rating. <Br /> <br /> This could be a good movie for adult children to see and laugh at their own friends and their weaknesses. But the lack of consideration for the families of the audience seriously harms what could have been a family movie, but fails. Certainly not worth spending money, although it could be worth a free watch on television.
