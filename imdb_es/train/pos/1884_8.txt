This is one of my favorite comedies. Not wanting to forgive the uninspiring lifestyle of its hero, but is taken for its value and not as trivializing alcoholism, the film is simply very funny. Tells the unlikely story of a somewhat irresponsible, perpetually drunken bachelor named Arthur, who will inherit a great fortune, but only if he marries Susan, chosen because the family believes she could do something about him. Arthur proposes, but then falls in love with Linda, a waitress and little thief. <br /> <br /> Dudley Moore is perfect as Arthur, the most endearing drunk in the world, whose antics are a laugh per minute. It is true that Moore is Arthur and I agree with those who can not imagine any other actor on paper. The ladies of the piece are also well represented. Liza Minnelli shines like Linda, and her chemistry on the screen with Moore is great. Jill Clayburgh plays Susan, the richest and most appropriate woman chosen for Arthur. <br /> <br /> However, this film is made literally by Sir John Gielgud, who plays Arthur's sarcastic but moral butler, Hobson. It is obvious that these two have had a great mutual affection during the long-time employment of Hobson. Hobson is Arthur's best friend and provider of unsolicited comments and advice. The most interesting relationship in this movie is not Arthur's romance, but his unusual relationship with this witty and, of course, perpetual disapproval. It is the butler who will remember better long after the closing credits roll.
