I had seen Lady with Red Hair when it appeared, and I did not remember it as something to appreciate. The truth is that, despite its base in a true story, its screen game is silly and incredible. The true merit of the image is the cast. A constellation of some of the best secondary players of the 30s and 40s make up the delicate and intelligent work of Miriam Hopkins, always underestimated, and the wonderful and spectacular performance of Claude Rains, who, as always, is the best in the image. What an actor! He never won an Oscar, but he's in good company with Chaplin, Garbo and Hitchcock. Maybe Lady with Red Hair contains her best work in movies. See it and enjoy it. <br /> <br />
