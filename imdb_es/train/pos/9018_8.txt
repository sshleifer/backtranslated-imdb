Despite its low profile release in this country and its apparent indifference in other countries (the 'R' rating in the States may not have helped, honestly, just because HBC uses the word C!), This is really a fine . Workpiece. Sentimentality threatens to drown him from time to time, but it is overcome by playing the two tracks. <br /> <br /> It's easy to win applause just because you're playing a physical or mental cripple (Daniel Day-Lewis, It's possible that Geoffrey Rush, Dustin Hoffman, etc.), and Helena Bonham-Carter do not fully capture the physical degradation of the ENM, but their vocal stretch and relentless emotional impulse make up for it completely. In fact, almost all of his acting is done through his eyes (and what eyes!). This is an intelligent turn of an actress who is quickly undoing her reputation as an English rose and emerging as a figure of a certain stature. The prizes surely must follow, although not, unfortunately, for this good performance. <br /> <br /> Branagh, one feels, has never given his best moment in the movie (except possibly 'Hamlet', and there his game was diluted by the big cast). Here, however, he heads his other appearances, playing to the fullest as a self-hating, unstable and, ultimately, kind guy with a subtlety that he has not always shown, and that shows both intelligence and depth. In short, we believe him, as much as we could not believe him as Frankenstein, as the priest in 'The Proposition', as the lawyer in 'The Gingerbread Man', even as Andrew in 'The Friends of Peter'. This is surely your best performance so far, so why could not you produce the goods much earlier? <br /> <br /> As a movie, it looks more like a television offer, and without its stars it probably would not be much. But it has been a pleasure to see this couple make their socks in this way, and I look forward to more of them (although not 'Love's Labor's Lost' ...). 8 out of 10, but Branagh and HBC get 10 out of 10.
