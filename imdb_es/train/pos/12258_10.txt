Jane Austen's Emma is an extremely nice story at the worst of times and this production of the story is the best I've ever seen. The Emma of Kake Beckinsale is irreproachable. Gwyneth Paltrow, (with the help of a good script and excellent cinematography) is able to perform the comedy effectively, fails to make Emma pleasant. Paltrow does not help the fact that his hairstyles are simply "incorrect" for the part (and I think the time) and looks very bad with the dresses of the Empire line. Kate Beckinsale, on the other hand, handles comedy effortlessly and is still able to show what Mr. Knightly (the most romantic of Jane Austen's heroes) really sees in her. Mark Strong is a splendid Mr. Knightly with the right combination of beautiful looks, proper age, chivalry, compassion and chivalrous behavior. Emma and Mr Knightly are supported by a cast of good actors and the production as a whole is quite charming.
