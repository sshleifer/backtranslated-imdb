I saw it at the Legacy Theater in the Joseph Smith Memorial building in Salt Lake City this morning. I will assume that the level of enjoyment of this movie will be based largely on the level of acceptance of the story of Joseph. <br /> <br /> However, apart from that, it was very well done, well acted and had a good score. If you arrive in Salt Lake City, you should visit it at the Legacy Theater. I've never been to a theater better in terms of image quality, sound quality and atmosphere in my entire life ... I wonder if the Church would let me see Batman Begins there! Being that I am SUD and I consider Jos√© as a prophet, I was touched in several places and many times I cried ... which I suppose is expected since they distributed paper handkerchiefs BEFORE the movie started! Anyway, I'm told that this movie is available in several LDS Visitor Centers around the world, if you have 70 minutes, check it out because you believe in Joseph Smith or not, he tells a fascinating story.
