A CRY IN THE DARK <br /> <br /> A CRY IN THE DARK was a film that I anticipated that would offer a phenomenal performance of Meryl Streep and a solid film, although nothing special. This assumption arose from the fact that, apart from the nomination for Best Actress of Streep, the film received little attention from the main prize groups. <br /> <br /> Little anticipated that A CRY IN THE DARK would be such a fascinating, good drama - built on all levels. If you ask me, this is an unappreciated classic. <br /> <br /> The film opens quite slowly, allowing the audience to settle into the Chamberlain at a relaxed pace and really notice that, deep down, they are an incredibly loving, simple family. Fred Schepisi (the director) selects random moments to capture a family on vacation that gives an imminent sense to the approaching tragedy, while also showing the attentive happiness with which Lindy (Streep) and Michael (Sam Neill) Chamberlain take care of their children. <br /> <br /> While the famous line "A Dingo took my baby!" It has become something like a "punchline" these days, the movie never becomes so ridiculous. The real death of Azaria is horribly captured. It is subtle and realistic, leaving the audience horrified and asking questions. <br /> <br /> The majority of the film takes place in courtrooms and focuses on Chamberlain's ongoing struggle to prove his innocence to the press and the court, which suspects Lindy of the murder. <br /> <br /> The fact that we were clear from the start that they are innocent makes the tense judgments even more exciting. As a member of the audience, I was totally committed to Chamberlain's plight ... and I got really angry, it hurt and I was sad when the media made them look so terrible. But at the same time, the media / public opinion are understandable. I loved the way the media did not sympathize, but they always had valid reasons to express their opinions. <br /> <br /> The final line of the film is very deep and perfectly captures the central element that makes this film so different from other courtroom dramas. <br /> <br /> In terms of presentations, the only ones that really matter in this movie are those of Streep and Neill ... and they are delivered in every way. For me, this is ranked as one of Meryl Streep's best performances (if it's not number 1). For all his mastery of different accents (which of course are very impressive in their own right), Streep never loses the heart and soul of its characters. I think this is one of the most subtle performances of Streep, and she leaves the park. And Neill, an actor who has never impressed me more than being charismatic and attractive in JURASSIC PARK, is a perfect counterpoint to the performance of Streep. From what I have seen, this is undoubtedly Neill's best work to date. It's a shame that he has not been recognized by the Academy with a Principal Actor nomination to match Streep's ... b / c the two play brilliantly. <br /> <br /> More emotionally exciting than most movies, and also incredibly suspense ... A CRY IN THE DARK exceeded my expectations. I recommend people who only know the movie like the movie where Meryl screams "The dingo took my baby!" Watch the movie and see how much more there is for A CRY IN THE DARK and then that single line. <br /> <br /> ... A ...
