Super Speedway makes a great demonstration of its new DVD sound system / large screen / 5.1 channels. The IMAX camera puts you right in the race car, where you run several tracks at high speed, reminiscent of the driving sequences in the Grand Prix (hopefully it will appear on DVD!). I enjoy watching it again and again. <br /> <br /> The only drawback, and why I did not give it a 10, is that some of the driving sequences look suspiciously like the film sped up. The soundtrack also requires a small suspension of disbelief: everything that can be heard in a real car is the engine. You will not hear swooshes when passing under bridges.
