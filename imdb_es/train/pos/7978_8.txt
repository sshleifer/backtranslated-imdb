This movie contains the ingredient that all revenge movies should have and that is the real emotion. Pain, love, laughter, anger. There are so many emotions released in this movie. From beginning to end this film is immensely captivating. The plot on the paper sounds like garbage that is usually thrown in the face of the audience, but make no mistake, this movie is powerful. Washington, as always, offers a great performance. <br /> <br /> In short: the man suffers from depression, a girl gives life to him, the children are kidnapped, the man wants revenge. It does not sound like something special, but it is far superior to any other similar movie. For a moment, TAKEN is a similar movie, but when you compare them, MAN ON FIRE wins without stopping. The characters are attractive and everyone makes a great performance and the direction is excellent. Mexico City feels alive, it looks like Mexico City, it smells like Mexico City. Everything is portrayed brilliantly. The management style was something that I enjoyed and brought out the best of Mexico City. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies that you will get once a year to watch again or a movie that will beg you. Family and friends to see. From start to finish, it is encouraging the main character, making it a roller coaster ride. There is enough action to keep you happy, there is enough character development to please you and then there is Washington to make you smile. Watch this movie, you will not be disappointed.
