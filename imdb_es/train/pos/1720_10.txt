This early biographical short was very fun to watch. The second on disk one of D.W. The DVD set "Years of Discovery" by Griffith (highly recommended) presents three excellent performances by the main characters, and it is interesting to see Henry B. Walthall (The Little Colonel, The Birth of a Nation) as a campy musician he gives the countess the eye (and other things). <br /> <br /> The Countess's husband is driven mad by his wife's betrayal and has her walled in a small room with her lover. It's a bit amazing that they did not hear the wall getting up, but hey, maybe the wine had something to do with that. Here Mr. Johnson (father of the silent player Raymond Hackett) gesticulates wildly and this adds to the melodrama, but in an unexpectedly comical way. The best moment comes at the end. When the lady faints from shock and fear, once she realizes she is condemned, Henry takes her instrument and "fans" it. The way he did it was so unexpected and in a strange way, something sexy, and I just lost it and started laughing. The expression on your face! From that moment I loved Henry B. Walthall.
