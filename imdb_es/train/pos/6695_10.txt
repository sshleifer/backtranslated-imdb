Oh, my God, I live in Kentucky and when Mellisa Joan Hart came to Louisville, she passed through my neighborhood and waved at me. I'm immensely rich, so I wanted to look at my neighborhood. Oh, and I love being rich in any way I've come for the Derby. Returning to my interest in the program ... that program makes you want to point something out and make it disappear. I mean, it's so creative and I love it. I would love to be in that program ... ... that show is just amazing, I mean whoever came up with that show, I just want to give them a big kiss, I mean it makes me feel better when I'm sick and it makes me happy When i am angry. if someone tells me they do not like it, I'll talk in a certain way with you OK OK
