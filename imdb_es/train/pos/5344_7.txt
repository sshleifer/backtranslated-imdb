This is a very good Spanish movie, but I am worried that many will feel lost because many in the whole world have no idea what the Spanish Civil War was about or when it was fought. Being a history teacher, I had a great advantage, but I could easily see how the film could be confusing until all the pieces were put together. I doubt that this is a major concern in Spain where this film was made, but for other audiences they may be a bit confused until later in the film. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with Carol, 12 years old. and his mother returns to his mother's hometown. Years have passed and it is known that they come to Spain from the city of New York. Despite the strangeness, Carol speaks a pretty good Spanish and much of the film is about how she adapts. As to why she and her mother are alone, I will tell you now with those who do not realize the fact that Carol's father is fighting in the war on the side of the Republicans (who finally lost in this bloody conflict) . ). <br /> <br /> The film gets exceptional marks for its charming work with camera and music. The rather slow and staggered pace is not bad as long as you are someone who can accept movies in this way. I have seen several other Spanish films about this war and this compares quite well with them, neither better nor worse, just a good part of the movie of life about those who are left behind, as well as a good movie coming of age . <Br /> <br /> PS: if you do not know which side is which, the Republicans were mostly socialists and were backed by the Soviet Union and Mexico, as well as by volunteers from many countries (including the United States). The nationalists were led by Franco and were helped by Portugal and the fascist states of Germany and Italy.
