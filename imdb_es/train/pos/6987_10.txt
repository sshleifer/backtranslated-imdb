Putting aside the "thing" UFO. This was the best documentary I've seen. Reports of events by Neil and Buzz ... a must. The interviews and the reports are a revelation, since most of the information was confidentially sealed in 1969 and published only in 2006. No documentary to date has the detail or accuracy in just 47 minutes ... FACTS will leave you impressed, and you will be amazed at the risks assumed as the first on the moon ... Neil and Buzz are probably the greatest heroes of our time. Have you ever seen a man save his own life? Bet no. Neil saves his life when only milliseconds separate him from death. Incredible to see It is a farce that people have not known all the details associated with the landing on the moon and the courage that these men had when they faced certain death, from a faulty computer ... 10 stars!
