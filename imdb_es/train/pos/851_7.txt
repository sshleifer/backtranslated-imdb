['Pierce Brosnan has drank his last Martini and returns, with a scandalous self-dependence, like the drunken assassin of Julian Noble, who has a special predilection for teenage girls, bullfights and sticky clothes. During a job in Mexico City, he meets Danny (Greg Kinnear), a businessman from the suburbs of Denver, who is in town to make his best deal at a hotel bar. Despite their completely different personalities and Julian&#39;s raw and insensitive comments, they become friends. <br /><br /> Driven largely by the performances of Pierce Brosnan and Greg Kinnear, director Richard Shepard revealed that he did not write the film with Pierce Brosnan in mind, but I can not imagine this without him. He shows a real talent for comedy and can be more than just James Bond or spies of the Cold War. The scene in which the two are in a bright bar of the hotel (dazzling and beautifully photographed sets) really is a brave piece of acting skills. The scene lasts almost fifteen minutes, and although it was probably carefully written, the two actors improvise in large part, but they have wonderful success! It almost feels like a new standard in screen acting. Think of Robert De Niro and Harvey Keitel in the improvisation of MEAN STEETS and add one of the most subtle foundations of many genre clich√©s and the actors&#39; own pigeonholes (Brosnan&#39;s James Bond in particular), and you&#39;ll get one of the most Lovely of recent Hollywood. . <br /><br /> Unfortunately, the story fades after a while. After an hour, the movie is just steam. However, and I can not point it out exactly, I enjoyed it a lot. It just feels very fresh and original, with an imaginative use of sets and lighting, and some advice for Seijun Suzuki and Jean-Pierre Melville. The other characters are not given much to do, but this film offers something new, in that sense, almost effortlessly manages to combine all conventional genres in an entertaining parody. Very entertaining. <br /><br /> Dark camera --- 7/10']
