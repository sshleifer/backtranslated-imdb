This is an exquisite film about the search for a bit of happiness in everyday life. The rhythm, the work of the camera, the emotion, the disturbing musical score and the pure charm of this image make it a must. It is not easily appreciated by the immature or emotionally retarded. The only flaw I can see in this movie is that it was not captured in a technically more perfect film format. It deserved Todd-AO, Technicolor and the best sound format available (you can make an intimate film in seventy millimeters). The magnificent effect of the Italian villas on its inhabitants would have rendered itself even more exuberant and the charming little moments would be even more beautifully seen and heard. As it stands, it still demands attention as a sweet and touching little film. I can not stop seeing it every time it goes satellite. The transformations of the content, tight and distrustful characters are always a joy to see and should really recommend them more frequently. <br /> <br /> The casting is perfect, the mood is perfect, the acting is irreproachable. It's a movie about middle age and the decisions people make. It is deep and reflective without hitting the viewer with a hard hand. Look at it in one session and let it have its effect on you. If you do not get it, maybe you have not lived enough, or something else is wrong with you.
