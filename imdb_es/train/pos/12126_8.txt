Bette Davis presents a coolly funny performance as Mildred Rogers in this 1934 film. The film seems pretty dated now in 2003. It's certainly worth watching for movie lovers and Bette Davis fans, but it may not be that much attractive for today's average movie viewer. It was surprising for me to see how young Ms. Davis looks in this movement. The actors revolve around performances that are basically solid and the story is meaningful and interesting. Leslie Howard is well chosen as Philip Carey, the medical student of the club. This is a movie with a strong message about who we choose to love and why. However, "Of Human Bondage" did not seem to have a great mental or emotional impact on me. I felt a little indifferent and I separated from the movie after seeing it. I have the intuition that this may be the reaction that the director was looking for. You are the judge! <br /> <br />
