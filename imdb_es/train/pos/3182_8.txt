The beautiful pilot of the British airline George Taylor (a solid portrait of Guiseppe Pambieri) is beaten by thugs after a wild night in Hong Kong. George meets and falls in love with the sweet and virginal Dr. Emy Wong (an excellent and charming performance by the charming Chai Lee). George regains his health and goes back to work. When Emy does not hear from George for a long period of time, she succumbs to despair and becomes a prostitute. While the director / co-writer Bitto Albertini does indeed offer a satisfying amount of tasty nudity and steamy, soft sex, this movie is anything but your routine in a carefree hiss. Instead, it is a surprisingly reflective, moving and tragic love story between two well-drawn and very attractive characters (Chai as Emy Wong is especially radiant and endearing). The image begins with a bubbly and cheerful sound, but the tone radically changes to a darker and harsher mood in the two thirds of the way. Emy's descent into vice after she has falsely assumed that George has abandoned her is grim and annoying; Similarly, the surprise surprisingly sad and heartbreaking final bummer. Of course, the narrative is certainly melodramatic, but never too silly or of bad quality. In addition, the sex scenes are quite tasty and even genuinely erotic. The notorious Italian porn star Ilona Staller has a good deal of considerable support as the jealous and uninhibited secretary of George, Helen Miller. The polished cinematography of Guido Mancori offers many incredibly beautiful shots of exotic places. The music of Nico Fidenco, impeccable and pulsating, reaches the wonderful place. It is worth taking a look for those who are looking for something different.
