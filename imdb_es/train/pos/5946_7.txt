"World's Finest" is a unique project. It is a trailer for a Superman / Batman movie that does not exist and will not exist, at least not in this way, with these characters, actors and plot anyway. <br /> <br /> So the movie is A great ridicule, even more than the standards of all the real movie advances. The trailer will exaggerate you for nothing. In that sense, I really did not like this short project. When you watch this trailer, you get hungry and want more and, at the same time, sadness, and maybe you even feel cheated later, when it turns out that a full movie of this trailer will never exist. Something like that makes you wonder why this project was done in the first place. Surely to show the skills of Sandy Collora, but could not have done this with a real short movie, like his previous movie "Batman: Dead End". <br /> <br /> But when you have to judge this short purely for what it is, from the technical point of view of a movie, it's really cool. It looks very good and is much more professional than perhaps at first you can expect, although people who have already seen "Batman: Dead End" will already know that they should not wait for a short with cardboard games, cheap homemade suits and third parties . qualify the actors. The short does not always look impressive and, obviously, the budget was not high, but for the most part it is very impressive and professional, with beautiful costumes, sets, special effects, cinematography and lighting. <br /> <br /> short has a good fast and typical trailer, with maybe a little too many too credible position shots but, well, it works well for the towing style. It has some impressive shots, but also a couple of lame, mainly the Superman flying sequences. It was obvious that the guy was standing in front of a moving car, with a camera aimed at him from a lower angle. It even seemed like a pretty laughable thing to see. But in reality, the best and most spectacular moments really make up for this. <br /> <br /> Michael O'Hearn looked like a very good Superman / Clark Kent, although obviously he is not the best talented actor. Clark Bartram returns to interpret well his paper of Batman and Kurt Carley seemed an impressive Lex Luthor. The rest of the cast also served its purpose quite well. <br /> <br /> It is especially interesting to see this shortly after the new and recent modern reinterpretations of the two main superheroes of this film, in the films "Batman Begins" and "Superman returns". It's interesting to compare the style and character treatment of those movies with this one. Actually, it's surprising and fun to hear how much Kurt Carley sounds like Kevin Spacey, the actor who played Lex Luthor in "Superman Returns." <br /> <br /> It is an attractive and well made and constructed trailer that, however, will do it. It makes you hungry for more, although you know there will be no more. What happened to Waner Bros.'s plans to create a complete Superman / Batman movie? I thought the developments were underway a couple of years ago, but since then nothing has been heard of that. Instead, two new Batman and Superman movies were made separately; "Batman starts" and "Superman returns". <br /> <br /> 7/10
