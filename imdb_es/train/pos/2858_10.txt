Bonanza had a great cast of wonderful actors. Lorne Greene, Pernell Whitaker, Michael Landon, Dan Blocker and even Guy Williams (as the cousin who entered several episodes in 1964 to replace Adam when he left the series). The cast had chemistry, and they seemed to genuinely like each other. That made many of his weaker stories work much better than they should. He also made many of his best stories become a great western drama. <br /> <br /> Like any program that filmed more than thirty episodes each season, there are likely to be some weak ones. However, most of the time, each episode had an interesting story, some kind of conflict and a resolution that usually did not include violence. While Bonanza was a western, gunfight was never presented as the main attraction. While I'm a fan of The Rifleman and Wanted: Dead Or Alive; those shows usually ended with a shooting. The shootings were the way many Westerners solved each conflict, and Bonanza was very different in trying to seek peaceful resolutions and harmony instead of killing. <br /> <br /> In the early years of Bonanza, there are some interesting episodes that do feature a lot of shootings. Those episodes contrast with the rest of the series, but they are pretty good in themselves. In 1964, when Pernell Whitaker wanted to leave the program, they brought Guy Williams to replace him. Williams was playing the role of a long-lost cousin. Unfortunately, Whitaker decided to stay another year and, therefore, Williams left the series when he moved to marry Adam's old girlfriend. If Williams had stayed for the duration of Bonanza, one can only wonder how much better the series would have been in the years after 1965, when Pernell Whitaker left the program. <br /> <br /> Without a doubt, once Pernell Whitaker left, the stories focused more on comedy and hijinks in the country. Whitaker had often played the heavy in many episodes, and his absence left a gap in the cast. Little Joe always wanted to play nice boy, and Hoss always wanted to play good boy with a heart of gold. Since Ben was the kind and wise patriarch of the family, that did not leave too much room for the shootings. <br /> <br /> At some point they hired a ranch named Candy (David Canary) that became their fourth member. of the cast, but Candy never appeared in any shooting, and he was just an older version of Little Joe. For a year or two they also made Ben take away another lost cousin (Jamie, played by the forgetful Mitch Vogel) who was a teenager who was usually getting into some kind of trouble with someone. <br /> <br /> Apparently When adding the teenager, the studio sought to attract younger viewers. It also gave writers the opportunity to write episodes about problems of adolescence, alcohol, crime, etc. These types of preaching episodes were popular in the 1960s as a reaction from the establishment's media to the counterculture movement. Dragnet was probably the most popular television source of order and law, although Hawaii 5-0, The F.B.I. and many other programs also tried to get on the bandwagon by making television shows that showed irresponsible teenagers causing mischief, chaos and crime. <br /> <br /> The addition of a teenager to the cast gave Cartwrights more opportunities to show. Solve and solve problems, but those episodes feel very contrived and are not very good in general. After Dan Blocker died, the series continued limping for a year or so before it was canceled. The last season was pretty bad, as it showed Little Joe tracking down his wife's killers, and most of the episodes were a bit depressing because Little Joe used to drink or remember how much he loved his wife, and how unfair was. She was killed. <br /> <br /> I do not think I've ever seen the last episode of the series, and I wonder if they ever officially finished it in some way. In the last year, there was only Ben (Lorne Greene) living in Ponderosa, since Adam had moved (and never returned as a guest once) and Hoss had died and Little Joe had left after his wife (in the series) had been killed by drifters. <br /> <br /> In general, the era of 1959-1965 is the best of this series. Once Adam left, it slowly diminished. Most of the shows before 1970 are also pretty good. In 1970, the series was trying to be difficult and current, and had lost much of its western flavor. The addition of Candy and the teenage boy also diluted the overall quality of the show, and the death of Hoss (Dan Blocker) was the last nail. Bonanza is probably the best western series ever made, and of the 465 episodes that occurred, at least a hundred of them are an excellent western drama! That is a pretty good album. Even the worst of Bonanza is better than many other television shows.
