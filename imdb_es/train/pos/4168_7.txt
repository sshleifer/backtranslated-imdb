This film not only has one of the great movie titles, but also has the third team of children's actors of the 70, Ike Eissenman and Kim Richards. I seem to remember that this movie was aired on Halloween week in the year 78 and that it was going against Linda Blair in Stranger in our house. I missed the first time I chose to watch the other movie. Later, in repetition, I saw that I made the right choice. The movie is not really bad, but it really does not have chills or surprises. Although, I liked the scene in which Richard Crenna shoots the dog of the family in vain.
