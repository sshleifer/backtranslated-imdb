"Against All Flags" is the classic swashbuckler. It has all the elements that the adventure fan could hope for and more in this case, the damsel in distress is not in trouble. Like Spitfire Stevens, Maureen O'Hara is at her best athletic moment, beating her enemies in defiance of the social norms of the period. Anthony Quinn completes the three best actors on the list as the ruthless Captain Roc Brasiliano and proves to be a cunning and capable nemesis for Brian Hawke (Flynn). For the classic adventure fan, "Against All Flags" is a must. While it may not be in the same league as some of Errol Flynn's previous work (Captain Blood and The Sea Hawk, for example), it's still a very entertaining game.
