This is truly an excellent movie with a revolutionary message (both in form and content) that no fan of the French film New Wave or Underground should miss. As soon as the credits are opened or closed, we are simply immersed in the world of consumer art, revolution and youth. This film has little to do with the documentary and it is more interesting to play with our advertising ideas and their relationship with reality. The lines of the real and the non-real intersect in a familiar way with the films that discuss a documentary, but this time we do it for the sake of consumption and marketing, not to describe the real thing.
