My children stopped in this movie the other night and, when things started to develop, it really piqued my interest. I had to go to the bowling league, so I recorded them in the dvr to see the rest later. Well, I just saw it and the front of my shirt must be soaked after crying cubes. It was an excellent movie, although I could almost feel the pain and anguish these girls were experiencing. And never in a million years would I have guessed the reason why Alissia had passed from this beautiful girl to an anti-social goth. That was probably why my shirt was soaked because I experienced the same pain Alissia felt. I would not have looked for this movie either, but I'm happy to have seen it. Very moving, very moving. Ideal for those who love a good drama or a tear pull.
