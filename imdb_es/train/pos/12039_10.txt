The woman in black is fantastic in all aspects. It gives fear, suspense and is so realistic that you can see it in real life. I first saw it on TV in 1989, and with all the lights off and the volume up, it was probably the most spooky experience of my entire life. I managed to get a copy, and now, I make sure to take it every Halloween and also show the most confident family members, who have no idea what they are doing, and all I can do is laugh happily. Regarding the film: <br /> <br /> Start with a young lawyer named Arthur Kipps, whom his firm assigns him to go to the commercial city of Crythin Gifford to arrange the roles of a recently deceased client: Mrs. Alice Drablow. <br /> <br /> This movie begins as a reasonably solid and interesting ghost story. But then, Arthur attends the funeral and, from that scene, we do not feel safe. We are constantly nervous and biting our nails, and that continues for the next hour or so, until the final, exciting end. <br /> <br /> A warning for all new viewers: do not look at this alone. ..
