This was my favorite movie when I was a kid, and I've been in the theatrical production several times, so it will always remain my favorite music and I doubt that anyone can do the story of Oliver Twist on the screen, better than this one. did. <br /> <br /> My favorite 'bad boy' of all time has to be Oliver Reed as Bill Sikes. Not only did it scare my life when I saw her when she was 6, but now, as a woman, I can empathize more with the character of Nancys, the waitress / bar prostitute who helps Oliver get the life he deserves. <Br /> <br /> Jack Wilde as the ingenious dodger, was fantastic, and I do not think anyone can beat him, as the street collector, and Fagin's best friend. The music is fantastic, especially the Fagin numbers. I'm also very grateful that they did not give Bill Sikes a musical number, it would not have worked because he was such a sinister character. <br /> <br /> I think Carol Reed did an excellent job with Nancy's sticky ending, keeping it as a G-rated movie by disguising her beating, but giving away enough to show Bill's violence towards her. <br /> <br /> This film is both charming and charismatic as a musical singer, as well as being a moving drama that follows a child as he tries to find where he belongs in life.
