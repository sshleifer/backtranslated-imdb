This is the second short of Animatrix, and the first one is what we might call "artistic". It contains many references, metaphors and symbols in the dense amount of material, especially with a run time of 9 minutes. I have heard some complaints that this is "anti-human", or tries to direct hatred towards man, for his "sins against the machine". I do not think that is true; he limits himself to using robots to show us that, as human beings, we are not accepting in a particular way or with an open mind towards anyone other than ourselves. I would say he does a great job of that. The plot is good ... plays as a historical document, telling what led to one of the main conflicts in the trilogy. Therefore, it contains fictional news and similar news clips. The voice acting is very good, if there is not much. The animation is nice, and the use of color, despite the generally realistic drawing style, makes it more open to make smooth transitions and other surreal images. This has several fragments of strong violence and disturbing visuals, as well as a bit of nudity. The disc contains a comment, not in English but subtitled, and it is worth listening / reading it. There is also a well done and informative elaboration, based on both parts, so I would advise to see it after seeing the next one as well. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys the universe of Matrix and / or science fiction in general. 8/10
