['Everything is idyllic in Suburbia when the small family moves, since the father has a new job in a computer company there. But no paradise would be complete without its snake. Strange things happen when the family joins the local country club without the husband, as it certainly keeps secrets. The father is not a carpenter, but there is pressure on him to join, since all who are in the neighborhood and at work are members. The good guy part of Robert Urich is a bit tepid, but Joanna Cassidy is a good-natured housewife who is turning into sparks. A cooler of suspense and well done with a bitch Susan Lucci as president of the club. Look for cult favorite Michael Berryman in a small part as a valet. The film captures the sense of paranoia and the end of special effects is worth waiting for. I have seen this movie several times.']
