This has been one of my favorite movies for a long time. Recently I was glad to see it on a DVD, which is a relief to see the old granulated versions of VHS. <br /> <br /> I had not seen it in years and I saw it today to be surprised at how good it is. The movie stands up over time. It's one of those rare, perfect comedy storms where great writing (really fun line after the truly fun line) is combined with great direction and outstanding performances at the same time. <br /> <br /> Dudley Moore earned an Oscar nomination for "Arthur" but lost (although John Gielgud won for best supporting actor). If Moore's performance in "Arthur" does not win an Oscar for Best Actor, it is proof that no comic actor could win the title (another example is Gene Wilder in "Young Frankenstein"). <br /> <br /> Steve Gordon elaborates the film beautifully keeping faithful to each of the characters and the warm tone of the story. In a nutshell, in my humble opinion the movie is a rare gem. It's sad that Steve Gordon died just a year after "Arthur" was released. <br /> <br /> Regarding the DVD that is available as of 1/2007, it is true / true. Although the quality of the video is a leap over old copies of VHS, there is still no widescreen version available. <br /> <br /> The DVD has some extras that are nice, but it's not enough. An example is the Director's comment indicating how he greatly desired how certain shots and deleted scenes might have been included (because they were hysterical), but that he had to make difficult decisions for a final edition. The DVD, being the perfect format to include such material, surely should have offered it. <br /> <br /> This, the original "Arthur", is a classic comedy that is for books.
