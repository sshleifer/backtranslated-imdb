The title exaggerates a little the content of this film, which could lead to some unrealized expectations. Frankly speaking, there is very little "panic in the streets" to be seen here. In fact, throughout the film very few people really know that there is a loose assassin that may well be spreading the plague to everyone and anyone who finds it. That said, what we do have here is a story very well done with a level of suspense that starts reasonably high anyway (because, unlike people "on the streets", the viewer knows what is happening) and that director, Elia Kazan. Build very deliberately. While looking for the killer infected by the plague, one of the most interesting sidebars I found was the developing relationship between Dr. Reed (Richard Widmark) and Police Captain Warren (Paul Douglas). At first, the two really do not like each other, even though they have to work together. In the end, they have forged a true bond of mutual respect. Kazan did a good job with that. <br /> <br /> Almost all the performances here were excellent. Widmark and Douglas were great, and I was very surprised to see Jack Palance playing what would become his typical "heavy" role. I found very little to criticize here. Maybe Barbara Bel Geddes was a little flat like Reed's wife, Nancy, but her role was not really central in the story. In short, an excellent job. 9/10
