Tigerland follows the life of a group of newly recruited men in the army who are called to fight in Vietnam in 1971. <br /> <br /> At this point, the United States knows they are fighting a losing battle, and the director takes the decision. through a 16mm hand-held documentary film of the lives of several recruits at the 'Tigerland' training camp in Louisiana. <br /> <br /> The film is more a study of characters, not a real plot, but it focuses on a key character Roland Boz, who is a disgordinated but intelligent man, who just wants to escape from the camp. We went through several characters in the unit who are waiting for the story to unfold. <br /> <br /> I must say that this is a great story about Vietnam and, more importantly, about the army in general. Great performance. and very memorable In addition, the use made by film directors and style works so well, because it looks a lot like the old movie that is always seen with respect to Vietnam. It is great to see how the film shows that all the internal struggles and problems were so important for the problems of fighting this battle. The particular scene in which Boz moves away from a training mission in which an instructor shows how to use a radio as a torture device summarizes almost everything about war in a few words ... and is useless. <br /> <br /> Fantastic movie. Not only about Nam but about who has to decide what is morally right to be 'in the army'. <br /> <br /> Rating 9 of 10.
