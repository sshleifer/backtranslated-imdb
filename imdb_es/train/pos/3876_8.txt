The charming Danish actress Sonja Richter steals this movie from everyone's noses, it's no small feat given the incredible performances that surround her. <br /> <br /> Richter plays Anna, a young woman without work, independent, something The neurotic (and perhaps suicidal) actress who gets a desperate job taking care of a father in a wheelchair, mute and old called Walentin (the great Danish actor Frits Helmuth, who died at 77 years shortly after this movie was filmed). <br /> <br /> SPOILER ALERT <br /> <br /> Walentin refuses to respond to anyone - until he confronts the gifted Anna, whose capricious and malicious manner makes the poorly abused return from a self-imposed death sentence. <br /> <br /> Writer / director / actor Eric Clausen has made a strong film about the difficulty of a business son (Jorgen, played by Clausen) who loves a father who has never accepted him. The movie sinks towards the end, but Clausen has some important things to say about euthanasia, the nature and value of loving and caring, and how a person, the irrepressible Anna, can alter the course of a human life. Highly recommended The performance of Sonja Richter is only worth the price of admission.
