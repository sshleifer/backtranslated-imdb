['This was the second of the two &quot;Hamlets&quot; filmed in the 1990s, the first was that of Franco Zeffirelli, starring Mel Gibson, since 1990. Zeffirelli&#39;s version, like that of Laurence Olivier in 1948, was based on a version abbreviated from the work, with much of Shakespeare&#39;s work. The original text is being cut. (I&#39;ve never seen Tony Richardson&#39;s version in 1969, but since it lasted less than two hours, even shorter than Zeffirelli&#39;s, I suppose it was also abbreviated). Kenneth Branagh was trying something much more ambitious: a film based on the full text of the work, with a run time of around four hours. <br /><br /> With his &quot;Henry V&quot;, Branagh claimed Olivier&#39;s crown as Shakespeare&#39;s best film actor, confirming his claim with his brilliant &quot;Much Ado about Nothing,&quot; a rare example of a great film based on a Shakespeare comedy. &quot;Hamlet&quot; was his third Shakespeare film as a director (he also acted as Iago in Oliver Parker&#39;s &quot;Othello&quot; in 1995) and, as might be expected, is very different from &quot;Much Ado ...&quot;. The previous film, shot in a villa in the hills of Tuscany and in the beautiful countryside that surrounds it, is a joyful summer film about everything that makes life worthwhile. <br /><br /> &quot;Hamlet&quot;, on the contrary, is established in the depths of winter. (The flowers in the description of Ophelia&#39;s death suggest that Shakespeare himself thought that the action would happen in summer). The appearance of the film is particularly striking, both sumptuous and cold. It was filmed in the Blenheim Palace, possibly the grandest manor house in England, but also a rather forbidden house. The snowy outdoor scenes are cold and wintry; The formal and elaborate interiors. The action is updated in the mid-nineteenth century; the female characters wear the elaborate fashions of that era, while the main men wear mostly splendid military uniforms. (There is a contrast here with the Zeffirelli film, where both the interiors and the costumes were deliberately subdued in tone). The work is dominated by images of corruption and decay; Branagh&#39;s intention may have been to contrast a splendid surface with the &quot;rotten something underlying the state of Denmark.&quot; <br /><br /> The film is notable for the large number of renowned actors, some of them in very small roles. (He blinks, and you might miss John Gieldgud or Judi Dench.) Apparently, the production company, which was nervous about a four-hour movie, needed a cast of stars. Some of the stars imported from Hollywood, such as Robin Williams&#39; Osric, did not come off, but others, like the King of Charlton Heston or the first gravedigger of Billy Crystal, played their roles very well. Yorick, who usually only looks like a skull, is seen here in a flashback, played by British comedian Ken Dodd. Brian Blessed, who often plays jovial characters, is considered to be the Phantom, and makes scenes in which he seems truly frightening. <br /><br /> Of the main characters, perhaps the weakest was Kate Winslet&#39;s Ophelia. The protagonist of Branagh in his first two Shakespeare films was his then wife Emma Thompson, but their marriage ended in divorce in 1995. However, I did find myself wishing that Thompson had been chosen for the role; Although Winslet entered the scene in the crazy scenes of Ofelia, she seemed weak in the previous ones, where her character is still sane. (I preferred Helena Bonham Carter in the Zeffirelli version). Richard Briers plays Polonio with a greater dignity than he is often given, a wise and experienced counselor instead of an old fool. Julie Christie also brings dignity to the role of Gertrude; here there is no attempt, as happened with Gibson and Glenn Close in Zeffirelli&#39;s version, to suggest an incestuous link between her and Hamlet. (An interpretation that owes more to Freud than to Shakespeare). The age difference between Christie and Branagh is large enough to make them credible as mother and son, which certainly was not the case with Close and Gibson. (Olivier&#39;s Gertrudis, Eileen Herlie, was, oddly enough, thirteen years younger than him). <br /><br /> Branagh said that his intention to restore those scenes, which are often cut into film versions, was to &quot;reinforce the idea that the play is about a national and national tragedy.&quot; Much emphasis is placed on the war with Norway and the Norwegian Prince Fortinbras, a secondary argument that Zeffirelli completely ignored. This emphasis on national tragedy may be better shown in the character of Claudius, sometimes played as a one-dimensional villain. There is something in Derek Jacobi&#39;s performance that suggests that Claudius could have been a good man in different circumstances, but that he was fooled by ambition and lust. He could have been a good and loyal servant of his brother, but he decided to rule as a bad king. Although he is tormented by guilt, he can not see any way to repair the wrong he has done. <br /><br /> Branagh, a wonderfully fluent speaker of Shakespeare&#39;s verse, is excellent in the lead role. Like Gibson, he has little time for the old concept of Hamlet as indecisive, passive, and melancholy. His is an active, physical, energetic Hamlet, something that is best shown in his fatal duel with Laertes. Its guiding principle is not the despair of the world, but an active dislike of evil and corruption. <br /><br /> It was a bet for Branagh to make a four-hour epic, and the movie did not go well at the box office. However, he was praised by many critics, James Berardinelli was particularly enthusiastic. My opinion is that, whatever the financial performance, Branagh&#39;s bet paid off in artistic terms. By focusing on the full text, he was able to highlight the full meaning and complete emotional power of Shakespeare&#39;s more complex work. When I reviewed his &quot;Much Ado ...&quot;, I said it was the best movie of a Shakespeare comedy. His &quot;Hamlet&quot; may be the biggest movie of a Shakespearean tragedy. 10/10']
