My children recently began to see the repetitions of this program, both the first episodes in the N, and the later ones in ABC Family, and they love it. (I did not know that the program would have lasted beyond the first or second season) I am curious about what motivated all the changes in the cast: I have described them as "highly publicized" and, however, half an hour of searching. Efforts on the web have revealed nothing but endless comments about how the first episodes were much better than later episodes. (Personally, I do not see much difference, the scripts and the themes remain the same in general, but they lose great people along the way) My daughter has put the DVDs on her wish list, so maybe the land's special features and comments will shed some light on all this. I also wish they had done a bit of self-referential humor about the changes, like in "Boy Meets World" where they leave the little sister for a season or so, and when a different actor appears later playing her, they ask her where she has state and says "up", or when the early geek series "Minkus" appears for the high school graduation, they ask where he has been and he says "there", pointing to the part of the classroom that was never shown. by the camera, before saying "Hey, Mr. Turner, wait!" and leave the screen (Mr. Turner is another character who left) Oh, well, maybe there will be a real Hollywood story about this or something? I was glad to see Aunt Hilda come forward for the finale, she was always one of my favorites, it's a shame that it was not a wider casting meeting. (The Zelda candle just did not cut it for me)
