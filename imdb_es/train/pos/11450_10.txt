This movie is incredibly beautiful. Goldsworthy's art really benefits from the medium of the film because you can see art in its most beautiful form, in movement, changing and flourishing. I recommend this movie to everyone. I can not think of anything else to say about it. It's just the kind of movie you MUST see, because it's visually compelling and it left me very refreshed when I left the theater.
