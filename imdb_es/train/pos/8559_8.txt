There is a certain genius behind this movie. I was laughing all the time. The scene in the sex office on the phone, discussing how love cures the doppelganger was a good attempt at this genius / humor. Execution is poor, but you can see the writer's message and have a certain talent. The division of the doppelganger in the end was like ... "ok, I did not expect that, but let's see what the movie has to say". Certainly ridiculous, but a sweet idea and really very coherent with the story in a strange way. <br /> <br /> Is the point of a movie logical or is it entertaining or communicated at an emotional level? I'm easily bored with many movies, but this kept my interest in everything. <br /> <br /> I think the story may have some self-biographical roots, but that's just a guess. Horribly bad, but good. I'm looking for other films that this person has made (with more experience).
