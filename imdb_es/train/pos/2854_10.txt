A lot has already been said about this film and I would like to join those who praised it. It is a very unique film that uses elements of different genres: drama, comedy, gangster movie without making a mess. In the points, you simply laugh out loud, in other points, you feel for the characters whose errors and faults you observe. The genius of Sabu can be shown with respect to some sequences of the film. One is that when the three men who chase each other have an erotic dream about a young woman who has just passed through the street. This sequence is very well done and illustrates very well the characters of the three runners. It is erotic and fun at the same time. Another example of Sabu's genius is the part of the film in which the runners get tired. The first of them, the typical loser among the three boys, hallucinates that the woman who left him for another person is back again and you see them dancing together and on the next shot he dances with himself, which is very moving. All runners come to this point where they think they have something back they lost or are on the right track again. And in one part of the film, they stop chasing each other, running in a row, just laughing. So here is all the beauty and ridicule of what we call the life that Sabu manages to show throughout the film. His characters fail (do they do it in the end?) But he does not steal their dignity. "Monday" and "Postman Blues" that do justice to Sabu's claim that he is a genius. Go see them! <br /> <br />
