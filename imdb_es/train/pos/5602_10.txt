Roman Polanski plays Trelkovsky, who rents an apartment in France. The previous tenant is in a hospital after a suicide attempt. He goes to see her there where she also meets Stella (Isabelle Adjani), Simone's friend. He and Stella are close enough. The last Simone dies. Trelkovsky begins to think that the owner and the neighbors are trying to change him to Simone so that he finally jumps out the window. Le Locataire (The Tenant) from 1976 is the last film in the trilogy of Polanski's apartment. The previous ones were Repulsion and Rosemary's Baby. Roman Polanski does not do a good job just as a director, but his performance is also excellent. Isabelle Adjani with her big glasses is wonderful. The owner, Monsieur Zy, is played by the great Melvyn Douglas. Jo Van Fleet plays Madame Dioz. The fantastic Shelley Winters is The Concierge. The tenant is something that is very scary from time to time. It gives a lot of that psychological fear. This movie is not the easiest to understand or explain, but that makes it all so fascinating.
