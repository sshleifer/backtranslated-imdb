What can you say about a show of this magnitude? "The Sopranos" has literally redefined television as we know it. He broke all the rules and set new standards for television excellence. Everything is impeccable, the writing, the direction, and for me, above all, the acting. Watching this show, you will realize that these characters are NOT real. The performance tricks you into thinking that there is a real Tony Soprano, or any character. This show is also very versatile. Some people do not see the program because it is violent, it is not just about violence, it is about business, family and many more profound things that depend on what you see as a fanatic. For me, I do not like when people refer to the program, a program about the mafia. For me, it's a show about the family. A family that, for generations, becomes part of the mafia. In general, this is a masterpiece of a show. This is what television should be. Here. Complex characters from the impressive performance, magnificent lines from the history of brilliant writing, and what do you get by mixing these ingredients? A show that defines excellence, and dares to be different.
