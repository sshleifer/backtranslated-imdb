I see them all. <br /> <br /> It's not better than the amazing ones (_Strictly Ballroom_, _ Shall we dance? _ (Japanese version), but it's completely respectable and pleasantly different in parts. <br /> <br /> I'm a teacher of English and I find some ignorance about the language in some of these criticisms quite annoying, for example: "the name should scream, not see." How it moves "Since when do the titles of the films ignore the grammar?" < There's nothing intrinsically wrong with the grammar of Caribbean English, it's just not the grammar of standard Canadian English, I find the comments about the dialogue unpleasant, I put the subtitles because I'm the standard Canadian speaking English, I simply assumed AUTOMATICALLY that I would have trouble understanding everything, it was not that difficult and it gave a distinctly different flavor to the other steps I've seen that are so American. <br /> <br /> I loved it or that this film was filmed in Toronto and, in fact, I would like it to be clearer there. I loved that the heroin was cast so uncharacteristically. I enjoyed the routines step by step. I liked the character of mom driven. I felt that many of the film's problems were addressed in a more subtle way than is characteristic of dance films. <br /> <br /> In short, if you like dancing movies, then this is a decent one. If you have problems of superiority with respect to the grammar of the English standard in which you grew up speaking, your narrow mind may have difficulty enjoying this movie.
