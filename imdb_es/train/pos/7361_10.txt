This film would usually be classified as the worst movie production in history. Forever. But in my opinion it is possibly the most fun. The horrible direction and the script make this movie priceless. I bought the movie while reviewing the bargain DVDs at my local pound store. Some friends and I looked at him, no doubt, while we were quite drunk. He soon realized that this was not a normal movie. Instead, an invaluable relic of what will probably be James Cahill's latest film. At first we were confused and shouted that the DVD player was turned off, but fortunately, in our abnormal state, no one could be bothered. Instead we saw the film through In the end, we soon realized that we had found the dream of any wasteful, something that you can accept laughter for hours, while you laugh for the wrong reasons. We soon showed all our other friends and they also agreed, this was not a huge movie job. This was a movie from which you can really get wet laughing. This was a movie that anyone can enjoy. This was genius.
