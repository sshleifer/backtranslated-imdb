Matt feels the change in his family's behavior and decides to investigate the club, finding an evil secret about Jessica and the members. <br /> <br /> In the 80s, when I saw "Invitation to hell", I liked it. This movie is partially reminiscent of "The Stepford Wives", with people changing behavior in a suburban complex. I just saw it today and I found a great metaphorical message against the big corporations, when people literally sell their souls to the devil to climb positions and earn higher wages. I'm not sure if the author intended to give this interpretation to the story, but I think it fits perfectly. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Convite Para o Inferno" ("Invitation to hell")
