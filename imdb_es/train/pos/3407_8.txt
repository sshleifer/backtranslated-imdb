Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boyer give solid performances in this beautiful but empty film. The irony is that Dietrich plays a woman with a beautiful but empty life. The cinematography and the really beautiful scenes, and yes, the bottomless clothes chest of Dietrich are also fabulous. She looks great Boyer looks young and trimmed. <br /> <br /> The story of a woman looking for meaning and an ex-priest looking for life seems quite old, but faced with those unreal sets and heavens, somehow it works, given the two stars, the great Max Steiner's score, and a good cast of support. The movie lasts about 76 minutes and seems poorly edited, plus certain characters simply appear or disappear. <br /> <br /> Joseph Schildkraut is funny since the Arabic guide, C. Aubrey Smith is the former priest, Lucile Watson, the mother superior. , Tilly Losch, the dancer, John Carradine, the fortune teller, and Basil Rathbone plays ... well, I'm not sure. He just rode from the desert and ruined everything! As others have said, John Gilbert was scheduled to star with Dietrich. I can not help thinking that it would have been wonderful. The role of Boris, who is tired of the world, would have been very good for the great Gilbert. And after the success of Queen Christina (with Garbo), her career could have returned to normal. <br /> <br /> I can not think of any other movie from the 1930s that Dietrich made in color. She looks great and wears some fabulous clothes. My favorite is Valentino as the Shiek style outfit that he wears in the pool. <br /> <br /> It's definitely worth seeing the lush sets and the color and the two big stars.
