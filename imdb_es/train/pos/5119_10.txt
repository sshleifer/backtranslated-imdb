I just have to say that this is one of my favorite movies of all time. I can not even count the number of times I've seen it. I was already in love with John Travolta, but the first time the camera checks his body after everything is clean shaven and looks beautiful for his first trip to Gilley, he was amazed. Debra Winger, as always, offers a perfect performance as the young and naive wife of Bud, but with the necessary attitude to marry a stubborn and hardworking cowboy. If you are not a country music person, which was not, this is a soundtrack that will make you sing with every word. If you have the opportunity, watch this movie, you will not be disappointed.
