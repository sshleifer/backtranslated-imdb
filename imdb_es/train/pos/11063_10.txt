I was totally impressed by the "Waitress" by Shelley Adrienne (2007). This movie only confirms what was clear from that movie. Adrienne was a wonderfully talented writer-director, an original and unique artist. He managed to show the miseries of everyday life with absurd humor and a true warm, optimistic and humanistic tendency. Ally Sheedy steals this movie with an excellent performance as a woman who has fallen to the limit. The male leader, Reg Rodgers, looks like Judd Nelson, that's fine. There is also a large cameos from Ben Vereen. The song at the end of the movie "The Bastard Song" written by Adrienne may be her optimistic praise: <br /> <br /> "It's a world of suffering, <br /> <br /> In a sea of ​​pain, <br /> <br /> It does not matter how much sun you bring, <br /> <br /> You're hit by the rain ... <br /> <br /> Do not let the heartless ones take you down, <br /> < br /> not to greet those who have no heart at your door, <br /> <br /> not to live among those who have no heart "
