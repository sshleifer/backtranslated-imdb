The city of Royston Vasey is a strange, but wonderful place. The characters could be wrong and too disturbing, but the fantastically brilliant writing means that it works, and it works very well. Most people will meet others with a touch of some characters, but I hope no one knows people with extreme personalities like Tubbs and Edward, the owners of the local shop who hate strangers, or the obsessed Pauline who treats "scum" Dole "With a lot of contempt. They were just some of the strange inhabitants. The television works consist of 3 series and a special Christmas. There are references to many horror movies, like the wicker man. A more recent addition to the range of works is a film, the League of the Apocalypse of Gentlemen, of which I will not say much, but I highly recommend. In general, the gentlemen's league is a hilarious comedy show with written genius and brilliantly crazy characters. I would definitely say it's worth seeing since you will not regret it!
