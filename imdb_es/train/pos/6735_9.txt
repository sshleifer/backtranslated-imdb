Woohoo! Stacy Peralta has followed Dogtown and Z-Boys with an equally astounding documentary about the history of big wave surf culture in the United States. Gathering insider footage along with interviews of surfing legends, we are transported to the bold, free-spirited life of the early pioneers whose passion for sport spawned an industry that today touches the lives of millions of people. <br /> <br /> Knowing these icons and their stories is what gives the film warmth. You can feel the respect that Peralta has for this group as we listen to the stories of Greg Noll walking from a group of fellow surfers amazed on the beach to uniquely challenge 50-foot swells off the northern coast of Hawaii. Or Jeff Clark, navigating the outrageous and dangerous Maverick on the northern coast of California for only 15 years before it was discovered and became the surf destination in California. And the story of the storybook by Laird Hamilton, the icon of surfing today. Listening to Greg Noll reverently, refer to Hamilton as the best surfer who sent shivers down my spine. <br /> <br /> (Aside from that, Noll, Clark and others were on the Sundance assessments.) Noll described himself humbly as an old, surfer on the hill, and was deeply moved by the reception of the audience by him. and the movie, both he and Clark were as nice in person as in the movie.) <br /> <br /> Riding Giants pays homage to these extraordinary athletes reward us at the same time with an idea of ​​the magnitude and power terrifying of the waves that they seek to conquer, the harrowing vertical drops necessary to enter them, and the almost unfathomable combination of adrenaline and fear that the surfers experience every time they acquire a wave of monsters. <br /> <br /> All this, and the movie has more. For those of us who do not live in California in the 60s, we have an idea of ​​the impact of surfing on American pop culture. (And, to my surprise, the impact of the movie Gidget on surfing!) Peralta also weaves an introduction to some of the technical aspects of sport and the history of team innovation. I'm not a surfer, but like the rest of the Sundance audience, this movie captivated me completely. Peralta is betting his claim as the Great Kahuna of American documentaries.
