Olivier, Kosentsev, Richardson, Coranado, Zefferelli and Almerayeda directed Hamlet, but Branagh is the only one who did it well. <br /> <br /> This is the only "Hamlet" movie that contains the full four hours of William Shakespeare's masterpiece gives a unique feel to the whole story. <br /> <br /> Not many directors could achieve this without boring their audience, but the skilful use of Bravo's movie style and Branagh's trick allow people to see the importance of scenes that are normally cut out. <br /> <br /> Examples of this include Gerarde Depardue as Ranyaldo, whose main purpose in the film was simply to say "yes, my lord" while Polonius asks him to spy on Leartes. This also included Billy Crystal as a grave digger, Robin Williams as Osric, Jack Lemmon as Marcellous and Charlton Heston as an actor. <br /> <br /> Branagh's performance of act 4 soliloquy from scene 4 (which is often cut off) is nothing less than a cinematic wonder as the camera slowly recedes as the intensity grows. It's a scene that literally made me want to jump out of my chair and start applauding. <br /> <br /> Branagh is the only filmmaker who understood the importance of each scene in this film and knew how to convey that importance. For the general public. <br /> <br /> This is a must-see for all who enjoy good storytelling, brilliant acting and incredible direction. All this is part of the greatest triumph of William Shakespeares.
