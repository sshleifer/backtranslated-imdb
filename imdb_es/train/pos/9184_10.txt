Yes, this production is long (good news for Bronte fans!) And it has a somewhat old-fashioned feel, but both the casting and the acting are so brilliant that you will not want to see any other version. <br /> <br /> Timothy Dalton is Edward Rochester ... it's that simple. I do not care if other critics say he's too handsome. Dalton is attractive, certainly, but he is not a pretty boy. In fact, it has a dark, angled angular spell that, in my opinion, matches the mysterious and very masculine Mr. R. And confronts the sad and tortured person of Rochester in such a moving way. It portrays the ferocity when the scene requires it, but it also shows the tender, passionate and emotional side of Rochester. (In my opinion, the most recent production of A & E is affected because Ciaran Hinds, whom I usually love, seems to be a bluff and abuser of him.) I have read the book many times and never felt that Rochester should be perceived as a beast that I kept pestering her.) <br /> <br /> When I reread the novel, I always see Zelah Clarke as Jane. Mrs. Clarke, to me, resembles Jane as she describes herself (and is described by others). Small, childish, fairy ... although it is true that the actress does not seem to be 18 years old, portrays very well the attributes of Jane. While other critics have claimed that his performance is wooden or non-emotional, we must remember that the character spent 8 years at Lowood being trained to control his emotions and his "passionate nature". His main inspiration was his childhood friend Helen, who was the image of demure submission. Although her true nature was different, Jane learned to master her temperament and be docile, in accordance with the school's goals for her charitable students who would enter the "service." Jane becomes a governess in the home of the wealthy Mr. Rochester. She certainly * would * not speak to you as an equal. Even later, when he gave as well as he received, he would always make sure to remember that his position was way below that of his employer. However, if you read the book, in which this production remains incredibly close, you can clearly see the small struggles that Zelah-as-Jane endures as she submits her emotions to remain moderate and moderate. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between Dalton and Clarke is the correct one, I think. No, it's not like Hollywood at all (thank God! It's not a Hollywood book class), but yours is a true, devoted and loyal romance. And for a woman like Jane, who never presumed to have * any * love in her way, it's a small miracle. <br /> <br /> The rest of the casting is fantastic, and I love the fact that almost everyone The character in the book is present here. So, too, it is a great part of the original rich, poetic dialogue. This version is the only one I know that includes the charming and infamous 'gypsy scene' and, in general, presents more humor than other versions I've seen. In particular, the mutual jokes between the main characters come directly from the book and are so charming. <br /> <br /> Jane Eyre was, in many ways, one of the first novelized feminists. He finally accepted love on his own terms and independently, and, finally, as the true equal of Rochester. Simply beautiful!
