After watching this movie I feel like I know a little more about the United States. David Lynch is synonymous with shock value and strange for the sake of rarity, and in fact, these elements are not lacking in The Straight Story. However, it is in a light that I have not witnessed before Lynch. We start with a simple family that lives a quiet life, but we end up with a series of absurdly interesting characters with a depth in their lives that can not be evident since its introduction. Especially moving was the bar scene with two World War II veterans discussing the events of fifty years ago and how this still affected their current lives and emotions. If you are looking for Wild at Heart or Dune, do not search here. But if you're looking for real people with real stories, this is the movie for you.
