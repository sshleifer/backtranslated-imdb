For me, the final scene, in which Harris responds to the press corps, is worth seeing this smart and timeless part of politics (especially the campaign phase). If only the "real-life" politicians responded in an intelligent and articulate manner as Mr. Harris did, then the arrogant and selfish members of the press may think twice before the emergence of irrelevant "garbage" and of confrontation that has absolutely nothing to do with it. see with the skills of the candidates to effectively handle the challenges of the office he / she is looking for.
