There are not many stories of overcoming odds like that of Christy Brown. Born with cerebral palsy in Dublin in the 1930s, his parents thought his disability was both physical and mental. Although finally diagnosed correctly, Brown, in a lower working class family with almost 20 children, had to struggle to be appreciated by his family. Through the use of his only fully functioning member, his left leg, he learned to write and paint, both skills he developed expertly. <br /> <br /> But what makes the film version of Brown's autobiography, "My Left Foot", as important as his humility. Both director / writer Jim Sheridan and star Daniel Day-Lewis have managed to tell this story in a way that does not scream to attract attention and resorts to melodrama. The corny fights and the scenes of frustration, as well as the glorious moments of the tiny victory, are easy pitfalls of such a miraculous story, but "My left foot" remains real and intrinsically inspired. enhancement. Playing someone with such severe physical disabilities has to be a demanding task. Day-Lewis not only gives us a very complete picture of Christy, but also chronicles the growth, improvement and internal change of the character at different stages of his life. He plays Christy when he was 17 when he had a limited language ability and was emotionally volatile, as crisp as the intellectually learned Christy struggles to cope with why he can not find non-Platonic love. The last theme is the strongest in the movie and it would have been nice if Sheridan and coadaptor Shane Connaughton really explained it. In any case, Day-Lewis makes us understand and sympathize with all those elements, offering a performance that is so believable that you often do not have time to think "wow, he's a great actor". Those are the most laudable performances. <br /> <br /> Equally important, but through more subtle means is Sheridan's work in the film. This story is about everyday life and struggles. Even though Christy has such a unique set of circumstances that hinders her life, her struggles are no different from ours and Sheridan captures that concept completely. Christy struggles with love, attention from parents, issues of self-esteem and ability. Their struggles manifest more physically (literally and figuratively) than ours. <br /> <br /> Sheridan gives us moments that capture the spirit of the great Brown family and Christy's unique place in it. The drama evolves naturally when tensions are higher and humor appears in the same way. The dinner scene when Christy learns that her doctor / teacher, the woman she loves, is going to marry her brother Peter, is the best example of the film from the efforts of Day-Lewis and Sheridan. It is so well done by Sheridan that it comes out when we are ready and Day-Lewis takes us from there with his impressive work. <br /> <br /> The other strong component of the film is Brenda Fricker as Mrs. Brown. She did not know that she had won the Oscar, but there was something in her performances like Christy's loving and wise mother who just shouted worthy of an Oscar. His love for Christy and the constant struggle for him only seems very convincing and sincere, and he gains a lot of sympathy due to his situation. <br /> <br /> The emotional blow of the film given the story is surprisingly minimal. Maybe that was part of the sacrifice of trying to create a movie that feels organically human. The two must be reconcilable, but I imagine that it is challenging to tell a story that seems real and that provides enough dramatic moments to take our emotions to a roller coaster. The decision to downplay the latter was definitely the right one for "My left foot". Brown's circumstances speak for themselves: it is not necessary to squeeze them to have a more dramatic dramatic impact. <br /> <br /> ~ Steven C <br /> <br /> Visit my site moviemusereviews.com for more information
