Citizen X tells the real-life drama of the search for a serial killer called "The Rostov Ripper." This great movie shows the long journey he took to try to stop a murderer. The film shows how the policy may have helped the killer continue his uproar for more than 12 years. (Possibly more than 50 victims, mostly women and children) The performances of Stephen Rea as the lead detective and Donald Sutherland as the main leader of the investigation were excellent. Jeffrey DeMunn as the ripper Andrei Romanovich Chikatilo. This is the kind of movie that will hypnotize you and you will immediately have it on the Internet investigating the real case. This is a movie that should not be missed. I debuted, I believe in HBO and I never got a theatrical premiere in my opinion. Great movie
