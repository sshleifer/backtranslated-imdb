OMG ! Buttgereit's masterpiece is one of the best movies I've seen in my life. Closer to the films of Peter Greenaway and Jean-Luc Godard, this one is really disturbing but not as frightening as the Nekromantiks. All the small stories have a deep philosophical interest and the direction is totally inventive, in spite of the lack of money (see the sketch of the "bridge"). Highly recommended!
