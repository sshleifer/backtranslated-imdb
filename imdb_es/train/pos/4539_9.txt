['The acting is pretty corny, but for the people of this area in the 80s and who are now automotive engineers in the Detroit area, this is a great movie. I even work with a Japanese supplier, which makes this film even more fun. <br /><br /> Jay Leno was showing his age last night on The Tonight Show! He looks very young here ... 17 years ago. The opening scene, with the drag race on what appears to be Woodward Ave, was great. <br /><br /> Leno also owns some evil ** cars, it would be great to see a new version of this with his modern collection. I&#39;m sure that the blown Vette in the opening scene was his own car. <br /><br /> Typical movie from the 80s. Look at it and enjoy it. There is no computer generated garbage!']
