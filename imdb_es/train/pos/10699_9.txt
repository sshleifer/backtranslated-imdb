When I saw Birthday Girl, I liked it so much that I decided to watch all the Nicole Kidman movies I could, only to find a disappointment in all of them. I theorize that while the presence of a particular star generally guarantees a certain level of quality due to its artistic control, with Nicole Kidman the influence it exerts is detrimental to the cinematic enjoyment, in my humble opinion. So, for example, Dogville, even depriving the viewer of anything visual to detract from the existential intuition he is forging, or other films that promote homosexuality and lesbianism as something worthy of another person's attention, or other favorite causes of Kidman. <br /> <br /> Here she is a natural woman and does a great job. I do not know how or who could contain it, but apparently it worked. The way in which the film shows its frankness despite its resistance reaches the heart of what makes a woman a woman. And, consequently, what makes a man's most desperate hopes come marginally. <br /> <br /> Of course, the fact that the male protagonist is transformed from a milquetoast employee to a macho man in the space of a movie sounds like an expansion fantasy of the male ego, but his transformation is properly credible. It is not timidly conceived as it would be in a movie designed to reinforce the male ego. Instead, it accurately records the necessary growth derived from the unique circumstances of the movie. <br /> <br /> It is also quite charming how criminals are portrayed as perfectly human, apart from their criminal mission. His gang has a mixed scholarship that is foreign to American culture. And although they are his adversaries, they are never really his enemy. In effect, they teach him to compete. <br /> <br /> I really marveled at Kidman's ability to look physically Russian. It made me wonder if his ancestry was Russian, but none of the photos I examined showed any indication of it. Maybe it's just makeup but it was amazing. <br /> <br /> I can only hope that they hit her on the head again so she can produce another great movie. Despite my free digs to Ms. Kidman, the message is that this is a top movie in every way and probably the role of a lifetime.
