['I originally reviewed this movie on Amazon about 6 or 7 years ago, and I criticized it. I think I called him &quot;miserable&quot; and a &quot;turkey&quot;. Well, well, by most standards, it&#39;s still a turkey. It has almost no production value, the small plot that exists is almost meaningless, and the performance is at the level of a third grade work. That said, this has really grown in me over the years as a kind of classic camp. In fact, all the films by director Todd Sheets have had this effect. They are almost like Ed Wood in that sense: observe them again and again and select the broken lines, the errors of continuity (the same zombie, two different locations!) And other defects. <br /><br /> I will say this: Sheets is a very nice guy, and although this one of his first productions is not so good, he has improved. And I must add that the only really decent actress / actress in the movie is Kasey Rousch, although I can be partial, since I attended school with her.']
