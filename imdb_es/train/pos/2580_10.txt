I say that the domino principle is a hugely underestimated movie. Anyone who has taken the time to investigate our contemporary history of conspiracies; jfk, rfk, mlk, g.wallace and, in fact, many others can only draw the conclusion that the author of dominoes The beginning really knew what he was talking about. Tony Tucker could be Lee Harvey Oswald or James Earl Ray or Sirhan Sirhan or Arthur Bremer, maybe even John Hinkley or Timothy Mcveigh. To mention some. The scenario of the conspiracy involves spies, big business and political assassinations. It is not really a fiction, but a sinister part of our complicated existential history. God helps us, but the domino principle is more a fact than a fantasy. If this causes a small loss of sleep, maybe you should. Do not trust my word. , investigate for yourselves.
