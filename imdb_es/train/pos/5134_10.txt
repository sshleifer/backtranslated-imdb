This short film was nominated for an Academy Award and I wish it had won! Basically, a session of improvisation filmed between some very talented musicians, including Lester Young and Joe Jones, the music is incredible! Hollywood often embraced Jazz (particularly animation, believe it or not), but this is a rare look at the film in improvised improvisation. This has been added to the film preservation list and deservedly. TCM executes this as a periodical fill and runs it every March at some point for its tribute of "31 Days of Oscar". From the center of the city to the buzzer, buzzing, nothing but network and the shot is so smooth that the net barely moved. More solid and highly recommended !!!
