Great voices, a lot of adventure and intelligent dialogues make this a very good movie. The addition of "character" to the three main animals gives the story much more depth and meaning, particularly the relationship between the older man, Shadow, and the young hell, Chance. Previous versions of this film could not give the animals any personality or real reason, which is perfectly done here. Sally Field is nice in everything, but she really shines in this movie as the proud feline, Sassy. Great contrast between the perspectives of life of cats and dogs, and just the right amount of spirit and warm fuzzies to make the plot and the resolution are excellent. There is even an uplifting score and a beautiful mountain landscape. Definitely perfect for a single night or with the children. Congratulations to Disney.
