Well, I was a teenager when I saw the movie ... the songs were a great success, but the elite class skipped Govinda's films back then, because I watched movies of Govinda and Karishma (also known as Karizma). Many people liked it because the series of these films spread throughout the 90s and most of them were successful ... today I saw it again after a long time and I remembered that there was a long list of people and riots they created. when the song of aa e uo uo ooo appeared on the screen ... the dresses of govinda and karishma were complemented (the worst costume duo of that time) and karisma in the late 90's was transformed, but govinda has still been very faithful for his designer, since his dress is still the same ... but at that time everything was mixed, everything was fine ... everything worked and slowly the elite class realized how much fun was missing and then .. I had not looked back for this jodi as I went on to make those Indians continue on the show ... I hated for a few, but loved by the masses. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a good time with nothing to do, fix it or watch it on TV, I do not think you will regret it ... but remember it is the worst at its best. <br /> <br /> I still see those movies when I have time because I can not stop laughing ... so I say, go ahead and have a good time, as there are times when everyone loves stupidity and especially when it's done for the kings of his time, surely you can see ... I recommend it to all movie lovers ...
