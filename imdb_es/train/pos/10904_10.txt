The most moving and truly revealing documentary ever created. I cried all the way, from beginning to end. Watching the show, you are immediately captured by a man's struggle to live without pain, to live a life we ​​would take for granted. The first time I heard the title, I was almost afraid to see the program, it was difficult for me to understand living in agony every day of every year of my life. I really felt for him. The saddest part of the documentary is when Jonny takes out his coffin. Can you imagine doing that? Even more, even though he was in excruciating and unbearable pain, he still opened his own charity. (DEBRA) Jonny is one of the only people that deserves real respect and admiration, is the definition of a role model, what a true and undeniable hero he was!
