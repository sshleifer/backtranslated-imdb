I just finished watching this film finely conceived and beautifully acted / directed. It was not easy to know if I was going to waste my time watching a movie on the Lifetime Movie Network because of the horribly distracted commercials. Reading the previous comments convinced me to give it a try. After all the worst that could happen would be that I fell asleep during one of the boring but long adverts of insect repellent. Then, why did I look at it? mainly because when IMDB gives a movie a "WEIGHTED AVERAGE" OF 5.8 WHO STATISTICAL MEDIA was 7.3 It must be a sure success. <br /> <br /> I was totally delighted to have taken the time to watch this movie, commercial smallpox and all. Helen Hunt continues to surprise me with her ability to take on difficult roles, adapting her main character to suit each of them. <br /> <br /> The portrait he painted in this hard but perceptively human police film was beautifully executed. When the scene requires a quick and timely verbal conversation, she can be face to face with any actor. However, she is an expert in delivering volumes of emotional responses without uttering a word based solely on facial expression and body language. Without commercials, which by design kill the continuity of any good movie, this would have been a real nail biter on the edge of the seat. I gave him a 9.0
