['The only show I&#39;ve seen since 90210! Why did they discontinue it? It was the only show that captured the essence of Hawaii and made you feel like you were part of everything! The least they should do is throw it on DVD! <br /><br /> I took a look at similar programs, but nothing has come close. The cast had incredible chemistry and expected each episode well in advance. <br /><br /> They made a big mistake by throwing that show. If anyone has any information about where I can get a North Shore DVD, post some lines here. Thank you! Aloha!']
