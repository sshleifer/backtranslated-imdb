Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais have a solid success rate when it comes to their work on television. However, his film work has been much more rugged (for example, The Bank Job of 2008, the previous year, Across The Universe, definitely weak, for example). <br /> <br /> Still Crazy, fortunately, is a solid success. It has a great history, excellent performances, lots of humor, fabulous music and, above all, a real heart. <br /> <br /> I enjoy the "moments", and this movie has one of them, just when everything goes pear-shaped at the festival meeting ... <br /> <br /> Very nice.
