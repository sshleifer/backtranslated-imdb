Throughout the Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy, Paramount Pictures really abandoned the idea of ​​restoring this film supervised by Cecil B. DeMille directed by Anthony Quinn and getting it on DVD and Blu Ray with all the extras included. It's obvious to me that executives at Paramount Pictures are blind as bats and ignore the fact that they have a very good pirate movie in their vault on a real pirate who actually lived in New Orleans, Louisiana, which would have helped to make The Crescent City once again famous for its pirate connections. When the executives of Paramount finally get in touch with the program and release this film in digital format, I will be a happy camper. Paramount Pictures is up to you to leave your duff and restore this movie now!
