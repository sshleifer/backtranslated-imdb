I remember Parker Posey in "As The World Turns" before she became the queen of independent films. In this film, Posey shows her potential as a first-class actress. In this film with the cast that includes Omar Townsend as Moustafa, a Lebanese immigrant who works as a falafel salesman on the street, who aspires to become a teacher. The supporting cast features a wonderful actress who plays her godmother and only family relative as Judy, the librarian who is outdated, dedicated and menopausal. Posey as Mary learns that she has to grow and mature. Losing his position as a librarian makes him realize how much he misses her as a place in his life. Mary's life is surrounded by friends in the Lower East Side Village of New York City before it is gentrified with yuppies. This movie is pretty good for an independent and I came to enjoy Parker Posey as Mary and other characters in other movies.
