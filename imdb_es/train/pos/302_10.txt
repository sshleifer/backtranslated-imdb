This movie is perfect for all the romantics of the world. John Ritter has never been better and has the best line in the movie! "Sam" hits close to home, is lovely to watch and very fun to play. Ben Gazzara was an excellent cast and easy to fall in love with. I'm sure I've met Arthur on my trips somewhere. Around you, an excellent option to pick up any night.! :-)
