Make no mistake, Maureen O'Sullivan is easily the most beautiful Jane in history, and there will never be a more beautiful one. She is visually stunning. Apart from that, it takes more than a beautiful woman to make a good movie. This is a great movie. It not only has Tarzan's classic aura, but also the feeling of the continuous saga. We get involved with the two white hunters looking for ivory, one of them in love with Jane, the other a rogue catalyst whose character can be one of the best defined and best examined in the history of cinema. And these characterizations are what do this. The great action movie stands out as a classic. There is the uncomfortable racism that is represented. However, Africans are represented as individuals, and in the end, two even become more heroic than white hunters, and stand out as such. In fact, the one without a name probably evokes more sympathy from the audience than any other character. The ending, too, is one of the reasons to enjoy this movie. The lion's great attack has never been duplicated, and the horror is well implied in the reactions of the characters, more than a modern gore movie would do with graphic representation. If I omit something, it's because I do not want to dirty the image for those who have not seen it. But it's everything you could want in a movie.
