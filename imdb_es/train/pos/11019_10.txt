Cliffhanger is what appears to be Slyvester Stallone's last action movie before he became such an underrated actor. It is a mountain climber who must help his friend after being kidnapped by mercenaries who want to find three suitcases with a money of more than 100 million dollars. It has a great sequence of action, fun on the edge of your seat and a great moment in the cinema.
