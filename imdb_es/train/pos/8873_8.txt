This movie came and went in theaters. Due to the nature of it, you can see why it was not well received. He was unfairly criticized for his subject more than the film itself. Higher Learning is not spectacular, but it was a good movie that tried to talk about a feared topic in the United States: racism. <br /> <br /> Plot / Story: Higher Learning focuses mainly on Malik (played by Omar Epps), a naive star on the track who has to deal with not being fast enough, and a stern teacher (played by Laurence Fishburne). He befriends Fudge (Ice Cube) as well as a beautiful lady named Deja (Tyra Banks). Later, they end up having to deal with some skinheads on campus. Remy (Michael Rapaport game) is a confused child who ends up making friends with some local skinheads on campus. Once you impose your views, it becomes as racist as they are. <br /> <br /> Opinion: Higher learning is not free of flaws: the development of the character is scarce, the performances of Omar Epps, Tyra Banks and the leader of the skinheads (whose name I forgot), Busta Rhymes are fine It does not fit in this movie. Also, women who became homosexual after being abused by men were a clich√© before this movie, so you know I did not like that part of the movie with Kristy Swanson. Apart from that, this movie was not bad at all. Laurence Fishburne was good as Professor Phipps (although he could do without the accent), Fudge was the best performance of Ice Cube and Michael Rapaport was as good as the confused Remy. In general, it was one of John Singleton's best films and it is one of the reasons why I frowned at the trash it now throws. The cinema needs more films like Higher Learning, Mississippi Burning and American History X and less films like Baby Boy, 2 Fast 2 Furious and a very useless remake of Shaft.
