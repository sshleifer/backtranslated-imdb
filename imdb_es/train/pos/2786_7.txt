What surprised me most about this movie was the large audience it attracted. Similar films like Anita and I never caused as much publicity as this movie, although I think it's probably due to the mention of 'Beckham' in the title more than anything else. <br /> <br /> It's a brilliant Transmit a brilliant message: you can do anything if you are determined enough, and put it in mind, which is such a positive message to anyone who watches this movie. <br /> <br /> I think this is one of Keira Knightley's best films, and I think she's a brilliant actress, and she was excellent for the role. Parminder Nagra was also brilliant. Unfortunately, I can not say this for Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, because I do not think he was such a good actor, and to be honest, his eyes were a bit scary. <br /> <br /> In short, a brilliant film and a brilliant story.
