I really enjoyed the pilot, it was as amazing as I expected, if not better. Patrick Warburton was a riot, although at first I thought he could not stand his character. He and Megyn Price had little chemistry, but I hope that as the season progresses they feel more comfortable with each other. It must have been strange that Megyn went from being the star in her last show ["Grounded For Life"] to being a co-star. <br /> <br /> Bianca Kajlich and Oliver Hudson seem really new to the whole Sitcom scene, but I think they will get better over time. The character of David Spade, to my surprise, was not the main focus of this pilot. The way he offers his lines is so different from any other person I've seen on television, but I think it's just his style. It works for him. <br /> <br /> I think that couples, or even single people, can relate to all doubts and fights and be unsure of their decisions, what this program is about. All the situations in which the characters are put simply feel like in real life, not covered in sugar like most of the shows. <br /> <br /> I hope for the good of all the actors that CBS gives them the opportunity. This show has the potential to be one of the best series, if given the opportunity and time.
