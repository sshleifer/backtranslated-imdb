Let's be honest; Nancy Drew was never a great literature. It's in the same category as the nannies club, the magic tree house, Goosebumps, ABC Mysteries. In fact, it was one of the original formula stories. Nancy is perfect, beautiful, thoughtful, "nice", she has never had internal conflicts! and it never changes. Ned is practically the same. The film was true to that style and I have to say that I liked it. It will never be a great movie, but it had the same nostalgic flavor that the books had. I had the right amount of suspense for my children (8 and 10). There was almost no offensive language. I liked the push for a more conservative dress. <br /> <br /> Corky was a bit annoying. It was a bit out of place on the campus of a high school. First of all, I never understood why he was there.
