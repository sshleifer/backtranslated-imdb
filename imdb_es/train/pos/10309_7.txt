Now, either you like Mr. Carrey's humor or not. I, Irene and myself had audiences that walked in droves and, on the other hand, cheered and collapsed in puddles of joy. Bruce Almighty is a bit more conventional, but he has been warned. <br /> <br /> If you're not sure, look at the trailer. I saw the trailer three times and I still laughed at the same gags when I saw the movie. If you can not find the view of a dog that puts the seat down after using the bathroom, do not bother with the movie. <br /> <br /> Carrey, a reporter caught in a routine that covers "lighter news" scolds God when his whole life seems to go to the pot. God accepts the challenge and asks Carrey if he can do better. Carrey is involved in having all the powers of God by making the breasts of his girlfriend (Jennifer Aniston) bigger, getting promoted and responding to everyone's prayers with computer commands in one fell swoop. <br /> <br /> This is not a high-level film or even a memorable one, but it's very well made with its very limited intention, it provides almost continuous laughter to Carrey fans, and even any religious possibility can be harmless to all but the squads of narrower and more opposite gods. - Two squads. <br /> <br /> At the most reflective level, the film tempts us to speculate about Carrey's own career: caught in his "comedy" box, he has largely failed to impress a serious actor, even after Win two Golden Globes. His most successful 'direct' role, Man on the Moon, is less known than his comedy is presented - or The Truman Show (in which the Academy garnered three nominations while overlooking Carrey) .
