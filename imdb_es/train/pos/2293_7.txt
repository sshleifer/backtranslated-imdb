This is a very, very early caricature of Bugs Bunny. As a result, the character is still in a period of transition: he is not as stiff as he was later and his voice is not entirely correct. Also, the chemistry between Elmer and Bugs is a bit unusual. Elmer is a poor bum who buys bugs at a pet store. There is no weapon or desire on your part to fly the bunny to the little ones! However, despite this, this is a very nice movie. The first Bugs were definitely more daring and cruel than their later incarnations. In later films, he got involved with Elmer, Yosimite Sam and others because they started it, they got into the rabbit. But, in this movie, he looks a lot more like Daffy Duck in the late 30s and early 40s: an imbecile who loves to irritate others! A true "anarchist" instead of the hero of later cartoons. While this is not among the best Bug Bunny cartoons, it's fun to watch and it's interesting to see how much it has changed over the years.
