I really wonder how this program is presented in the USA. UU And in the rest of Europe. IT IS SO TO BE A FRIEND TO BEING AN AMERICAN (particularly white Americans). That could be an important reason for the poison and vitriol that are expressed here in this forum. I love the show, but I have some reservations and I feel that Spoiler Spoiler came off easily: <br /> <br /> It crashed and burned everything at the end of the second season. Julie slammed the door with the hope of reviving the show unless her character lands in a hayloft in the middle of a farm. Who knows? It was a funny show, obscene and, at times, somewhat frightening.
