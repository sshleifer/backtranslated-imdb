Great, great, great! That's all I can say about that movie, but imdb wants at least four lines of text, so I'll explain it. The cast was great (Jerry O'connel is so cute!), The music was great (the sixties had the best music, imho), the historical material was interesting, and so was the way in which the actors of the 90. It seems that they were actually there in the 60s. And, above all, the stories of the main characters made me cry, and that is the greatness of any drama. BUT IN A WORD: BIG!
