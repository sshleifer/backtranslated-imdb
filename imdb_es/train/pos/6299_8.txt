There are good ways to make a movie and bad manners and this is the first. This little adventure does not require anything more than what it gives the audience. It presents a simple story, told very clearly with enough jokes to follow, and then improves and improves. Clooney's cameo is fun and very welcome, but potential customers, including Sam Rockwell and Luiz Guzman, can easily do it on their own. Pleasant and fun, so hilarious towards the end, Welcome to Collinwood is a welcome addition to the robbery genre.
