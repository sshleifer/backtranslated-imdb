We really enjoy Gray Owl: a simple story well told in the classic Attenborough way: a bit too romantic, with archetypes, humor and a stress of dignity and values. <br /> <br /> Beautifully filmed and told in a beautiful This is the true story of Archie, an Englishman who became a native of India and went to live and trap Canada. <br /> <br /> The solid performances of all make this film easily seen. <br /> <br /> Two of the stars in the film are undoubtedly the most beautiful we have ever seen, and the message is good with its ecoleantes. It must have been great to meet or read Gray Owl in the 1930s, a unique character and this is a suitable film tribute.
