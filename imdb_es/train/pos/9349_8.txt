['I really did not go to &quot;Reign Over Me&quot; knowing exactly what to expect from the director or the story. The plot was quite easy to understand, I suppose. The whole family of this kind died on September 11 and the world is left without life. All right. I did not know if I was going to use terrorism addiction as a platform to talk about that or other issues related to it, and it really does not do it on a very obvious level, so if you&#39;re afraid of being surrounded by political opinions that may be different to yours, I would not worry. I think the writing even made a point to never explicitly mention &quot;September 11&quot;. <br /><br /> In general, I was impressed. It was a very moving image. The film has a sense of humor and is very sharp, but it is definitely a drama where it counts. I usually do not like to think that comedic actors are incapable of acting really, but sometimes, let&#39;s be honest, they are. Adam Sandler is definitely capable of doing it (and although I think so, you can disagree, Jim Carrey is also very complete ... sometimes). Sandler&#39;s interpretation of Charlie Fineman took on a character that at first glance seems completely unreal and makes it absolutely believable. I read many reviews that criticized the writing of Alan Johnson&#39;s wife (Don Cheadle in another excellent role, if not one that seems similar to some of his most recent photos), which is well interpreted by Jada Pinkett Smith, describing it as static and boring . , but that is completely false. <br /><br /> She has depth, but part of her is hidden behind the main story, which deviates and occasionally blurs. (Which also brings to mind some very unusual transitions made at the beginning of the film, with an extravagant fading of &quot;Making everything out of focus.&quot; After the first 40 minutes, they are no longer used. perspective of the characters, artistically, or maybe they realized how irritating it was.) The film gradually begins to reveal the point (one of several, but definitely the most explicit) of the story, which is that sometimes people They have to deal with pain in their own way. It may seem unorthodox, it may seem frankly unhealthy, but perhaps what some people want more than anything is just to forget. To simply exist. The soundtrack of the films was excellent, and he used the music to pursue and amplify the moods, instead of establishing them, which gives credit to the actors and writers. <br /><br /> The film takes its name from the song &quot;Love, Reign O&#39;er Me&quot;, outside the rock opera of The Who, Quadrophenia. The song itself is quite insignificant for the real story, but it is used powerfully in the film during the climax and at the end. The movie has a good pace and does not seem to be dragging anywhere in its length, which is a little over 2 hours. If you can accept Adam Sandler&#39;s portrayal of this deeply disconsolate and broken man, you will enjoy the movie. You will become entangled in the story and feel genuinely for the characters in every minute of the story. It is not the best movie of the year, and it has nothing innovative or positive, but it is a very nice and visible movie, in general.']
