This is one to see a couple of times. The excellent writing shows that they had to have lived this story or know someone who did it because they nailed it. Freebird made me relive and laugh at my poorly written youth. The title was a great choice. Great movie, setting, story, soundtrack and characters. It's a movie for motorcyclists, but it would be a shame to do it that way. Fun to the bone, a bit like Trailer Park Boys in the USA. UU If you've never seen TPB, make a point if you like this movie. Thank you. I hope to see more of these characters in other movies. Continuation? It could be done. There is much more of the world that I would like to see through your eyes.
