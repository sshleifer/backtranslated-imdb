Before the usual comments, my main curiosity about THIS IS NOT A SONG OF LOVE is that, while there is a run time on the 94-minute IMDb list, the Wellspring Media DVD in the United States has 88 minutes. Any comments on this are welcome! <br /> <br /> Two friends with very difficult lives set out on an adventure. What ends is just that: one accidentally shot a girl and the two escaped on foot to the field. Instead of just a big chase, the movie is complicated by the imbecile and rather childish Spike behaves inappropriately and grabs his boom box like a teddy bear. Some viewers may dislike the story based solely on the character Spike, but without a bit of frustration added to the story, the movie would have been too easy. You will notice the way in which the more stable character, Heaton, refers to Spike as "big man" in contrast to the attitude and behavior of "boy out of control" of Spike. Frankly, I was also aggravated by the ridiculous actions of Spike, especially the spray can smell, but in a desperate situation it is clear that someone of his mentality would choose a temporary escape. But, Heaton was there to keep things under control until things were overlooked as well. <br /> <br /> Kenny Glenaan as Heaton is a wonder, and after a while I stopped wondering why the hell he would. I want to pick up Spike from prison and continue a friendship, due to the great performance of Glenaan. After all, there are many reasons during his career that it would be a good idea for Heaton to simply get rid of Spike and try to save himself. I suppose Heaton felt like a protective older brother for Spike, and the loyalty between the two is hard to break, until things get desperate. <br /> <br /> Although some of the cinematographies are really artistic, they do offer more flavor to the story instead of shots of men running through the desert. The beautiful landscapes, the rain and the vast gray sky offer a somber tone that increases the feeling of tragic circumstances. The score is also unusual, and the use of Public Image Ltd.'s song "This Is Not A Love Song" and how the title of the film is quite intelligent. <br /> <br /> In general, it is understandable if you do not mind. THIS IS NOT A SONG OF LOVE, since it focuses on two contrasting personalities who escape from another man determined to hunt them (played by a genial and quiet David Bradley). It is not a big budget action entertainment. For the rest of us who enjoy looking for something minimal and dramatic, it is a time that is worthwhile and YES offers some extremely tense moments in which you hold your breath a little. <br /> <br /> I am really enjoying the recently released films from Scotland recently, with this guy, Dog Soldiers and The Devil's Tattoo. I am also a little grateful for the subtitles offered on this DVD, as the accents are sometimes very fast and difficult for some viewers like me to understand. <br /> <br /> Frustrating, dark, and often tense, THIS IS NOT A SONG OF LOVE, it's a tragic but fascinating story. <br /> <br />
