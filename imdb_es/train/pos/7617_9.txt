A very addictive series. I had never seen an exact combination of drama, action, suspense and science fiction. I am impressed every chapter. The script is very intelligent, I do not know how the creators invent all these amazing stories, each character has a strange past, problems, stormy relationships, gives the show the human sense necessary to create intimate characters. <br /> <br /> The most incredible thing is the fact that all the characters are related to each other: the numbers have been found before without knowing it, and so on. The others, the enigmatic security system and the Darma initiative are elements that do not allow us to lose a chapter. <br /> <br /> Mr. JJ Abrams, what did you think to create this incredible story?
