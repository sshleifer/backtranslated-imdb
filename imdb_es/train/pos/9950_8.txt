Very good action with an interwoven story that does not really suck. Interesting enough to deserve attention instead of skipping to get to the good parts. Having Jenna Jameson and Asia Carrere also helps cheer him up. Jenna in that sweater and those glasses is simply amazing! It's worth picking up just to see it!
