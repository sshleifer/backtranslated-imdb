... but I enjoyed this show anyway I've been reading some of the comments that previous reviewers have had to say about this program, and it's costing me a lot to completely cancel out all the criticism in my head (except one: the program was sold out, this program was SOMETHING MORE but rancid). Many of the things that people discuss about this program are about money: pretentious; forced; overexcited; desperate for attention; Self-congratulatory annoying narration always present. But you know what? I really liked it. It was different, it was original, really, really TRIED; and that it compensated for all the inconveniences. The show was brilliant, verbal, fast, witty, interesting, fun to watch ... you know, it was only once a week, I could take it once a week and wait and enjoy it. I will mourn your step. But I guess nobody will bring this back to life.
