['This may not be a memorable classic, but it is a poignant romance with an important theme that highlights the importance of literacy in modern society and the devastating consequences in the life and lives of any unfortunate person who lacks this vital ability. <br /><br /> The story revolves around Iris, a widow who meets a co-worker at her factory job, an illiterate coffee shop worker named Stanley. Iris discovers that Stanley can not read, and after he loses his job, she gives him reading lessons at home in his kitchen. Of course, as you might predict, the two, although initially distrustful of getting involved, develop feelings for each other ... <br /><br /> Jane Fonda plays Iris, a woman with problems of her own, who faces a job without prospects, two teenage children (a pregnant woman), an unemployed sister and her abusive husband. However, Robert DeNiro is, of course, brilliant in his endearing interpretation of the intelligent and witty, but illiterate, Stanley, bringing a dignity to the role that demands respect. They are not your lovely couple of young yuppies, as is generally shown in screen romances, but a middle-class couple, of an ordinary working class, with very sensible struggles. <br /><br /> I will not reveal the ending, but it is a charming, comforting romance and a personal look at the problem of adult illiteracy, albeit from the perspective of a fictional character.']
