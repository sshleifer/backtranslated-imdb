I have had a lot of experience with women in Russia, and this film portrays how many of them are, unfortunately. They are very cunning, ruthless and greedy, as well as highly unfair. From the robotic sex, the hustle and bustle of gifts, lies and betrayal, I have experienced everything in Russia. <br /> <br /> I know what I'm talking about. And here are my qualifications: Here are the periodicals of my three trips to Russia in search of a girlfriend. It includes thousands of photos of many Russian girls I met, black comedy, scams of which I knew, and the story of my robbery and appearance on Russian national television. <br /> <br /> http: //www.happierabroad .com / Photojournals.htm <br /> <br /> It's like Reality TV. You will love it. I spent a lot of time putting it together. So take a look. The Russian woman who plays Nicole Kidman is very similar to Julia and Katya in my photojournalism. <br /> <br /> My 3 trips to find brides in Russia are very exciting and they would sell themselves, why do not they do a movie of my girlfriend looking for adventures in Russia? However, there is an objective impossibility in this film, and that is the way in which the man orders his girlfriend from a catalog and sends her to the airport. It does not work that way, so I do not understand why the media likes to perpetuate this. There is not a single website introducing Russian brides that works this way, and I challenge anyone to find one that does. The fact is that you can only request the CONTACT INFORMATION of the Russian lady (email, address, telephone number, etc.) from the website. From there, you communicate with her and then visit her, and if you want to take her to your country, the immigration process begins in the INS office and waits months later. This is how it works in real life. You can not just order him to arrive at your airport. US immigration UU I would NEVER allow something like this to happen. <br /> <br /> WuMaster <br /> <br /> - I got everything I wanted to go abroad! You can too! http://www.happierabroad.com
