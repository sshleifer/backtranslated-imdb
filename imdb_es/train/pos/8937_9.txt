This was a good example of how you can make an interesting movie without using big stars and great effects. Just tell a true story about the struggles of two African-American women during a turbulent century. <br /> <br /> This film challenges us all to look at our own personal prejudices and see that people are people, not white, black, etc. <br /> <br /> Good movie with a good message.
