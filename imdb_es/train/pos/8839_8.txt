Thank God, this was not based on a true story, because it's a story. Populated by despicable characters whose depravity knows no limits, Before The Devil is a fascinating and amazing excursion to perversion that would be ridiculous (and sometimes, even with, or maybe because of, the sickly and tragic undercurrent of human dysfunction in It was not carried out with such a magnificent and overwhelming conviction of its stars. The excellent script of Kelly Masterson and the excellent direction of Sidney Lumet do not hurt either. <br /> <br /> The main dysfunction here is of a family nature, with the two brothers mostly screwed (brilliant depictions of Philip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke decided to steal their own parents' jewelry, an attempt that goes pathetically bad. < br /> <br /> The story is told with turns of time (which can be seen on the screen, like: "Charlie: Two days before the robbery", so no one should be confused), some people have said that they do not liked this device, but I thought it worked perfectly, which helped to improve the situation, considering that the two brothers in question just play with the complete decks, among them you can not make a good move. Add these tasty morsels: one of the brothers is a junkie, married to Gina (Marisa Tomei, also excellent), who is having an affair with the other brother, has a monumental sibling rivalry, along with the fact that the drug-addicted brother hates his father (a harrowing performance by Albert Finney), who apparently caused him serious pain in the past, and you have a tragedy of Shakespeare / Greece in your hands. Proceed with caution.
