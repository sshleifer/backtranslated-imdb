In New York, family dentist Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle) meets his former roommate and friend Charlie Fineman (Adam Sandler) by chance on the street. Charlie became a lonely and crazy man after the loss of his wife and three daughters in the tragic September 11, while Alan has trouble discussing his most intimate feelings with his wife. Alan returns to his friendship with Charlie and they approach. Alan tries to fix Charlie's life, sending him to psychologist Angela Oakhurst (Liv Tyler), but Charlie has an aggressive reaction to the treatment and is sent to court. <br /> <br /> "Reign Over Me" is a good idea. Drama about loss, friendship, family and loneliness. September 11 is irrelevant to the plot; It could be a car accident, a fire or any other tragedy, as well as the sexual harassment of Donna Remar, played by the beautiful Saffron Burrows, to Alan. But the family drama works, supported by the great performances of Adam Sandler and Don Cheadle. Liv Tyler is impossible to recognize, I do not know if she uses excessive makeup to look older, but her face is strange. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Reine Sobre Mim" ("Reign Over Me")
