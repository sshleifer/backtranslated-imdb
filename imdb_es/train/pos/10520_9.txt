I saw this film as an addict to Jane Austen and always doubting about the cinematic interpretation of the complexity of her novels: well, this transposition is simply accurate, intelligent, delicate, careful, discreet, respectful, intense, in a word, perfect! br /> <br /> "Emma" is one of Austen's most charming and fun novels, thanks to the general irony surrounding situations and characters. The film respected this subtle irony, without leaving aside the comic element (especially Miss Bates). What involved me in the novel, and the film clearly shows it, is the profound knowledge of human life shown by the English novelist and the modern aspect with which women, men and their relationship are handled, and it is surprising if we think how an eighteenth-century novelist, who lived an almost isolated life, could capture as much depth and truth about life as she does: that's what fascinates me the most. We can feel this modernity throughout the film: just replace the costumes and use a more current language, but situations, feelings, ideas would be extremely modern. I think of the morbid interest in other people's lives, or that insinuating envy that now always governs women's relationships, and it remains the difficulty to reveal and express feelings, especially love: every situation becomes universal and is out of place. value of time. <br /> <br /> The cast is really talented and offers very good and extremely brilliant performances: a young Gwyneth Paltrow is particularly suited to this role (nowadays she would probably be too mature for it), Toni Colette is simply great. And how I envied them for the wonderful dresses they could wear! And then, the stunning English countryside, where every situation takes on such a magical and dreamlike dimension ... a really nice and worthy movie.
