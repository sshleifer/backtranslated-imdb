The Bible teaches us that the love of money is the root of all evil. The love of money leads to greed that can lead to pride and, ultimately, destruction. Andy and Hank, two brothers, will discover how much money will cost them and who love them the most. <br /> <br /> Andy Hanson (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and his younger brother Hank (Ethan Hawke) could not be more different. Andy seems to be enjoying the success of working in the New York real estate market and is married to his beautiful wife Gina (Marisa Tomei), which is the idea of ​​a trophy wife, if it ever existed. Hank, however, is a divorce that is at the mercy of his ex-wife, the expensive bills from his daughter's school and the endless amount of child support payments. A man who has good intentions and has good intentions, however, Hank can not escape the water that slowly rises above his head, no matter how difficult it is to stay above it. <br /> <br /> However, Andy has his own. The problems with the only difference between him and his brother are that he hides them better. He has committed fraud against his company and is very involved in the use of drugs to escape his fears. The pressure of his life, and the lies he needs to keep up appearances, have made him think of running away from the country with Gina to start over. Of course, like Hank, he needs money to do this and believes he knows how to get it. How? Stealing the jewelry that their parents own and administer. This act of betrayal is where the Hanson brothers, their families and many other lives will be destroyed by greed, pride and fear. <br /> <br /> The singularity of Before the devil knows that you are dead is the way in which the story is told. After the theft fails, and Nanette Hanson (Rosemary Harris), who is the mother of Andy and Hank, is murdered, the story is told from a variety of different points of view from several days before and after the attempted robbery. We learn more about the motivations of not only Andy and Hank, but also the reaction to his father Charles (Albert Finney) at the death of his wife. The relationship between Charles and his two children, especially Andy, is also explored and another potential motivation is discovered after it is revealed that there is little love between the two men. Nanette may have been loved by her children, but her father is a different story. <br /> <br /> Philip Seymour Hoffman proves once again why he is one of the most impressive actors in Hollywood today by portraying Andy not only as a greedy criminal with a lack of morality but also, in a contradictory way, as a man with whom we can sympathize. Ethan Hawke also brings Hank to life, not only as a loser, but also as a man desperate to cling to what little he has left. Andy and Hank come alive in such a realistic way that it is easy to think that they are not just characters, but very real images of lost and confused men who now face the consequences of their actions. <br /> <br /> Before the devil knows that you have died it is a moral story about how our actions lead to consequences that we could not otherwise expect to face. More than that, our choices can also affect those around us in a way we had never expected. In what should have been the best image of the year, we see how lives break easily when the love of money becomes the ultimate quest to alleviate our troubled lives. In other words, there are no easy solutions or answers to our problems and trying to find them can only make things worse. <br /> <br /> 10/10
