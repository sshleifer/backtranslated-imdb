It's an ugly, ugly, unpleasant retro-action thriller about a bodyguard who's determined to find (and destroy!) The murderers of the girl he was supposed to protect. This film is almost an anachronism in today's politically correct environment. The director Scott has no desire to apologize for the inherent immorality behind the dramatic structure of the film. Scott is not aware or does not care about 30 years of social advances. I really do not think we'll see a more violent film in the short term, so better go and look at this while you can. In spite of its implacable gravity, I believe that the film is a powerful example of cinema in its most sinister, exploitative and effective form. Scott has something hard to sell, but I think I'm a buyer. The extraordinary technical aspects of this film are too effective to ignore. Scott's choices as directors are simply amazing, and he draws a great performance from Denzel Washington. Sensitive souls should stay away from it, but I recommended it to viewers looking for a great action-packed movie.
