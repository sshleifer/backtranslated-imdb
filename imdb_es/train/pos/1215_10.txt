This is my favorite of the three bears care movies. Once again I liked all the songs. However, the big problem, as most people have pointed out, is that this story contradicts the original. For those who saw the first memory of the film, the bears found their "cousins" who apparently never met. It was not until the end, of course, that the cousins ​​received their abdomen symbols after showing how much they cared. In this story, however, cousins ​​grow up with care bears and have belly symbols all the time. That said, it's not a bad movie, as long as you keep it separate from the first one. I thought that the character of Darkheart was much more evil than Nicholas's first. But at the same time I felt that it added a kind of balance to the sweetness of the care bears. I also liked the part that matters to us in the end, although I know that other people had mixed feelings about that scene. And of course I LOVED the songs. My favorites are growing and always young. The care that movies have always had so good songs. Ten stars for a very good movie.
