['A friend lent me this DVD, which I think he received from the director of a festival, I think. I was warned that some of the technical aspects of the film were a bit unstable and that the writing was good, but not excellent. So maybe that influenced my judgment, but I must admit that I liked this movie. <br /><br /> The highlights are the actors. Youssef Kerkor was really good like Ernie, the main character, something pathetic in a nice way. Adam Jones (who also directed) and Justin Lane were excellent as roommates who drive Ernie crazy. The character of Bill (Justin Lane), who spends much of the film dressed as a panda, was by far my favorite; It seemed the least one-dimensional, and it reminded me of an old roommate at the university who called the guy after watching the DVD. Really kind, and very funny. Some of the other performances were good, others were more or less, but none was bad. I also liked the vigilant duo very much. Ridiculous and fun <br /><br /> I give this a high score, although it has some problems, because when you see it, you can say that these people cared and decided to make their film in their own way. Well done to Adam Jones and the crew.']
