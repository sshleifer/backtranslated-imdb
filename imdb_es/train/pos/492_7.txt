First, let me say that although I have seen all the episodes of StarTrek at least twice, I do not consider myself a Trekker or Trekkie. These are people who live in the basement of their parents and attend conventions with costumes with pointed rubber ears. I gave this movie a cast of seven historical fiction errors. The performance was better than average, but the plot had no surprises. They worked hard to reverse engineer the technology, but still special effects were a great temptation. Now, regarding historical errors, if you call them that, the first Captain who piloted the Enterprise was Commander April, then Captain Pike, Jim Kirk, etc. I educated them and gave them the technology (that is why a main directive was created), but as I said, there is no reason to discredit this good series. I hope that the plots are deeper and that special effects can be in the background.
