One more of those brilliant young people who did everything possible and dared to make a romance movie for teenagers (can I call it that? - would invoke the devil to their fans) with a micro budget but full of such taste, sensitivity and maturity. Peter Sollett: you deserve more admiration and respect. Thank you once again for demonstrating to the powers that be in the "industry" that stereotypes can be eliminated in the toilet. A place, a handful of rich characters, low budget, good acting (and that too amateurs), decent lighting: the worshipers of true indie cinema should see more of this and STOP looking ... well ... you know what.
