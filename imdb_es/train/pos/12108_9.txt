['Yakitate! Ja-pan (translated as Fresh Baked! Japanese Bread) is the story of a young man named Azuma Kazuma and his journey to make the perfect Japanese bread or Ja-pan, for Japan and for the Japanese, which will be recognized as the whole world . <br /><br /> Of course, that is only abroad. Actually, Yakitate! Ja-pan is not really about the bread, but the reaction that occurs after eating the bread and the wordplay that comes with the reaction. The series is adorable because of these puns. From popular anime titles like Naruto, Detective Conan and Dragon Ball to hit movies like The Matrix and Lord of the Rings. It&#39;s all there. <br /><br /> So, how is this title different from other titles of the same genre such as Cooking Master Boy or Mr. Ajikko? Well, unlike the others who use the kitchen to dominate the world, Yakitate! Ja-pan is purely comedy. Of course, there are times when history becomes drama, or even murder, but the comic atmosphere makes you laugh at them. You will laugh at your own vision of heaven. Just look at it. <br /><br /> Just remember that this is also fiction, although part of the bread that is made here is based on real bread, eating Japan # 2 made at home will not make you a Super Saiyan or rubber.']
