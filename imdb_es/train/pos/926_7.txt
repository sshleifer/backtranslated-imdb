I do not know why some people criticize the program so much. <br /> <br /> It's a great and fun program; probably not the right material for primetime, but still ... <br /> <br /> Family dynamics are fun, and in general, the same as most comedy shows. The secondary characters are absolutely hilarious. The plots of the individual episodes and the frequent incursions of Siegfried and Roy are barely above average, but there are always subplots or single-row phrases that make you roll on the floor laughing. <br /> <br /> This The show was worth the Â£ 8 I paid for it. <br /> <br /> rating: 8/10
