This was probably one of the most well-made films of the 1940s: Warner Bros. at the height of his style. The photography of Sol Polito is, without doubt, his best achievement: magnificent compositions and lighting with delicate shadows. Max Steiner contributes one of his most complex and beautiful scores, the epitome of his classic method of leit motives. The music adds great emotion and emotion to the plot and is exquisite and memorable. It is interesting to note that the same production team that made this movie went ahead to do "Now, Voyager" later that year, an excellent movie that won honors and awards and became a favorite of the story, because it was starring by Bette Davis. In my opinion, "The Gay Sisters" is a much better movie, better done in all departments and more interesting, complex and enjoyable. A very unusual film that entertains those who take it for what it is, instead of projecting their own modern creative sensibilities or their advanced and demanding standards of hypercritical perfection. Each thing must be judged on its own time reference and what it is trying to achieve on its own terms. Most of the complaints I have read in these reviews are very childish and have nothing to do with it. If you are hungry for a perfect filet mignon, do not go to the bakery counter and start complaining and complaining about fluffy pasta. The art of film criticism is truly lost in a large segment of the population. Sorry, folks: maybe if this movie had a score on the Rolling Stones and a hundred intricate and soul-searching plots, everyone would happily rejoice. I'll take an old movie without modern intellectual pretensions one day of the week!
