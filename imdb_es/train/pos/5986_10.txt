This movie is the most cult metal movie that exists. Premise: a child seizes the final recording of his favorite artist, Sammy Curr, who recently died in a hotel fire. He plays it backwards and summons him from the dead to take revenge in the name of heavy metal in those late b ** jocks that torment him. Any true metal fan will enjoy this movie, and if you're a metal fan tormented by sportsmen, play an upside down Sammy Curr album ... do not wait, he's fictitious, so sign up for this movie. Look at it with your fist in the air, hitting your head and volume at 11!
