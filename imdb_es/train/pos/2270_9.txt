['The film is a bit &quot;thin&quot; after reading the book, but it is still one of the best films ever made. Sheryl Lee is beautiful and Nick Nolte is really &quot;vonneguty&quot;. He does a great job expressing the feelings of the book to the movie. There are not many films that capture the feeling of the book as Mother&#39;s Night does.']
