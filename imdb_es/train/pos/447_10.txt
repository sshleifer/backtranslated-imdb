This is one of the best movies. It is one of my favorites. A movie with good performance. The story is very sensitive and moving. Good work with the camera too. <br /> <br /> The names of the actresses and actors are not at the top of the American Star list. However, they offer performance equal to or better than the first on the list. <br /> <br /> It's a pleasure to see a movie about true love, romance, friendship without having to endure seeing someone have to kick the box. his way of saving the world. <br /> <br /> If you do not like this movie, you have no heart or feelings. Then go see a sports movie. There is no killing or horror here. See the movie It is mandatory. TH
