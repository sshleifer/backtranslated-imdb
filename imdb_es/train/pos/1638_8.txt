Heartland was in production almost at the same time as Heaven's Gate, by Michael Cimino. Heartland has a fraction of production, but it is 10 times larger than the film. <br /> <br /> Heaven's Gate was "the biggest and most expensive ($ 40 million in 1980!) Hollywood failures of all time, its failure resulted in the sale of the United Artists studio to MGM" -imdb entry <br /> <br /> Heartland cost a few hundred thousand dollars and benefits from excellent writing, directing, photography and acting. It easily attracts you to the beauty, the joys, the difficulties and the sadness of the pioneer life. <br /> <br /> It's sad that Hollywood sometimes spills millions in turkeys (based on the great success of a director) and neglects such a wonderful story.
