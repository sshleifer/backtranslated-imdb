I am a writer who works at home and Diagnosis Murder is my lunchtime companion: good fun, good humor and nostalgia for the days of the Dick van Dyke show. What innocents we all were (and how innocent is murder by diagnosis). I particularly enjoyed the episodes with other nostalgia figures such as Joe Mannix. The bad ones are always caught, the good ones continue. The stars have fun clearly and are having fun without taking themselves too seriously. <br /> <br /> A beef: why were so many villainous women or at least bitches? Amanda was too dizzy. It is hard to imagine her doing something as frightening as an autopsy. <br /> <br /> I hope we have not seen Dick Van Dyke and his family on our screens, especially. at lunch time !!
