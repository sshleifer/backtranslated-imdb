This movie is hilarious! I saw him with my friend and we had to see him again. This film is not for those who visit it, who will only see the films nominated for the Academy Awards (they already know who you are). I will not summarize it because they have already seen it in all the other reviews. <br /> <br /> "Whipped" is a cheerful comedy that made me laugh all the time. It is not taken too seriously and should be observed with your friends, not with your girlfriend. You will not win any prize, but you just have to see it to appreciate it. It's true that some of the jokes are toilet humor, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Everyone can use some of that sometimes. Some people need to lighten up and see "Whipped" for what it is, not for what it is not. <br /> <br /> **** 1/4 of *****.
