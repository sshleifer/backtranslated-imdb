Sniper gives true new meaning to war movies. I remember movies about Vietnam or World War II, many shots, they all die, bam bam. "Sniper" takes the war to a new level or refinement. The film certainly conveys all the emotions it points to: the helplessness of humans in the jungle, the hatred and eventual trust between Beckett and Miller, and the hustle and bustle of the moment they pull the trigger. A seemingly low-budget film compensates for each failure with action, suspense and emotion, because when it comes to that, it's just a shot, a death.
