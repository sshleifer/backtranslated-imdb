['Domini Enfilren (Marlene Dietrich) has spent most of her life taking care of her father. Now that he died, she is free, but she does not know what she wants. Boris Androvsky (Charles Boyer) is a monk who has fled from a monastery to savor more of life. They accidentally meet in Algiers, fall in love and get married. But he can not leave behind his past and she can not live without him ... <br /><br /> The exaggerated way of romance full of situations and hysterically bad dialogues. Dietrich and Boyer do everything possible to give good performances, but NO ONE could get away with some of their lines! Still, in a way, it&#39;s a classic. It is filmed in a beautiful Technicolor (try to see it on DVD) where each painting is amazingly beautiful. Dietrich always dresses at 9 (even in the middle of the desert) and makes hysterical postures to wear clothes and body. Boyer simply walks around with a surprised face (no surprise). I still never got bored. It was wonderful to see him and the stupid dialogue that did not stop kept me on time. The end almost made me fall from my chair because I was laughing so hard! Now I love scholars and I give them a lot of space but, really, this is amazing! It also runs a very short 80 minutes. <br /><br /> As a classic of the camp I give this one an 8. Like a serious movie - a 1.']
