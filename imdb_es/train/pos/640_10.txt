last night, my sister and I saw the premiere ... it was so good that we were stuck for the whole thing ... hahaha ... I think I'm hooked for the season ... they have very good actors this thing ... the coach in chief and the player who likes pete were very good and the plot already has me, but I really do not understand how they will keep it stretched throughout the season ... probably there will be something big I can not wait until Tuesday. Finally Jeremy, who is he? I can say it's going to be great !! It was so good that we fell in love with his character immediately ... I can not wait for the next episode ... GO TO Jeremy! <br /> <br /> 'Aimee
