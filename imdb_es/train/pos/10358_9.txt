I remember seeing this movie several years ago on the Lifetime television network and I thought it was an interesting story. Several years later I see him again and I fall in love with this movie. The story behind the film is fascinating in itself. The cast makes it much more attractive. Meryl Streep is definitely at the top of her game in this photo. Nail Mrs. Chamberlain's gestures, the accent and even the look. She shows the pain, the pain, the surprise and anger that Lindy had to endure, and in the process it is hard to remember that it IS NOT Lindy. In my opinion, this performance by Meryl was better than her Oscar-winning turn in "Sophie's Choice," and she should have won her third Oscar. Sam Neill is perfect as Michael Chamberlain, and for some surprising reason, he was not recognized by the Academy with at least one nomination. In total, this film only receives A nod to the Oscar (Streep as Best Actress). However, he received several Oscars and Australian nominations. <br /> <br /> Definitely a first level movie: tell a great story and you get great performances from the whole cast.
