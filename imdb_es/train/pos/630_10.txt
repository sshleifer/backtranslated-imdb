I did not expect much from this movie. They gave me a ticket for an advanced screening. He had just left work. It was hot and I was tired. I had to wait 40 minutes in the line of the film and there did not seem to be fresh air in the corridors of the theater complex. <br /> <br /> Once sitting in the cinema, tired and frustrated, the film began. At first I did not recognize any of the actors, but the flow of the film was perfect. From the beginning I began to consume with the film and I got more and more excited with every minute that passed. I think this movie is meant to be a fantasy / fairytale classic. The actors were fabulous, the rhythm was perfect and the ending was magical.
