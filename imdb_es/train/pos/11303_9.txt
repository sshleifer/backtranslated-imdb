Visconti's first film has all its characteristic visual skill and immaculate technique, accompanied by the convincing interpretations of Massimo Girotti as the handsome vagabond and, best of all, Clara Calamai as the fabulous and frenetic Giovanna. He remade several times as 'The Postman Rings Twice' but never improved. I can not believe that this was the first movie of man! It shows someone's confidence at the peak of their career.
