I read Schneebaum's book (the same title as this film) when it was first published and he was deeply moved by his ability to see through the many forms of "otherness" (his and the people of the Amazon with whom lived and loved) for A way to live a decent life. His later books were not so powerful, but they showed his continuing search. His description of his sexual relations with the men of the tribe was far ahead of his time in the early 60s, but his honesty and openness were welcome. This film beautifully conveys both the rarity and the generosity of man, but it also offers a vision of the inevitable destruction of innocence (which is not a morally positive term, in this case) that occurs when "civilized" men interfere in the traditional societies. Even so, Schneebaum himself has moved towards a kind of superior innocence that suggests the possibility of saving humanity from its own destructive capacity.
