I found this movie available for streaming on Netflix and I thought about trying it out. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around Ryan and Theo Taylor (Colm Feore and David Cubitt) who have finally seen each other afterwards. his father has passed away. Ryan and Theo at first argue over who did what. But later, Theo discovers that his brother Ryan is not only gay but is dying of a terminal illness. Then, Ryan and Theo spend their time fixing their differences. <br /> <br /> This is an incredible movie. I've only seen Colm Feore in Season 7 of 24, but he was phenomenal in this. David Cubitt, an actor I have NEVER heard of, also did a phenomenal job. <br /> <br /> I would recommend it to those who are interested in the gay and lesbian genre. This is a movie you do not want to miss. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 10 stars out of 10. Excellent movie!
