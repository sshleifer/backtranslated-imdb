I've been a fan of Jodie Foster since we were both kids, since her years at Disney. I loved his tomboy antics in movies like Candleshoe. <br /> <br /> "Foxes" was a great deviation from all that. <br /> <br /> Where other young female actors of that time turned to sex. Childhood disguised as a comedy ("Little Darlings", anyone?), Jodie looked for a depressing and tragic story of adolescents dragged to their demise by the powerful enchantment of temptation and addiction. <br /> <br /> This was not Disney. This was not Porky's. This was not "Halloweed". This was a dark and powerful story of the destruction of young lives. Unfortunately, it is a story that is still being played every day throughout the country, this film could be replayed (with a current soundtrack) and still be totally relevant. <br /> <br /> It is not the best movie ever made. is tired in some parts, not all performances are particularly outstanding. But Jodie Foster continued to show her skills as a true adult actress (a trend that began when she was very young in Taxi Driver). <br /> <br /> 7 of 10 Barky
