This movie has been on my wish list for ten years and I recently found it on a DVD when it was given to my partner's grandchild. He saw it and was thrilled to learn that it was my generation, born in 1930 and evacuated in 1939 and wanted to know more about it, and me. Fortunately I borrowed it from him and I saw it on my own and I cried during the whole process. Not only did he capture the emotions, the class distinction, the difficulties and warmth of the human relationships of those years (as well as the cruelties (spoken and not spoken), but he was also successful. ARP uniforms, ambulances (LCC) of the correct color (white) and all the impediment of the management of the bomb sites and the work of the Heavy Rescue Brigades, I could not reproach any of this from my memories, and the sack of sand The Anderson shelter and the WVS eaters brought it all in. The difference between the relatively intact life in the village and the war-torn London also came through clearly, I relived 1939/40 and my own evacuation of London with this production! Gold's work, of course, and one would not expect more from him than this meticulous detail, but it went far beyond the precise representation of the facts and played deep chords on the human responses and the unique cos value judgments in half of those years. It was certa At present, it is one of the best places in the career of John Thaw and the direction of Gold, and deserves to be better known. It's a great movie and I've already ordered a couple of copies to send to friends.
