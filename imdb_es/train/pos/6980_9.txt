I must admit that I was one of the skeptics who judged this program prematurely before relatively much information was disseminated about it. I determined that it was going to be a cheap spin-off guided by Ronald D. Moore wielding the retcon wand. <br /> <br /> I was wrong! <br /> <br /> The pilot leaves an excellent impression on the spectators. The accessibility is wonderful! Of course, experienced BSG veterans will find themselves immersed in the plot, which focuses on the development of the Cylons before the First War. (58 years before the events of the pilot BSG). The pilot also allows newcomers, clearly presenting their plot and ideas in the first part of the episode. <br /> <br /> Make no mistake: "Caprica" ​​is not BSG. They present us with an immersive and cerebral drama sprinkled with provocative, daring and controversial ideas. <br /> <br /> The casting maintains the BSG standards; Stoltz and Morales are simply amazing. The representation of Morales by Joseph Adama, inspired by the representation of William Olmos, offers a wonderful vision of William's heroic father. The Stoltz representation of Dr. Graystone provokes many reflections and questions. <br /> <br /> If the quality of the pilot is an indication of what is to come, RDM and the creative team are prepared to continue the legacy of BSG first Program television with another masterpiece of television created with mastery .
