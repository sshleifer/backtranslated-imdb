A long time ago, I saw this movie from the center by cable. Then I fell in love with Mary Moronov. I saw her again at Comer Raoul. He was convinced that she is the sexiest woman on the screen. <br /> <br /> Maybe I was inclined for this movie. 9 of 10. <br /> <br /> This is the only movie I have on the original film.
