Fever Pitch is a pretty funny movie. It has many fun moments (including a hilariously disturbing shower scene). Like most romantic comedies, it has a "dead zone" in the middle where everything heavy, "she's breaking up with me", things happen, but other than that, it's still fun to the end. <br /> <br /> Although the plot revolves around fanaticism towards the Red Sox, it is not overloaded with sports. You do not have to be a fan to enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> Of course it's easy for me to say: I've also been a Red Sox fan since I was a child. <Br /> <br /> 7 of 10. <br /> <br /> Barky
