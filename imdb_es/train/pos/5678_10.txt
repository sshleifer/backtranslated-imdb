Even today we could use Black Adder. Imagine Rowan Atkinson resuming the role of assistant prime minister played by the wonderful Hugh Laurie. Hugh is sensational as the imbecile Prince George and Edmund as his brilliant assistant. I love the episode that Kenneth Connor plays as a British actor. Each time, Edmund says Macbeth. The two actors play a little foolish act to ward off the evil spirits. It's the most fun you'll see. Of course, none of this brilliant and comedic genius could be without Ben Elton and Richard Curtis, who are also behind such films as Love Actually, The Thin Blue Line, Four Weddings and A Funeral. Black Adder is fun and almost too good for television. Humor can be smart, sexy and fun at the same time. Last night, on Saturday Night Live, I expected Hugh Laurie to pay tribute to his experience in British humor. If the gang in SNL did a little research, they would know what a treasure it was to have Hugh Laurie in his stage.
