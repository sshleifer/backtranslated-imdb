I just thought it was excellent and I still do it. I'm grateful that we can still see things different from what Hollywood almost floods us with. Saving Grace is smart and nice: those who are offended by the issue of marijuana is better to go see the movie of the bride of the United States. <br /> <br /> Saving Grace also shows that a funny movie does not have to be stupid. For most of the time I was laughing at my ass, but she was also asking me questions about what the female lead was supposed to pay for her late husband's debts. <br /> <br /> In a few words, an ingenious story with the typical English humor. And good performance and direction. You can not ask for more. <br /> <br /> 7/10.
