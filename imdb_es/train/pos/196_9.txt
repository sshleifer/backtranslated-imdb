This for me was a wonderful introduction to the talents and beauty of Marion Davies. She is not only beautiful, but also hilarious in this movie. (I think Lucille Ball could have modeled her later career according to Davies' style, which could be called "crazy beauty.") Vidor's direction is light but sure, the story is a bit of a brown one, of course, but the performance is wonderfully contemporary . and the element of stargazing for fans of the silent era, with many cameos, adds to the overall fun. It combines pretty well the elements of the slapstick with adult drama and good old romance. For all movie fans who have an instinctive reaction to watching silent movies, sit through it and you can change your attitude. <br /> <br />
