I bought this game on an impulse walmart purchase. I am happy to have done it. It was very entertaining to listen to Sean Connery and play the game. I thought the graphics were the best I've seen in a new version of a movie / game. The bonus levels were very difficult! The sniper I think was too hard, it frustrated me so much that I did not play the game for a week and a half. There were too many people shooting you with nothing to hide behind or life to handle it. <br /> <br /> The only thing that could change was the update system. I did not notice any difference between the outdated and upgraded equipment, such as buying an armor upgrade did not seem to make the armor stronger or fuller in my life meter. I really liked the helicopter Q. I think the developers did a good job.
