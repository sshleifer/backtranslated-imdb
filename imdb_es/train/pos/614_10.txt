What a wonderful and fantastic movie is "Stardust". <br /> <br /> I could easily end it with that statement and suffice it to say that it could be taken as a very strong recommendation to see it. <Br /> <br /> At a time when Hollywood seems bent on forcing remakes and sequels in our throats, "Stardust" reminds us why we go to the cinema in the first place, to escape from reality for a couple of hours and explore other lives. , other times, or other planets. Ironically, "Stardust" takes us to all three places without effort and with a childhood joy that we all long for. <br /> <br /> "Stardust" is full of all the characters we remember as children: princes, witches, pirates, ghosts and scoundrels. It has the damsel in distress, the hero, the rogues, the obstacles, spells, antidotes, amulets and even a touch of speed of light to make it almost modern. <br /> <br /> "Stardust" is about a man from the city of Wall, who is conveniently located next to a wall that separates his city from a magical kingdom. The only way to get through the wall is through a bedroom that is guarded diligently by an old scruffy coder (played beautifully by David Kelly). One day, a young man from Wall named Ben Barnes maneuvers with the old guard and escapes through the bedroom. He meets an enchanted kingdom called Stormhold where he meets a chained (and very sexy) young woman called Una. She is captivated by a witch and bound by an unbreakable chain. While the witch is absent, Una seduces Ben and sends him on his way. Ben returns to Wall without incident and continues his life. But nine months later, he is summoned to the bedroom on the wall where the old guard gives him what you could expect: a child. <br /> <br /> The boy, named Tristan, becomes a rather unfortunate young man (Charlie Cox) who is in love with a girl outside of his league and is also committed to another. However, the young girl (called Victoria and played as Sienna Miller) goes out once with Tristain and he confesses his love. After they see a shooting star, she tells him that he can have it if he retrieves the star and brings it to him. He agrees and undertakes his search, which will take him to the other side of the wall. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, in the kingdom of Stormhold, the old king (perfectly played by Peter O'Toole) is dying. . He calls his remaining living children to tell them who will succeed him to the throne. The names of their children are Primus, Secondus, Sextmus and Septimus. The other children were killed by the other brothers in a humor contest to see who lives to get the throne. <br /> <br /> Anyway, he throws his ruby ​​charm to the sky and Voila, that's what brings the star to earth. . <br /> <br /> The star crashes in the form of a beautiful woman named Yvaine (Clare Danes) and she, of course, wears the amulet. But little does she know she is now being persuaded by Tristain, the Princes, and also an old witch named Lamia (Michelle Pfeiffer) who wants to cut the hearts of the stars to recover her own youth. <br /> <br /> Complicated? Yes. But everything comes together as the adventure unfolds. <br /> <br /> Tristain is the first to find Yvaine, but he is so blinded by his devotion to Victoria that he does not recognize the growing bond between him and Yvaine. His initial interest lies solely in returning Yvaine to Victoria as proof of his love. But he must pass to the princes and Lamia first. Princes are not such a big problem, as they are constantly trying to kill each other, and just like in "Pirates of the Caribbean," death has never been so fun. <br /> <br /> But Tristain also meets the witch who enslaved his mother (although he does not know what his mother is) and a band of flying pirates led by Robert DeNiro. <br /> <br /> His is the most important character in the movie and DeNiro plays it to perfection. The film is stolen with its hardness and we soon learn a secret that will leave the audience on the floor with laughter. Although his role is small in length, DeNiro is extraordinary! <br /> <br /> Michelle Pfeiffer is wonderful as Lamia, a sexy and evil witch. Claire Danes is more appropriate as the confused and anguished Yvaine. She makes a perfect damsel. Jason Flemyng, Adam Buston, Rupert Everett and Mark Strong add the perfect dose of lightness like the fighting princes who, while they die, return as ghosts of "Blithe Spirit" and "High Spirits". <br /> <br /> In addition, director Matthew Vaughn, whose only other directorial experience was "Layer Cake," weaves a charming story that everyone will enjoy. <br /> <br /> "Stardust" may be too complex for young children, but anyone over 13 years old will want to watch this movie several times. It's just that "Stardust" is what movies are supposed to be. Perfectly written, perfectly fused, perfectly directed and perfectly acted. In other words ... perfect.
