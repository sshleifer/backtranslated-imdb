The title is the sound that one of the characters makes while driving his imaginary car through the garbage dump where the characters live. The film is based on a series of stories by Shugoro Yamamoto and tells the story of a group of people who effectively live in dilapidated homes on the edge of the garbage dump. It is a mixture of laughter and sadness. <br /> <br /> The first color film made by Akria Kurasowa has been something I've wanted to see for a long time. Strangely, it was often indicated that it was only available in a reduced version from an original of three or four hours due to an error in the execution time in some promotional material. I was waiting for the full version, hoping to see what Kurasowa wanted us to see, only to discover in the recent launch of Criterion that the 140-minute version is the full version. <br /> <br /> Finally sitting down To see the movie last night I am of mixed emotions about the movie. First, it is visually linked to each movie that followed. You can see all the other six Kurasowals films reflected in this movie, until the sunsets painted. It is an amazing film in its use of color and you can understand why it took so long for a film with which he would be happy (of course, there are also failed projects). The movie is a work of visual art. (Although it is noticed that if you are going to see this on your widescreen TV, you filmed 1.33, so it will appear in a normal TV relationship). The rest of the movie is a mix. Part of the problem is that the lives of all these people do not come together. As separate stories, they all work well, but as a filmic whole they do not hang as one. I do not blame Kurasowa, since one can not always get things out of the box, especially when someone like Robert Altman, who specialized in films of multiple characters of this type, occasionally got bombed. <br /> <br /> This is not I do not mean that there are no reasons to see the movie. Like all Kurasowa movies, there are always reasons to see their films, whether they work or not. The first trip of the "trolley" is one of the best things that Kurasowa did and it is worth the price of the rent. It is one of the most magical moments in the history of cinema, since the car is inspected and removed. The father and son who live in the car touch (although ultimately they are very sad) and there are other parts and parts that shine (like the cast that is great in all areas) and at least one should try the movie as something different from a man. We usually associate with samurai movies or crime dramas. <br /> <br /> It is an intriguing failure of a master filmmaker, which means that in this case it means that he is better than most other filmmakers. <br /> <br /> Between 6 and 7 as a whole, much higher in pieces.
