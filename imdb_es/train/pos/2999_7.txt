There were times when this movie seemed to complicate much more than necessary, but I think that is part of its charm. The power of observation of the detective Philo Vance seems greater than all the oriental scholars of the time when it comes to the final evaluation of how the murders were committed. The fall of the dagger in the Chinese vase was what most struck me; I mean, could not someone have dropped it? <br /> <br /> Vance (William Powell) had a phrase at the beginning of the film about the "psychological impossibility" of Archer Coe to commit suicide; I had to think about that for a while. I was left wondering if in fact there is any scientific basis for that concept to be true, not having studied psychology myself. It seems logical, but there is always the case that it does not conform to the rules. <br /> <br /> You know, I was kicked by the agitated medical examiner (Etienne Girardot), who reminded me of Dr. Star Trek. McCoy a couple of times said "I'm a doctor, not a magician" and "I'm a doctor, not a detective." I can imagine DeForrest Kelley watching the movie and saying to himself, "I'll have to use that sometime." <br /> <br /> Once the murderer's identity is revealed, it does not seem like a big surprise. But until then it is really what nobody guesses. But aside from Archer and Brisbane Coe, the film did not answer the central question posed by the title and the murder he was really interested in: who killed Ghillie, Sir Thomas MacDonald's dog?
