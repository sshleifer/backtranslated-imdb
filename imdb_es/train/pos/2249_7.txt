I enjoyed watching Brigham Young and discovered that it was a positive and largely true portrait of the LDS faith. I think a remake of this epic journey through the plains would be beneficial, since many people today are not familiar with the trials and persecutions that the early Mormon church faced. It is an incredible story of a strong and devoted people. <br /> <br /> As a member of the church, the most disturbing aspect of the film (most of the historical inaccuracies did not bother me much) was the representation of Brigham Young as one who had "knowingly deceived" the members of the church making them believe that he had been called to be Joseph's successor as a prophet. Although I understand the dramatic reasons for this plot, it creates the impression that his doubts about it are a historical fact, when in reality, both Brigham and most church members understood and firmly believed that he had been called to lead the Church . Brigham did not knowingly deceive the saints; rather, he guided them with confidence by inspiration. The point is important for Mormons because it articulates an important aspect of our faith: that God really speaks to prophets today, and that Brigham Young, like Joseph Smith, was an inspired prophet of God. <br /> <br /> Whether or not you believe this statement or not, you just need to know that the film does not accurately describe what Brigham himself believed.
