The family is about two families that are after the blood of the other. <br /> <br /> Viren Sahay (Amitabh Bachchan) is a gift from the underworld, operates from Bangkok. He has a family in India. Once by mistake he kills Shekhar (Akshay Kumar). Like Viren Sahay, he also has a family (a brother, wife and parents). Aryan (Aryaman), Shekhar's brother is willing to take revenge for the death of his brother. Kidnaps the family of Viren Sahay for the same reason. <br /> <br /> The film has a turning point (Amitabh Bachchan). The second half of the film belongs completely to him where, instead of his dialogues, the expression matters more. The tiny Akshay role has also put him on par with Amitabh. I did not understand what Bhumika Chawala was doing in this movie. <br /> <br /> There were some loose points in the script; I like it; It has been shown that Amitabh is the most wanted criminal in the city, and still walks free of globetrotting. The kidnapping of his family also seems vague. How can the family of such a big gift not have security coverage?
