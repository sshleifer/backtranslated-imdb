Dahl seems to have been under the influence of Wenders' The American Friend. The innocent Nick Cage is recruited for a coup. Dennis Hopper plays a real Hit Man. Lara Flynn Boyle is dangerous. The Hero becomes more entangled the more he tries to free himself. And the small city of the United States does not seem as safe as the Big City. Like its predecessor mentioned above, this film has many twists and turns of the plot that seem unlikely, but all lead to cathartic self-discovery.
