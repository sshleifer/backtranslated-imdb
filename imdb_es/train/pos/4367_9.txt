I have not seen this movie in years, so my knowledge is a bit rusty. I remember thinking that this movie is twice the Braveheart movie. It is simply more realistic and has more credible characters. Ridb Roy it seems that one would imagine Rob Roy, with messy hair and beard with simple clothes. Liam Nesson also has a Celtic appearance, looks like a Scot and, more importantly, looks like Rob Roy. It's a comparison that angers some people, but compares it to Mel Gibson as William Wallace. Gibson is supposed to play a man whose legend has made him describe him as a 6ft 7 giant, while Gibson is almost a shorter foot. The story contains a bit of romance, conspiracy and a weaker storyline. Does it sound like Braveheart? But instead of a movie that claims "freedom", freedom and nationalism, we get a movie that says honor, love and justice. This makes it a more interesting movie. Like Gladiator. The cast is fantastic and Liam Nesson is a very strong leader in this endeavor. The story is great with how it deals with heroism and humanity. The scene in which Mary is raped and leaves the burning house with a look of true Scottish strength is followed by her washing the semen from her crotch in extreme panic. This is something a heroine in Braveheart would never do. In general, this is an impressive and almost perfect watch. Go and see it!
