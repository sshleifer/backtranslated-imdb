For all who hate: condemning a television series with an episode is like judging a whole book after reading the first few pages. That said, I was a big fan of BSG, I thought it was one of the best television dramas (not just science fiction) in the air. But it was time for it to end and the story to go on. I liked the epilogue "The Plan" by BSG, but it generated as many new questions as it answered, so I anxiously anticipated "Caprica" ​​and I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> I was hoping that I did not try to know another BSG, and I was pleased that "Caprica" ​​was something different, and personally the story seemed exciting to me, in a different way than the flaming spatial battles, explosions and effects Sci-fi specials (do not get me wrong, I like those things too). Eric Stolz and Esai Morales give solid performances, and Alessandra was simply wonderful. I can not wait until next week.
