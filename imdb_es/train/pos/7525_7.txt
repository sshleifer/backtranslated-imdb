Bettie Page was an icon of the repression of the 1950s, when it represented sexual freedom that was still a decade away, but with many hopes and dreams of many adolescents and young adults. Gretchen Mol does an excellent job portraying the scandalous Bettie, who was a village girl with acting ambitions and a great body. Her career as an actress did not go anywhere, but her body took her to the top of fame in a certainly limited field. When it leaves the world of exploitation in New York, this film made for television (HBO) has good production values ​​and a very credible support cast. The problem is that it is emotionally quite flat. It is difficult to form a bond with the character, since Bettie is presented as a rather superficial and naive person, given the business she was in. The selfish investigations of the government receive a lot of screen time, which slows down the movie towards the end. But it's definitely worth looking at the history of the time, and seeing the heavy-handed government repression that was a feature of the fifties. 7/10
