Sure, it's a special 50's drive-in, but do not let that fool you. In my little book, there are a series of intelligent touches with unexpected surprises of humor. Catch the reckless Mrs. Porter, who is supposed to watch the doctor's place. She not only steals the scene, but approaches the entire film. And where did those indie producers get the dollars to shoot in color, a wise decision, since the blob would not look good in b & w. Yes, the result is irregular around the edges, as illustrated by the number of nonsense. But with the exception of several of the teens, the non-Hollywood cast performs well. Then, too, the game between the hot-rodders and the police appears animated and entertaining. Pretty good for a couple of directors more at home in a pulpit than in a sound stage. Apparently, they wanted to represent teenagers in a positive light at a time when the screen was full of "juvenile delinquents". On the other hand, McQueen, 27 years old, barely qualifies in the old department, but handles the hot-rodder attitude anyway. The film was a success at that time, helped along, no doubt, by the catchy melody of the title that had a lot of radio. And, except for the unfortunate final effects, the movie is still very funny, drive-in or not drive-in. Meanwhile, I'm waiting for the blob to return now that the polar ice cap is becoming, say, water cooler.
