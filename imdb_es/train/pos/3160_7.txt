This show has all the typical characters of a comedy: the good boy, the idiot, the pervert, the rich girl ... but it is set in the 70s. That is the only difference it has with other television comedies. I do not know how you can like this show. His humor is pathetic! I mean, the jokes are so direct ... A typical dialogue is this: "Fez: Oh, Jackie, I want to have sex with you (laughs from the audience) Jackie: Fez you're a pervert (audience laughter) Fez: Oh, yes, I am (the audience applauds and applauds) "This is not funny. I think if I did not have those laughs (I do not know what you call it in English, I'm sorry) you would not laugh at all. This is not smart comedy, this is an insult to the public. I like most American comedies, but this is not good at all. I would give it 4 out of 10. (Sorry for my poor English again).
