Do not let my constructive criticism stop you from buying and seeing this Romy Schneider classic. This film was filmed on a lower budget, probably against the will of Ernest Marishka, so he had to win. For example, England is presented as bordering Germany. The will of Victoria and her mother are on vacation in Germany. in buggy alone. They arrived too fast. Probably could not be avoided, but the castle they rented, for the film, was Austrian. When they tell her she is queen, she goes to the royal room where the members of the court bow before her, where are the British citizens who are outside the castle cheering for their new queen? Why does not she show herself on the balcony to greet her subjects? Low budget! Where is the audience aware of these imperfections? I wonder how the critics felt. Snuggling the scene of the inn, she knows Prince Albert, but I'm not excited. During the meeting on the food side of the inn, you can listen to music from the famous old songs of the American Civil War, such as "My old Kentucky home" and "Old black Joe". What? Songs of the civil war in the 1830s? Are you representing Romy Schneider as Scarlet? Where is Mammy? Is Magna Shnieder playing with her, too? Is it Adrian Hoven Rhett or Ashley? What did Marishka think? Well, this adds to the camp. Without wanting to, he is satirizing the story of Queen Victoria. This is the only reason why you should pick it up or see it 03 11 09 correction Germany and England are connected
