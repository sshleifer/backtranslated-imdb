"The Last Big Thing" is a wonderful satirical film that sardonically lashes pop culture to the point of humorous self-destruction. The characters are very interesting and fun to laugh / sympathize with. Which brings me to an introduction to the characters that I liked the most ... <br /> <br /> Simon Geist is a man in the late 30s and early 40s who creates an editorial magazine directed by the culture pop called "The Next Big Thing". The thing is that this magazine does not really exist, and is just an excuse for Simon to approach the actors when interviewing them, only to mock them, insulting their way of buying in pop culture. Her friend Darla, who lives in the house, is also writing a magazine (which is real), which mainly has to do with her and Simon, as well as with her and her father. Darla is a genuinely adorable (or detestable) character, depending on how you view her silenced neurotic behavior. Magda is a prostitute, the character that I liked the most. Brent is a flat character with little for him, as is Tedra, the queen of the music video for a group of rock bands with a B rating. Still, these characters weave a very interesting web together. And this film questions all the motivations that people have for what they do and why they do it. It's a wonderful movie and I suggest you see it if you're in the indie / art house crowd. Mark my words! <br /> <br />
