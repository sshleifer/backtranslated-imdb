Nice film about three animated sisters from Switzerland (who are often seen running around in costumes) who want to reunite their parents (it seems that Mommy is still carrying the torch for Dad) - so they go to New York to prevent the father marry. a golden seeker blonde whom she calls "Preciosa". Dad has not seen his daughters in ten years, they (oddly enough) do not seem to care and think it's wonderful, and meanwhile, Precious seems to lead a life led mainly by her dominant mother (Alice Brady), a woman who just wants to see her daughter marry a rich man. The sisters have the idea of ​​pushing Precious down the path of a drunken Hungarian count, fooling the two women diggers of gold into thinking he is one of the richest men in Europe. But a case of mistaken identity makes the girls think that the count is the handsome Ray Milland, who agrees with the plan because he is in love with his sister Kay. <br /> <br /> This movie is nice, light. . Barbara Lee when Kay looks so sweet and pretty, Ray Milland looks very young and handsome here (although, unfortunately, he is given little to do), Alice Brady is quite good as the intriguing mother, but it is Deanna Durbin, a true Charming and cute as a button that plays the younger sister, Penny, who practically steals the show. With absolutely beautiful voices, she sings several songs throughout the film, although in fact I would have liked to have seen them highlighting her even more in this. The plot in this movie is a bit silly, but nevertheless, I found that the movie is entertaining and fun.
