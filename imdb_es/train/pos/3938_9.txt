Henry Fonda brilliantly captures what we have always believed was Abraham Lincoln. He is a fool. Through the performance of Fonda, they lead us to believe (on the surface) that Abraham Lincoln was a blip in the country. But, through his confrontation with the lynch mob and especially during the judicial proceedings, you can see that beneath the exterior positions there is a brilliant man who has a very good command of what is happening around him and how to influence people that surround him. <br /> <br /> In this film, Henry Fonda shows that he has a very good understanding of how to present humor. It is an aspect of him that has been lost over the years. When he is telling stories and jokes, he has the perfect moment. There is a sequence in the trial that made me laugh a lot. He shows this gift again in The Lady Eve in 1940. <br /> <br /> The end of John Ford is absolutely brilliant with Henry Fonda going to the top of a hill and in the distance a tremendous symbolic storm of the Civil War . . He is going forward in history. The film is fiction, but Lincoln's vision is tremendous. Definitely worth seeing again.
