Once again, it seems totally illogical to me, at least for me, that "Arthur" deserves a mere 6.4 out of 10 possible. The masterpiece of Steve Gordon in this document is the "improbable" fusion, if not "impossible", of totally different elements. That he managed to make alcoholism laughable instead of heartbreaking, is in itself wonderful. That I have given Dudley Moore his best role, and all the other cinematographic elements here, his optimal impact, including the score, seems obvious and obvious to me. I challenge ANYONE who feels in this movie and does not laugh out loud. But, apparently, almost a third of its audience has achieved it. Well, I, on my part, found and found Gordon's effort both laughable and adorable, and the wonders of the absolute gems of Geraldine Fitzgerald's godparents and Stephen Elliott's murderous aunts. Even the black driver managed to escape condescension, and the late Sir John Gielgud was right in accepting his fees, but he was wrong to assume his role. "Arthur" makes no effort to "Understand", much less rationalize, the scourge of "alcoholism" (hey, iFit is not drunk, are other drugs of choice, including methamphetamine, and addictions are simply symptoms, not targets ), He simply observes in his own mocking manner.
