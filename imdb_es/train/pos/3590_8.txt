I just watched this movie the other day when I rented it, and I thought it was going to be just another movie with a girl trying to prove something, but Diane joined boxing because she wanted to. I thought that this movie was good. I gave him an 8/10. That's how good it is. Also, a movie with Michelle Rodriguez is always good. Even is that she has been in only six.
