Partially from the perceived need, one feels, to include a conventional love story in the plot to make the film more commercial for an audience of the 1950s. <br /> <br /> The film begins with some perversely funny characterizations of upper-class bureaucrats who run the Foreign Ministry: the British are ridiculed in the way that only the British can. But after that, the movie loses its way in a conventional farcical plot. Terry-Thomas can be seen as always, but the great talent of the cast (Peter Sellers, et al) is largely wasted. <br /> <br /> It's a fun movie, but not great.
