This is a great movie. <br /> <br /> I agreed to watch a movie for girls and somehow I ended up with this. I had never heard of that or anyone (excpet Mike from Friends). <br /> <br /> But it's great! Eva, Lake and Paul give incredible performances. Humor is always dry and witty. <br /> <br /> Paul Rudd plays the mike character of Friends (which works very well). The other characters are stereotypes and the plot is a formula (I mean we're not talking about 'Apocalypse now'), but the characters are nice, the story is attractive, the soundtrack, production and direction work well. <br /> <br /> In general, a great movie to feel good that really deserves much more credit than you get. <br /> <br /> Everyone has their own tastes, but I really do not understand the reviews of a star for this.
