First a quick 'shut up!' To those who say that this movie sucks. You can not go to all the movies that wait for 'Citizen Kane'. This was actually a funny movie. Jason Lee is good at everything he does. The only flaw in this movie is that I do not think there's enough chemistry between Lee and Julia Stiles. They should have insisted more on that. Apart from that, the movie is very funny. Selma Blair needs to eat something. She is worrying me. But she still looks beautiful. So yes, I recommend this movie for a light date or a Saturday afternoon. Go see. <br /> <br /> RATING: ** 1/2 of ****
