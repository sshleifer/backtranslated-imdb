Things to Come is in fact a classic work of speculative fiction; an essay on the destructive nature of war and the terrors of progress. He makes some surprising and accurate descriptions of the war he would follow a few years later, but he is very naive in his utopian ideals. <br /> <br /> Raymond Massey, Cedric Hardwicke and Ralph Richardson make an excellent cast, Although the drama is played more like a play, than a film work. There are great speeches, although somewhat forced, often uttered as if the actor were trying to get to the back of the theater. However, there are some deep words there. Is technology the savior of humanity, or the instrument of its destruction? The film is a visual feast, if one can detach from the age of effects. Sure, Hollywood is more sophisticated today, but rarely is it so creative. For the imaginative, the third act is a delight: a world with underground cities, massive decompression bombers, space cannons, rotating helicopters and secret organizations of saving scientists. It has all the characteristics of a science fiction adventure, but instead uses the adornments for a philosophical exercise. <br /> <br /> Things to Come and Metropolis were the hallmarks of Hollywood's science fiction Neolithic cinema. They are operatic in scope and visually inspiring. Technology has long since left them behind, but their ideas still explode. There is an art there, one with more heart and emotion than the mass-produced cinema generated by today's computer. These films are products of artisans, not industrialists.
