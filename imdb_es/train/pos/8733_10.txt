When I bought my Toy Story tape when it came to Video after being released in theaters, I saw a trailer that said this about the creators of Toy Story. As soon as I saw that I knew it was going to be a good feature! I was right! The life of an insect like Toy Story is a great story, great characters and a great animation. My favorite characters are Dim the Beetle of rhinoceros with the voice of Brad Garrett and Hemlich, the caterpillar with the voice of the late Pixar Storyman Joe Ranft. My favorite scene is when Slim the cane (David Hyde Pierce) lifts Hemlich trying to distract Bird and Hemlich as You hoo Mr. Early Bird. How about a good-tasting worm on a stick and Slim is like he's going to jump? I will break! I just died laughing at that scene. Being a big fan of insects, I think A Bug's Life is my favorite Pixar, although I know that many people consider it the worst Pixar movie. I do not know how you could hate a Pixar movie! I think they are all pretty good movies! Good job PIXAR!
