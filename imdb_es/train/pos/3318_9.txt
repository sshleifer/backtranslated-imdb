A very nice movie with a great background provided by the city of Boston and Fenway Park. As a baseball fan and addicted to light films, I hit a home run. Lots of laughs and lots of authentic baseball scenes with real ball players and real references to past Bosox failures. And how pleasant was it to see a movie with a baseball theme without having to put up with Kevin Costner, who is self-sufficient and excessive, trying to get believers out of a critical audience? Jimmy and Drew did a good job as a young couple in love with the "Jones" of Jimmy's Bosox. It was a bit crazy and out of left field, but there are really Sox fans who are such fanatics and live their lives through the fortunes of their beloved team. The film advanced at a rapid pace and the ending, although predictable, had the charm and sentimentality of many other popular films, without being too pretentious. <br /> <br /> It was also nice the return of Willie Garson to the screen. I miss the popular "Stanford Blatch" by Sex & the City. It's always funny, even when it says or does not say much. <br /> <br /> So buy yourself two box seats, some popcorn and get ready for a fun time. "Fever Pitch" is a winner.
