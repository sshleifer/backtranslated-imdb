I love this movie and I would really like to have it someday. It's just a fascinating legend about an eagle wearing a turquoise necklace, I loved it and would like to see it again! I do not remember much about it, but a Native American boy lives in a nice town with his family, and I do not remember what happened, but he's supposed to go to the desert alone. His sister packs him some food and he leaves. While he is out, other Indian boys run out and put some feathers on him, and he becomes an eagle. The legend says that if you ever see an eagle with a turquoise necklace, it is the child. I was always fascinated by legends, particularly the legends of Native Americans, and I would love to see it published some day on a DVD.
