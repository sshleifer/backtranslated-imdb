When I first heard about this series on AnimeTV, I must say that of all the programs I've seen, this is the best. I had to watch this show, and that's what I really did. When I got the first volume of this show, it was the best. I really liked the animation, and all the fight scenes were awesome. I have to say that my favorite characters in the series were Saber and Archer, and of course I also like Illya. And, of course, all the episodes in the volumes were interesting and very interesting. Another thing I have to say about the series is Michael McConnohie (famous for Transformers, and others) playing the voice of Berserker. He has a great character. And I even saw the whole series again before I saw the final volume. So, if you see something good, then you see this show, it's the best.
