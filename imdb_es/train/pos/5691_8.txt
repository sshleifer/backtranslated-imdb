I was very interested to see this movie when it first appeared in theaters, however, I could not do it. So, finally, it hit the shelves, and I picked it up. Without knowing exactly what to expect, I placed the DVD in the player, installed myself on a night of murder and pressed Play. What followed was one of the most attractive films I've seen in the last two years. <br /> <br /> * SOME SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> This is the story of the killings in Wonderland, which led to the most sensual parts of Los Angeles and the beginning of porn more great of the 70s, John Holmes (Val Kilmer). <br /> <br /> I was hooked from the beginning, and the feeling of the movie captivated me. Until the end very bloody. I was surprised to discover that the film focused less on actual murders and more on previous events and subsequent investigation. Apart from a few walls sprinkled with blood at the beginning, and the actual showing of the murders towards the end, the film was more or less an attractive demonstration of great dialogues and great performances. Val Kilmer almost sold me as a porn star of junkies, and even the "beautiful but that's all". Bosworth was a pleasure to see him (and only for his appearance, of course) <br /> <br /> Personally I felt the best The appearance of the film was, as I mentioned, his failure to openly show the murders. It was shown in a very dark atmosphere, so you could not see completely the brutal beating that was granted to the four who slept. In addition, the sound effects of these murders were more than enough to whet my appetite. They were hitting with lead pipes, there's not much more to say. <br /> <br /> My only real problem was the short appearance of Carrie Fisher. His representation of the overly religious figure was, I think, a bit too clich√© of his appearance. Maybe that person was really part of the story, maybe not, but they did not sell me, and for some reason, Fisher seemed a little "uncomfortable" in his interpretation. <br /> <br /> In general, an excellent movie It's worth seeing, even once! <br /> <br /> *** 8/10 ***
