['Well done, and together with &quot;New Travels&quot;, it&#39;s a great continuation! Fabulous to see James Cawley in the last episode &quot;Vigil&quot; Check it out! <br /><br /> I like the growing characterization, and I think we have good replacements for the TV actors in a piece produced by fans. This program manages to capture the feeling quite well, since it is said to have improved, over the years it has improved with experience and I hope that with more experience, a solid script editor and a rebound in time and CGI that HF will become more remarkable than it really is! <br /><br /> Good job for all interested! <br /><br /> (I have a great weakness for Lefler and McFarland (GREAT performance), although I&#39;m a little tired of the &quot;laws of Lefler.&quot; That&#39;s it! Shelby is great (albeit a bit tense) and it&#39;s great that he&#39;s done with the boat Nice (like Fred Flintstone), but he lacks the rough edge of a commanding officer and seems too pleased with himself Doc, the Counselor and Rawlins are right in my eyes, just like the WONDERFUL Nechayev (what a beautiful accent! A real Russian! (Well, I guess Rene is from the Czech Republic.) <br /><br /> You get my vote, and the CGI is very good. Some of the greenscreen are obvious, but on a small budget, what the hell is it? <br /><br /> I&#39;m really glad I found it! <br /><br /> (Okay, some of the performances are not good, but they are made by fans and, therefore, they are allowed to be variable, sorry Cmm. Cole) <br /><br /> The gay material is placed too thick (Graham Norton would be ashamed). Trek does not pay much attention to heterosexual couples, so why target homosexuals with all the caresses? It is not necessary to show someone&#39;s sexuality up to this point. I hope you soften it and let Aster and Zen be people, not tokens. I do not treat my gay friends differently, they&#39;re just normal guys. <br /><br /> Musically it is a mixed bag. I can say that all Trek OST material is in stock and it works most of the time, but time may fail now and then (the end of &quot;Worst Fears Part 2&quot; is lost and the issue.) I love the fact that use the &quot;Galaxy Music Search! <br /><br /> I certainly can not wait any longer! Dazza <br /><br /> &quot;Never give up, never surender!&quot; <br /><br /> Live them frontieres']
