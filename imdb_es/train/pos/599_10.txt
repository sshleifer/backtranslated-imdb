I really enjoyed this movie because there was genuine sincerity in the acting. The writing was first class. James Arness is a great actor and he showed it here. Brian Keith was too old to be Davy Crockett, and can anyone really play Davy but Fess Parker? <br /> <br /> Another great actor in this movement was Raul Julia, who gave depth to Santa Anna, a vain and complex person. who led Mexico through turbulent times. <br /> <br /> While some may think the film was slow, it captured the battle as it developed, a lot of tedium followed by a couple of hours of horrible terror. <br /> <br /> What impressed me the most about this movie is that it made you think of a cause and how some people are willing to die for what they believe. At this time, when nobody represents anything, it seemed refreshing to think that there was a time when people died for freedom, no matter how you feel about the politics of the time.
