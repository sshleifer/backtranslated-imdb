It was a doubly interesting experience. For some reason, the greatest scientific mind of the twentieth century had never been the central figure in a film *. The closest I can think of the movies with Einstein in them is CHAMPAIGN FOR CAESAR, where (as a "deus ex ma-china") the great man who clarifies a point on a radio show is heard, to be shown that Ronald Colman has given the correct answer after all, and in BULLSHOT, where the great Albert is one of a dozen prominent physicists and scientists who are drugged with cannabis by the villain, with the intention of stealing some of their machines. It is remarkable that in these two cases, and in IQ, we are dealing with comedies. So far no one has tried to make a serious film about Einstein's life, such as John Huston's attempt to do a FREUD with Montgomery Cliff. I suppose it is too difficult to make the world of mathematical equations or the secrets of electromagnetic field theory into interesting dialogues. But then, just three years ago, Russell Crowe and Christopher Plummer made A BEAUTIFUL MIND. Maybe nobody has really tried it. <br /> <br /> (* Later, after writing this, I remembered the hit comedy YOUNG EINSTEIN with Yahoo seriously about ten years ago, but that's an exception and it was a parody). <br /> <br /> The other surprise was the actor who plays the great Albert. It was Walter Matthau, who took time out of the series of films he made with Jack Lemmon in the last decade of his careers. Matthau was an actor of great talent and talent, both in comedy and in drama, but normally his comedic characters were variants of his "Whiplash Willie" Gingrich of THE FORTUNE COOKIE. They were connivers and gonifs. Later, they would put aside their criminal tendencies because we had come to like them, but they were still grumpy. But his Albert Einstein turns out to be genuinely sweet. More like his Kotch than Willie Clarke. <br /> <br /> He plays Albert like good uncle Albert. It seems that Matthau's Einstein lives in Princeton with his niece Catherine Boyd (Meg Ryan), and she is seeing a misnamed teacher James Morland (Stephen Fry). But Fry's car needs repairs, and they take it to the auto shop where Ed Walters (Tim Robbins) works. Robbins falls in love with Ryan, who is attracted to him, but discovers that he lacks the mental equipment that she admires. The old Uncle Albert, helped by his three friends (Lou Jacobi, Joseph Maher and Gene Saks) decide to give his help to Robbins and turn him into an apparently unrecognized physics genius. This will open the doors of romance between him and Ryan, as long as Ryan is impressed and Fry does not spoil things (as he expects to do). <br /> <br /> The atmosphere is sweet, like when Matthau and his companions crowd. a super physics questionnaire in which they help Robbins cheat (by changing the positions of their bodies). The plot eventually leads to the brazen lie that the brilliant Robbins has built an atomic propulsion rocket, which attracts the interests of the nation in the figure of President Eisenhower (Keene Curtis). <br /> <br /> It was a lovely Comedy, and an interesting stretch for Matthau in the sense that he was not as hyperactive as usual, but much more tenuous.
