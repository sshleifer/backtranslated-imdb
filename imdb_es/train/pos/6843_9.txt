Screenwriter and director Brian De Palma is best known for his series of films that have been called, somewhat unfairly, "Hitchcock imitations". Contrary to popular belief, De Palma does not cheat Hitchcock; borrows elements of stories or characters that may have been seen in a Hitchcock movie and then expands them in a more violent and modern way. Like Hitchcock, De Palma is known for mixing death bathed in blood with a macabre humor. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Dressed to Kill", dating back to 1980, is, perhaps , De Palma's most well-known Hitchcock film, and it's probably his best too. The story involves a serial killer who is stalking both a burned housewife (played by Angie Dickinson) and a street prostitute (played by Nancy Allen). <br /> <br /> Yes, it will clearly remind you of "Psycho", but De Palma's film is as ingenious as it is technically creative. The sequence of the museum is particularly well punctuated and edited; The stabbing scene in the elevator is also one of the most unique murders ever filmed. "Dressed to Kill" may not be a complete original, but I would say it's definitely worth it. Classification R. 105 minutes. 9 out of 10.
