Although I like the books of EE "Doc" Smith and the books of David A. Kyles of Lensman, the anime, which is loosely based on books, is a fun and innovative fair. <br /> <br /> Although the story may seem familiar to fans of science fiction and fantasy, such as the fact that a child on an isolated planet inherits mystical powers and comes the death of his family. However, it is quite entertaining. In addition, Lensman was the first animated film to use drawings drawn by hand and CG at the same time. Sure, it may seem a little outdated now, but it's still an innovation. If it were not for Lensman, none of that would have happened (personally, I think Computer Graphics looks better in animation than in action). <br /> <br /> Too bad they've only released it on DVD / VCD in a few countries in the world (mainly in formats that are quite foreign and different). I only wish that they release the film and TV series Lensman on DVD / VCD in EVERY part of the world, not only in certain parts. <br /> <br /> P.S. Worsel rules! I just think he is so amazing and neat too.
