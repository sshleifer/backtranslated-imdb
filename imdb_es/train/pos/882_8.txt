['I took it for a whim from the library and I was pleasantly surprised. A lot of expressionist camera work, an equally tight script and two excellent actors are fused to make a very fine film. Not by the reptilian multiplex brain, but by the true movie fan. If Hollywood ever gets his hands dirty, I&#39;m sure it will ruin it. A treatment of choice in every way. Other posters here have more than widely sung their praises, so I do not have to bother to duplicate their chants; Just follow their advice, and mine, and do not miss this gem. Call it whatever you want; I call it two hours of well-spent entertainment. Read my lips: do not miss it.']
