One of the great mysteries of life, which we suffer on a daily basis, is the reason why nice girls are more interested in idiots and heels than in nice guys. <br /> <br /> Worse yet, when nice guys even want to get married Those girls, the girls STILL prefer pulls and heels, even after the jerks and heels have shown their contempt, have shown that they are just interested in using the girls. <br /> <br /> Stu Erwin is the nice guy, who is still kind after being tricked and cheated and even after losing the girl completely. <br /> <br /> Clark Gable is the imbecile, and he's perfect on paper, rather a sad note for his fans. <br /> <br /> Jean Harlow appears as a more slender Mae West, even with a sound like La West in some of her cynical disposable lines. <br /> <br /> Something disconcerting is that many of the other characters, destined to be bad, I mean, devils, are locked up, so they must be, they are obviously nice people. <br /> <br /> In fact, there are a lot of nice people here, people who, in a minor movie or story, would be a grunt and a stab, but here they go out of their way to help someone else. <br /> <br /> So, maybe the story is more of a clich√©, at least for modern standards, but in the end the viewer will be happy to have seen it. <br /> <br /> The biggest complaint I have is that many really good actors are not given credit. Once again, we can say a fervent "Thank you" to IMDb.com.
