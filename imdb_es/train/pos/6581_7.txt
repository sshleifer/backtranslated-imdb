Looking for Quo Vadis in my local video store, I found this 1985 version that looked interesting. Woohoo! It was incredible! Very similar to Ken Russell's film type: demanding, stylized, very artistic and, of course, "different". Nero presented himself not so much as evil incarnate, but as an unsatisfied and dissatisfied emperor who would rather have had a career in the circus. He probably wondered why the hell he was put in the position of "leading" an empire; It was not very fun, and fun was what he wanted. Klause Maria Bandaur had a tremendous time with this role and played it for all it was worth. Yes, Nero persecuted the Christians with vengeance; One of the many who did it At one point, one of his henchmen mutters: "No one will understand that we were simply protecting ourselves." He has that right.
