Walter Pidgeon is Braley Mason, a civil lawyer who handles a criminal case in "The Unknown Man," a 1951 film that also stars Ann Harding, Barry Sullivan, Keefe Braselle and Richard Anderson. Pidgeon, a great believer in justice, accepts a pro bono case defending a young man, Rudi Walchek (Braselle) accused of murder and acquitted him. Shortly thereafter, he realizes that the man is guilty and was extorting protection money from his victim and from other neighborhood merchants. The district attorney (Sullivan) advises that Rudi is a small change, that to end organized crime, one has to find the best man. Mason finds the main man, and faces a dilemma. <br /> <br /> "The Unknown Man" is a small black and white film that manages to maintain the interest of the viewer with its different twists of the plot, although the plot is something artificial It is really the story of a good man who seeks his god, justice, and what he is willing to do to achieve it. And that is the most artificial part of all. I guess there was a time before O.J., the Men√©ndez brothers, etc., etc., when people believed in the justice and integrity of the lawyers. Anyway, for this viewer, those days have already passed. <br /> <br /> Walter Pidgeon does an excellent job: his elegant and elegant attitude and his declamatory voice show us a successful and confident man, but also a very affectionate one. Pidgeon had a magnificent career that spanned 60 years, but never really reached stardom. He was a solid actor who could play almost anything and he did. It may be because at the time he received clues, he was already in his mid-thirties and missed being a matinee idol; or it could be that something was missing; or that was typified from the beginning as a second advantage for a great female star like Greer Garson. Hard to say. Give an honest and moving performance here. <br /> <br /> Very good movie with good performances.
