A jewel of comedy. A lot of laughter in noisy moments, the shop and the pub scenes made me laugh uncontrollably. The characters are recognizable and the dialogue well observed. I know people like that! The humor is surprisingly smooth and the movie (this may sound strange) reminds me of an Ealing comedy. It is a peculiar little movie with many details. Without a doubt, it takes a series of visits. I've seen it a few times (I've been showing all of my friends!) And I've noticed something new every time, a bit of dialogue, something visual that I had not caught before. It could be really delicate and find some deficiencies in the film, but I will not because, in general, it is a very fun and well-being movie that is really worth seeing and that anyone with a sense of humor should enjoy. It's a movie that will find friends and I hope there are many of them out there. Oh ... and it has a great soundtrack.
