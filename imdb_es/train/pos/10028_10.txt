When I saw this movie I was surprised by the great movie that was. This is the only movie that I think would give it a rating of 10 stars. I'm sure this movie will always be in my top 5. <br /> <br /> The acting is excellent. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslett are at their best. I do not think anyone can have a better job than Kate. <br /> <br /> If it's a rainy day and you can not decide what to rent, well, this is the option. You will love all the performances, the special effects and much more. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this movie, fix it or buy it now! You will not regret. <br /> <br />
