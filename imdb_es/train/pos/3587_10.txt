I really like this movie ... when I started watching it, I thought I'd get bored pretty soon, but I was surprised ... I thought it was a great movie and I've seen it several times. The characters are believable and I have to say that I fell in love with Brian Austin Green again (the first time was Beverly Hills 90210). I would recommend this movie if you are a fan of yours, but I agree with another comment made earlier, that the ending is somewhat disappointing. I would have loved it to be a little different! It does not matter, good story exciting.
