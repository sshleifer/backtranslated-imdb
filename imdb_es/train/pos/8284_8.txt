This is one of those unique horror movies that require a much more mature understanding of the word "horror" to be appreciated. It is possible that people do not realize that this story is told through a small child and, as with most younger children, is easily frightened. Mainly because he just does not understand things, like why his father is almost never there for him. By watching the movie, you can see the husband discussing with his wife the balance between work time and family time and you can easily understand it, but the child does not. You can also imagine that the child is afraid of the forests, as it was established at the beginning of the film, that the family is from the city. Also, at the beginning, when the family travels to the house, they beat a deer, then they stop, then they argue with the locals about it, and the child probably did not find anything nice in this introduction to the forest. <br /> <br /> The "Wendigo" is ultimately what your young and innocent mind manufactures to explain all this. There is the legend of the American Indians, but when you look at the scene where the young man finds out about it, he is explained frankly and simplistically. Not because that's what the Wendigo really is, but because that's how he understands it. When you look at the film from this point of view, you can really begin to appreciate it. Obviously, it was low budget and low cost, but the jump mounts, the use of light and the general restlessness compensate. And the final question the movie asks is: is everything in your head, or is it really out there? 8/10 <br /> <br /> R: profanity, violence and a sex scene
