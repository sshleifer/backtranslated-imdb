I saw this movie in theaters when I was about 6 or 7 years old. I loved it then, and recently I have purchased a VHS version. <br /> <br /> My 4 and 6 year old children love this movie and have been asking me again and again to see it. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed watching it again too. Although I have to admit that it is not so good on a small TV. <br /> <br /> I do not have older children, so I do not know what they would think of that. <br /> <br /> The songs are very nice. My daughter keeps singing them over and over again. <br /> <br /> I hope this helps.
