Simply well written, directed and acted ... the best of Woody in the 2000s, if not the best since the 80s! Hugh Jackman was the perfect choice for his roll. Scarlett Johansson's joke with Woody shows how well she has become an actress. <br /> <br /> It's refreshing not to be in a romance on the screen with the protagonist. He plays the perfect awkward magician. <br /> <br /> There have been some comments that slander this movie. Do not let them prevent you from watching the beautifully made movie. The people in the crowd with whom I saw this laughed so hard in some lines that I lost the next line. If you like the Woody Allen movies of the 70s, you will regret having lost this one. <br /> <br /> I suggest you go see this movie with an open mind; if you do, you can go out smiling.
