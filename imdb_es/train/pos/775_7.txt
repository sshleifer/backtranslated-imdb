It's a strange, but somehow impressive, story about love. Personally, I never find a story so twisted in real life. But, I can see what there is. <br /> <br /> It's a story that promises to be "sick" for the title. But, after seeing it, I did not have this feeling of "illness" that I would surely have with respect to the rules of society. It's something beautiful in this movie ... something impressive ... that I can not contradict using any moral or society rule. <br /> <br /> The film focuses mainly on the relationship between Kiki and Alex. You can see how this relationship begins, evolves and finally ends. You feel the moment when this love blooms, the first whispers, the touches. You feel the connection. And at no time did I think that this is immoral. You even hope it does not break in the end ... it can not break ... it's not right. In the end, you feel the pain of having a broken heart ... <br /> <br /> But I also need to add a negative twist to this comment ... I do not know if the story is not somehow * Showed * to give the feeling that these relationships are sick only in form, but not in content. You do not have the total story, only fragments. When the film began, the relationship between Kiki and Sandu was already established. So, there is no idea of ​​the nature of the relationship. You only feel a tension between them ... a struggle between the need for love and the desire to break this relationship. I think that this line from Kiki to Sandu says everything: "I want to stop ... and if you love me, you will do what I ask". <br /> <br /> This movie will probably provoke some questions about what love is and what it is to be moral ... and where is the boundary between them. I do not know if the idea of ​​this film is "love conquers everything ... even social and moral standards" or "love is beautiful ... no matter how or where". But in my opinion, this movie is already a success for the simple reason that it makes you think ...
