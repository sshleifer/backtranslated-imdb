['In your video store, you can find this gem. <br /><br /> The human condition in modern times LA. There is no exaggerated drama, just a collapse of events that can happen to any group of individuals over time. <br /><br /> It helps you understand the joys and despair of urban life. <br /><br /> The address and the cut are first class. Cinematography and music are very much in the mood and the situation. And the CAST! <br /><br /> Excellent casting and excellent performance. Nobody out of place or out of place. <br /><br /> And it is NOT really as disappointing as one would expect. I gave him 7 out of 10. <br /><br /> If you have not seen it, do it!']
