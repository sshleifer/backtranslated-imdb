I thought that this movie was hysterical. I've seen it many times and I highly recommend it. Mel Brooks, it was excellent. The cast was fantastic ... I do not understand how this movie gets a rating of 2 out of 5. I loved it. I have seen other movies of his and they were also fun, but this one really comes to my mind because of the humor. I can not say enough about this movie. I'm looking for it to be on periodically but never enough for me. The people who interpreted homeless people were, by comparison, up to the funniest standards as well. Please, put this movie more often. I can not see enough ... Leslie Ann Warren was also another of my favorites, since Cinderella. I always thought that she was not really funny but I loved her acting. In this movie she was very funny ... and she and Mel did a great job together. They should put more of their movies on television.
