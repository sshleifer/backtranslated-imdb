First of all, this is just the funniest movie I've ever seen. It incorporates the perfectly synchronized slapstick, the sexual humor and the stand-up ingeniously thought out. But it goes beyond that. The Souler Opposite is an original love story (something we do not see so often) that gave me hope that there is love out there, that two people who love each other can overcome their adversity; and that such a comic take on life (something I think we should all have) can be accepted by the people who really matter. Chris Meloni offers a performance as compelling as Barry Singer who should have won an Oscar. The film is written brilliantly and I hope we will see more films from everyone involved in the future.
