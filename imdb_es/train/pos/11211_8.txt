['I enjoyed the innocence of this film and how the characters had to deal with the reality of having a powerful animal in their midst. The gorilla looks just great, and the eyes were especially real. Sometimes it&#39;s even a little scary and I should have slightly frightened children without overdoing it. Ren√© Russo plays his wonderfully feminine role. In general, this type of Hollywood films that take place in the past feel the need to create a villain of the straw man, but the only adversary is the gorilla. It&#39;s an interesting look at how close some animals are to humans, how they feel the same emotions that we do, and how we can not treat them like people because they are not. There are not many films that venture into this territory and it is worth seeing them if you want to contemplate the human-animal similarity.']
