I rarely see a movie with which I am totally absorbed; This was one of them. He had good acting, dialogue, plot, and the landscape was beautiful. I laughed out loud many times, especially at the scene of the raid in the kitchen. The slapstick comedy performed by the lunkhead hired by the hand had me on the floor, but I admit that I am an imbecile for slapstick. The story is about a group of 30-year-olds who return to a summer camp they had attended 20 years before. It was a week of farewell to the camp, since the place would be permanently closed at the end of the season. As adults, the camp looked different, and they felt differently about it and each other. I recommend this funny and moving movie for everyone. <br /> <br />
