Diane Keaton gave an outstanding performance in this rather sad but fun story that involved many young people and their deep and dark secrets. Diane Keaton, (Natalie), "The Family Stone", '05, who had an only daughter and loved her beyond what words can describe. She always called her and said: "Surrender Dorothy", which was an expression used in the 'Wizard of Oz', 1939. A sudden car accident occurred and Natalie became deeply involved with the friends and lovers of her daughter. While Natalie investigates, the more truths she discovers about herself and her real relationship with her daughter. Great movie to see and enjoy, especially the good acting of all support actors.
