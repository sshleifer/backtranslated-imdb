A short comedy by LAUREL & HARDY. The boys come to sweep the chimneys at the home of Professor Noodle, a mad scientist who has just perfected his rejuvenation serum. Stan and Ollie proceed with their DIRTY WORK, spreading the destruction inside the house and on the roof. Then the teacher wants to try his new potion ... <br /> <br /> A very funny little movie. The ending is a little abrupt, but much of the slap that leads to it is excellent. Especially good is the testament contest of Stan and Ollie at the opposite ends of the chimney. That is Lucien Littlefield as the teacher.
