Do you think you've had a hard time? You should check this movie. Carl Brashear is the epitome of courage and determination. What this man had to go through to become a marine diver, should be an inspiration to all of us. And significantly, after watching this movie, I learned that what is shown is not even half. Cuba Gooding, Jr. makes some of his best works to date as Brashear. De Niro, as usual, is good as the southern redneck who trains him. George Tillman in just his second feature film (after "Soul Food"), has made a great leap as a filmmaker. If you want to be moved and inspired, you definitely need to review this.
