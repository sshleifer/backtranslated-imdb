['As with that movie, we follow the unlikely adventures of the 2 main characters. But while C + J avoids sex for a female journey back to childhood, this couple delights in their carnality to the point of exploring homoeroticism. Most of the sex they acquire from spiteful or reluctant partners and yet, despite their deeply non-PC behavior, everyone emerges smiling. As C + G, in spite of everything, they are still innocent of heart, they rebel against the city, the bourgeoisie, the restrictive one. As someone else has commented, I would not want to know these 2 and it is a small miracle that your trip brings mostly comedy scenes and very little tragedy (and what there is of that can not be left at your door) and therefore That left me deceived but with a sweet taste in the mouth. I dare say that only the French can get away with movies like this. And that is part of his genius.']
