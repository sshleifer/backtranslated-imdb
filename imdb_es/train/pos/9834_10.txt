Yes, I'm sure it's corny, it's not Zombie, but it's not that bad either. It has the Beatrice ring, which is a great advantage, and it is entertaining. I was fortunate to meet Fulci later in his career and remained philosophical about the experience, as he was never completely satisfied with it. It's worth a search, especially for fans of the genre and Fulci. It is a film that too often dismisses hands.
