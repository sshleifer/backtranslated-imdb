['A timeless musical jewel, with Gene Kelly in top form, elegant address by Vincente Minnelli and wonderful musical numbers. It&#39;s great entertainment from start to finish, one of those movies that people look at with a smile and says &quot;do not do them like they used to!&quot; But they never did it at all. The culminating musical sequence of 25 minutes without any dialogue is among the most beautiful in the history of cinema. Magical film, clearly derived from the heart and soul of all involved. You must see it!']
