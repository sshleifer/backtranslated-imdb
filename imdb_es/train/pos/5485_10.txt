One of the most timely and fascinating documentaries I've ever seen. While the story takes place in the Venezuelan capital of Caracas, it offers an intimate view of the political dynamic that prevails throughout the Western Hemisphere. While essentially another chapter in the history of the "US-backed Latin American coup d'état", this film is a chronicle in real time, what can happen when the poorest people are armed with unity, political intelligence and courage! <br /> <br /> The political ideas offered by this film are invaluable. One gets clear examples from the private media, as a formidable force for deception and mass propaganda. We see the poor people of Caracas grappling with the brutal realities of "American politics." One has a clear sense of imminent death, if people do not turn to flagrant tyranny, which the conspirators have imposed on them abruptly and illegally. We also see the arrogance and fascism of the private media, plutocrats and generals backed by the CIA, who have conspired to bring Venezuela back under the domination of Washington. Although well led by President Hugo Chávez, the people of Caracas are forced to act without him, after Chavez was forcibly kidnapped by renegade generals. Your answer is the highlight of the movie. If one looks for an excellent portrait of what the United States government is all about, Hugo Chávez and revolutionary Venezuela, this movie is everything!
