If you want Scream or something like the great study terror product that imposes us today, do not worry. This well-written film kept me thinking about everything I had to say. The importance of myth in our lives to make sense, how children interpret the world (and the violence in it), our plundering of the environment and ignorance of its history and legends ... everything here, but not outright. Technically you could call it a "monster movie" even if the Wendigo does not take physical form until the end, and then it is up to you and your beliefs what is happening with the legendary spirit / beast. Some elements of standard suspense for those who seek the basics and the film never get bored, although in reality, the less you see the creature, the better. Fessenden continues George Romero's tradition of using the genre as a parable and as a discussion forum while still keeping us scared.
