I had begun to lose my faith in the recent flood films with the typical film of Genre Hollywood. The story lines fail, and the work of the camera is simply copied from the last movie of similar taste. But, then I saw Zentropa (Europe) and my faith was renewed. The metaphorical story is not only fascinating, but the use of color and black and white is visually stimulating. The narrator (Max Von Sydow) takes him through a fascinating journey every step of the way and absorbs it in Europe in 1945. We have all seen death on the screen in a hundred thousand ways, but the beauty of this movie is how it takes him through Every moment of slow movement that takes you to death. Unlike many movies, it is not cut after a second of showing (for example) a knife, but it forces you to see the devastating and sensual beauty of a man's final moments. I think we can all take something different from what this movie is trying to say, but it's definitely worth taking the time to find out what it really means. I'd love to talk more about the film to anyone who wants to send me an email. Enjoy it!
