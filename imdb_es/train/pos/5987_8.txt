Gabe Ryan (Frankie Thomas) leaves the reform school and returns to the poor neighborhoods. His sister (Ann Sheridan) does everything possible to keep him out of trouble, but seems to follow him. Aside from its associations with the termite gang, Gabe is followed by real-life gangsters who have a plan to set buildings on fire at random to collect insurance. They need someone to blame for the fire, and Gabe is. It is up to the termites to enforce the law in their favor and give the mobsters their just desserts. <br /> <br /> The scene that presents Dead End Kids is really good. The boys wander towards the furniture of the new resident on the street and make it their own. They talk to each other with false accents and talk about tea together; Bernard Punsley takes a nap in a chair. Then, the boys begin to fight with the new one, but after demonstrating that he is a good fighter, they ask him to join the club. <br /> <br /> The initiation scene is also pretty good, full of mischief that seems dangerous at first, but is really quite intelligent and innocent. <br /> <br /> Later, when Billy Halop studies to become the mayor, he has a dream about school work. This is wonderfully organized, with small holograms of children walking on their faces and asking questions. <br /> <br /> Los Angeles wash their faces is a great title because it plays with the success of Angels with dirty faces. and it really says what the children are doing. Notorious for bad behavior on and off the set, these guys behave well in this movie. But instead of looking fake, it makes great laughs. This is a preview of what many of the guys would become in the series The Bowery Boys. We even received some confusing words from Leo Gorcey.
