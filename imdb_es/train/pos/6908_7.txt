Richard Dreyfuss starred in "Moon Over Parador", a 1988 film by Paul Mazursky also starring Raul Julia, Sonia Braga, Jonathan Winters and Charo. Dreyfuss plays a New York actor, Jonathan Nolan, in the Caribbean country of Parador to make a movie. When the dictator dies suddenly, the Chief of the Secret Police (Julia), who is the one who really controls the dictator and the country, asks Jonathan to interpret the dictator, having noticed the similarity between them. Soon, Jonathan is installed in the palace as Alphonse Simms, and the prostitute girlfriend of Simms, Madonna (Braga), who realizes that the change promises to help him in everything he can. <br /> <br /> Mazursky, who appears dragging like Simms' mother, gives us a look at how the CIA operates in third world countries. The character of Winters, supposedly a salesman, is actually an agent of the CIA. The film, however, flirts with, but really does not advance on a very serious ground and is rather a farewell, and a very funny one. <br /> <br /> Richard Dreyfuss does a fabulous job as Jonathan the The actor and Alphonse the dictator, creating two separate characters and nailing them both. The gorgeous Sonia Braga is great as Madonna, and Raul Julia delivers in an incredibly funny performance as Strausmann, the man behind the dictator. It is one of those performances in which you never know very well what the character thinks: it can be nice or become a psychopath at any time. Charo is available as a maid and manages to be funny and discreet at the same time. <br /> <br /> A very good movie, not very big, but very entertaining.
