I have to admit that this movie moved me to the point of bursting into tears. However, I always think twice about things, and instead of writing a praise that would define the film as impeccable and impeccable, I prefer to take a risk to see it closely. <br /> <br /> First, the first thing: the film has an undeniable impact on the viewer simply because it starts and continues like a slow-paced movie that does not try to surprise you with the real 9/11 scenes. Thumbs up for this blow of genius, because, unlike Stone's WORLD COMMERCE CENTER, this film fortunately does not focus on the attack itself, but on the consequences that, similar to the consequences of a nuclear explosion, are barely visible , but still dangerous and devastating. The psychological impact, the devastation caused by September 11 and the havoc it caused in the American people is almost palpable in this film. I think Binder achieved a clever observation of American society after September 11 and, in my opinion, the sky skyrocketed from an average comedy actor to a real talent that offers a performance worthy of an Oscar. <br /> <br /> However: In the movie DIAMOND OF BLOOD, the character of Di Caprio says and quote: "Ah, these Americans, they always want to talk about their feelings." Now, I do not want to belittle your suffering, but I would like to make a comparison. Since September 11, the entire world is facing memories, memorials and commemorations of September 11. The Hollywood industry and writers like Safran Foer more than refer to 9/11 in their works. Now, this huge amount of cultural products, related to September 11, make the death of 3000 people the greatest tragedy of this young century. The amount of books written on the subject and the number of films directed on this subject, and I say this with due respect, makes the importance of this atrocious crime disproportionate. <br /> <br /> The fact is: People die every day because of unfair actions and horrible crimes committed by bad people or simply lost. We have a war in Iraq, in Afghanistan, in Birma and in many other countries. Daily, we forget the poverty that Africans suffer and we tend to empathize with them to a lesser degree than with the 9/11 American victims simply because they are black and because their lives do not have much in common. common with our western lives. Africa does not have the money or the potential to commemorate its national tragedies in a way that the United States can. So, what I am saying is this: the reason why we feel more for the 3000 victims of September 11 and their families is because we are constantly reminded of September 11th. Not a day goes by without a newspaper article, a movie or a book that analyzes September 11. <br /> <br /> In conclusion: I sympathized with Charlie Fineman, but I was not sure I had the right to do it. he feels for him more than for a Hutu who lost his entire family in Rwanda's civil war. <br /> <br /> Do you catch my savings?
