I really liked that movie. Great story and actors and good movie sets. He told the story in a way that I can understand and pay attention easily without falling asleep. I would like to know where I could get the soundtrack. I can not find it anywhere. Please, send me an email if you know where I could get the soundtrack. Apart from not being able to find the soundtrack, I thought the movie was fascinating. Swayze did a great job. I think this is one of your best jobs. His previous films were fine, but this really told a story for a change. This will go down in history as one of the best television movies that have been aired. Congratulations to the producers and writers of such a great work.
