Well, honestly, I saw the previews of this film and I thought: what do the producers think? Hutton, Jolie, and DUCHOVNY? How could the monotonous actor possibly compete with the natural power of Jolie on the screen? But surprisingly, the two had the kind of chemistry that showed intense care without a kiss. Even David's humor coincided with Jolie's spark and fire. As for Hutton, he played the psychopath very well, contrasting with David's quiet delivery of life-threatening situations. In general, I was very impressed with the writing and the development of the character. I gave him 8 stars.
