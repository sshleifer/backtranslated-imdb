This was the second in the series of 6 "classic Tarzan" movies with Johnny Weismuller in the lead role and Maureen O'Sullivan as Jane. <br /> <br /> As usual, this was a wonderful movie in this series; and perhaps it stands out as an "intermediate" film in a progression that could almost exemplify the development of cinema from the early 1930s to the 1940s. As such, it showed good rhythm, although not as good as later films. Similarly, cinematography is less successful than Tarzan's later films in this series. The material I saw was of uneven quality, with some granulated landscapes and some underexposed and overexposed scenes. The sharp image of Tarzan's latest films is not shown here. On the other hand, there is a scene, very early, in which the sudden movements of a camera with a foliage waving in front of it while the camera backs up, showing the safari men advancing towards the jungle, was really almost modern in style , and it contrasts sharply with the fixed shots that make up the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> As for the plot, an interesting feature here was Jane's near instability and inconstancy, when subject to Martin's. flirting The kiss? And Jane's reaction, dazed and partially guilty? prefigures something of the Jane we see in the future also in these films. Compare, for example, in Tarzan Find a Son! The duplicate actions of Jane fooling Tarzan and delivering Boy to his family. Later, she admits to Tarzan that she was wrong. Here, nothing so explicit, but we have Jane "returning" to the Jane Parker of yesteryear, and in a series of almost repentant actions, shedding the gala dress that Martin and Harry brought to get her away from Tarzan. <Br /> <br /> There was a whole series of representations and sequences that impressed me especially in this vision. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, the image we get of Tarzan's domestic life is here, as below, a combination of sensual idyll with the near possibility of violent death. For me, this is a fundamental part of Tarzan's experience. <br /> <br /> I was really surprised by some pretty violent scenes, even by today's standards. <br /> <br /> There was a whole series of scenes that gave me a special pleasure: Tarzan guiding the elephants to the Valley of the Elephants Cemetery; Tarzan was rescued from watery death by the hippopotamus, and was then nursed by the apes; Cheetah will find Tarzan when Jane and the other men are trapped at the foot of the escarpment; Cheetah, in particular, crossing the river in the registry. The final battle scenes of wild and lions on the ground and wild and monkeys in the trees. Jane, who shows us that she is truly from Tarzan's world now, quickly shows off her woodwork to develop a line of fire to keep the lions away. <br /> <br /> The final series of scenes is splendid: suddenly, Tarzan is on the scene, throwing savages out of the trees and taking charge of the lions, and summoning the elephants to the rescue! That final cry of Tarzan in triumph, holding a happy Jane in his arms, with a cheetah dancing and enchanted at his side, is a memorable image and really a good summary of the story of Tarzan and Jane. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is another wonderful classic Tarzan movie. I would recommend this movie to anyone.
