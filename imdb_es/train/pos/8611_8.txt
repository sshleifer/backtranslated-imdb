['I really enjoyed watching this movie. I recorded it while I watched it so I could review it later. In fact, I enjoyed the second viewing more since I was able to absorb more the intelligent dialogue between Natalie and Adam, the 2 main characters. I thought that the way this story evolved was very stimulating. I was very intrigued by the way Natalie was going to interact with her daughter&#39;s friends, at first it seemed that she was going to vomit a lot of animosity, but once she started to interact more pleasantly I had to see how this visit was going to develop. I was not disappointed Gradually, the secrets that Sara hid from her mother began to reveal a daughter who was not so perfect, a defective human being like most of us who wanted her freedom from a dominant mother who believed she knew her daughter , but unfortunately I had to learn in a very serious way. Painful way that sometimes to really love someone you have to give them their freedom. The viewers who stayed with this film until the end saw a very moving performance by Diane Keaton (which is always wonderful, even in some of her less well received films, such as Town and Country). The final scene of Diane Keaton driving home was worth waiting for, revealing that whoever loves another human being has to learn that we must live our own lives, we love others but we do not own them and, ultimately, we must leave what to go It is a difficult lesson but it is worth contemplating it from time to time. Thanks to CBS for this transmission, it was worth the long wait.']
