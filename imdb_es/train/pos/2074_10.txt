Another great channel 4 canned much ahead of time. Convincing performance of Phil Davis and the rest of the cast. Sexy, intelligent and fun. I remember that I saw him at that moment and even then, asking around, no one had heard of that. But trying to find someone now that you can remember is even more difficult. Maybe Channel 4 does not do its job well enough to increase the enthusiasm needed. Either that or the general public is too interested in the vomit of television that is Big Brother. I suspect the latter. The download of Dark Place by Garth Merengie made Channel 4 release a DVD of that series. Hopefully the same can happen with North Square.
