This movie is one of the most provocative Jesus movies I've seen. It does not seek to tell the whole story, but only to represent an interpretative expression of the last day of Jesus Christ. It is darkly witty, playful and seriously faithful to the elements of the Jewish tradition and to the modern interpretation of the scriptures. Judas is much more common than other representations, not the dark and sinister evil we sometimes imagine, but a man gravely wrong, terribly wrong in his zeal. The Jesus of Chris Saranden is playful and serious, faithful and committed, very human and at the same time divine. The final dialogue is carefully made and serves as the kind of small talk that two powerful men can do when they have just committed an atrocity. I would see this movie again and recommend it to others.
