I was literally preparing to hate this movie, so believe me when I say it's worth watching this movie. In general, the story and the gags are designed, but the film has the charm and delicacy to take them out. That gag where Jason Lee thinks he has crabs, and tries not to let his boss / future father-in-law and his co-workers see him scratching himself is not terribly smart, but it caused me a frantic laugh. Very few of the gags in the film are serious, but they made me laugh. As I said, the film has charm and charm can go a long way. <br /> <br /> The characters are also nice. I must say I wish I could see more of the character of James Brolin, as it was a great success in the few scenes in which he was. In addition, I admire any romantic comedy that has the guts not to make the character of the wife (who Serves as the obstacle in the plot) a total witch. The character of Selma Blair is not unpleasant, and there is never a scene in which I thought: "Why did he want to marry her in the first place?" The end is Hollywood, but it could have been much more awkward. <br /> <br /> The cast is talented. I have not had a favorable view of most of Jason Lee's main work. I just wanted it so much in the films of Kevin Smith that I could not help feeling disappointed to see him in these silly papers. And he never looks comfortable in these silly papers. Even in this movie, it does not look perfectly comfortable, but it brings its own two cents and manages each scene effectively. But I still miss his work in independent films. Julia Stiles shows again why she is so nice. Of course, she is a very beautiful girl with a radiant smile that makes me want to faint, but she also has a unique charm and seems to have a good personality. In other words, its beauty is shown inside and out. I do not know the name of the actresses, but the woman who plays drunk grandma is very funny. Julie Hagerty also has a small part, and it's always nice to see, which makes me wish she had received better roles. I loved her so much in "Airplane" and "Lost in America" ​​that it's a shame she does not have the same opportunities to flaunt her abilities. <br /> <br /> Do not get carried away by the horrible trailers and even more horrible locker records. This is a fun and charming movie. Romantic comedies are becoming so predictable nowadays that it seems that the genre itself is ready to be flushed down the toilet, so it's always good to see a good amount among all these rotten apples. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (out of 10)
