['New York model Alison Parker (Cristina Raines) rents a room in an old brownstone house where she meets some strange neighbors and experiences some spooky hallucinations. While lawyer boyfriend Michael Lerman (Chris Sarandon) tries to make inquiries on her behalf, she struggles to maintain her sanity (not to mention her willingness to live) as her experiences affect physical, mental and emotional health. <br /><br /> I do not want to spoil the best moments in this psychological horror movie for those who are not familiar with it. The story is interesting and entertaining, but the film does not really offer much in terms of real fear. Or, for that matter, any environment. It&#39;s a bit sinister, but it&#39;s not like the traditional horror movie. It is more like a story about the attempts of a woman with problems to deal with the increasing unreality in her life. On that level, it works, but it&#39;s not powerful enough. <br /><br /> What &quot;The Sentinel&quot; * offers * are some striking pieces (in particular, the fascinating climax, fabulously spooky, and there is a scene with Beverly D&#39;Angelo that must be seen to be believed). There is also some blood to see, but not much. An ominous music by Gil Melle adds to the threat. <br /><br /> No review of this film would be complete without an evaluation for the filmmakers, bringing together such excellent actors for their cast. Some of them can not do too much, but seeing them all together is impressive. Eli Wallach and Burgess Meredith make the biggest impressions as, respectively, a tough detective and a solicitous neighbor. Other legendary names include Jos√© Ferrer, Arthur Kennedy and Ava Gardner. Future stars like D&#39;Angelo, Christopher Walken, Tom Berenger, Jeff Goldblum make brief appearances, and other familiar faces include Jerry Orbach, Sylvia Miles, William Hickey and Martin Balsam. Whoever was the casting director of this film deserves some kind of prize. <br /><br /> Written for the screen by director Michael Winner, probably best known for the series &quot;Death Wish&quot; he did with Charles Bronson, from the novel by Jeffrey Konvitz. <br /><br /> I would not consider this a great horror thriller, but it has its moments and is quite entertaining. <br /><br /> 7/10']
