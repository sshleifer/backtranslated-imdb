Okay, it's not a perfect movie, but I do not agree with IMDb's general opinion that it's really bad. I watched many films from Hong Kong in the 1990s and I loved the time. I never saw 'Black Mask' at that time and I only saw it last week for the first time. Apart from the embarrassingly poor dubbing that my DVD copy did not give me the option to turn off, the film contains the raw energy and bravado that permeated the Hong Kong movies during this time. I still cling to my weapons in the opinion that, when it comes to action, these guys, no matter what their budget, add an element of magic to the screen without the Bourne Supremacy, Casino Royale or Mission Impossible (I'm not calling). Movies: I recognize that they lack the spontaneity of this and they feel too regulated) that they will be achieved. What is it? It is the feeling that the filmmakers were experimenting while filming and editing, without fear of leaving some flaws to learn the lessons for the next time. For me, this makes watching movies more fun and dangerous.
