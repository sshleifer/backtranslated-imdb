This movie is very funny. I've seen it a couple of times, but I always have something funny that I remember. The car scene "duckies and bunnies" is one of my favorites, and I still quote Morone's versions of certain words! <br /> <br /> There are so many jokes, it's amazing. But I love Michael Keaton anyway!
