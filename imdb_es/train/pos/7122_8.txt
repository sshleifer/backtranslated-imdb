Immediately after World War II, healthy Hollywood minds tried to distance themselves from the senseless waving of the flag that is a natural ingredient in a war effort. "The best years of our lives" and even the "Gentlemen's Agreement" investigated the way Americans looked at themselves after the war, but Delmer Daves' Pride of the Marines convinced them. <br /> <br /> The film is about the clever alec John Garfield of Philadelphia, who goes to war as a marine and after a nightmare night in a trench, with Japanese soldiers screaming at him uneasily and his friends "Mariiines, tonight you die!", He is blinded by a hand grenade, and leaves his girlfriend at home instead of having to depend on her after returning home. <br /> <br /> Delmer Daves is intransigent in his description of these men who are brave, so to speak, almost by chance. They are there, in the well, and when they are shot, they react. So much for heroism, but they do the job. And then comes the self-pity, the dark and somber sense of humor. Garfield is angry denial of his blindness and the film does not make excuses, "There is no free candy for anyone in this world," as his friend tells him. A guy, a Jew, played by Dane Clark, reminds him: "In a war, someone understands you and you are." Everyone has problems! When I return, some guys will not hire me, because my name is Diamante. "<br /> <br /> Great movies are made with guts like these, and if the first half hour of 'Pride of the Marines' does not reach the occasion completely, from then on it becomes a true work of art, you cry and reflect, it hurts and you wait for hope, well, simply: art. <br /> <br />
