John (Ben Chaplin) is a lonely bank employee who lives in a small town near London. Through the Internet, you contact a Russian bridal agency. Select Sophia (Nicole Kidman, the boy might feel lonely and shy, but he certainly has good taste, is not it?) And when they met, he realizes that she does not speak English. The communication between them is basically limited by sex (once again, imagine, what a terrible situation for the boy, just have some sex with Nicole Kidman!). On her birthday, two Russian friends visit her. Then, many surprises will happen. I liked this movie: first, it is almost impossible to be 'labeled'. Is it a black comedy, an action, a thriller? I think all the choices are correct. Nicole Kidman is beautiful as always, and I am very curious about her Russian: do you speak Russian with a correct accent or are you just pretending? Anyway, I thought it was a nice movie. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Isca Perfeita" ("The Perfect Bait")
