['Crush offers a combination of drama, humor and such irony that I think English is very well established when it comes to matters of the heart. Especially for his direction, John McKay wrote this wonderful script about three friends in their forties in a small town in England. The three professional women who had bad luck with the men formed a ritual ladies&#39; night with gin, fags and sweets that were included with an interminable talk about the erroneous behavior of their appointments or the needs of their libidos. Andie MacDowell, once again launched around the British (which is where I find that she exudes the most) is absolutely charming as the director of a prestigious school that gets involved with a younger man. Gossip from small cities and jealous friends who disapprove (great cast of support) are in conflict with their relationship. Deploying a series of brutal and unfortunate events and showing us the many difficulties when one is looking for true happiness. Keep in mind that the main premise of this film is friendship and the end shows us exactly that. This is the kind of movie you love or hate, so I think there&#39;s a lot of criticism and not the biggest success that came when this movie was released. As I&#39;m sure, the majority is just unearthing the movie now. I enjoyed this movie a lot and I recommend it for those who like movies like &quot;Love Actually&quot;, and &quot;Three Weddings and a funeral&quot;. Not to mention that the soundtrack is extraordinary, perfectly capturing those crucial moments.']
