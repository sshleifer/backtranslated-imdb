I have always liked movies that represent life as it is. Life sometimes has boring patches, it does not have a real plot and not necessarily a happy ending. "A River Runs Through It" is the perfect name for this movie (and Norman Maclean's novel). Life flows and flows like a river, and it has difficult places, but it is a wonderful journey. <br /> <br /> Robert Redford brings a lot to the movie. His narrative has a friendly feel that fits perfectly with the image. As a director, he is sober and calm, and captures some incredibly beautiful scenes. In terms of acting, Craig Sheffer and Brad Pitt work surprisingly well as brothers. I do not know how to describe the performances of Tom Skerritt and Brenda Blethyn, except that they really feel real. "A River Runs Through It" is a wonderful movie. <br /> <br /> 8.6 out of 10
