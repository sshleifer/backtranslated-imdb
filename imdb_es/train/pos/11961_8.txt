I thought this was a wonderful way to spend a hot summer weekend, sit in the air-conditioned theater and watch a happy comedy. The plot is simplistic, but the dialogue is witty and the characters are nice (even the alleged serial killer). While some may feel disappointed when they realize that this is not Point 2: Risk Addiction, I thought it was proof that Woody Allen still has total control of the style that many of us have learned to love. This was the most I had laughed at one of Woody's comedies in years (would I dare say a decade?). Although I was never impressed by Scarlet Johanson, in this she managed to soften her "sexy" image and jumped to the middle, but an energetic young woman. <br /> <br /> This may not be the jewel in the crown. of his career, but he was more ingenious than "Devil Wears Prada" and more interesting than "Superman", a great comedy to see with friends.
