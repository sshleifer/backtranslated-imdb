There is a detail, which is not very common for Jackie Chan's films, but which is present here. It has a very hard and serious atmosphere, while fun elements are also present. Jackie is menacing and psychotic here. He is not a hero who is attacked and only then defends himself (in a habitual relaxed pattern), but he is the one who can go and start the tumult. His way of hitting that evil guy in glasses is amazing. Every time it goes "crack". I also especially enjoy the scene when Jackie goes to the pub and hits the villains who had faced her girlfriend. It is one of the best blitzkriegs on the screen. In addition, the whole scene is recorded with the background of an action character painted on the wall (it also looks like a "rabochiy" poster from our Soviet era) and some lines in Russian on the left (I noticed it very accidentally). That looks great (and nostalgic for the Russians). I also like it when the windows are broken in the movies. Here are many of these things. It's amazing to see the characters fall / jump / run / drive through all kinds of panels. <br /> <br /> The three films are great. I had been preparing to see the slide of quality, but I saw a perfect trilogy with sensations and incredible acrobatics (and not only the character of Jackie Chan appears in all three films, it is also excellent and maintains continuity). <Br /> <br /> I would like to describe each film in a few words: No.1 - great (in all respects - it's an exciting story from start to finish) and fun (many scenes are ridiculous); No.2: furious (Jackie is really * beep * off here) and painful (Jackie is tortured); No.3: incredible (the woman who fights along with Jackie is incredible) and grandiloquent (should I mention many weapons and explosions?). <br /> <br /> As for the rest, a lot has been mentioned by the others. <br /> <br /> It's a trilogy that can be seen again and again (at least by me). His place is in the top 10 among the action / comedy gems. Finally, it was released in Russia on DVD (the second movie has the best options: the Chinese / Russian soundtracks and the English / Russian subtitles). <br /> <br /> Solid 10 out of 10. Thank you for your attention.
