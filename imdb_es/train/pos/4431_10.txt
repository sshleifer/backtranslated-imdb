This movie is classified as one of my 10 best favorite movies of all time. Many people who see it for the first time and who know little about many of the themes of the film probably will not understand why I find it so fascinating, so I'll try to explain ... <br /> <br /> The movie is very rich in historical details and cultural visions, and while it has a few minor anachronisms, they are completely forgivable. The story is a retelling of the famous duel between Monk Benkei and young Prince Yoshitsune on the Gojo bridge. During the fight, according to the legend, Yoshitsune surpasses Benkei and the monk becomes the loyal retainer of the prince. However, this film is a revision of that story and involves war, dark prophecy and political maneuvers. <br /> <br /> One of the main themes of the film is "Mappo", which is the Buddha's prophecy that follows. 1000 years his teachings would fail and the world would fall into chaos. It was believed in Heian Japan, after the eruption of Mount Fuji and the civil war between the Taira (Heike) and the Minamoto (Genji), that the world would fall into anarchy and everything would collapse. It is a moment of demons. <br /> <br /> Next, you have the way in which the film solves the problem of Yoshitsune sword training by the Tenku (Ravens Goblins) of Karuma. The defeated clans often escaped to the mountains and disguised themselves as demons to scare the locals. It is said that this is where the ninja clans began historically. The representation of Yoshitsune in Gojo adapts very well to all this. <br /> <br /> Then there is Benkei, and the various strains of Buddhism are represented, including a large amount of esoteric Buddhism from the Shingon sect. All these are represented quite accurately, and just to add a little more, the film manages to convey the power of meditation and energy Ki in a way that makes it an integral part of the story, that is, uses magical realism to add an additional dimension to the story. Film, but he does it in a way that is tactical and threatening. <br /> <br /> In general, it is full of fascinating tidbits and surprisingly realistic rings for the time. The scenery and the costumes are also completely unmissable and very authentic. The soundtrack is great, very melancholic and sinister. I also thought that the real performances were surprisingly good. Benkei is a great antihero, Shanao (Yoshitsune) is represented as a young man who tests his limits and gets drunk more and more by his own power, and Tetsukichi, the sword's treasure of swords, makes an interesting description of the "common man" and His less than flattering opinion of murderers who think they are better socially. <br /> <br /> As for the plot, to see why it's so good, I really suggest you dig up an old book about Japanese history and see. how this recount turns an almost carefree story of Robin Hood against Little John into a bloody story of intrigue, violence and hellish karma.
