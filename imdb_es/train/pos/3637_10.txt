This was really a great movie. I loved Dennis Quaid and the entire baseball team. Jay Hernandez is also a very nice actor who is very nice to watch. The chemistry that the team had once they gathered things was spectacular, it only serves to show what they can achieve when minds come together as one with a goal. This team came back from the edge, having multiple losing seasons to win almost everything. I love movies like this, because they really are very inspiring. <br /> <br /> In addition, the character of Dennis Quaid occupies a place in the big leagues. You can not do anything, but encourage this guy. It seems that when someone must do something, they will do that. Things simply fit into place and make everything click. <br /> <br /> Based on a true story, this movie will really make you think about the fact that "nothing is impossible".
