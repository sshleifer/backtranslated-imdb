I've seen hundreds of silent movies. Some will always be classics (like Nosferatu, Metropolis, The General and Wings), but among them, my favorite movie is this one (it may not be the best, but it's a favorite). In fact, when I searched for it in IMDb, I noticed that I laughed immediately because the movie was very cute and well made. Marion Davies demonstrated with this film that she really had great talent and was not THE ONLY lover of William Randolph Hearst. <br /> <br /> The story involves a Georgia hick who comes to Hollywood with the expectation that she will be an instant star! Their experiences and the interesting appearances of the stars of the time make this a real pleasure for movie lovers and a must see!
