Now this is one of the best roles of Big's Best, Jack Hulbert in 1931 divided into two for the radio team Band Waggon Askey & Murdoch. It has a great unconditional cast, which takes care of everything that counts, especially Askey, of course. Linden Travers provided information on the subject, melodramatic by Herbert Lomas and Richard Murdoch for pragmatics. <br /> <br /> The group of train passengers stranded at the lonely rural station at night find more than they expected, ghostly trains, spectral carriers, furry sausage rolls and Arthur trying to entertain them all. Its repair with the whole world falls between the lateral division and the horrible boring. When the formula works, it is very good, but sometimes it is very artificial and forced to make the film look more antiquated than it is. But those damn traitors of the fifth column, thanks to any god that Britain does not have today! <br /> <br /> Ultimately, a good harmless movie, to welcome you to the television screen like an old friend, but if you were expecting to be shaken out of your woods you will probably be very disappointed!
