['Taiwanese director Ang Lee, whose previous films include &#39;Sense and Sensibility&#39; and &#39;The Ice Storm&#39;, turned to the American Civil War for his latest film. Based on a novel by Daniel Woodrell, he follows the exploits of a group of southern guerrillas, known as the assailants, while fighting against their counterparts from the north, the Jayhawkers in the Missouri backwater. <br /><br /> As expected, there is much visceral action, but the focus is on the tension that the war exerted on the young people who fought in it, many of whom were fighting against their former neighbors and even relatives. Jake Roedel (Tobey Maguire) is a man like that, or rather, boy, since he is only seventeen years old when the war comes to Missouri. He is the son of a German immigrant, but instead of following his countrymen and becoming a trade unionist, he joins his lifelong friend, Jack Bull Chiles (Skeet Ulrich), and rides with the bushwhackers. Despite the lack of acceptance due to his ancestry and the unwillingness to participate in the murder of unarmed men of the Union, he remains loyal to the cause. So does his friend Daniel Holt (Jeffrey Wright), a black slave freed by another ranger and fighting for the South. <br /><br /> Lee handles the issue with aplomb, never rushing to the deep introspection that the plot demands in favor of the action and this gives the film a sense of the reality of war: long periods of boredom and waiting interspersed with occasional flashes of intense and terrifying combats. The action is unglamorous and admirably sincere, recognizing that both parties committed a large number of atrocities. <br /><br /> The performances are excellent, with Maguire and Wright brave and worthy. Promising Irish actor Jonathan Rhys Meyers is particularly chilling as a cold-blooded killer, while Skeet Ulrich is pleasantly soft and arrogant. Lee never shudders at the reality of war, but his actors do an admirable job in showing the good that emerges: the growth of friendship, the demonstration of courage and, on a wider scale, the emancipation of oppressed peoples. Ride With the Devil is a beautiful and deeply compassionate film that moves regularly but always moves the audience.']
