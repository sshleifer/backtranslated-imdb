First of all, if you plan to see this, make sure you see the UNCUT version (although it is very interesting to go back and then see the scenes that were manipulated due to censorship), this makes a BIG difference. This film is about a young woman, played by Barbara Stanwyck, who from the age of 14 was forced to prostitute herself by her own father. When her father dies suddenly, she can go out into the world alone. After reading about the philosophies of Nietzsche's life, she uses her sexuality to manipulate men to give her what she wants and leaves them in ruins and desperate for her love. Throughout the film, she becomes increasingly materialistic and manipulative, and the audience begins to wonder if she has any sense of morality left. In general, Baby Face is a very shocking movie with obvious scenes of sexuality that most people do not expect to see in a black and white film. While sexual acts are not explicitly shown on the screen, it is very obvious what happens outside the camera. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed watching this movie and I think that most modern audiences will enjoy at least some fun if, especially with the shock value of movies. I thought that while I was watching it, the rhythm seemed a little slow in some places, but I think most of the films see it for the first time. Actually, I think almost every movie I've seen made since the early 30s had some minor rhythm problems or certain parts just did not "flow" well. Probably this was just the job of making movies, has not yet been perfected? It would only take a few more years. Compare a 1939 movie and compare it to a movie from the early 1930s and I think you'll see what I mean. <br /> <br /> Once again, I am very happy to have been able to see the original cut; It really makes a big difference. Also any John Wayne fan will be surprised to see him in this film before he was famous in an uncharacteristic role.
