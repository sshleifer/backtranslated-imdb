James J. Corbett, world heavyweight champion from 1892 to 1897, turned out to be Errol Flynn's favorite role. Possibly because he did not have to wield a sword or be in a western. He got tired of boasters and said in his autobiography that he felt bad in westerns and could not understand why people liked him. It's a nice movie, but it almost does not tell the true story of James J. Corbett. <br /> <br /> As he described it Corbett was the first scientific boxer to win in the heavyweight division, a man who used brains and speed more than brute force to win. He defeated John L. Sullivan and lost to Bob Fitzsimmons the heavyweight crown. He was also a compulsive womanizer and in that he looked very much like the man who portrayed him. Of course it was not shown on the screen. The character played by Alexis Smith, the banker's daughter who falls in love with him, has no basis in reality. In fact, Corbett was married twice and was flagrantly unfaithful with his two wives. <br /> <br /> In addition, after losing his title and concluding the events of this film, he suffered a great personal tragedy. His father was in a time of depression, probably because of financial problems because he lost betting that his son beat Bob Fitzsimmons, shot his mother and then pointed the gun. The murder / suicide hardly coincides with the happy clan that presided over Alan Hale. <br /> <br /> One thing that I liked about Gentleman Jim. Ward Bond won the career role of his life when he played John L. Sullivan. Director Raoul Walsh earned a great Bond performance as the passionate but adorable Sullivan. Even taking into account some of the negative points of Sullivan that do not reach the screen as rabid racism, the portrait of Bond is John L. par excellence and the best of Gentleman Jim. <br /> <br /> Speaking of racism, one thing that should have been said was the fact that Sullivan, while the champion refused for career reasons, ran into Peter Jackson, who was black and from Australia and probably the best heavyweight of his time. I say probably because as a challenger Corbett met him and fought with him for 61 rounds for a draw. That fight, more than any other, created a demand for a match for the Sullivan-Corbett title. Of course, when Corbett was a champion, he refused to give Jackson a shot at the title. Maybe I did not want another marathon of 61 rounds with someone that could have been better that particular day. <br /> <br /> Knight Jim is not the story of Jim Corbett, it's an Errol Flynn movie that plays James J Corbett. But Corbett, if he had been alive in 1942, would certainly have loved the film and loved Flynn's representation of his life. It's like he would have liked to be remembered.
