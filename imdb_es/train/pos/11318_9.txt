Cain's very American novel is also fascinated uncritically with the construction of whiteness (the main character, Cora, has an obsessive fear of being identified as Mexican and ashamed of having married a Greek immigrant), which is not It is relevant to the Italian rural context that Visconti is. working in. This allows class antagonisms to take center stage and dance among the embers of the passionate and damned love story of the two main characters. This movie is a complex, suspenseful and rewarding experience.
