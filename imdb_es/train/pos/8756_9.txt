I caught this cable movie in the middle and had to rent it to see it in its entirety and I'm glad I did. I was immediately attracted to the story and worried about the girls involved. Naive high school graduates, best friends since childhood, take a high school trip and are tricked by a scammer named Nick who gets them into serious trouble. They are used as sacrificial mules in a network of heroin smugglers. The girls, in charge of custody, learn to deal with their incarceration while trying to get out of their problems. Everything they try to help themselves falls short when the Thai criminal justice system shows shortcomings and girls end up in more trouble and lose the confidence of their American lawyer "Yankee Hank". Hank gives up trying to defend them after he feels betrayed by Alice (Claire Dane). However, Hank's native Thai wife smells a rat in the case and does a little more research work and discovers that the girls were really victimized. The end of the film, when Alice does a disinterested act to save Darlene (Beckinsale), made me cry. I really enjoyed this movie and would recommend it.
