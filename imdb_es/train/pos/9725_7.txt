"How to lose friends and alienate people" is not based on Tiger Woods' infidelities. It's a mediocre romantic comedy based on Toby Young's book about his experiences working as a journalist covering celebrities. The film stars Simon Pegg as Sidney Young, a quirky British journalist who takes a job at an illustrious celebrity magazine in New York. Young is uneasy about having caught all kinds of scams to alienate him, hence the title of the movie. It is graceful, daring and foolish. But nevertheless, for some very strange reason, he is a very nice character. Sidney befriends a fellow journalist, the compound Alison Olsen, played admirably by Kirsten Dunst. However, Sidney is mainly yearning for sexpot actress Sophie Maes played by the fantastic Mrs. Megan Fox. This foxtrot is short on acting ability but high on "sweet eyes" material. Sidney gets into all kinds of nonsense to be able to climb the scale of journalists in the magazine co. Those are the comedic moments of the movie. However, I think that director Robert Weide and screenwriter Peter Straughan could lose some viewers and alienate the authentic rom-com material by developing an unlikely romantic plot between Sidney and Alison; although Team Weidstraughan formulated an entertaining narrative in another way. Pegg nailed his character on the wire with his hilarious performance as Sidney Young. Jeff Bridges was once again building bridges "The Dude" with his enigmatic support work as Clayton Harding, the soft prez of the magazine. But the rest of the film's performance was not worthy enough to present here. "How to lose friends and alienate people" should not be completely alienated, but you can lose some movie friends if you publish it as a superlative romantic comedy. *** Average
