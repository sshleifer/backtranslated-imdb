['This movie is amazing for several reasons. Harris takes an extremely clumsy documentary and makes it a relevant social commentary. Groovin &#39;Gary is a child from a small town who (supposedly) is very loved for his many imitations. When he decides to play Olivia Newton John in a local talent contest (for whom he is very passionate), Gary&#39;s actions show that he disagrees with the conservative social environment in which he lives. This causes him to make several justifications for his actions so that people do not think that, in fact, he is a transvestite or another such social outcast. In the second installment, Harris exploits the fight between Gary and Beaver in a rookie attempt to make a narration of the original documentary. The third and final installment of the trilogy is really surprising for Harris&#39;s extreme sensitivity to the subject. Unlike the second installment, &quot;The Orkly Kid&quot; shows Gary as a truly problematic character. He struggles to gain acceptance within his own community in vain. His secret passion for dressing like Olivia Newton John takes him further away from people who already consider him a social outcast. The film is described so realistically that, like reality, it lends itself to many reactions. Surely, one can see Gary as a ridiculously pathetic character, but he can also identify with him as an outcast.']
