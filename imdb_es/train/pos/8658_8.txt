It's a road movie, with an assassin on board. Brian Kessler (David Duchovny), a sophisticated, urban writer, wants to conduct a field investigation of American serial killers. But, neither he nor his girlfriend, Carrie (Michelle Forbes), have the money for a tour through the murder sites, so they announce that someone will share the travel expenses. With those who end is a young couple, Early Grayce (Brad Pitt) and his girlfriend, Adele (Juliette Lewis), two best examples of "poor white trash" that you will never find in all the movies. <br /> <br /> In fact, Early and Adele are the ones who make this movie so entertaining, as they babble, tease, trust, reflect, speculate, drool and behave differently in ways I have not seen from the replays of "The Beverly Hillbillies". Early's California idea: "People think faster, because of all that warm weather, cold weather makes people stupid." That's enough to convince Adele: "I guess that explains why there are so many stupid people around here." To which Early responds with pride: "Surely." Early continues to instruct Adele about California: "You never have to buy any fruit, since everything is in the trees ... and they do not have speed limits, and I hear that your first month of rent is free, state law." <br /> <br /> But poor Early has some, well, mental problems, which are becoming more and more obvious to Brian and Carrie, as the four travelers move westward across the United States. Upon entering the Southwest desert, with its beautifully stiff landscape. , "Kalifornia" begins to look more and more like "The Hitcher" (1986), and Early begins to act more and more like John Ryder, the hitchhiker of the whole world, whose terror seemed so unstoppable. <br /> <br /> In "Kalifornia", the performance is uneven. Duchovny's performance is flat. Brad Pitt is surprisingly effective, despite his overacting at times. Michelle Forbes is great as the avant-garde, photographic artist. But my choice for the best performance is for Juliette Lewis. With her nasal voice and her strong southern accent, she is amazing, since the naive, highly animated, like a child Adele. <br /> <br /> Towards the end, the film acquires a Twilight Zone feel. while our travelers enter a Nevada nuclear test site with an old dilapidated house full of test mannequins. The plot dissolves quite disorderly in an unnecessary and absurd violence, an ending that was somewhat disappointing. <br /> <br /> In general, however, "Kalifornia" is an entertaining film, thanks to an intelligent concept, a great stage, especially in the Second Half, good cinematography, great dialogue and that wonderful performance by Juliette Lewis .
