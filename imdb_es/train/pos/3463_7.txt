I'm a big fan of the Beatles. My favorite Beatle is Paul and my least favorite is John. I already knew a lot about the music of the Beatles and the truth behind the breakup, as well as things like the John Lennon family and the Paul Wings band. I was curious to see how this film would handle the relationship between John and Paul so many years after the breakup. <br /> <br /> This movie did not disappoint me. Although the story itself is fiction, many of the references that the two musicians used were very accurate. This included how Yoko Ono would always be with John wherever, where the Wings song "Silly Love Songs" was the number one hit that year and the concert on the roof of Apple Studios playing music from the album "Let It Be". br /> <br /> The actors did a very good job of playing John and Paul. The accents could have used a little more work, but they seemed to act a lot as I read how the two ex-Beatles used to act. I also liked the dialogue between them, which was basically what the whole movie was like. <br /> <br /> The ending at the beginning disappointed me, but the more you think about it, the more you will appreciate it, especially because this was so. How it really was in real life. They also show the fantastic "Saturday Night Live" sketch in which the Beatles are offered $ 3,000 to act in the show. (compared to the $ 220 million that others offered) In general, I was not disappointed with this movie. It really gives you more idea of ​​why the Beatles split up and why they never got together again.
