History and music (George Gershwin!) Are wonderful, as are Levant, Guetary, Foch and, of course, Kelly. One thing is missing, and that thing is a good leader. I'm sorry, Leslie Caron bothers me. Anyway, despite it, the plot moves very well with the famous (and deservedly) Ballet. Oh, the colors, the dazzling reds, the blues, the greens and the yellows. Nor should we forget the beiges. ; ) I simply love the contrast between the Beaux Arts dance (completely black and white costumes) and the always brilliant ballet. <br /> <br /> So I guess what I'm trying to say is this: please, by all means, see it and enjoy it, because even though it's not the best, it's WONDERFUL. But be sure not to forget that other Gene Kelly musical with the 20-year-old girl who was catapulted to stardom right after.
