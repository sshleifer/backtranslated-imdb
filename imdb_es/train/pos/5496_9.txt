Someone has already mentioned "being at the right time in the right place". It was so true for this documentary that I had doubts about the authenticity of the scenes and I thought it included some acting, but it is not. Everything is real. History is nothing new for people in developing and / or poor countries. It sheds light on the manipulation of people by the corporate media, the misinformation, the artificial polarization of the people by deliberately creating tension in the streets, sometimes to the point that the army, the intelligence agency or even the government (Many believe, led by the United States uses agents that attack "any" side to provoke the violence of the masses and, therefore, justify their coup d'etats.) A naval officer in the film also mentions it. see all the towns in the streets, all these scenarios have been played in Turkey (the US pet dog in the Middle East) throughout its history that has experienced 3 blows and, lately, secret plans made by the Turkish army have been exposed, ironically, through an official religious / conservative media, opposing the a-religious doctrines of the army, in which an agent of the army bombs a mosque very important to provoke people, etc. <br /> <br /> What makes this film unique is that they were filming from within, perhaps by chance, when events have happened. It is clear that the directors are pro chávez. Whether or not this caused directors to filter and manipulate events and information, I would not know. <br /> <br /> And if Chávez will defend the people of Venezuela against the dictatorship of the United States and the global economy without repressing any opposing thought with force and in the end becoming a self-indulgent tyrant, history will tell. <br /> <br /> But at least Chávez is hope and I think it's worth risking.
