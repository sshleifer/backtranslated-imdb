I saw this movie with my family and it was great! This film is more than just a documentary (it offers no more than cold data) with long monolems / dialogues and many graphics ... The full "power" of this film comes from the impressive images that are filmed underwater, in the Air or the Arctic. By watching this movie, you can learn more about our planet than just reading a book, this shows that WE are embedded in the circular flow of life. This movie is not just for "environmental fans", although people who want to see a good movie with a message should see it. This movie taught me that we not only live on earth ... we live with and through the earth and all plants and animals grow and die with us.
