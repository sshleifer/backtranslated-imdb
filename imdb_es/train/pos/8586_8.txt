Welcome back Kiefer Sutherland. It's been a long time since you appeared in a movie, and what movie this was, it was 24 no, but very intriguing, especially with a professional like Michael Douglas at the helm as the beleaguered Secret Service Agent. The character of Kiefer is the one who chases Michael Douglas throughout the film, Kiefer's partner is Eva Longoria, the desperate woman. wow, you can actually act, in addition to flirt all day and look good, although I would like Kim Bassinger to have a more important role, but apart from that, I really believe that the whole movie was an explosion from start to finish. This film is what I consider to be a political thriller, everyone did their part to the fullest. Nothing was revealed to Sooon in the movie, in order to keep you guessing at all times. And I really think that Kiefer did a great job here in this movie, but in my opinion, Michael Douglas had the best performance of the day, a thumbs up.
