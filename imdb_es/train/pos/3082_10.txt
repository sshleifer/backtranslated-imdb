What is really sad, programs like Six Degree's and Brothers & Sisters are the real reality show, not that crap that are nothing more than glorified game shows. I think the wave of discontent has been there in recent years with very premature cancellations of numerous shows with cult followers. But with the more vocal reaction of Jericho fans (which I also enjoy) and other programs, networks can begin to reverse this trend. I am like the others, I will not support ANY new program until they have been given a second season. Then I will possibly make the decision to watch and catch up on DVDs and watch them online. Until then, ABC, you have lost me as a spectator of ANY new show.
