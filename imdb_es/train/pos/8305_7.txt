I really enjoyed the movie, however, I did not realize that Little Richard had so many things happening in his life. In the first place I was not aware of Lucille. There is very little (almost none) mention that women are intimately involved with Little Richard. Even in her current life, no women's participation is mentioned in a romantic way. I wonder why this part of his life was not mentioned. In general, the movie was great. I also did not like that Leon played the role of Little Richard, he's a good actor, but I think the part of it should have been for a different actor. Visually it did not remind me of little Richard. He also totally ignored the promiscuity that little Richard was part of. From the movie he was photographed as a sexual addict. In today's time, he would be referred to counseling for his sexual addition. He was a voyeur. I do not want to ruin the movie for someone who has not seen it. However, there were several things about the movie that I think should not have been part of the final cut.
