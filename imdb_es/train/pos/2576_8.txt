I'm from "the Christopher Reeve Generation." It's fair to say that he was the best actor to play Superman, but that does not stop me from enjoying other actors in the role, and George Reeves makes a good attempt to knock him out. Chris came out of the top, although it hardly falls short. That does not stop me from enjoying this movie, it has a lot in its favor. It has everything you need a movie, a plot with beginning, middle and end, plus all those parts are written intelligently. The film is avant-garde in both the acting and the plot, something similar to black film but with meshes. The story is exciting and meaningful, this is a movie with a message that is not too predicative. I'm still surprised that it was filmed for 12 days, oh Hollywood's glory days, when we did not have to wait 5 years just to see if the movie would fall into the hell of development ... The film is polished and made by experts, directed by Lee "Roll'em" Sholem, best known for directing with speed and efficiency. It never allows the limitations of technology to slow it down, in fact, some creative things are done to create the effect of flight, such as putting a camera on a truck boom and shooting high and traveling fast to make it look like we're watching. Superman's point of view, also some close-ups of George in the process work, and a very remote possibility of an animated Superman. <br /> <br /> Now available on DVD as an additional feature in the first season of the television series George Reeves. A DVD that is worth owning in its own right, the inclusion of the film as its original set, is the icing on the cake. <br /> <br /> Give blood to God today!
