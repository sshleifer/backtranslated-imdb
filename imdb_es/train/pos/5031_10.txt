This movie is beautifully designed! There are no faults. Not in the design of the set, the lighting, the sounds, the plot. The script is an invitation to a complex game where participants are on a simple mission. <br /> <br /> Paxton is at his best in this role. Their gestures, the infections used in the tones of their voice are without error. Each shot meticulously done! Surprises appear one after the other when the film reaches beyond its first hour. This may not be the best image of the year, but it is a jewel that has been very well polished. It is not for the simple mind.
