The premise may seem silly, but since Murphy's character does not take it seriously, it helps the audience get into this mixture of mysticism and kidnapping of children today. Excellent cast, particularly Charles Dance and Charlotte Lewis, and Murphy is at the height of his peak in the 80s in comedy / action. There is also a large F / X, a very surreal dream sequence and a quite original plot. It is often overlooked in the pantheon of Murphy's films, but it is worth checking out.
