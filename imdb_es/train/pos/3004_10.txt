Philo Vance (William Powell) helps solve multiple murders among the rich after a dog show. <br /> <br /> I usually hate very complicated mysteries (like this one) but I LOVE this movie. It moves very fast (only 72 minutes), is beautifully directed by Michael Curtiz (uses tons of camera tricks that speed up the narrative), has a very clever story line (which includes a solution to a murder in a closed room that was simply amazing) and has a very good cast. <br /> <br /> Powell is very soft and great like Vance, he does not seem to be acting, IT'S THE Vance! Mary Astor does not have much to do, but adds class and beauty to the production. Everyone else is also very good, but the best of all is Eugene Pallette as Detective Heath. He is a very good actor with a VERY distinctive voice and some of his lines were very funny. <br /> <br /> Basically, an excellent mystery of Hollywood murder in the 1930s. Well worth seeing. <br /> <br />
