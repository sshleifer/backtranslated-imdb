I will never forget when I saw this title in the video store when. I was always a big fan of Weird Al and when I saw this video, I rented it and saw it. I was too young to appreciate all of Al's subtle humor and satire at the time, but I remember it much later when I was old enough to understand what I was seeing. If you are a "Al" fan, especially from your previous work, you will enjoy this movie. It's done in MTV's "Rockumentary" style and tells a true (but sometimes exaggerated) story of how Al came to be where he was in 1985. You'll love it if you like his brand of humor and, most importantly, his music.
