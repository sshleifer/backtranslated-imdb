I've seen this documentary twice, and although I'm a big movie buff, most documentaries do not appeal to me. This movie, however, was fascinating. Almost all the shots are perfect: they say much more than an audio commentary (that this documentary does not have). <br /> <br /> The concept of this movie is incredible, I can not praise it enough. Mardi Gras Accounts - Who would have thought? <br /> <br /> Surprising and excellent interview selections - filming a factory in China - the film makes you feel like you're really there. <br /> <br /> I am aware of politics - and I have read several books on globalization, so there was nothing in this film that surprised me. However, it has made me think a lot. <br /> <br /> I also really want this world to be a better place. <br /> <br /> A million congratulations to the filmmaker, and thanks for making this film as well. <br /> <br /> I wish everyone could see it.
