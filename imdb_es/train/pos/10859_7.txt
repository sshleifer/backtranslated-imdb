Not to be confused with the Resse Witherspoon movie from the high school of the same name, this is a stylized look at the gangs of the Hong Kong triad. It is called an election because a new leader or "president" is elected by ancient traditions every two years. Two candidates are ready for the position and, through ego, bribes and background, the race is tense, to say the least. Directed by experts to introduce you to an extensive cast without confusing the twists and turns of the story before revealing itself in all its brutal glory. The Asian godfather is not, but it is a fun thriller in a genre of gangsters that will leave him on the edge of his seat and shudder in the face of violence. Subtitled volume 1 I think it is safe to say that there will be other deliveries as we delve into the dark world of the triads and all of their commercial dealings and disputes. Either way, this is a good start and if there are no sequels, a great movie in itself.
