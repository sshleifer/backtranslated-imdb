['When I was a kid I thought that this movie was great. I had animals, I had beautiful music and I had my favorite actor: Michael J. Fox. Now, I still love this movie, for different reasons. It has well-trained animals that undergo various acrobatics and scenes that look great in the camera. It has a beautiful well written musical that fits perfectly with the scenes, with fast-paced melodies and the main theme that tore at my heart, which still makes me cry. Even when people buzz it. And it has my favorite actor, Michael J. Fox. <br /><br /> Based on a book, this is the story of three domestic pets, an intelligent, overconfident and considerably paternal laboratory named Shadow, an ingenious and vain, but intelligent cat, with a fear of water called Sassy and a street. -Smart ridiculously curious and slightly neurotic bulldog, Chance. All three are taken to a friend&#39;s farm when their family leaves. Discouraged and worried, the pets escape and plan a trip through the mountains of the Sierra for the journey of their lives. A truly incredible trip. So, what, maybe the home is right on that mountain. But what if it is not? <br /><br /> I suggest Homeward Bound for people who like the three incredible actors that provide the voices of the main animal characters, and for anyone else who ... yes, everyone goes to see it.']
