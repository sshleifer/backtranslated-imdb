In this simple adaptation of Jane Austen's satirical classics on the marriage game within and between the classes of eighteenth-century provincial England, production values ​​and solid performances abound. Northam and Paltrow are a healthy mix as friends who must go through jealousy and lies to discover that they love each other. Good humor is a sustained virtue that largely explains the accessibility of the aged original material (which has been somewhat attenuated in its harsh skepticism). I liked the look of the film and the way in which the shots were taken, and I thought that it was not based too much on the sequences of shots to the head like most of the other films of the 80s and 90s. Very good results.
