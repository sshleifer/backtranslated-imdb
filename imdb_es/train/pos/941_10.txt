The first time I saw this version of "A Christmas Carol" was when it first appeared on television. In fact, I anticipated seeing the movie when it was announced and it was more than up to my expectations. Now I have bought the DVD and I plan to see it every year. With the exception of "It's A Wonderful Life", I consider this version of "A Christmas Carol" to be one of the best Christmas movies ever made. George C. Scott is excellent and an excellent cast directed by Roger Rees surrounds him. Scott proves once again that he is one of the best actors of our time. Scott has the artistic talent and the ability to act to play any role and keep the character unique to himself. How can someone be remembered as Patton and Scrooge? Scott does it so easily. The direction is wonderful with the fine sets, costumes and music that give the film a special feeling of time, place and time represented. You will simply love this movie and you will place it among your favorites to watch during the holiday season.
