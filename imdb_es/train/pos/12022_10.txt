As a big fan of the original, I avoided this movie like the plague when the negative reviews began to arrive eight years ago, but I just saw this movie and it seemed a very pleasant surprise. <br /> <br /> Well, if you are looking for a new version of the original, a big disappointment awaits you, but if you are looking for something quite different, a little nervous and political, then this is the movie for you. <br /> <br /> Gregory is now thirty-four years old and works as a teacher in his former comprehensive school, where a classmate is chasing him and has sexual dreams with one of his students. When the student insists on meeting with Gregory, a series of misadventures take place that include torture, rupture and entrance and all kinds of unexpected turns that made me feel euphoric and moved. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for something original, then I recommend this movie. I just wish more people would have gone to see this when it was released and they saw it for what it really is.
