This film reminds a bit of the German film, THE NEVERENDING STORY because a child is magically transported to a strange land to be a hero. However, due to a much higher modern technology, the puppets and the CGI are used to create a world of incredibly realistic aspect, which will leave you breathless due to its realism and scope. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this movie, but boy was a task at first! Unfortunately, for most Westerners, this is a film to which you can give up or fire very quickly, since everything in the movie seems so strange. However, give it a chance. Do not think or try to understand everything you see; just let the story unfold and you will probably enjoy the movie. <br /> <br /> In many ways, this is exactly the kind of advice I give to adults who look at Miyazaki SPIRIT because it is very similar and presents tons of Yokai (Japanese mythical spirits). The big difference between the two is that THE GREAT YOKAI WAR is live-action and SPIRITED AWAY is much more child-friendly. Although I believe that THE GREAT YOKAI WAR was thought primarily as a children's movie, in the USA. UU., Most parents would not want to show this to younger children because it is very violent, frightening and presents some behaviors of adults. So, who is the audience in the west? Well, older children and adults who appreciate foreign films with non-western themes and compositions. This is a pretty close audience, by the way! <br /> <br /> While you're watching, look for all the strange little touches. In fact, you can watch the movie dozens of times and notice different little things each time. Some of the fun references I liked were the commentary on Gamera, the scene that came with the comment "CHILDREN: Do not try this at home," as well as the use of Kirin beer to allow a person to actually see the Yokai (hmm , ... maybe that scene should have also contained this warning)! <br /> <br /> By the way, the director Takashi Miike is difficult to define stylistically, apart from saying that none of his stories that I have seen has seemed "normal". Some of his films are quite unpleasant and disturbing and I hated them (especially AUDITION and ICHI THE KILLER), while some of them are magical and are among the best movies I've seen (THE HAPPINESS OF THE KATAKURIS). One thing is for sure, it is difficult to see one of his films and not have a strong reaction in one way or another.
