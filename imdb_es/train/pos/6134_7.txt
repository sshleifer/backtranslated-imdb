Certain DVDs I have until I just have to go out and buy it. This was one of those movies. Like many here, I remember seeing him as a child and I loved it. I never knew there were scenes and musical numbers that were cut, so I was intrigued to see what they could be. I will agree that the sequence of "Portabellow Road" is now a little long (as in the football game), but apart from that, I found no qualms about the remaining scenes that were kept in their respectful place. Maybe Disney should have had the original version (which is the restored version) on one side with the version restored on the other side, then people could choose what they wanted to see. All in all, it is still an entertaining film that still manages to recover some of the memories of my childhood.
