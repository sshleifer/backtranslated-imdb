I'm glad that the users (as of this date) who liked this movie now show up. I do not understand people who did not like this movie, it seems that they were waiting for a serious treatment (?!?!?)! Come on, how the hell can you take the premise of a killer snowman seriously? The filmmakers knew that this was a silly premise, and they did not try to deny it. The direct delivery of scenes actually makes FUN! Yes, there are times when the low budget is shown (like the explosion scene), but I think an expensive look would have taken the fun out of the movie! So if you like B movies, and the ridiculous premise appeals to you, then you'll like "Jack Frost."
