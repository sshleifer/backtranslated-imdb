['To qualify this movie fairly, you must think about the genre it is supposed to be: for children. They had more guidelines to follow to make this film (which means that they could not get away with the humor and language of the 1st day). Take everything in this movie was fun and enjoyable to watch. The sequels usually make me nervous, however, this went pretty well for itself. Knowing he did not have the star power of Fraiser, George took advantage of the humor and I think Showeman did quite well as a leader. The plot is easy to follow and maybe camping sometimes adapts well to a younger audience, if you want to watch a movie and expect honors from the academy awards, it is not, but if you want to watch a simple, fun and full movie of energy You would make a good choice with this.']
