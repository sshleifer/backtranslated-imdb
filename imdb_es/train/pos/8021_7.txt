Muppet's third film is perhaps the most relaxed and enjoyable, as the gang brings their modest college musical to the bright (but volatile) Broadway lights filled with typically naive optimism. Of course, his first attempt fails and Kermit (group leader and program author) blows his top; therefore, all others go their separate ways so you do not have to feel responsible for them. Kermit himself befriends a young fashion designer who wants to make ends meet by serving food in his father's restaurant (the old man, then, has a line of particularly tortuous non-secuiturs!). We get regular appearances from a variety of stars: Art Carney (as a producer), James Coco (as the owner of a dog too enthusiastic), Dabney Coleman (as a trusted trickster), Elliott Gould (who was also in THE MUPPET MOVIE [ 1979]), Gregory Hines, Liza Minnelli (as herself, with her portrait in an elegant restaurant replaced by Kermit, sporting a fake mustache, like a businesswoman ostensibly famous in a trick to attract publicity to the Muppets' show), Brooke Shields , and even the director John Landis (possibly in the funniest scene of the film as a Broadway producer, before which appears Kermit acting as a street and chummy actor, and putting on hilarious shades and an afro wig). The other Muppets more or less go through their typical rhythms, with (unfortunately) less space given to Gonzo this time; while Miss Piggy is an acquired taste with me, the scenes in which the latter spies what she interprets as Kermit's romance with the waitress? And especially his violent reaction to this? They are undeniably fun. What disappoints, however, is the climactic show itself (after a fairly redundant middle section in which Kermit acquires amnesia and eventually acquires Madison Avenue publicity) that, instead of the flashy routines expected, it does not get anything else original that Kermit's wedding ceremony and his eternal flame miss piggy!
