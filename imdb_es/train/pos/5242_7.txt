I enjoyed this movie a lot for two reasons. The first is that it gives an idea of ​​the world of loyalty in Northern Ireland, which is rarely discussed in films, most of which tell us about the Republican struggle. The second reason is the performances of the actors. I thought that they offered very honest and convincing representations of a very sordid underworld that not many people listen to outside of my native coasts. <br /> <br /> In general, it is a funny gangster movie with stellar performances of a who is who. In the cast of Northern Irish actors. It will not move the earth, although it may slightly open the eyes of some people to the murky world of loyal paramilitaries.
