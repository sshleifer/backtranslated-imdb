This is without a doubt my favorite novel by Le Carre and it transforms into the silver screen with all the love and care one could wish for. I read a review on this site that seems to find the characters disgusting, but I think this is not the point. All the stories of Le Carre are essentially love stories and this is no exception. It is a precise reflection of the period in which it is established. Treason is everyone's key to the good of no one. Pym's education is so close to mine that I find it chilling to see her. Peter Egan is in his best role and the last lamented Ray McAnally is incredibly good. Even the smallest roles played by Andy de la Tour, Tim Healy and Jack Ellis are accurate. This cast is the dream of a theater impresario. The story should not be marred by an ill-informed description, but suffice it to say that it relates to the slow but inexorable destruction of a young man and the descent into espionage and betrayal. All my sympathies are with Magnus Pym and his only (non-sexual) love for Poppy (RÃ¼diger Weigang, as wonderful as ever, his only true friendship, but also by definition another in the long list of betrayals.) HIGHLIGHT! Rent it, buy it. love it.
