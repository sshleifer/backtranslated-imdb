I really liked this movie. It really intrigued me how Deanna and Alicia became friends in such a tragedy. Alicia was just a troubled soul and Deanna was so happy to see someone after being shot. My only complaint was that at first it was a bit slow and it took me a while to get to the bottom of things. Apart from that it was great.
