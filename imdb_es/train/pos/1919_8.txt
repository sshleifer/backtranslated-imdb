I have not read the book on which it was based / inspired. Being some of them (the others are movie roles) the latest work by John Ritter (RIP), one expects it to be hilarious. And it is. Almost every time he is present in this, in fact. The majority of the cast, both support and regular, plays well, and the material tends to be excellent. He plays Paul Hennessy, the father of three teenagers: Rory, the typical boy of that age, Kerry, the depressed middle child who fights for causes and conscience, and Bridget, the popular fashion-loving ditz. Sagal returns to be the female protagonist of a comedy, and her character is very far from Peggy Bundy. The show changed a bit after Mr. Three's Company passed away, and for a while, they did not seem to decide if they wanted to laugh, or be touching and make sure they were respectful. One may wonder how or why it lasted so long after that: it could still be pretty good, some of the additions were lucky (if you like David Spade, most of his part is that he makes his plan) and had things what to say. . My personal favorite episode is in last season. Humor is a good mix of "silly person" jokes (mainly related to high school students), nonsense, dark comedy and raw material. It was about sex and other adult themes, but never graphically. The language is soft and, at times, moderately strong. I recommend it to any fan of those who did it. 8/10
