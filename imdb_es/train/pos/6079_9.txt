Shakespeare's plays have a way of transcending time. The language somehow breaks the time barrier. but maybe it's the actors who really do that. <br /> <br /> After the disappointment of Romeo and Juliet (the version with Claire Danes and Leonardo DiCaprio), he was hesitant in another modern version of Shakespeare. To my surprise, Othello was great! <br /> <br /> Iago's character was played very well by Kenneth's partner! Even though Iago is really evil and despicable, the character was interpreted so well that he does what Shakespeare intended the character to be, a pleasure for the audience he hates. I have to say that Fishburne's performance here was also very good. <br /> <br /> I recommend it for Shakespeare scholars and lazy students (who refuse to read the book) equally.
