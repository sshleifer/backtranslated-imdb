What I liked most about this movie is that, like the Hitchcock films, it's a thriller that does not take itself too seriously. <br /> <br /> Hitchcock understood that people go to the movies to have a good time. Something that Hollywood seems to have forgotten in recent years. This is a thriller, but it has a lot of laughter and always has an eye looking at the camera. <br /> <br /> Rachel McAdams is wonderful as always. Cillian Murphy is more creepy than it was in Batman Begins. In the old days, there were guys who always played the bad guy. We do not see much of that these days because I suspect Hollywood agents consider it a bad career change, but Cillian Murphy is really good at being bad. <br /> <br /> The address has a surprising style. The story is good, but the dialogue could have improved. <br /> <br /> "Red Eye" is a very funny movie and people applauded when they started shooting the final credits. If you're in the mood for a fun escapist thriller, "Red Eye" could be your ticket.
