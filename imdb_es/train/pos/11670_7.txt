A featherweight plot and dubious characterizations do not make any difference when a movie is as fun to watch as it is. Lively action and spectacular acrobatics, for your day, give this movie a bit of real zip. And there is some real comedy about the chemistry of the two protagonists. Quinn is also a good villain, although his role is completely eclipsed. <br /> <br /> But do not be fooled by the hard and broad role of Maureen O'Hara, this is as sexist as any Hollywood movie of this era. You may be able to forgive that because of the time it was made, but it is still difficult to pass. Despite all the heroism and horribly adult situations off the screen, this is little more than a good time for teenagers.
