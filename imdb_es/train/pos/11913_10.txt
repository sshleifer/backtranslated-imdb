This is an excellent movie for women bodybuilders and action lovers! I think Sue Price did a great job in this movie series (Nemesis 2,3,4) and she proved to be a great fighter. It has a very striking appearance and an iron will to resist the powerful Nebula (Nemesis 2). Although it is not a high-value film and Sue Price's acting skills are not the best that have ever been found in my life, the film itself was incredible, a priceless gem for bodybuilders action fans! Well, some parts of Nemesis 2 have been copied by other famous science fiction movies, like Terminator or Predator, but that's not the point. The point is that A.Puyn played in that film a very talented bodybuilder who put all his energy and body talent to show us the best he can do. I really enjoyed that movie and saw with the same enthusiasm Nemesis 3 (a quite boring sequel) and Nemesis 4 (a sequel much more interesting than 3). What a pity that has not yet been seen on DVD :-(
