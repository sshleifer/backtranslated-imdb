Imagine turning off the lights of your remote farm on a cold night and then going to bed. There is no need to close the doors. The only sound is the wind whistling through the trees. Sometime after midnight, a car with lights off inches from the road. Moments later, an intruder lights a lantern in your dark living room. <br /> <br /> What makes this image so terrifying is the scenario: a remote farm ... at night. Based on Truman Capote's bestselling book, and with black and white lighting comparable to that of the best films of 1940, "In Cold Blood" presents a terrifying story, especially in that first act, as the plot unfolds mainly at night and in the country drenched in rain. roads. It is the stuff of nightmares. But this is not a dream. The events really happened, in 1959. <br /> <br /> Two scammers with delirious heads kill the entire Kansas family, looking for a stash of money that does not exist. Director Richard Brooks used the real places where real life events took place, including the farm ... and its interior! It is a memorable and fascinating film. <br /> <br /> Both main actors are very similar to the two real-life assassins. Robert Blake is more than convincing as Perry Smith, short and stocky with a bum, who dreams of finding the buried treasure of Cortez. Scott Wilson is almost as good as Dick Hickock, the soft-spoken swindler with a totally American smile. <br /> <br /> After their wave of killings, the duo heads to Mexico. Things go wrong there, so they return to the United States, steal cars, hitchhike and, in general, feel miserable when they wander from one place to another. But it is a life of fools, and the two outlaws soon repent of their actions. The last twenty minutes of the movie are fascinating, as the rain falls, the string tightens and all we hear is the beating of a beating heart. <br /> <br /> Even with his middle act, something mundane, "In cold blood." stages in fascinating details a real life story that still hypnotizes, almost half a century later. It is that scenario that does it. Do you think the people of rural Kansas still leave their doors open ... at night?
