The tit and the moon is a symbolic film of Spain. Everything in this film has a symbolic meaning. It is totally different from the usual movie that you have access to. <br /> <br /> This movie is good, but it will be good only for people who want to find the meaning of everything in the story of the movie. I must warn that this is not a sample movie.
