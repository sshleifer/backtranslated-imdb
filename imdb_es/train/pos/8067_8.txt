Today, if someone mentions the name of Victor McLaglen, the answer will probably be "Who?" or maybe "Why?" Well, believe it or not, Victor McLaglen won the Academy Award for Best Actor in this film, which is about a poor and desperate man who is willing to sell his best friend for "self-service" to the United States. It's an interesting movie that shows how low, even the most well-intentioned shnooks, will go for a few dollars. The film takes place in British-dominated Ireland and while all the other characters struggle directly or indirectly for the political independence of Ireland, all that worries Mr. McLaglen is getting money and getting drunk. The film makes one wonder if political activism is worthwhile, because while the activist is struggling to make a point, many others not only do not care, but do not even know what it is. The moral of this movie is: take care of the friend, maybe he will sell you for a penny.
