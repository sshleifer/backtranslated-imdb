This show is hilarious! The jokes are original, God and I love Eric and Kelso! Yes, I know what they say, after the eighth season it's not fun anymore because Eric and Kelso are no longer in the program, and Randy is a real idiot. Randy is, compared to Eric and Kelso. <br /> <br /> You can not take the funniest characters and change them for the kind of person I am "I'm a cool guy" (Randy). Anyway, it's not your fault, but the writers are trying to keep the eighth season fun, it still is, not as much as the previous seasons, but it's fine. <br /> <br /> The 360 ​​are awesome, the Circle, Red is a true kind of father who abuses the mind :) and Kitty is always half cake. Hyde tries to be cool all the time, he also has his moments. The less favored characters are Jackie and Donna. They are great, but not without Kelso and Eric. <br /> <br /> great show. Dumbass!
