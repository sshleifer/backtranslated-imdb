Those who love the book Jane Eyre like me (it's my favorite of all times, and I read it at least once a year) will love this version. Timothy Dalton is just a little too handsome to be Mr. Rochester, but other than that, he does a wonderful job of playing Thornfield's inveterate teacher. It's possible that Zelah Clarke was a bit too old to play Jane, 18, but when I watch this movie, I do not think about the ages of the characters. The dialogue of the film is taken almost literally from the book, which was very intelligent. Sure, this movie may seem a bit long, but it's the only version I've seen that includes the third part of the story. <br /> <br /> I wish the people who made this film were involved in the new Zeferelli. Version, since it would have helped that mess of a movie. <br /> <br /> I also noticed the last time I saw this video that Judy Cornwell plays "Aunt Reed"! She is so versatile that I did not recognize her. She plays Daisy in Keeping Up Appearances, and also played Mrs. Musgrove in Persuasion of 1995 (another wonderful adaptation). <br /> <br /> UPDATE: I got the DVD this week and it's wonderful to see the original version without editing. There is much more at the beginning (Young Jane in Gateshead and Lowood.) And in the end, they have restored many things, (I always wondered why St. John had a role in revealing that he knows who Jane is - because the part in which he pulled it from his painting was edited from the VHS version of the US Rosamund Oliver is in it ... was completely removed from the VHS. As far as I could see, had not edited any part of Timothy Dalton , so there's nothing new there, but it's great to see the full miniseries in its entirety after all these years of enjoying VHS, thanks, BBC (PS ... I would have paid more for a special edition DVD ... maybe with some interviews with the stars ... or a show)
