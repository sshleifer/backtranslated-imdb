I really thought they did an * excellent * job, there was nothing wrong with that, I do not know how the first commentator could have said that it was terrible, it moved me to tears (I guess it moved everyone to tears) but I try not to Crying in a movie because it's embarrassing, but it caught me. It was so good! I hope they release it on DVD because I will definitely buy a copy! I feel that it renewed my faith and gave me hope that I can not explain, it made me want to strive to be a better person, they went through a lot and I think we take that for granted. Compared to that, I feel that our own tests are nothing. Well, not nothing, but almost do not match what they had to go through. I loved. Who played Emma?
