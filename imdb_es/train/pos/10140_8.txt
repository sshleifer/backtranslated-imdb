Fans of the HBO series "Tales From the Crypt" will love this episode of MOH. Those who know the basic archetypal stories on which most of the classic EC comics were based will immediately recognize. <br /> <br /> Martin Donovan's favorite underdog favorite (also an excellent writer, co-author of THE SCREENS of ZERO APARTMENT and DEATH BECOMES IT.) He could play a very nice role if he does not get it right, or he can play the same paper with a dark undertone of corrosive perversity.In the case of RIGHT TO DIE, he adopts this last approach, and definitely works. <br /> <br /> Donovan is a doctor who recently had an affair with his office receptionist (Robin Sydney), much to the chagrin of her inconsolable and relentless spouse, Abbey (Julia Anderson), when the two got involved in a terrible car accident when they returned from an unsuccessful weekend of "recovery" and she burned horribly in a fire, he is reluctant to remove the plug, not without an enthusiastic push from his even more sordid lawyer and best friend (Corbin Bernsen, who looks worse from wear these days). <br /> <br /> But Abbe and he's never been able to surrender without fighting, and that's where the episode's EC theme appears. Horned husbands and wives have always been the favorite subject of the genre for some spooky supernatural scams (and OOKY), and this case is definitely no exception. In any case, the ratio of sex and gore must have Bill Gaines laughing with joy in his mausoleum somewhere. <br /> <br /> And that's not to mention that John Esposito's original script gives the angle of adultery a slight twist. You do not realize while you see that you only know half of the story, until near the end ... (think of WHAT WHILE BENEATH with more guts and gazongas, and you are there). <br /> <br /> It's not a bad effort, but it's not the best either. At least Rob Schmidt shows touches of style here and there with direction, especially in a scene that makes cell phone picture messages a truly horrible experience! As with most episodes of MOH, this is following a predominant theme in this season of skinning and dismemberment, so it is not necessary to apply the extremely delicate.
