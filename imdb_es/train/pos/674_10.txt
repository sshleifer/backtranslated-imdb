While for most people who watch the movie, this will be of little interest, but out of the many hundreds of films that deal with magic and the occult in one way or another, this is probably the best in many ways. <br /> <From The Golem to The Craft, the subject seems to be of interminable interest to the film industry. Most of the films that play it in some way do it in a childish way (for example, "Witchboard", a real piece of garbage in every way) either taking the transcendental elements as cheap excuses for special effects with cheese or villians cut out of cardboard (cf "Brujo"). More often, the issue arises in a hysterical religious context (in the various Revelation-oriented films, the antichrist is inevitably an advocate of some kind of new-age style practice). Rarely, a film seems to show at least some passing experience with magic as practiced in real life, but the presentation of the occult in such films can, at best, be described as allegorical and not literal, symbolic, or ... just not quite right. <br /> <br /> I went back to see this movie after many years tonight. I had seen it before on VHS; It's a dark piece, in a bad mood, and after watching it on DVD, I'd say if you have any intention of watching this movie, watch it on DVD, do not watch it on VHS. <br /> <br /> The darkness and the bad mood are overwhelming in VHS but in DVD the film takes a very different tone. I think Weir pushed the dark aspects intentionally like that, but when the film is converted to the lower color medium of VHS, this goes beyond the limit. The DVD comes back to life and I saw it in a different way. <br /> <br /> Anyway, looking at it like it was the first time, I realized that the treatment of magic is extremely good in this movie. It's hard to get into all the reasons why I do not mind taking the time to do it. <br /> <br /> For anyone who is curious, anyway, if you want to see what real life is like. , this movie is very correct in innumerable levels. <br /> <br /> And for anyone who is not, you really wasted a lot of time reading up to this point.
