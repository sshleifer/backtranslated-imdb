It is a pity that, due to its title, this film is avoided by people who hate football. Bend it Like Beckham is much more than a cheesy sports movie. The story line is moving and intelligent without being numb, the jokes laughed and the characters are well acted Parminder Nagra and Keira Knightley are great when teenagers Jess and Jules perform great performances both on and off the field. Anupam Kher is wonderful as the worried father of Jess, and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, who was incredibly evil in 'Ride with the Devil', is presented as well as the good guy for once, making full use of his magnificent Irish accent ! Even if you do not like soccer, go see this movie. In any case it will make you smile.
