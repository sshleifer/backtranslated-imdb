Anyone who has lived through the ages of Revenge of the Nerds and Girlpower will appreciate this movie. It's one of those movies that offers everything you want in a "spring break movie" PLUS that makes fun of the college film genre. It's funny, it has a cast to die for (Amy Pohler, Rachel Dratch, Sophie Monk, Parker Posey, Jane Lynch, writer and actress Rachel Dratch is a comic book genius, and Sophie Monk is a great villain. ! MY GOD! (I'm just repeating myself now ...) He will live with girls who like Miranda July, but who want to eat ice cream and pretend they are stupid.
