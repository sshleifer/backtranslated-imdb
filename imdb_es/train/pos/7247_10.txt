Robert Jannuci, Luca Venantini, Venantino Venantini, Alicia Moro (two stars are from CITY OF THE LIVING LADING) (I wonder what Luca is doing these days, probably a lawyer or something like Bela Lugosi Jr. or David Hennessey, a child of dark shadows, who wants to forget that there were dark shadows). Anyway, in the video of Thorn EMI there is no music in the first credits ... but the music is excellent once it enters ... with the Italian films the movies are not as good as the music ... my favorite scene is with the boy with the arm of the robot that follows Alien-Alien through the desert. Alien says why you are following me. Tommy responds because I feel like it ... Alien answers where you're going, Tommy West says that Alien says good, I'm going east. So, after a while of walking, the subject that touches the bottom Alien looks up and sees Tommy sitting on a rock caressing a pet hamster ... Tommy looks up and says to Alien, what took you So much time ... I love this movie ... It moves my heart. The boy with the robotic arm needs a dad and Allen is recruited to be Tommy's dad in the desert. . . Oh yes, they also need water. . . It's NOT THE WAY WARRIOR (MAD MAX 2) by any means, but a silly western / post nuke movie with a guy with a robot arm and Alien and Trash and some other good guys with a bad girl with an iron claw and CRAZY BULL looking. as Wez on the warrior path. . On Sunday afternoons on channel 57 (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) after church, I would come home and find this. . . often . . . very often Love him. 10/10
