['This was a really great movie. It only goes to show that you do not need silly things like continuity and scripts to make a movie. It crosses the continents in seconds, people are shot and nothing happens, swords catch fire, samuari fight against the sinking galleons, David Essex is the epitome of sleazy villainy and John Rhys Davies is the type. I enjoyed this movie but I like movies s ** t, this is the perfect example of a very s ** t movie that only KICKS ASS. If you like Battlefield Earth, you will love this movie, it&#39;s a braggart, it&#39;s fast, it&#39;s silly, it&#39;s samuaraitastic !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /><br /> It also looks like it was made in 1972.']
