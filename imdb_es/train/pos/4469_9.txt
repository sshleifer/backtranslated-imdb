['Usually, musicals in the 1940s were of an established formula, and if they studied movies, they know what I&#39;m talking about, a certain duration, very &quot;flashy&quot; performances that were great on the surface but never reached the real personalities of the series. characters etc. <br /><br /> THIS IS DIFFERENT - and light years better and well worth his nomination to the best photo of the year - 1945 (although he had no chance to beat the final winner - Lost weekend). <br /><br /> Gene Kelly was probably in the best shape of his career, yes, I know &quot;American in Paris&quot; and &quot;Singing in the Rain&quot;. This is different. He really gets into his character of a &quot;sea wolf&quot; thinking (at first) that &quot;pick up any girl while on leave&quot; is nothing more than a joke. And if you had to invent a &quot;story&quot; to get it, so be it, until. Something like the Man of Music when his foot is &quot;attacked at the door&quot;. The eventual hilarity of the film comes mainly from his and his new friend&#39;s (Sinatra) attempt to make &quot;history&quot; good for &quot;getting the girl&quot; from which he REALLY fell in love unexpectedly. You&#39;ll have to watch the movie to see what I mean. <br /><br /> Besides that there are many other elements of a great movie in this one, it&#39;s a classic story of friends, nostalgia for a time when World War II was almost over (the war ended about a month after the movies were released), a Understanding that a guy who always laughs at life can discover that he really is a great human being, great songs and probably some other elements of the making of classic movies that I can not think of at the moment. <br /><br /> Why not a 10? Near the end: almost 2 1/2 hours starts to feel a little long. There is a small number of ballet that Gene Kelly does that must have been a sensation in 1945, but it seems outdated and it seems that it only adds minutes now. But in general, this is a definite winner at all levels.']
