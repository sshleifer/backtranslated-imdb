Even at the beginning of his career, Capra was quite successful with his camera work and synchronization. This is a thin story, and quite predictable at times, but it gets very good interpretations of its cast and has some quite complex camera movements that involve the viewer intimately. The first part looks like a Cinderella story, although anyone with intelligence can see that the bottom will fall out of that, the rich "prince" will lose his fortune. <br /> <br /> However, because of its good distribution and at a rapid pace, it is easy to get caught up in clich√©s. Then the film becomes more original, since the married couple has to find a way to make a living. The end is very predictable but satisfying. I also want to congratulate the written title: very ingenious and fun.
