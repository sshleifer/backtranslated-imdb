This is the second short of Baby Burlesk to be released, and probably the most popular, is a parody of the 1926 silent film What Price Glory. <br /> <br /> I saw it and I do not understand child pornography. that is being claimed It's just a cute little movie. I have seen family programs that I grew up seeing in the 80s and 90s that had the girls dressed in a more provocative way acting in a "mature" way. It was more provocative because they did not dress in diapers. There's nothing provocative in a diaper unless you have one of those fetishes. (just a joke) I read that description of the movie and where it says that only a pedophile would enjoy watching this. That he is sick For me, if you look at this and it bothers you, then maybe you should look at your own psyche and try to find out why it bothers you. It's an innocent movie that was made as a parody of another movie. All the films of B.B. they were parodies, nothing more. The parodies / parodies of today are graphic in nature and have almost pornographic scenes and a rather vile language. Should not they be more frightening? I can see them without problems, but sometimes they take stories of children and turn them into filth in those parodies. That is what should be put under your skin. Not that they have babificado (not a word, I know) a film for adults of 1926, because we know how PORNOGRAPHY were those silent movies, huh? Not to mention those films from the time of 'Forbidden Hollywood Pre-Code' so vile and dirty. Would they NEVER make such dirt today? (note the sarcasm)
