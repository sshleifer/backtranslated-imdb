Young Mr. Lincoln is a beautiful and poetic film that captures the myth of one of the most revered figures in the history of the United States. Henry Fonda had the difficult task of portraying a mythical figure and at the same time making it human enough for people to worry about. It is perhaps the best performance of the actors. Observe how he solitably stops a band of lynchings. Alice Brady is fantastic in the role of a simple farmer. Most of the last part of the film takes place in a courtroom, and there's the only part. The negative thing I can say about this movie. Most of the characters, from judges to spectators, are given so many lines of humor that they distract from the serious test that is at hand. But I'm used to this because humor is a trademark of Ford. . The support parts of Ward Bond and Donald Meek are very good.
