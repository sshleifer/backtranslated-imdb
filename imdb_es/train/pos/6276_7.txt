Weak, fast and colorful, this is Valvoline's film, in fact, you can always see this oil mark in many scenes. The real protagonists are the cars, weak performances of Cage and Duvall. An intricate Angelina Jolie is an unlikely mechanic. For the lovers of the dream car (LAMBORGHINI and FERRARI above all).
