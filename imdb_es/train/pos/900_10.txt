This is one of the best Bollywood movies I've seen so far. Family and friends feel the same about it. This movie is really romantic and dramatic at the same time. In my opinion, we need more movies or films like this to keep the culture of South Asia alive. Shahid Kapoor and Amrita Rao acted extremely well in this, also their partner attracts many people to the movies. This is a movie that must be seen, it is a family and romantic movie. This film is also from the creators of Hum Saath Saath Hain and Hum Apke Hain Kon. This movie is your best moment right now ... the scenery of the movie was beautiful, which is also a great attraction. This movie should be seen ... recommended for everyone!
