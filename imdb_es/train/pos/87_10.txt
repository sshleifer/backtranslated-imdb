This short film winner of the Academy Award can be among the largest in the genre. Said without any dialogue, it is a visual gift about a child who buys a golden fish, places it in a container and then goes to school, leaving the goldfish unprotected and a window open without care. After a while, an orange tabby cat approaches, enters through the window and slowly goes to the bowl. The fish apparently knows that something is happening and gets very excited. When the cat gets too close to the bowl, the fish jumps. The cat catches the fish, drops it back into the bowl and goes out the window into which it entered just as the child, without knowing what has happened, returns. This was incredibly filmed with real animals; How Cousteau managed to make these animals behave in this way is remarkable. I hope this movie is available now for people to see it; I only saw it once, in 1959, when it was originally launched, but it has remained unforgettable.
