['Forbidden Planet qualifies as a milestone in science fiction, staying carefully within the &quot;hard&quot; aspects of the genre (science, not fantasy, nerds will love it) while playing with images and ideas of the contemporary values of the fifties. The isolated house of Morbius is a model of modern design with open spaces that go into sculpted gardens, a swimming pool and the latest in home appliances for the home: Robby, the robot. &quot;The dream of a housewife!&quot; exclaims the captain after lunch and a demonstration of the robot&#39;s ability to synthesize food and disintegrate waste. <br /><br /> He also revealed to the 1950s: the Fruebian psychology pokes its head in the explanation of Id, although Morbius dismisses it as an obsolete concept. There is a touch of the drama of the Pacific War in the battle with the invisible monster and the life on board the cymbal. Perhaps the most opportune thing is the postatomic fear that science is the enemy, and arrogant scientists will unknowingly reduce destruction in their blind search for knowledge. <br /><br /> However, the suburban drama presented by Forbidden Planet seems exceptionally new in the genre of science fiction. They are not braggarts or heroes, but common sailors who cross the galaxy with the rawness and honesty of a soldier. The good ones handle the flying saucer, and the aliens have gone so far that we do not even know what they looked like, although their music, for example, the &quot;atmospheric tonalities&quot; of Bebe and Louis Barron, are remarkably futuristic today. The views from the house of Morbius are really strange with irregular cliffs and pink bonsai. The inside of the cymbal is just this side of Buck Rogers. There&#39;s a lot to like visually. Although we have fantastic monsters and robots for children, Forbidden Planet is a brain movie, slow pace and very talented. He is working on many levels at the same time: hard science fiction against spatial adventure, philosophical against domestic. <br /><br /> There are many suburban touches. Despite all their spatial talk, the soldiers dress up for the golf course. The fatal discovery of Morbius is a humble educational facility, a school. The most interesting character is the daughter of Morbius, Altaira. Having never seen a man, she addresses the crew without shame. She is a post-Madonna teenager who designs her own space age clothes and takes every opportunity to change clothes. Imagine Christina Aguilera with a home replicator. The men who see the film can see her as a naive girl in a minidress, but all women know that there is no such thing as a naive girl in a minidress. Anne Francis deserves a better recognition for humiliating the Leut with kisses. We will never know if she was &quot;working&quot; as he suspects, since the Captain interrupts and becomes a more interesting target for his attention. She is the character that makes the important change in the movie. Surprised that her father compares Doc. Muerto with the other &quot;embeciles&quot; in her landing group, she moves away from her father, from her home, to go with the sailors to Earth. It is this act of defiance, of maturity, that sends the creature Id of Morbius to the limit, allegorically destroying its creator as it did thousands of centuries before the Krell. <br /><br /> Maybe the Krell had teenage daughters too ...?']
