I really liked that movie! I'm a true Tom Hanks fan, and I've always been impressed with all his work. From his most dramatic roles as Cast Away, The Green Mile, Saving Private Ryan, Forrest Gump, Apollo 13 and Philadelphia. To your fun roles like The League of yours, Turner and Hooch, Catch Me If You Can, The Lady Killers, Big &, of course, Toy Story. But in this movie, Hanks is not the only great actor who lights the screen. Tyler Hoechlin, a promising star who is very promising in Hollywood, plays Hanks as the son of Hanks and offers nothing less than a great performance. Certainly, he is someone to take care of throughout his career, I think he will do great things. Paul Newman as always offers a brilliant screen performance. He is truly a legend. We can not forget the people who did not have such important roles in the film, but who still helped make it great. The beautiful and very talented Jennifer Jason Leigh, who will play Bastard Out of Carolina and Single White Female I will never forget, brings her grace to the screen as Hank's wife in the film and does an excellent job. Liam Aiken is another treasure found in the movie. He does a great job with such a small role, and like his roles in Lemony Snickets, and Sweet November, and I Dreamed Of Africa, he gives a great performance.
