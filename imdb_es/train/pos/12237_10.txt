Mating Game is a lovely and wonderful movie from a bygone era. Hollywood needs to consider a charming remake of this movie. My wife and I were going to see him. <br /> <br /> It's an excellent romantic comedy that my wife and I saw at AMC. <br /> <br /> This movie has Tony Randall at his best. Debbie Reynolds is great, as always. <br /> <br /> I loved it. We plan to order DVDs to add to our growing collection of movies. <br /> <br /> It's a pity that Hollywood no longer makes movies like this one. <br /> <br /> Hey Hollywood ... it's time to extract some of these types of scripts from the old safe, update them a bit (without spoiling the movie and the original script as you have done with other remakes) and make a casting call <br /> <br /> A remake would be a great success on the silver screen, DVD and cable / SATTV. <br /> <br /> SN Austin, TX
