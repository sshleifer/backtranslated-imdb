Here at IMDb.com I read an opinion, that Gray Owl is the best character of Pierce Brosnan that has been presented. I do not know if he had better or worse roles, I'm not his fan, but this was really exceptional. <br /> <br /> The other thing: the impressive hand of the film director. I give you my respect The serenity, the beauty and the spirit of the wild life were illustrated in an exclusive way, I had never seen it so closely in any film before. <br /> <br /> Another thing that remained in my mind after the movie: this is the movie, closest to the original books, and the atmosphere in it. <br /> <br /> And a little more. I pay my respects to the original Gray Owl.
