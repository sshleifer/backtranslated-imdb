The emotional powers and characters of Dominick and Eugene are the things that Hollywood no longer does. This is one of the most emotional, sensitive and sincere movies I've seen! Roy Liotta, Tom Hulce and supporting actress Jamie Lee Curtis, offer Oscar-winning performances! There are not enough words to express how big this movie is. Of course, people who do not like sentimental films will not care as much as all of us about Dominick and Eugene, but for the rest of us, this film goes directly to the heart and the only one of compassion and humanity. You will never forget this movie, NEVER! <br /> <br /> ***** SPEAKERS BELOW ***** <br /> <br /> The simple but eloquent story is told with expertise. Eugene is a medical intern who faces long hours and a demanding workload in the hospital. His fraternal twin brother Dominick (born 12 minutes earlier) is a bit slow and uncomfortable due to brain damage due to a victim of abuse by his father. (A heartbreaking moment when this is discovered in the movie that will leave you crying!) Eugene (a.k.a "Geno") faces a painful dilemma. He must decide whether to finish medical school, which would mean accepting his residence in another city and leaving Dominick behind (a.k.a "Nicky"), or losing the rest of his education to take care of him. Nicky helps pay tuition for his brother's medical school working as a garbage collector. <br /> <br /> The questions of ethics, morals and responsibilities are masterly mixed in this historical film. Just when Gino thinks that Nicky could be progressing toward independence, Dominick turns around and ends up doing things like helping a drug dealer or trying to use a faulty cable he finds in the dumpster of an electrical appliance. <br /> Larry, is "The Character" and Nicky's partner on his garbage collection route that fills Dominick's naive head with all sorts of stories like Geno and Jennifer (his girlfriend, whom he is teaching Clinical Pharmacology) going to Atlantic City and betting. All your money. But deep down, you can see that Larry cares about him. In his rounds, Nicky also befriends a little boy, whom we discover was also beaten by his father. A final result is also tragic and the pain you see in Nicky's face when it happens, says a lot. <br /> <br /> The sensitivity that the two brothers share with each other can not be exaggerated enough. All Nicky wants to do is be loved and seek acceptance in any way he can. (That is, he goes to church, loves Hulk Hogan) Geno loves Nicky more than anything in the world. But can his brother be independent enough that Geno can fulfill his dream of becoming a doctor? A brilliant film that should have gained much more recognition than it deserved, but unfortunately it came out almost at the same time as Rain Man, who was dealing with a similar subject. However, I like Dominick and Eugene more because it has a much stronger emotional component. Keep in mind that this film is aimed directly at the tear ducts, so have Kleenex at hand! What movie!
