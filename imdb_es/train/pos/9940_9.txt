This animated television series is simply the best way for children to learn how the human body works. Yes, this is biology but they will never say it. <br /> <br /> I really believe that this is the best part of this flow of "educational cartoons". I remember that you can find small books and a plastic body in several parts: skin, skeleton and, of course, organs. <br /> <br /> In the same sequence, you will find: "Il était une fois l 'homme", which relates the human history of the big bang with the twentieth century. There is also: "Il était une fois l'espace" (about space and its exploration), but that is more a fiction than a description of reality, since it takes place in the future.
