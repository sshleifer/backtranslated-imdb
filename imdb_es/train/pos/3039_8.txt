Frank McCarthy, who produced the biographical film Patton, winner of the Academy Award, follows with a strong tribute to another of the US combat generals, Douglas MacArthur. Gregory Peck gives a strong characterization of man, his genius and his selfishness. With MacArthur you never knew where they started and the other stopped and many times mixed. <br /> <br /> The whole story of Douglas MacArthur would be a six-hour movie or a television miniseries. He would cover it from his days at border posts with his family to his time at West Point, where he still has the highest academic average achieved by a cadet. He would speak of his service in the Philippines as a young officer, his legend building bravery on the battlefields of World War I in France. He would also have to say that he shot the veterans of the Bonus Marchers of World War I in 1932, which probably means a great possibility for President Herbert Hoover to be re-elected. During the last years of MacArthur, he and Hoover had suites in the attic at the Waldorf Astoria in New York City. That must have been a subject they avoided. <br /> <br /> This movie focuses on the years 1941 to 1952 and is told in flashback. The film begins with MacArthur addressing the student body in 1962. While speaking the words of the famous Duty Honor Country speech, MacArthur's mind goes back to World War II and his desperate struggle against the advance of the Japanese on the island of Corregidor and the fields of Bataan in luzon. The film takes him through his struggle to regain the Philippines, the occupation of Japan and the first 18 months that culminated in his relay under President Truman. <br /> <br /> MacArthur as a movie would not work at all if it was not for the performances of Dan O'Herlihy and Ed Flanders as Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman respectively. It's the part of the movie that I enjoyed the most, seeing MacArthur and his relationships with these two men. <br /> <br /> FDR of O'Herlihy captures the aristocratic squire and the exceptionally evil man who was our 32nd President. Roosevelt was a man who understood his views with unusual subtlety and intelligence. Sometimes he liked to flirt too much for his own good, but he was the main politician of the last century. Notice how he treats MacArthur as commander of the battlefield and potential rival at the same time. <br /> <br /> Truman for Flanders is how people remember him, a frank man of people who did not like MacArthur's arrogance of the gitgo. Of course, it's in the history books how Truman relieved MacArthur in 1951 for insubordination. MacArthur was insubordinate, no doubt. <br /> <br /> However, I was able to write an entire thesis about Truman-MacArthur relationships. On the way there is no need to have reached a crisis. I always felt that FDR would have handled the whole thing in a much better way if he had been president at that time. <br /> <br /> MacArthur was also very eloquent and Gregory Peck captures some of that eloquence in some of them. The prayers that made him a legend and victories on the battlefield. Listen to Peck in the Japanese surrender, in the farewell of MacArthur of the nation before the joint session of the Congress and, of course, in his speech to the cadets in 1962. Watch the news and see if you do not agree.
