It's time for Hollywood to sit down and take notice! If the actors are acting presumptuously, all you need to do is get the animators who worked on this little marvel. The Renaissance is probably the first animated film that makes you forget that you are not seeing human beings. Although the voices in off of the cast (Craig, McCormack, Pryce, etc.) are some of the best that I have heard, but even then the emotions represented by the "cartoons" are disconcerting. <br /> <br /> This style of animation is not very new, but the use of lights and shadows makes the film a living painting. Ironically, that technical magic makes you forget that this is really a beautiful movie. The rhythm and the development of the plot are wonderful and the dialogues are clear. <br /> <br /> Argument: the disappearance of an important employee of a mega corporation unravels a story of deceit and corruption with a cold-hearted hero at the helm. I can not say much without giving it away ... except that while the movie keeps you on the edge of your seat, the climax leaves you speechless. <br /> <br /> A must see ... even for the 'adults who smile at the' cartoons'
