Okay, first I hate to comment on this but I felt that I had to defend this movie. So many people were criticizing him and I felt that people who wanted to see him should get a second opinion. <br /> <br /> First, Bend It Like Beckham is not meant to be the deepest film in the world. century. If that is what you are looking for, go elsewhere. The fact that it is an independent film does not mean that it has to be artistic. It's supposed to make you feel good and you should have fun watching it and those two things are easily achieved. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the performance, even if it is not "Halle Berry in the Monsters Ball", is still good. The film does not need to act like that honestly, so do not look for it. It is a family movie. If that's what you wanted, you should not or should not watch this movie honestly. <br /> <br /> Finally, it has a very nice story. I think it's well thought out and it's entertaining to watch. It is also very faithful to life for the most part for that culture, so if you want to sit down and watch a movie you can enjoy it and feel good when you are finished. If you are looking for something with well thought out plot lines and great dramatic scenes, this is not for you. <br /> <br /> -Lyndsay
