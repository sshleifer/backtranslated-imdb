This film moved me deeply in many ways. First of all, I just want to say that Clara Lago was the most precious thing. Such a beautiful girl. Her performance was excellent too. Faithful to life and very human. Although I do not like the part where I had to smoke; I hope it was just a false support. Either way, she was absolutely wonderful and the story was very moving. I found myself immersed in the story and its character. <br /> <br /> It's quite interesting how I came to discover this movie in reality. I was walking in a box office success and I noticed his cute smile on the cover as he walked. Luckily, I looked in the downward direction that this movie was in. I thought to myself, 'Awe, look at it!' So I picked it up and saw that this movie was described as such wonderful things as "A little gem". I read the plot in the back and then I thought that, well, maybe I would look it up first in IMDb and then I would go back and rent it later. I'm glad I did not, because I certainly would have missed it. After looking for a movie with my friend, I knew that I would end up regretting not having rented this movie, so I went back to the place where I originally found it and placed it. <br /> <br /> I had been in my dressing room for a week, since the school started for me this week and I really did not have time to see it, but tonight was the perfect opportunity. I placed it and I got hooked on the beautiful cinematography, a lovely score and a moving plot from start to finish. I was so enthralled and I must say that some parts almost moved me to tears. <br /> <br /> I would also like to make a special mention for the young man in this film, Juan Jos√© Ballesta. It was remarkable. Also the actor who played Carol's father, whose name unfortunately does not appear on the site. His voice was so loving and gentle that he could really feel his love for Carol. Even though his appearance is not prominent, I really felt the presence of his character. <br /> <br /> This is truly a wonderful movie. If you are a person moved by light, but with emotional movies, then this is definitely one for you.
