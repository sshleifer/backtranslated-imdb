and possibly closer to the Dickens story line. Although the young Ebenezer is hard for me to see (whose idea of ​​vintage hair was it, they could have done better than that!) Scott does an amazing job as Scrooge. His delivery of some of Dickens' lines finally gave me life. Edward Woodward is everything we expect and more of the Christmas Ghost gift. Encounter to G.C. Scott's Scrooge is much more believable than the most current version made by Patrick Stewart. The Christmas morning scene, when Scrooge realizes he has not been lost, is enough to convince one that Scott knows how to act instead of acting in an exaggerated way. He is phenomenal here. Almost the entire cast is incredible. The Tiny Tim in this version of The Christmas Carol is a bit hard to see, almost too sweet. Still, music and scenery make this a must-see every holiday Enjoy!
