Armageddon PPV <br /> <br /> The latest PPV of 2006 <br /> <br /> Smackdown brand. <br /> <br /> match results below ******** <br /> <br /> We are starting the show with the match Inferno. Kane v. MVP This was a good match. No wrestling here. This was about the visuals. In general, this was not bad. There were some nearby places here with Kane getting too close to the fire, but in the end, Kane won with the release of MVP to the fire first. <br /> <br /> Nice opener. Let's continue. <br /> <br /> Teddy Long announces a new match for the team titles: London and Kendrick will defend against: Regal and Taylor, The Hardyz and MNM IN A LADDER MATCH !!!! Let's move! <br /> <br /> Combine two: Four-level fatal combat. This was a total carnage. Judging by three of the four teams here, you would expect chaos. The stains were incredible. A total spot-fest. One point Jeff went for Poetry in Motion and London moved and Jeff climbed the ladder! Soon after, Jeff is sitting on the top rope with two ladders nearby, since MNM was going to kill Jeff, Matt makes the rescue and Jeff hits the "see-saw" shot to Joey Mercury. Mercury is hurt. His eye closes quickly and breaks open hard way. Mercury is taken out of the game and Nitro is still there. He will fight only for the titles! Regal and Taylor then grab London and numb him face to face on the stairs! Jeff goes up the ladder and Nitro in a murderous place, goes through the ladder to nail Jeff! Amazing! In the end, London and Kendrick retain the tag team titles. What a match! <br /> <br /> This was crazy. I can not understand why WWE did not announce this until now. The Buyrate would increase enormously. However, I am sure that the value of the repetition will be good. <br /> <br /> Mercury has suffered a broken nose and lacerations in the eyes. He is in the hospital now. Recover, child. <br /> <br /> No way, nothing else here will overcome that. <br /> <br /> Next: The Miz v. Boogeyman (Ugh) This was not compatible. Will the Boogeyman ever fight? Miz stinks too. After a crazy crowd, this kills them dead. DUD. <br /> <br /> Chris Benoit v. Chavo This was a strong match. I liked it a lot. Chavo hit a murderous superplex in a moment! Benoit hit EIGHT German suplexes too! Benoit wins with the shooter. Good things. <br /> <br /> Helms v. Championship for the cruiserweight title of Yang. This was a good match. Unfortunately, the stupid fans did not care about this. WHY? Helms and Yang are very talented and fought well. I agree with JBL. He got angry with the crowd. JBL is 100% correct. Learn to appreciate this or leave. <br /> <br /> Mr. Kennedy v. The Undertaker-Last Ride match. Not too much here. This was a slug festival, with some exceptions. Kennedy at one point threw Taker from the top of the stage to the floor. The place was fine. The reaction was disappointing. The final point was Taker, he killed Kennedy in the car and won the game. Unreal. Kennedy needed this victory. Both work hard. Even so, Kennedy needed this victory. Undertaker should have lost. The creativity was ruined again. <br /> <br /> The following is a stupid diva. I like women. No this. At least Torrie was not here. That is refreshing. Judging from the crowd, Layla should have won. The WWE wanted Ashley. Consider this your rest in the bathroom. Following. <br /> <br /> Main Event: Dinner & Batista v. Finlay & Booker T. This was also a game of nothing. The focus was Cena v. Finlay and Batista v. Booker. Batista and Booker can not work well together. Finlay tries to make Cena look good. The finish was failed. Finlay hit Batista's knee with a chair stroke and Batista did not sell the shot and finished the game. Lame. It is not the caliber of the main event at all. <br /> <br /> In general, Armageddon would have scored less, but the ladder was the main event here. That was worth enough money there. Some others were solid. <br /> <br /> The last word: a good PPV with the ladder game is the savior. Smackdown is not a bad show, it just is not convincing enough. Smackdown has to stop letting Cena move on. Let Smackdown stand on its own two legs. This show proves that Smackdown can.
