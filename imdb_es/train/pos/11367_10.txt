Caution: it may contain spoilers ... <br /> <br /> I have seen this movie 3 times and I have always liked it. When I see him again, he always reminds me how good he is. A HBO TV movie, very well made like most of his films, would get Oscars for their performances if it had been released for general distribution instead of for TV. <br /> <br /> As I'm sure Someone knows from reading other reviews here, this is the story of the serial killer, Andrei Chikatilo. He killed 56 people for 8 years in the former Soviet Union. (3 victims were buried and could not be found, so he was only convicted for 52 of 53 of his murders). The story actually focuses more on the forensic analyst, Victor Burakov played to perfection by Stephen Rea. A man who becomes tortured and obsessed with finding this killer despite the additional obstacles placed by the pirates, his part is essential to be sure. There is a very moving scene towards the end of the film that mentions how in the United States, investigators routinely withdraw from cases of serial killers after 18 months, whether they want to or not, due to mental strain and frustration. According to this account, Burakov worked for more than 5 years before getting his first break. He followed the case to its conclusion, 3 years later. In this scene, his superior, General Fetisov, played by Donald Sutherland, actually tells him that he admires his dedication and apologizes for not knowing that he should have given him a break before. <br /> <br /> Rea's performance is very good done, he does not exaggerate, he does not chew the landscape or do anything that distracts him from his representation of a man who is determined to find his murderer. He is a passionate man, but he does not show it in the same way it is presented in detective films. Only occasionally does he rage after enduring in silence more than most could withstand in such circumstances. Rea does so much with her face, her eyes, that she does not need to exaggerate. He simply * is *: his character, so frustrated after so much time, at one point, motivated by frustration, says he would prefer to find 3 at the same time as nothing in a year. Of course, what he wants to say is not that he wants more people to die, he just wants some clues to catch this man. Rea makes us feel for this man. It makes us understand, but only a glimpse of what it is to live with such horror and uselessness. <br /> <br /> A mutant, without a doubt, the childhood of Chikatilo was the one that produces such "monsters". The character of Chikatilo is very well done by Jeffrey DeMunn. Somehow (although it seems impossible) it causes a little sympathy for itself. Maybe it's the worst of us that has gone terribly wrong? Either way, his performance is very well done. <br /> <br /> Donald Sutherland as Colonel Fetisov (later promoted to General) also does a great job. He begins by looking like a cynical world official who does not seem to be much more interested in helping the investigation than anyone else who blocks Burakov. But eventually he becomes more than just an assistant, he actually participates actively in helping Burakov. There is also a very nice twist of Max Von Sydow, as the psychiatrist hired to help profile and determine what kind of deviant they are looking for. <br /> <br /> Although this film is about a morbid, grotesque and violent person. history, it's really more about what it takes to catch a murderer than the murderer himself. Around a very well made movie with good performances and a great script. The script manages to do what makes the best of this type of film: it offers concrete events and places them in a meaningful way within a dramatic framework that makes you feel that you know the people behind the events. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10 stars
