Stage adaptations often have a major flaw. They often come out as if a movie camera simply stood on the stage (like "Night Mother"). The direction of Sidney Lumet keeps the film alive, which is especially difficult since the image did not offer any real challenge. Still, it's good to look for what it is. The chemistry between Michael Caine and Christopher Reeve is quite brilliant. The dynamics of their relationship are amazing. Caine is fantastic as always, and Reeve has one of his few opportunities to really act. <br /> <br /> I confess that I have never seen the work of Ira Levin, but I heard that Jay Presson Allen's adaptation is faithful. The script is incredibly complicated, and it keeps you guessing. "Deathtrap" is a hugely entertaining movie and is recommended for almost all fans of the stage and the screen. <br /> <br /> 7.4 out of 10
