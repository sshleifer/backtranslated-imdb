For those of you who do not make that reference, clubberin had 4 fists in one body ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, in the review. <br /> <br /> I miss the WCW on Saturday night. Some of my favorite moments of struggle took place in this scenario. I remember seeing Stunning Steve Austin, Rick Rude, Brian Pillman, Cactus Jack, Dustin Rhodes, Johnny B. Badd, DDP on his workdays, Lord Steven Regal, Harlem Heat, Ricky Steamboat, STING ... He would be here while we list everyone . The point is WCW had an impressive list in the days before Hogan and they were producing entertaining television. Dusty Rhodes in his comments in his later years gave me a completely new reason to see when I started smoking marijuana as a teenager ... I really wish Vince would put him in the microphone for a show or two, maybe in the next Great American Bash? They CLUBBERIN! Here comes DA PLUNDA! It was great. <br /> <br /> -DirrTia
