EA has shown us that they can create a classic 007 agent and make you feel in the world of the 60s. The graphics of the game are exceptional and also the voice recording is very professional. I got this game in April 2007 (two years after launch), and I'm still impressed with the game. It's a shame that EA no longer plays 007. <br /> <br /> I give this game 10/10 for the levels it contains, especially the "consulate" level. I would recommend this game to anyone from 13 years old. The only thing I did not like in the game is the level of Russian ship, it was too much pressure. In general I like the game a lot!
