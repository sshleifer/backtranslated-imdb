I am ashamed to say that I missed "La Madre" when I was in theaters. I saw it on DVD tonight. I gave him a vote of 10, one of the few that I have given here. This independent English is filmed with such care and quality. It attracted me relentlessly. The story, discreet and purely human, is brutally honest and completely absorbing, thanks to the performance of Anne Reid, Daniel Craig and Cathryn Bradshaw. The cinematography is impressive. The score is hardwired to the plot. The plot is epic, brilliantly dressed by the writer Hanif Kureishi in mundane lives. This story addresses the great problems with the subtlety of an impressionist painting. And some of those big issues are very controversial, which probably explains the lack of prizes won, despite many nominations. It's just one of my favorite movies of all time.
