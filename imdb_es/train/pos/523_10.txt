Why is not this movie in the 250 best? This film seems surprisingly new 56 years after its production, but it could only have been done as a result of W.W.II due to the perception of the proximity of death. People were more aware that life could stop at an unexpected moment. And after life? I liked the scene at the end with the trial and all the people from all nations met. The phlegmatic judge (Abraham Sofaer, a typical British judge), Dr. Reeves (Roger Livesey) defending Peter Carter (David Niven) and also June (Kim Hunter) against the US Attorney Abraham Farlan (Raymond Massey I). He is an American-). It's all so imaginative! Michael Powell wrote, directed and produced this amazing film that is a true "force tour". The message of the film is clear: in the universe the law is the most important, but on earth nothing goes beyond love between humans. The way this beautiful story is told is much more interesting than any Hollywood movie could do.
