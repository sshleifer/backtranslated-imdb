I enjoyed this movie. It was a joy to see a version so close to the vision of Peter O'Donnell. <br /> <br /> Many people have been disgusted by the film, but it must be seen in the context of the origin story that it is. The film uses a flashback to show the young Modesty and the events that transformed her into the woman she became. Before the network. Before Willie Garvin. <br /> <br /> The rhythm is a bit slow, and for my taste there is not enough tension developed in the current scenes. However, this is acceptable only to obtain such a faithful version. <br /> <br /> If you like Modesty Blaise, you will enjoy it even with its faults, if you only want an action movie with car chases, forget it. <br /> <br /> He has the feeling of being the first in a franchise, but since I've never seen him promoted anywhere, I suspect there will not be more to follow. Sadly.
