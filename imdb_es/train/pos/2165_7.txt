Seeing "Impulse" is a very satisfying experience. Unpredictable movies are such a rarity, when one appears as "Impulse", it is something to embrace. The script is logical, and extremely creative. Meg Tilly, Tim Matheson, Hume Cronyn and Bill Paxton give credible presentations. This could have developed like a zombie movie, but "Impulse" is far superior to any boring "zombie", and the originality shines in almost every scene. You have the feeling that something like this could have happened, even if the script is pure fiction. From the opening of the "grabber" to the credit roll, you will be fascinated. Very entertaining and definitely recommended. - MERK
