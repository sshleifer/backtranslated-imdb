The scene in which Sally Field and Whoopi Goldberg go to the mall to revive the spirits of Sally is reason enough to enjoy this movie, but wait! There is more! This is a good display of daytime television, movie stars on the way down (and more) and the horrors of love. Robert Downey Jr shows the lighter side of his genius, and Cathy Moriarty is splendid. Dialogue is witty, and physical humor done with consummate skill. This is a movie that will appeal to those who really enjoy the arts of acting, directing and writing.
