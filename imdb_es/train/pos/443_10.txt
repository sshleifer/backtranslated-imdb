The first time I saw this movie was in the early 90's when it was released. Room with a view was also recently outside. Enchanted April had much more to offer! I found it much more real and earthy, the more credible characters being "normal". At the end of the film I felt the same as when I first saw the BBC production of Pride and Prejudice, I wanted the characters to find what they were looking for, be it isolation, peace, freedom or love. Throughout history, Italy feels so far away from everything they have known, that they are so decadent to take risks and leave aside everything that is monotonous and restricted. But in the heat of the spring of April, everyone's lives are loosened and unraveled (in line with Victorian corsets) and slowly rebuilt to everyone's satisfaction. What a little movie gem! How is it not better known?
