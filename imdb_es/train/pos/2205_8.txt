The variety of psychotic orchards of its average garden variety (deliciously rehearsed with deranged joy by Stephen Sachs) hits several young and foolish "adults" (to use the term very loosely) at the University of Dayton Hall, which is being closed by demolition. With a terrifying performance by the entire cast (Daphne Zuniga makes her ignominious and unpropitious film debut here as Debbie, a bimbo whose head is crushed by a car!), A great count of 10, good makeup f / x by Matthew Mungle, some bloody murders (baseball bat hit, chicken wire strangulation, your standard head drill, that kind of dreadful thing), an unexpected and surprising ending that was later copied into "Intruder," a Christopher's creepy score ("Hellraiser") Young, a slight hint of gratuitous female nudity, and an incredibly incompetent direction from Jeffrey Obrow and Steve Carpenter (who also blessed us with "The Power" and "The Kindred"), this entertaining atrocity abysmal. It classifies as a lot of fun, low grade deliciously boring and drecky.
