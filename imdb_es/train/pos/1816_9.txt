Many comments on this page mention that this movie is a bit dark for children. That depends on the child. This is not a movie for a child from 2 to 6 years old; It is more oriented towards 8 years old and older people. I saw this movie when I was 10 years old, I loved it. At that time, most of the animated films were too childish for my liking. This film deals with more serious issues and, therefore, has a little more emotional impact. In this movie the characters can die, and be sent to HELL! This gives a bit more emotional weight to the scenes where the characters are risking their lives. The good ones are not always perfectly sweet and pleasant (like other cartoons). They have "real" motivations, such as revenge and greed, but also compassion and friendship; It shows that things are not always black and white. <br /> <br /> Excellent movie
