Often, films of this nature are presented as a mixture of great work together with a slight nonsense to fill the execution time. Whether the support of the big name or the project itself, Paris je t'aime never falls into this realm. I think I can really say that the film as a whole is better than its parts. Between the wonderful transitions and the fantastic finalization sequence, combining characters in a final view of love in Paris, I think the film would have been affected if any piece was removed. It is true that there are definitely some outstanding points that overshadow the rest, but in the end I have a lasting image, even if it is only a fraction of a second of each brief vignette. Love takes many forms, and talent here comes close to the occasion, to surprise and move the audience through the poetry and elegance of the many facets of emotion. <br /> <br /> Quartier des Enfants Rouges: Maggie Gyllenhaal surprises like a drug Actress of shot in Paris and I find her distributor. The revelation in its conclusion leaves you a little out of balance, since the love between the two hands changes. <br /> <br /> Quatier Latin: Ben Gazzara and Gena Rowlands (recreating a relationship from an old Cassavettes movie?) Brings some great sharp wit and sarcasm when they meet to discuss their impending divorce. What is true in your conversation and what is only to annoy the other, everything is nice, leaving a smile on your face. <br /> <br /> Quais de Seine: Director Gurinder Chadha gives us a poignant portrait of existing love Beyond religious and racial differences. It's a sweet little story of shy love between two people who obviously feel a connection, but can not vocalize it. <br /> <br /> Tour Eiffel: I admit that I was disappointed that Sylvain Chomet did not have an animated sequence However, this live-action tale of mimosa lovers in a Paris prison has the same peculiar nature as his film Les Belleville Triplettes. <br /> <br /> Tuileries: The Coen brothers stick to their weird sense of humor and deliver some fine laughs. Steve Buscemi really shines and sells the performance without saying a word. His facial reactions to the verbal abuse of a dissatisfied Frenchman are priceless. <br /> <br /> Bastille: Here is a heart-rending portrait of a couple almost out of love only to face the tragedy again. Sergio Castellitto and Miranda Richardson move like a couple that faces problems and finds out how strong the bond of true love is. <br /> <br /> Pére-Lachaise: A surprisingly funny little story by horror master Wes Craven. Oscar Wilde's humor can add lightness to any relationship. <br /> <br /> Parc Monceau: Alfonso Cuarón seems to be practicing the incredible long shots he perfects in Children of Men with this story of two people in love, walking down the street. While Nick Nolte and Ludivine Sagnier finally come into close view, we also find the true context of their "forbidden love" conversation. <br /> <br /> Porte de Choisy: a very surreal look at the glamor of Paris. This is probably the strangest entry, but so intriguing that you can not look away from the madness that occurs. Do not anger your Asian beautician, whatever you do. <br /> <br /> Pigalle: An interesting look at a relationship that experiences a role play that seems to have been stagnant for years. A small variety of Bob Hoskins is needed to light the fire. <br /> <br /> Quartier de la Madeleine: Even vampires in Paris can find love between feeding times. I do not know whether to be happy for Elijah Wood as a result or not. Beautifully filmed and silenced to allow the vibrant red of blood, this short is strange, but so is love. <br /> <br /> 14th district: leave it to Alexander Payne's strange sense of humor to add some depth to it. This story of talking about an American in Paris to discover what love is. His rough and uneducated French is a stark contrast to the authentic accents we've been hearing up to this point, crazy enough to be funny and totally true to the story. <br /> <br /> Montmartre: An interesting introduction to the process. Paris can be a city inhabited by everyday activities, such as finding a parking spot, but when love is discovered, it will take its prisoner anywhere to continue the journey. <br /> <br /> Loin du 16éme: Catalina Sandino Moreno brilliantly shows what Love for a child is through her subtle acting, since the story is accompanied by her singing to a small child, but totally different each time. <br /> <br /> Place des Fetes: My favorite group story. Seydou Boro and Aïssa Maïga are simply fantastic. The cyclical nature of the story and how fate unites the two characters twice so that Boro finally asks for coffee is hard to see. Sometimes, love in your last moment is enough to accept that you leave this earth. <br /> <br /> Place des Victoires: One of the best stories about a mother trying to deal with the death of her young son. Juliette Binoche is devastating as the mother, desperate for a last glimpse of her son, and Willem Dafoe is strangely perfect as the cowboy who gives him the opportunity. <br /> <br /> Faubourg Saint-Denis: Sometimes you have to think you have lost your love to accept that you have not been totally involved in the relationship. Melchior Beslon remembers, trying to find where they went wrong through a series of quick and sharp cuts from his meeting with Natalie Portman to finally "see" how much he needs it. <br /> <br /> Le Marais: Leave it to Gus Van Sant shows us a story about the gap in communication and understanding, since his films almost always deal with some kind of alienation. His Elephant photographer is an American who works in Paris and is the catalyst for the ramblings of artists and soulmates of Gaspard Ulliel. Sometimes you do not need to know what is being said to understand what is going on in the breaks.
