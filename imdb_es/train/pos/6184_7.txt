Since this is Black History Month and I am reviewing the achievements of many African-Americans in a film in chronological order, I got this VHS movie from the library because Duke Ellington and his Orchestra were in it. His jazz version of "Rhapsody" by Franz Liszt was the highlight of this mix of mystery and musical comedy, mostly very extensive. Many other numbers that I liked were especially "Sweet Marijuana" by Kitty Carlisle, the "Cocktails for Two" by Carl Brisson, as well as his duet with Carlisle about that before, and those of Gertrude Michael, who is great as the woman you love hate. Jack Oakie and Victor McLaglen probably take too much time with their love / hate jokes as a producer and detective, but they grow on you. And Toby Wing is a silly, sexy joke like Nancy, who keeps trying to tell Oakie something, but gets a "Not Now" from him every time. While many of the characters have a reason for the murders that occur, I was not surprised by the revelation of who did it. And get a load of how naked the women are here (although, of course, their breasts are covered, either with their hands or with a flimsy upper part). This was, obviously, pre-Code. It's worth seeing any movie buff interested in this kind of thing. PS As a resident of Louisiana for a long time, I like to point out that someone was born here because Carlisle was born in New Orleans.
