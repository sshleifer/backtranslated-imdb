When I saw the movie at the beginning, I thought it was boring because nothing happened, but when all the terrifying things started to happen, like when the church dies and comes back to life, and also Gage and his mother die and there the idiot dad has what to bring come back to life even though he knows the warnings and ignores Jud. This is not the best work of Steven Kings. I thought your best job was brightness. I do not think that the people who see this movie and comment on how horrible it was, are wrong, because the only thing they think about is what they thought. as if that person could do a better job of making a horror movie. I mean making the instrument bad and how it kills Jud is a genius. Making the most innocent and unsuspecting character one of the murderers is great. The people who did not like the movie are dumb because everything is a scary movie and nothing of everything. Do not expect something from a movie that is not. Still in a general area it was not so good. I still recommend that people see the movie
