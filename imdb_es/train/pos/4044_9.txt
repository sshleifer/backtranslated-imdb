I found this movie to be very good rhythm. The premise is quite imaginative, and as a spectator I was dragged while the characters developed. The rhythm is performed very well for those who like to think: it remains hidden enough for the viewer from the beginning, and the questions keep coming up and then they respond, producing a well-thought-out and very satisfying movie, both from the point of cerebral sight as from an action. point of view. <br /> <br /> It seems that some people were looking for a roller coaster without stopping in this movie, one of those that comes out of the loading door. This would be more analogous to one of those coasters that first takes you slowly up the hill, creating a wonderful sense of anticipation, and ultimately, in my opinion, is more satisfying to the base that was initially established. <br /> <br /> Excellent movie.
