Personally I liked this movie and I am alarmed by the rating that some people have given it. It is a movie based on a comic and is animated, now, if you do not like comics or animation, of course, you will not like this movie, so why did you see it and you bothered to describe it as being out of my scope? However, if you are a fan of interesting characters, strong and heroic women (sexy) who kick your butt and save the world (hell), you will love this movie. I thought that the story really attracted me and it was a very good movie. It is quite anime or more like some of the American movies that follow this new adult animation trend. Like Titan A.E. meet is the live action version of Punisher. In the end, I recommend this movie to the fan of comics and fans of superheroes or anyone with a sufficiently open mind in search of a funny movie.
