Well, of course not, women are excessively sensitive and needy on average, which is interestingly described from mother to whore, though not pseudo-artistically, extravagantly, or flagrantly. Unlike many of you, I have only seen La Maman et La Putain twice. Like many good movies, I noticed that my opinion improved after a second viewing. All I know is what I've seen and I still have to dig into new exploits until I've acquired the DVD myself. I still have to figure out precisely why I enjoy this movie so much, but really, what does it matter to me why? Although I'm sure I could and I'm going to form a wonderful explanation. Okay, you may not agree, maybe it's a bit boring sometimes, I'm not an expert. The blonde reminds me of a lovely grushenka.
