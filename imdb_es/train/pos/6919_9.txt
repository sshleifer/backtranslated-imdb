['&quot;Winchester &#39;73&quot; marked the first of a series of westerns that involved James Stewart and director Anthony Mann. As with most of them, Stewart&#39;s hero has a violent advantage that threatens to explode at any moment. <br /><br /> The title refers to a &quot;one in a thousand&quot; rifle that is ready to compete in a rifle shooting that took place in Dodge City on July 4, 1876. In the city is Lin McAdam (Stewart) and his partner High Spade (Millard Mitchell) who are following the trail of Dutch Henry Brown (Stephen McNally) for a past work of cowards. They arrive just in time to see Marshal Wyatt Earp (Will Geer) running to the parlor girl Lola (Shelley Winters) out of town. It turns out that Henry Henry is also in town to fire the rifle. Lin and Dutchman Henry shoot for the coveted prize with the winner of Lin, but Dutchman Henry steals Lin&#39;s weapon and escapes. <br /><br /> Lin and High Spade track Dutchman Henry through the country where they meet Lola with her cowardly boyfriend Steve Miller (Charles Drake) at a US cavalry camp. UU Waiting for the attack of the Indians led by Young Bull (Rock Hudson) who has acquired the precious rifle. Killing the wily arms broker John McIntyre. He had got the gun by cheating Dutch Henry in poker. Young Bull is killed during the attack and the weapon passes to Steve. <br /><br /> Meanwhile, back at the ranch, Lola and Steve meet the notorious gunman Waco Johnny Dean (Dan Duryea) who kills Steve and takes the valuable rifle and Lola for him. When Dean meets Dutch Henry, he allows him to retrieve &quot;his weapon&quot; that he plans to kill later. In the city of Tuscosa, Lin kills Dean when Dutch Henry&#39;s plans to delay the bank go badly and he escapes to the hills with Lin in pursuit. In one of the best final shots, the two are in the final showdown. <br /><br /> I think this movie was the only one of the Stewart / Mann collaborations that was filmed at B &amp; W. It is beautifully photographed, especially the scenes in the &quot;open spaces&quot; and, in particular, the final confrontation. Stewart playing against the guy, plays the hero with a violent motive of revenge, an emotion that would lead to future films with Mann. <br /><br /> As in most of the universal westerns, this has a cast of experienced veterans and hired players of the time. In addition to those mentioned above, JC Flippen appears as the cavalry sergeant, Steve Brodie, James Millican, John Doucette and Chuck Roberson as several minions, Ray Teal as the sheriff pursuing Duryea, Tony Curtis and James Best as novice soldiers and Edmund Cobb, Chief Yowlachie and John War Eagle play different roles in the Dodge City sequence. <br /><br /> A classic western in every sense of the word. He was responsible for rebuilding Stewart&#39;s career as an action star.']
