I saw this my last day at the festival, and I was glad to stay a couple of days more. Poetic, moving, and most surprising, funny, in its own strange way. It is very rare to see the directors who work in this style and who can find true strangeness and humor in a hyper-realistic world, without appearing beautiful or upsetting the balance. He manages to seem impromptu, but completely controlled. I hesitate to make comparisons, because these filmmakers have really digested their influences (Cassavetes, Malick, Loach, Altman ... the usual suspects) and found their own unique style, but if you like modern directors in this tradition (Lynne Ramsay, David Gordon Greene), a real pleasure awaits you. This is a wonderful movie, and I hope more people can see it. If this movie plays at a festival in your city, go ahead! to go! to go!
