I really enjoyed this episode, which was a big surprise given the bad reputation it seems to have acquired. From a pure writing perspective, 'The 16mm shrine' is an absolute delight, with a great dialog and character analysis, typical of Sterling. In particular, I enjoyed the philosophical indulgences of the episode, addressing issues of existence and reality, while balancing it with more psychological issues such as denial, pride and desire. 'The sixteen-millimeter sanctuary' is an episode about how these ideas based on an unwillingness to accept change can seemingly alienate a person from the rest of the world in constant change. It is also a fantastic example of the Twilight Zone of the brain; One that explores the mind instead of the outside world. These elements combine very well to create an exciting thought of 25 incredibly interesting minutes. <br /> <br /> However, the episode is not without flaws, which are mainly found in the shoes Lupino and Leisen. Ironically, I felt that Lupino was not convincing at all, with only a few scenes that could be memorable. This, of course, is an absolute shame considering how well Sterling had written his character. Also, Leisen did not seem to know what to do with most of his characters, sometimes causing them to stand on the set doing nothing, which probably explains why he accepted Lupino's bad performances half the time. Fortunately, Balsam does a good job covering many weak points, helping to redeem the program at least from a performance perspective. <br /> <br /> As I said earlier, however, if you are a fan of classic cinema and brain science fiction, this should not be as bad as you sometimes think. In addition to the writing I mentioned earlier, the episode also features some fantastic photographs (I'm still surprised that the show looks so good almost fifty years later!) And a pretty decent design. In general, 'The sixteen-millimeter sanctuary' is a great episode and, above all, it is one to make you think.
