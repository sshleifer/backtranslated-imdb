This movie could be one of the most undervalued in the history of Bollywood. This blockbuster of 1994 had all good performances, music and direction. I remember I was in Allahabad when this movie was being published and it was somewhere in March at the time of Holi, the people there were playing their song "Ooe Amma" on their loudspeakers at the highest volume. If someone who likes to watch Some Like It Hot and dribbles for Marilyn Monroe, you should watch this movie. Thumbs Up Govinda. How many of you know that this movie was shot in South India and after Sholay could be one of the few? The blockbuter will reach the silver screen. With movies like this Indian comedy I could never be dead.
