I think I got this movie when I was young. I remembered seeing it when I was a kid, but I could never find the movie. I remembered the good ol Rageddy Ann, Andy, Babette, the greedy, King Koo Koo. I searched high and low for this movie and I still have no luck. But one day, when I moved out of my childhood home, I had found it. We meet. I am 17 years old now. I still see it. All the time really. It's one of the funniest and most moving movies I've seen and enjoyed at the same time. And personally I think they should do a sequel. Mmm, yes a sequel by the way. Now I'm even considering tattooing bird captains somewhere in my body!
