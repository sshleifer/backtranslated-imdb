We saw the vcr and found it fascinating. Without knowing anything about this real story, I thought: "Oh, no, P.Brosnan as an American Indian (Indian 'red' in the movie), what a bad choice" until I discovered the truth about the Gray Owl. The film does a good job of demonstrating the dignity of these native peoples and undermining racist myths about them. And Annie Galipeau, WOW, how beautiful, and very convincing as an Indian woman (I think she is French-Canadian, she surely returns to the familiar speech of others). Despite Brosnan's distant and grumpy style, in the end he convincingly shows himself as a passionate and dedicated man. The plot is a little weak to demonstrate its conversion from trapper to animal conservationist. Good movie, highly recommended.
