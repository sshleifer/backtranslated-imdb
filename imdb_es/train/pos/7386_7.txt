OK, so the Oscars seem to be exaggerated a little more each year. And I was encouraging him to win "Gosford Park" (Come on, Robert Altman had deserved an Oscar for years!). That said, I think it was about time for an African-American to win the Best Actress. Contrary to the previous critic, the role of Halle Berry in "Monster's Ball" was much more original than that of Nicole Kidman in "Moulin Rouge"; I would never have thought about nominating the latter for anything, especially in a year that saw the "Mulholland Dr.". <br /> <br /> Among the things I had predicted were things about the September 11 attacks; I knew they were going to say something about freedom. Yes Yes. Robert Redford should know better. But again, contrary to the previous critic, Whoopi Goldberg is not the worst host (among the previous hosts was Bob Hope, whom I do not respect him); I really liked his blow to John Ashcroft. <br /> <br /> Then, even if I had not given the Best Film of "A Beautiful Mind", "The 74th Annual Academy Awards" still pleases me (I must admit, I enjoy the Oscars more than my own birthday). And the next day, when my parents and I were walking through the houses in Bandalier, New Mexico, it was spring break, I thought that when Jim Broadbent won his Oscar, most people who saw him asked "Jim who ?! "I wonder if Woody Allen will attend the Oscars again.
