A French novelist, disgusted by the friends of his wife's society, goes to North Africa for a respite. There he meets a vivacious and talented Bedouin, who lives in poverty. In spite of his wife, who is in love with a Maharaja, he decides to train and educate the girl, and present her to Parisian society as the PRINCESS TAM TAM ... <br /> <br /> The wonderful Josephine Baker is perfectly incorporated . The main role in this French movie very nice. With her huge eyes and contagious smile, she immediately contacts the spectator's heart. Her oversized personality and the obvious joy of doing it make it a pleasure to see her. Baker makes us worry about what is happening to poor Alwina during her transformation and introduction to European customs. <br /> <br /> Albert Préjean performs very well as Pygmalion in Baker's Galatea; Also effective are Georges Peclet as a mestizo servant and Jean Galland as the mysterious Maharajah. <br /> <br /> The film is very beautiful and well-made, with an appearance reminiscent of the Busby Berkeley films that are produced at the same time. Time in America: although unlike the American films of this period, PRINCESSE TAM TAM does not have any racism. It should be noted that there was no Hays office or a production code in France. Part of the dialogue and the action are quite provocative, but we must admit that Baker singing and dancing in 'Under The African Sky', as well as his culminating performance in the Parisian nightclub, are two of the most memorable moments of cinema. /> <br /> The filming of the real location in Tunisia greatly improves the film. <br /> <br /> Josephine Baker was born in St. Louis in 1906, in a very poor family. Her talent and ambition to drive, however, soon pushed her to move eastward and she was briefly a member of the cast of the Ziegfeld Follies. Realizing that America in the mid-1920s had great limitations for a gifted black woman, she managed to reach Paris, where she eventually joined Foliés-Bergeres & Le Negre Revue. The French adored her and became a great celebrity. A brief return to America in 1935 showed Baker that things had not changed for African-Americans. She returned to France, became a French citizen and worked for the Resistance during the first days of the war. Baker moved to Morocco for the time and entertained the allied troops stationed there. <br /> <br /> After the war, Baker's fortune began to slip and he faced many financial and personal difficulties. For a time, he was even banned from returning to the United States. Finally, Baker accepted an offer from Princess Grace of Monaco to reside in the Principality. Josephine Baker was about to return when she died of a stroke in 1975, at the age of 68. <br /> <br /> Having appeared in only two decent movies: ZOUZOU & PRINCESSE TAM TAM - Baker is in danger of becoming dark. But she deserves her place alongside Chevalier, Dietrich & Robeson, as one of the truly legendary artists of her generation.
