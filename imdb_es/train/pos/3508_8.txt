Incredibly intriguing and captivating, I found it impossible to turn around once I started looking. I'm usually one of the toughest critics, but for me this movie was brilliant, oddly enough that I can almost smell the air and feel the textures of the places. <br /> <br /> From a cinematic perspective, I thought there was a great use of light and texture. All of them gave me an air of different realism, from the orange glow of summer light to the plastic wrapped sofa. <br /> <br /> From the perspective of the character, I thought that the notion of VÃ­ctor Vargas was almost the glue that connects. The story was quite inspired, as each of the other members of the family with a more complete history simply caused more intrigue in the main character. <br /> <br /> Beyond that, having met someone like Grandma and having been On the receiving end of such a situation, I can say that the situation felt particularly realistic. The discomfort, the accent, the cooking and even the comments seemed very authentic. <br /> <br /> I think this movie worked for me because I started to see it without expectations and I found it completely immersed. and it brought back memories of adolescent emotions, which are worth a watch.
