['In general, I was quite impressed with the pilot. The initial first fifteen minutes were worrying, as they felt that the creators were trying to create a science fiction version of The OC, but this fear is rectified when a terrorist incident occurs and from here the program enters into issues and situations that rarely I see. television tackle. <br /><br /> BSG dealt with issues such as monotheism, existentialism, reality, death and terrorism, but they were mainly subtexts, for the viewer to contemplate or ignore if they wish. Here, on the other hand, these issues are the focus of the program and I personally found myself evoking works like Ghost In The Shell and The Matrix as reference points while watching and I was surprised at how well the topics were discussed. I think if you&#39;re a fan of the two I just mentioned or other movies / TV shows that deal with the issues I referred to, I think you&#39;ll find at least something here. <br /><br /> In terms of a starting point to explain how the situation we know in BSG came about, I think they handled it in a very interesting way, I especially liked how they explained where Cylon&#39;s belief in a God came from and Caprica&#39;s creation was over . It threw enough advanced and contemporary technology to make it appear in the future, but not for us as spectators. <br /><br /> The only real weaknesses I noticed were the relationship between Greystone&#39;s parents and the actress who plays &#39;Lacy Rand&#39;. While I like Eric Stoltz and Paula Malcomson individually, on the whole their scenes seemed to lack chemistry, at this point it might just be to develop their characters, but I think this needs something. I also found Magda Apanowicz unconvincing in her role. Again, this could be due to the experience and time needed to develop, but throughout the episode his performance seemed forced and not completely secure. <br /><br /> Based on the pilot, I am eager to see where &#39;Caprica&#39; is going in the future and I hope it touches the greatness that BSG once did.']
