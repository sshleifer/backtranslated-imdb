I have been a fan of Xu Ke (Hark Tsui) for many years since school. This movie is the best fantasy movie in years. I do not think that "action" is the correct genre, although there is a lot of action and KongFu scenes. Wait, did I mention that this is an ORIENTAL fantasy moive? Please note that DO NOT use the hollywood formula to rate this movie. And for the boy who "poops", I do not blame you, because you're young and you need to know more about "culture".
