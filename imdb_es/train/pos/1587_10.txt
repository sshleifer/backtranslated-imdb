Does anyone know where I can watch or download episodes of season 4 of "What I like about you" on the Internet? Because I would die to see them and here in Germany it will not be shown on television. Please help. I want to look bad episodes of season 4 I've already seen episode 4 and episode 18 on YouTube. But I could not find more episodes of season 4. Is there a website where I can watch the episodes? Because I read some comments on forums in Germany and there were people who had already seen the episodes of the fourth season even though they had not been seen on television in Germany. I'm happy with every information I can get. Thanks Kate
