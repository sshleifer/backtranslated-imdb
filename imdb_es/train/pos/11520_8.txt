The road movie par excellence ... if your idea of ​​a road movie involves three magicians with accents of Eastern Europe and Claire Forlani. (Well, one in four is not bad ...) A magician without talent who has an eye for the show (Max) looks at a very clever pickpocket (Hugo) who manages his trade in New York. After convincing Hugo that he (Max) is a) mental and b) desperately needs a partner to fulfill his dreams of being a stage magician, the not-so-dynamic duo has the managerial experience of an inventor of illusions (Milo) and the softer attributes of a lovely waitress (Lydia). The unlikely four piles in a van (obtained by Hugo ... guess where it came from) and you head to Las Vegas. The chaos continues. Anyway, it's fun, it's well written and the ending is surprisingly good. A solid comedy with a warm heart, and so much better than it was totally unexpected.
