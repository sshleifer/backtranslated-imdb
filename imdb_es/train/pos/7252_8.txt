I saw this movie before joining the British Army. I went through my basic training, at the beginning difficult and then as I progressed much easier. My time was spent during the trouble of the problems in NI and the cold war. There were times when I wondered what I had gotten myself into, not for a long time, since training would always take over and you would always react instinctively. The voice-over used to show what the soldiers are thinking is right, even though I would have added breath and heart rate, since this seems to beat on your eardrums in certain situations. Some years later, I was in Canada for a family reunion. An aunt of mine who lives in the United States and is a professor at Columbus Uni Ohio had written an article about the effects of the British army on NI. She spent some time there researching. Although she was an ex-pat, she was very anti-British She made a bee line for me and condemned me for being a British soldier. My only response was to see the movie 'A long day dying'. It is as close as a civilian will realize why a soldier does what he does. The answer is right at the end.
