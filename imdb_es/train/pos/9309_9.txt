My God, where do I start? This is the best movie I've ever seen. The angles of the camera are excellent, but in my opinion the performance was the best. why the writers of this movie are not writing big-budget movies that I'll never understand. another is the cast. That's great. This is the best ted raimi movie there is. I know some of you are probably thinking "in no way does he have much better" but he is not wrong. Isla rapaz is a work of art. I hope I should have gotten the best movie of the year instead of that fucking Crash movie with a lot of names and abductors. I think this movie is really the most wonderful thing of all.
