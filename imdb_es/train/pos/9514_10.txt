This is one of the best movies I've seen in my life. He has a very good performance by Hanks, Newman and all the others. Definitely the best performance of Jude Law. The cinematography is excellent, the editing is just as good and includes a great original score that really fits the mood of the film. The production design is also a factor in what makes this film special. For me, it takes a lot to beat Godfather, but the fantastic cinematography that is shown wins this contest. Definitely a nominee for the Best Film in my book.
