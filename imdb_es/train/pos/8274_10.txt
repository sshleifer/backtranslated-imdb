This movie is excellent. I found it very interesting. I thought the legend of Wendigo was very good. The performance was also great, as well as the costumes, production, photography, direction and script. <br /> <br /> A very happy family on vacation is left stranded in the middle of nowhere after they hit a deer. Then a hunter appears and is very angry and outraged by the fact that one of the deer's horns is broken. Then he begins to stalk the family and strange things happen to them. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie. Worth it. Congratulations to the cast, crew and filmmakers. Two thumbs high!
