That summer I had seen the filming of this film for several days, the final result was only two scenes from the film. The location was Sylvan Lake in the Black Hills. Bring the car, stop the car, etc. So this young Dakota wanted to see the movie and was not disappointed. The herd of local buffalo was being eliminated so the shooting scenes were real. (Yes, Doris, the animals were hurt during the filming). I think the ending was copied by Jack Nicholson in Shining? A great western / social commentary of the 50s. This should be of the same kind as High Noon for the true Western drama or used as a social statement like Blackboard Jungle or Rebel Without A Cause for the youth of the 50s.
