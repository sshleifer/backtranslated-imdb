Some bad reviews here for this and I understand why, but I consider them as a low budget serial killer movie and you may get more out of it than most. <br /> <br /> I thought this worked in a way because afterwards I felt dirty and wanted to take a long shower, so it's a degree of success, right? <br /> <br /> I'd say there's the right level of bad quality here to get under your skin even if the acting is maybe a little too bumpy David Hess is only in this elegant locker, so do not do it Illusions too if you like Last House. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, it's worth checking out.
