A great story with a message. Joan Plowright is excellent as "Phoebe", Mike Kopsa is very funny as "coach" and Richard de Klerk plays the role of "Carmine" perfectly. Mischa Barton as "Frankie" does a good performance and Ingrid as "Hazel" plays her first advantage extremely well. This movie is superbly directed by Jo-Beth Williams. The edition is first class.
