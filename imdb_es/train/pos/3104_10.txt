This movie was excellent. I did not expect him to live up to all the hype, but he did. Like all Bourne films, the action is fast, realistic and intense. If you liked the other two films in the trilogy, you'll love this one too. The plot of the film is simple and there are no twists in the plot that are too unreal. Okay, the character of Julia Stiles who showed up at the Italian security house was kind of crazy, especially after what happened in Supremacy, but it makes sense that she's the only character in "Treadstone" that Bourne knows, who does not want it dead. You could possibly trust and be the only person to guide you in the right direction. The action is directed by the characters and their reactions to what happens around them. What I've always liked about Bourne movies is that Bourne can kick butt, but when he's combined with people as good as him, fights are fights and he gets a lot of damage in them. They never treat the audience like idiots. <br /> <br /> All the actors were solid in their performances. I think Damon could play Bourne while he sleeps and receives excellent support from Joan Allen who repeats his role as Supremacy, David Strathairn and Scott Glenn. I recommend this movie and the trilogy. Although I do miss Franka Potente.
