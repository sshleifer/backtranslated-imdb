['Of the three new versions of W. Somerset Maughan&#39;s novel, this is the best, and not especially because of what John Cromwell contributed to the film. It is worth watching the film due to the breakthrough of Bette Davis, who like Mildred Rogers showed the film industry that she was a star. Finally, his problems with Jack Warner and his studio paid off. <br /><br /> The movie is dominated by Mildred from the beginning. From the beginning we realize that Mildred does not care about Philip and never will. She does not hide her contempt for this kind soul who has fallen in love with the wrong woman. Mildred will humiliate him again and again, since she does not say anything about what he really is. <br /><br /> Poor Philip Carey, besides being disabled, is a weak man. When he tries to hold onto Mildred, she rejects him. It is when Mildred returns to him, when she is frail and defeated, that he gets up for the occasion, overcoming his own dependence on this terrible woman who has stolen his will and his manhood. <br /><br /> Bette Davis gives a fantastic performance of Mildred. This was one of his best roles and he ran away with him. His dislike of the guy Philip is clear from the beginning of their relationship. When she tells him to wash her mouth after he kisses her, it is one of the most powerful moments in the movie. Leslie Howard gave little importance to Philip and makes him look even weaker than he is. Frances Dee, Reginald Denny, Alan Hale and Reginald Owen, are seen in minor roles. <br /><br /> This is the Bette Davis show, and do not forget it!']
