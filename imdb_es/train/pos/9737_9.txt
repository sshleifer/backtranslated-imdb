['The incredible performance of Simon Pegg, which improves and improves with each role. As usual, he plays the role of a very shy character that makes you want to hide behind your pillow, embarrassed by him sometimes, but that&#39;s what Pegg is about. <br /><br /> The laughter was regular and tearful, and each of them pointed to Penn. The film was put together in a very intelligent way in which each character plays a very sophisticated and serious role, since Penn is the only humor involved, which is a great merit for Director Robert Weide. <br /><br /> And I can not let it go without a quick applause for Gilliam Anderson, who shone everywhere. Highly recommended for everyone.']
