There is something convincing and strangely credible in this episode. From the beginning, an atmosphere of tension is created by the knowledge that a certain planet will explode in a few hours. Kirk, Spock and McCoy have moved to evacuate the inhabitants, all of whom seem to have already left by unknown parties, except for an elderly librarian. <br /> <br /> The educated but cryptic advice of the librarian about where all the citizens are The crisis has been interrupted by a crisis in which the three members of the crew of the Enterprise are unexpectedly launched at different times of the planet's past . Kirk is in a period of time similar to that of the seventeenth century in England, while Spock and McCoy are trapped in a desolate and frozen desert. <br /> <br /> The interrelation between the two stories and the different dangerous situations in which men find themselves is handled in an excellent way, with the return to the present as an unknown possibility, while the minutes count down to the explosion of the planet. <br /> <br /> Imaginative writing and good acting characterize this episode, with a poignant interpretation of Mariette Hartley as a woman exiled in the Ice Age, and Ian Wolfe as the urban librarian. Something reminiscent of the classic episode City On The Edge of Forever, this time travel story is a rich and compelling ending to the series, which concluded an episode later. This has to be one of the best in the whole series, especially remarkable, given the generally lower quality of the third season in general.
