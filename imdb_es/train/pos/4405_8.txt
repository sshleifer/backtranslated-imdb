['The War between the States was perhaps the darkest hour in the history of America; a war that pitted brother against brother and family against family and left scars that still have not healed, and in all probability never will. And, as in any story about any war, beyond any historical significance, it is the personal discord behind the greater conflict that creates the emotional impetus that involves it. It is the human element that makes the context necessary to give it a perspective, which is what director Ang Lee offers in &#39;Ride With the Devil&#39;, a Civil War drama in which he focuses on the personal tribulations within of the broader description of the War itself. and, along the way, he manages to include an examination of one of the bloodiest chapters of the war, the infamous attack on Lawrence, Kansas, by Quantrill and his assailants, which he manages to present quite objectively from the point of view of the Confederates <br /><br /> In 1863, the influence of the Union predominated in the state of Kansas, and even across the border in neighboring Missouri, those with confederate loyalties find it increasingly difficult to resist the invaders from the north, especially without the help of the which could be considered any regular Confederate troops. And when things really start to heat up in their own city, Jack Bull Chiles (Skeet Ulrich) and Jake Roedel (Tobey Maguire) form a band of their own and join the fray, causing damage to the cause of the Union where possible. Jack Bull and Jake do not like war and do not like to kill; but they are defending what they think is right. <br /><br /> There are others, however, even among their own, men like the young Pitt Mackeson (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers), who will use conflict as a vehicle for personal gain and as nothing more than an excuse to express their own violent nature through of unnecessary. Brutality, perpetrated in many cases against innocent victims. And so, for Jack Bull and Jake, as well as for many like them, it becomes a moment in which loyalty and moral judgments will be put to the test; a time during which their souls will be tempered in blood. And they will have to travel with the Devil himself, against seemingly insurmountable odds. <br /><br /> As with all his films, director Ang Lee approaches his story through an incisive and subtle examination of the traditions, cultural aspects and moral attitudes of the people and the times he describes. And by doing so, Lee gives his audience at least some understanding of his subject that goes beyond the real story and, ultimately, offers, perhaps, a deeper understanding of the motivations that drive his characters and the drama in which they are involved. Be it the traditions and customs that explain the relationship between a father and his daughters (&#39;Eat Drink Man Woman&#39;), the effects of class distinction (&#39;Sense and sensibility&#39;), the honor and the code by which a warrior live and die (`Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon &#39;) or the moral ambiguities fostered by the lack of all the above (&#39; The Ice Storm &#39;), Lee infuses his films with information about the human condition that takes them to a higher level. This movie is not an exception; and (as he does with all his films), Lee presents his story with the help of an impressive cinematography (in this film, by Frederick Elmes, who also brilliantly did &#39;The Ice Storm&#39;), which under his guidance is nothing more than visual poetry. It&#39;s that special touch of Lee, and it adds a melancholic and reflective sense to any story he tells, which is one of the elements that makes his films so memorable. <br /><br /> Like Jake, Tobey Maguire initially gives a sense of youthful innocence to the film that contrasts so effectively with the maturity he conveys later as the story unfolds, and his character along with it. The most important thing is that Maguire responds in a convincing and credible way to the events that take place around him, which adds to the credibility of the film in general and underscores the realism of the presentation: his stoic acceptance of death and news of the &quot;murdered&quot; in the various skirmishes. and battles; the moral property to which those with whom it finds themselves adhere, even in such difficult times; the betrayal, which due to the nature of the conflict is almost commonplace; and the loyalty and beliefs to which he and his companions cling firmly. It is all this that Maguire achieves through his performance, and it is not a small achievement. However, it is the kind of performance studied and underestimated that is often taken for granted, which is unfortunate; A job like this is worthy of recognition, and should be recognized. <br /><br /> Skeet Ulrich is also effective, since Jack Bull and Jewel (in his film debut) become an attractive act as Sue Lee Shelley. However, it is Jeffrey Wright who stands out in a notable supporting role as Daniel Holt, as well as Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, who brings a chilling threat like that of Christopher Walken to his role as Pitt. In addition, in what amounts to a cameo (a scene), Mark Ruffalo leaves an indelible impression with very little screen time. <br /><br /> The cast includes James Caviezel (Black John), Simon Baker (George Clyde), Tom Guiry (Riley), Tom Wilkinson (Orton Brown), John Ales (Quantrill), John Judd (Otto Roedel) and Kathleen Warfel (Mrs. Chiles). ). The Civil War will forever be an open wound on the nation; but hopefully, as time goes by, it will be through the objective contemplations of filmmakers like Ang Lee and films like &#39;Ride With the Devil&#39; that will ultimately help close the schism and promote healing. In light of the most recent events, it is something that is urgently needed throughout the world. The movie is a powerful medium; It can be educational and entertaining, and perhaps in the future more filmmakers, like Ang Lee, adopt and promote a sense of unity through the sensitive representation of events and attitudes that make us what we are. 8/10. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />']
