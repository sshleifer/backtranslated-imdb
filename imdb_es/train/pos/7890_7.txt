Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare (1991) was the last film that presented Freddy Krueger as a solo act (not as an entity or co-star). Years of murder have taken a toll on the city of Springwood. It has reached the point that the small city has become a virtual ghost town. The parents who killed Freddy Krueger so many years ago have paid the final price. Only the insane inhabit the city and the survivors are scattered everywhere. But that does not stop Freddy from seeking his final revenge. No matter how they try to stop him, he always comes back for more. But this time he learns a little more about his old life. Can children finally stop Freddy forever? What is this secret that is buried in Freddy's twisted mind? to find out you'll have to see the dead of Freddy. the ending was originally filmed in 3-D. <br /> <br /> An adequate way to end the franchise. Freddy learns something about himself and his perverted life and can go out in a blast! Lisa Zane, Yaphet Kotto and Freddy Krueger star in this final installment. Rosanne, Tom Arnold and Johnny Depp make special appearances. Much better than the previous one, but it is full of some old-fashioned jokes. If you like the series, you will not want to miss this one. <br /> <br /> I have to recommend this movie to Freddy fans.
