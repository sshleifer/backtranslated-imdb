Okay, this movie is stupid. I say it in a good way, however. It was stupid on purpose, and it was one of the best "stupid" movies I've seen. The jokes and jokes are intentionally bad, but they were delivered in a way that touched all the right notes with me. The secondary characters were quite superficial and mediocre. There is a fairly weak plot, but it works well. <br /> <br /> Elvira's character is the center of attention here. It is adorable and adorable. Cassandra Petersen has a world of acting talents that simply shines in this movie. In addition to her talent as an actress, she had physical attributes that, frankly, were impressive. Few men could disagree with that. The parts that show his figure were also some of the funniest scenes in the film. <br /> <br /> I had a smile from ear to ear from the first to the last scene. <br /> <br /> Very well Recommended for comedy fans, and for beautiful women fans. I wish they had done a dozen more Elvia movies.
