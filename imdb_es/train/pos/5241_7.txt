Excellent film by Thaddeus O'Sullivan with strong performances by a large number of British and Irish actors. The film deals well with a thorny subject, and effectively captures the hopelessness and grim atmosphere of the 1970s in Belfast. Surprisingly realistic, it does nothing to glorify any of the sides in this conflict. On the one hand, it shows a young Catholic father who tries to raise his family without falling into trouble. On the other hand, he deals with a loyalist gang that intends to spread the violence. Very interesting and, fortunately, entertaining. However, do not expect any laughter. 7 out of 10
