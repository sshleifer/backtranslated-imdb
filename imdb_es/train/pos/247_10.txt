['I love this movie, because it showed that they did not kill for fun, but to save those they loved! Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom did a great job representing Ned and Joe. It has some quick and inappropriate scenes, but it&#39;s fine apart from that. The language is very soft and sometimes you do not even know it&#39;s there. This movie shows that just because they are outlawed does not mean they are vicious murderers! I hope people see this movie and learn about important moments in history like this. One thing that fascinates me about this movie is that they got their inspiration for their armor from a book that Ned looked at! Also that&#39;s how people remember them, from their armor. I hope that people see this movie and be interested as I am.']
