Ghost Story, (The New House) is a terrifying horror story. This is from the Circle of Fear and Ghost Story series of the early seventies. The beginning and end of each story is narrated by Sebastian Cabot. Do you remember it from the first family series, Family Affair in the 1960s? This particular story has Barbara Parkins and David Birney as the main actors, and as the main characters in the story. I saw this recently and I was very scared! If you are alone, I would not recommend you look at it. This story is great, without words of gore or curse, but it is very scary. Barbara Parkins played the young bride. David Birney played her husband. Both actors were very good in their parts. If you like terrifying, funny and terrifying ghost stories, then you will like this little gem. I gave this a high rating. I highly recommend this story.
