This movie is fantastic, as it explores storytelling and fantasy as a child would, for adults. The idea that a child's drawings become a place where he can physically visit and influence them is wonderful. At the same time, I could talk to all the child psychologist and say that he is really exploring his subconscious, just as we do in our dreams when we sleep. What gives me goosebumps is when her dad is in the paper house and chases her. The only thing I can not stand is that it was marketed as a horror movie ... it really is not. If you want to see something British with a lot of history that keeps you guessing without the usual cheap emotions that most movies have to use, then Paperhouse observes.
