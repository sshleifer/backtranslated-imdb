Six Degrees is a wonderful show! I watched the entire season online since I found it and I was terribly disappointed that there will not be a season 2: "(and to top it all, ABC has now disconnected it, so it can not be seen online. Why would ABC create a Such a wonderful show, with a great story line and great characters just to get it out of the air without completing the story ... It seems that it is up to the imagination to discover what happens with all our connected characters, honestly, although I think ABC could at least place the online program for the viewers who enjoyed it while they continue to broadcast over-rated reality TV shows, Six Degrees will miss you.
