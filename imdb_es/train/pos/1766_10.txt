Last night I received a free pass for a preview of this movie and I did not know what to expect. The premise seemed silly and I assumed it would be a lot of superficial humor of virgin's amusement. What a great surprise. I laughed so much I cried for some of the jokes. This film is a must for anyone with an open mind and a slightly twisted sense of humor. Ok ... this is not a movie to go with your grandmother (Jack Palance?) Or small children. The language is dirty, the jokes are (very) rude, and the sexual conversation is as graphic as you will find anywhere. What is surprising, however, is that the film is still a sweet love story. My girlfriend and I loved it. Steve Carell is fantastic, but (like The Office) the supporting cast really makes the movie work. All the characters have their flaws, but they also have depth and sympathy. Everyone gets their weight and the chemistry is perfect. I can not wait to get the DVD. I'm sure he'll be there with Office Space for repeats and citable lines.
