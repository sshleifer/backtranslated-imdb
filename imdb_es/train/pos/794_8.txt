I was very surprised how much I enjoyed this movie. I thought it was fun, sexy, painful and warm. Andie MacDowell's performance was nuanced and vulnerable. For once, the director of a MacDowell movie did not make her another character in the film. The romance between Kate and her young man is lovely to see and develops very well. His relationship with his friends is both a thorn and a balm in his life. Imelda Stalinson, who has been MVP in so many British films, does a great job in this. There is some tragedy in this, but I think the film is saved at the end by the brilliant performance, the clean direction and the ingenious writing. The quality of the film is excellent and the music is also good, although it is not available on the soundtrack.
