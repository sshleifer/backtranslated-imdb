Lindy (Meryl Streep) and her husband Michael (Sam Neill) have just welcomed a girl, Azaria. As Seventh-day Adventists, they live their beliefs every day and soon Azaria is dedicated to God in her church, with her two older children watching. Michael takes vacations and the family decides to go to Ayer's Rock, one of the most impressive tourist places in Australia. Not being rich, the family camps near the site. After a wonderful first day, Lindy puts the baby Azaria to sleep in one of the stores. Suddenly, she listens to Azaria crying. While Lindy rushes to the store, a dingo dog has just come out, shaking her head. The baby is gone and soon, so is the dingo. Although the entire camp searches for the baby, it is not found. Concluding that she is dead and that the dingo took her beloved daughter, the Chamberlain struggle to accept God's decision and continue with their lives. But, unfortunately, the story has a sensational coverage in the media and soon the story goes that Lindy murdered the baby. Later, she is arrested and taken to court. How could this happen? This is a great representation of real events that shows how the "mafia rule" is not a figment of the imagination. The whole country turns against the chamberlains, partly because they are seen as strangers. Streep offers her best performance as the Lindy complex, whose own strong will attitude works against her every step of the way. Neill, likewise, does a wonderful job as the hesitant and confused Michael. The cast is one of the greatest of all time, with representations of people from all over the country who are getting into Lindy's case. The costumes, the stage, the script, the direction and the production are all front line. If you have never seen or heard about this movie, correct it immediately. It is not far from the reality to say that this "weeping" must be seen by all those who care about the film and about the misused power of the media.
