This is one of the best animated movies I've seen in my life. This is not just a funny movie, or a well made movie. This is a milestone in the art of animation and even if it were not, only the technical skill that was acquired to achieve it would give it a place in the history of animation. <br /> <br /> Wladyslaw Starewicz created a stop-motion film about the secret life of beetles. He imagined a coherent world of insects, with jobs, houses, nightclubs, cinemas, even small objects like posters, bicycles and paintings. <br /> <br /> In this film he tells a simple story of hypocrisy and revenge. Mr. Beetle has an affair with a dragonfly that dances, to the chagrin of a grasshopper; but he is a cameraman and decides to shoot the adventure. Mr. Beetle returns home and finds that Ms. Beetle has her own adventure. Mr. Beetle scares off the lover but forgives his wife. The two make up and go to the movies. And the movie they see is Mr. Beetle and the Dragonfly. Described in this way, it sounds banal, but once seen, it becomes an exciting film work. Along with Emile Cohl and Jiri Trnka, Wladyslaw Starewicz practically invented everything that future animators would use in their work. That's why it should not be forgotten.
