I always liked seeing this when it appeared on television during prime time every year in the 60s. It's an epic story typical of Hollywood, dramatized, stylized and full of inaccuracies, but, what? It's an entertaining movie and a good looking movie. Cecil B. DeMille, at the end of his life, is the executive producer of this remake of his 1938 film. The actor of his son-in-law Anthony Quinn, who had the supporting role of Beluche in the film of '38, is the director in his debut as a director and his swan song, since he had never directed a film before and never would again. DeMille brought together a team that had recently worked on his 10 Commandments to help Quinn achieve it, including DeMille producer / actor Henry Wilcoxon, who oversees the project. Also of the 10 Commandments are screenwriter Jesse Lasky, cinematographer Loyalk Griggs, assistant director Francisco Day, director of the second unit Arthur Rosson, art directors Walter Tyler and Hal Pereira, stage directors Sam Comer and Ray Moyer, costume designers Edith Head, John Jensen and Ralph Lester, who as the costume design team received the only Oscar nomination from The Buccaneer. A great cast here from the DeMille team led by Yul Brynner as pirates Jean Lafitte and Charleton Heston as future President General Andrew Jackson. Also in the cast are Charles Boyer, E.G. Marshall, Lorne Greene, Claire Bloom and Inger Stevens. In just over two hours, it crawls in some places, but makes up for it with some excellent battle scenes. I would give it a 7.5 out of 10.
