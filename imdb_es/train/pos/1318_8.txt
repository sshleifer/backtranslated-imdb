I felt compelled to write a review for Space Cobra, as it has received a good score of 7.3 stars, but only some of the reviews at the time of writing this were particularly positive. A strange situation and, hopefully, my positive criticism will point people towards this old and almost forgotten Anime movie. The space cobra is the funky tale of a smuggler and rogue who gets involved with the three sisters of an ancient and dead planet and an evil force that wants to take advantage of the powers of the planets. This is an old movie and the animation shows, but what it lacks in modern sophistication it makes up for with a lot of charm. Space Cobra is very oriented to a Western audience and is very easy to see. There are few references, if any, to the specific Japanese culture and excellent for Anime beginners to see and enjoy. The same Space Cobra is witty and nice. I can not say how much of this is due to English dubbing or the intentions of the creator, but this is one of the few Japanese comedy characters that I find really funny. The style is very barbaric of the sixties with a fantastic soundtrack by Yello. The style is colorful and imaginative and there is a constant action to advance the story. The strangest aspect of this film is how it begins as a comedy and ends with a very strong dramatic note. I can not think of another Anime or general movie that could have done this so perfectly and convincingly. You barely realize what is happening, but it is done in a very subtle way and it seems perfectly natural. You also really feel that the characters went on a trip and that their lives were changed by the whole experience. Take a look if you can.
