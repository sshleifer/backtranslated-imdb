['I&#39;ve been waiting to see cuts from the day I heard about that, which was sometime last year. Anyway, today I could see it, and when the movie started, I thought it started instead of a week, but it got better after about 10 minutes. I thought the movie was pretty good. but what I did not like was how the killer was created, I thought that just before renting it, it would probably stink like the urban legends: the final cut, I almost died. Mainly, everything in UL&#39;s final cut needed to be improved. CUT is 100 times better than UL: final cut. The best part of CUT is the killer and the death scenes. The killer kicks MO F *** ING ASS. <br /><br /> I give a cut of 8 out of 10']
