(It is not necessary to recap the plot, since others have already done so). <br /> <br /> It is understandable that many viewers find flaws in the film, since we are facing the sensational panorama of today's cineplex experience. In that context, a movie like Ecstasy seems to have wandered from another planet. I think there are several reasons why it's worth it. <br /> <br /> The most important thing is that the film develops poetically, since the camera moves slowly over the hills, trees, clouds, etc. that surround him, providing a serene and lyrical sensation of a World that integrates man and woman in his fold. Together, they reveal a style and dimension almost totally lost in today's technology cinema, where fast editing works to divert the attention of the audience and not to concentrate it. In addition, the story is transmitted by eye and not by ear, almost without dialogue to explain what is happening. This amounts to another extreme deviation from today's very literal rate, where visuals only seem to count when they excite the audience. But perhaps most disturbing: the film is sometimes disturbingly silent, not in the sense that silent films are silent, as we hope they are. But in the sense that the characters rarely speak when we expect them to do so. Thus, the burden of history is shared between the filmmaker and the viewer. The first one must choose artistically his images to transmit the narrative, while the second one must think about those images, since they are not going to be explained. <br /> <br /> None of this is intended to belittle the movie today. -manufacturing. It is simply to point out that a film like Machaty comes out of an aesthetic very different from the one we have today. I do not pretend to be better or worse. However, I do affirm that ecstasy represents a very absent perspective in the experience of going to the cinema today, where such contemplative values ​​are usually dismissed as slow and boring. <br /> <br /> The film itself is not a masterpiece, although it sometimes reaches artistic levels, such as in the beautiful and beautiful scene of the beer garden, with its final crane being shot to reveal the exquisite panorama that shows below. The slow trays of the field with their pantheistic celebration of life, nature and regeneration are also beautifully expressed. These are the kind of scenes that do not overwhelm you, instead, you give them a chance, they accumulate silently in a memorable experience in their own way like the variety of "Jaws". <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the film is sometimes heavy handed, as when Machaty stacks images, particularly in the final sequence, ode-to-work. It is difficult to know what to do with this rather disturbing presence. Perhaps the symbolism has to do with the heroic dimension that hard work has for the hero of love and the people in general: a theme promoted by the influential Soviet cinema. Still, his presence here is too tediously exaggerated. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I must admit that initially I tuned in to see the beautiful Hedy LaMarr in the buff. But now I have to admit that in the process I also got a lot more than just a hide-and-seek romp in the woods.
