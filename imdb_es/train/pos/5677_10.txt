The third and, in my opinion, the best of the Blackadder series. <br /> <br /> The only drawback is that there is no Lord Percy who is the funniest character in the previous series, but the Prince Regent of Hugh Laurie is appropriately insane. line. <br /> <br /> As a package, it is of high quality with convincing regency sets, excellent cutting sarcasm and crazy little fragments, the 'macbeth' actors standing out and printing chickens of Prince Georges' luck lucky ones' and the missing words in Dr. Johnson's dictionary. <br /> <br /> Few comedies have been as witty as fun, it's fine, the observation or the strange and unconvincing line comes in but most of it is a scream.
