['`Europe &#39;(or, as it is also known,` Zentropa&#39;) is one of the most impressive films I have seen in my life. The combination of grayscale and color photography is almost perfect ... a true feast for the eyes. The image was a contender for a golden palm of 1991 in Canners. The award went to Barton Fink (of the Coen brothers); A film stylistically very similar to the zentropa. Here is an exercise in class: rent both movies and be a judge for you.']
