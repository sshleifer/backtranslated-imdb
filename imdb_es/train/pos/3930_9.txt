It is notable that for supporters of 'Young Mr. Lincoln', Ford has chosen lesser-known actors, other than stars. This not only increases the focus of his film on the central character of Lincoln, but also gives the public a refreshing vision of Lincoln as a man of his place and time, a tangled man, as each of us, inexorably, is in the Topics and Feelings of your time and looking for your way to solve them. It is not so much through the words and actions of Fonda Lincoln, but in the faces, the reactions of the supporting players that Ford tells the story of the formation of young Lincoln's worldview, the sense of place in society and the policy, and how people responded. The words and deeds of Mr. Lincoln placed their trust in this man whom they considered to have earned their respect and respect. <br /> <br /> Try it: instead of focusing on Henry Fonda, the next time you see 'Young' Mr. Lincoln will focus his attention on the supporting characters: I assume that you will be generously rewarded with a deeper appreciation of both Lincoln like Ford. I like to suspect that Ford's narration through the reactions of the secondary characters to the Fonda Lincoln may have attracted David Lean when he directed Omar Sharif in "Doctor Zhivago", in which the reactions of the secondary characters to Zhivago are the ones that really talk about Zhivago.
