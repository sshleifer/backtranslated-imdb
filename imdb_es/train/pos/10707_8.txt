For a movie that received little publicity and that few people have heard of, this was pretty good. It is another of these modern British crime movies that are extravagant ("Snatch", "Sexy Beast", etc.). It's not wild like "Snatch", but it's interesting and it has some rough characters. <br /> <br /> It also has a cheesy and somewhat predictable ending, but at the beginning of the program, not late, it has some twists ordered to make it very interesting for the viewer for the first time. Basically, this is a low-profile British man who sends a Russian "girlfriend by mail" that ends, with the help of two Russian friends, who give him a couple of big surprises. <br /> <br /> Ben Chapin and Nicole Kidman are co-stars, and they are very good, as are Vincent Cassel and Matthieu Kassovitz as the Russian cohorts of Kidman. This is a different type of film and well acted. Once again, Kidman shows that it is much more than a beautiful face.
