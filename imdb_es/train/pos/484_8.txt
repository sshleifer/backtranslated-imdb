Alexandr "Sascha" Luzhin (John Turturro) is a former leading chess player who tries to return in a tournament organized by Italy. His brilliance is unquestionable, but his obsession with chess has stunted his growth in all other aspects of his life. Natalia (Emily Watson) is a beautiful heiress who has come to the same place with her mother, Vera (Geraldine James) to look for possible marriage partners. Vera leans toward a handsome earl but, surprisingly, Natalia is more fascinated by Sascha, whom she met on a walk. Sascha, too, is taken with Natalia and proposes marriage at their second meeting. But, with the concentration that Sascha must give to the chess matches and, with other events in her past that still cause problems, will Natalia's heart win? Oh, and can he also become the chess champion? This is a lovely movie, based on a novel by Nabokov. The performance is amazing, with Watson very well as the beautiful rich girl and Turturro with absolute perfection as the shy and clumsy chess enthusiast. James takes a pretty nice turn since the dominant mother and the other cast members are also wonderful. As for the appearance of the movie, it could not be better. The landscape is of the variety to put you in view, the vintage costumes are beautiful and the cinematography deserves a lot of applause. Yes, the story is unusual and it has the use of flashbacks, sometimes, so it is a movie that not everyone will appreciate. Then, too, the ending is bittersweet. However, if you love romance, vintage pieces, great acting, spectacular scenery or the art of creating movies, do not miss it. You will be helpless in resisting your multitude of charms.
