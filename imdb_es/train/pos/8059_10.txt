I just saw this movie in Turner Classic Movies last night and I was surprised by the performance of Victor McLaglen: in every sense of the word "tour de force". The atmosphere of 1922 in Dublin evoked through cinematography and production design really foreshadowed the techniques used in the best films of the 40s and early 50s. Very good attention to detail too, during the wake of Frankie McPhillip ( Wallace Ford), all who are in mourning are praying. Gaelic. Max Steiner's score is unforgettable. As in later films such as GWTW in 1939, he appropriated popular ballads to give local color and a sense of place and time. John Ford: already a giant of the cinema in 1935!
