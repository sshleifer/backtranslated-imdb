It's depressing to see where Jackie Chan has ended up. It used to be an unstoppable hurricane of kicks, kicks and incredible stunts. To be fair, he is now in his fifties and one would expect some slowdown. But with 'Rush Hour 3', where he takes the back seat to Chris Tucker (of all people!), And then there is 'Kung Fu Panda' where not only is he in a purely vocal role but his character has hardly any dialogue. .. to say that Jackie Chan has seen better days is a colossal understatement. <br /> <br /> It's at times like this when the only solution is to take out an old dusty VHS tape and watch Jackie kick some asses on her youngest son. , installers, Chris Tucker's free days. <br /> <br /> Enter 'Police History'. Jackie Chan plays Kar-kui, a policeman whose job it is to protect a witness before a major trial. He faces the resistance of both the non-cooperative witness and the numerous assassins sent by the mob to silence them both. <br /> <br /> But, on the other hand, who cares? We do not watch Jackie Chan's films for the story. We watch them to see Jackie Chan perform incredible stunts and, in general, hit and kick many people who are less impressive than him. <br /> <br /> And at that level, 'Police Story' does not disappoint everyone. There is an impressive confrontation in a shopping mall at the end that culminates in Jackie sliding down a giant high-voltage spider. Seriously, if this kind of thing happened more often, no man would need to persuade himself to go buy clothes. <br /> <br /> There is also comedy, much of which involves Kar-kui who inadvertently bothers May (Maggie Cheung), his eternally suffering and apparently always forgiving his girlfriend. The mood in general is quite subtle, but it works, so I'm not complaining. <br /> <br /> The performance is not very subtle either. In fact, I'm not sure there was anything subtle in the "History of the police". Director Jackie Chan (yes, he does too) clearly has a deep understanding of why we watch her movies, and she knows that while we wait for the next fight to start, the last thing we want is to look for nuances and nuances. Depth and internal meaning. <br /> <br /> Then, 'Police Story' is an explosion. As is the case with most of his films, the fact that Jackie really does what he sees on the screen puts him well above the competition. I mean, when Jackie Chan is really hanging from a bus at full speed for an umbrella, a new "Wow!" Factor is added to the action.
