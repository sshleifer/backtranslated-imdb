In general, I'm not a big fan of stop-motion movies and at first RUKA did not catch my attention. However, knowing that this film was made in the repressive Czechoslovakia during the era of Soviet domination, the more I watched the film, the more I realized how subversive this innocent-looking little film was. This subtext really made the film come alive and gives it a real staying power, both as a work of art and as a political statement. <br /> <br /> The sad little film is made without any dialogue, but it is quite clear what it is. happening. A nice little wooden man is making a clay pot and has a lot of fun when suddenly a nosy animated hand appears that destroys the pot, turning it into a one-hand sculpture. Well, the wooden man tries again and again to chase away his hand and do his thing. However, over time the hand becomes increasingly insistent and eventually cages the man. And, in the end, the man is dead thanks to the meddling hand and the hand, in a sign of real hypocrisy, gives the man a hero's funeral. <br /> <br /> As I said, this movie is an obvious attempt by the brave Jir√≠ Trnka to criticize his ruling government. Not surprisingly, although the Czechs loved the film and gave it critical acclaim, the state (ie the hand) forbade this little parable. Sadly, Trnka did not live to see her liberated nation a little more than two decades later, during the so-called "Velvet Revolution".
