I will not repeat everything that other viewers of this film have already said. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is an excellent film, not only as a very human account of the developing relationship between a father and his adult son, but also as a small window into the world of practicing Islam, for those like me who are not very familiar with that religion. <br /> <br /> An important aspect of this story is that of the young man's relationship with his father's beliefs and practices, and how his attitude towards religion seems to be altered subtly as we move forward on his journey with they. <br /> <br /> This is very stimulating, enjoyable and well done Movie that I would recommend to anyone with brains and hearts.
