In one of the best works of Neil Simon. Creaky, the former Vaudeville stars played by Walter Matthau and George Burns are teaming up for a special television comedy. The problem is that they have not even been seen in more than a decade. Filled with Zippy One liners and within jokes in the world of entertainment, this story flies with a constant flow of humor. Good work also from Richard Benjamin as a harassed nephew, Rosetta LeNoire as a nurse and Howard Hesseman as commercial director of television. Steve Allen and Phyllis Diller appear as themselves. Trivia note: The first montage contains images of the Hollywood Revue of 1929 and shows Marie Dressler, Bessie Love, Polly Moran, Cliff Edwards, Charles King, Gus Edwards and the Brox sisters singers.
