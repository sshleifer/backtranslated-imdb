The story of a vagrant, his sheep ranch boss and his boss's daughter is not for everyone, but it's still very intriguing. It takes place in the beautiful country of New Zealand, among the landscapes that we have come to know so well through other films of this region. <br /> <br /> This was the first time I saw the excellent Mary. Regan, and I've been a fan of her ever since. The cast also contains Bruno Lawrence, who is probably best remembered by the American public in the movie "Smash Palace." Terence Cooper becomes the owner of the ranch that pays too much attention to his daughter (Regan). <br /> <br /> He acted with force, with unforgettable performances of all his potential clients. The first time I saw this movie in extremely edited form on the night television of the United States, but believe me, the unpurified version can not be lost.
