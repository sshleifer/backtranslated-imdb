['In 2006, &quot;In Cold Blood&quot;, a fascinating thriller from 1967, has two interesting new contexts that it did not have before. First, and most chilling, is the fact that his star, Robert Blake, was recently on trial for murdering his wife. Second, the recent Oscar-winning biopic, &quot;Capote,&quot; showed the confusing story of Truman Capote, the author of this disturbing and real crime. These two new twists make the film timely for a modern audience. <br /><br /> As an independent film of its time, &quot;In Cold Blood&quot; is first class in every way. Most notable is the impressive black and white cinematography of Conrad Hall (later known as &quot;American Beauty&quot; and &quot;Road to Perdition&quot;). Many of the stills of this film from the Kansas lodge at night or from the tree-lined back roads could be sold as artistic photography. Combined with the direction of Brooks Jack and the excellent editing in the first scenes (where we see the daily life of the innocent family about to be sacrificed without sense, beautifully intertwined with the conspiracy of the two defenseless murderers), a rich atmosphere is created of restlessness created that sets the stage to remove the suspense (even when everyone knows how all this will end because everything is based on real-life events). It is also great to see in this era how a heartbreaking murder scene can be brilliantly portrayed where the graphic nature of the act is conveyed to the viewer subliminally without a drop of blood shown on the screen. <br /><br /> The film is also very well anchored by the strange performance of Robert Blake as the most sympathetic but senseless brutal side of the murderous duo. The flashbacks to his horrible childhood are extremely well done. Then there is the scene towards the end of the film where he talks to the reverend before being sent to the gallows and makes his last &quot;confession&quot;, so to speak. It is one of those moments of classic films that is a perfect marriage of gritty performance, excellent writing, impeccable direction and disturbing photography. I encourage you to erase from your mind the raw image of the reflection of the rain from the window that flows down the pale face of Robert Blake instead of the real tears. <br /><br /> The only thing that hinders &quot;In Cold Blood&quot; is the slow act in movement in which the murderers are in the street and the forced nature of the social comments at the end. The added political message about the death penalty is secondary to its convincing description of the crazy murderers and their prey.']
