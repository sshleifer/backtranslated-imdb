The legendary Boris Karloff finished his illustrious career by making four low-cost clowns in Mexico. This is the Gothic terror entry of the token token period of the group. Karloff offers a typically elegant and dignified performance as Matthias Morteval, an old and eccentric patriarch who invites several of his relatives, small, greedy and dying, to his ruined and dilapidated castle for the reading of a will. Very soon, the odious guests are hit by life-sized lethal toy people who populate the place. The old Mexican sex symbol Andrés García, from the infamy of "Tintorera", portrays the police hero and Julissa seems absolutely dazzling as the only pleasant female character. The clumsy, laborious (no) address, trivial script of the numbers, ugly, outlandish cinematography, ridiculous series of murders (a fat ass is blown directly in the face with a miniature cannon!) A morbid atmosphere of gloom, in Much of the bad action (Karloff remarkably excepted), soft and cheesy gore, poor dubbing and stirring fiery conclusion, give this terribly delicious lemon a charming charm and, therefore, strangely funny. A true campy hoot.
