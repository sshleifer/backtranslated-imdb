['A manned flying saucer (literally) by a team of about 20 male space explorers travels hundreds of millions of light years from Earth to register in a colony founded about 25 years ago on a &quot;forbidden planet&quot;. What they find is a robot more advanced than anything imaginable on earth, a beautiful and totally socially inept young woman, and her father, a hermit philologist chased by more than the demons of the ancient civilization into which he has submerged. <br /><br /> On the surface, this story is a murder mystery science fiction pulp. Some compare it to Shakespeare&#39;s tempest, but this is a stretch and, somehow, an insult to the science fiction genre. Stripped of what makes it a science fiction movie, for sure, it&#39;s The Tempest, but how many hundred movies can you say something similar? <br /><br /> Below, this is a warning story about progress and technology and the social evolution necessary for its proper and safe use. However, the film still continues with all the hope for our future that we have come to expect from programs like Star Trek. <br /><br /> Anne Francis is not the only reason why this film is best described as beautiful. The special effects, and even the aesthetics of the background backgrounds, are powerful enough to make uninspired leadership and uneven performance almost imperceptible. If it were not for the retro art nonsense of the 1950s science fiction props, you might think you were watching a piece from the 1960s. <br /><br /> This is a classic of that very special subgenre of science fiction that I like to call science fiction of the 50s and, although I do not think that the best is a must for anyone interested in science fiction movies and special programs. Effects It is worth paying attention to the intelligent plot, now trilled by its reuse in six or seven episodes of Star Trek, Lost in Space and even Farscape, and it will keep the interest of the majority of scifi fans. Trekkers will be particularly interested in the various aspects of the film that seem to have inspired the themes of the original Star Trek series that aired 12 years later, although they may be disappointed by the (relatively soft) sexism of 1950 and the lack of any type of racial integration. While I do not want to say anything, the lack of social progress that is manifested in this movie was the main problem I had with her. <br /><br /> Some will probably watch this movie just to catch a glimpse of young and attractive Leslie Nielsen in one of her first leading roles. Unfortunately, Nielsen&#39;s performance is only average and, at times, poor (especially at the climax of the movie). Walter Pigeon, although quite excellent in other films, also fulfills his function. Francis, Earl Holliman and the incredible Robby the Robot are the most outstanding actors of this crowd, although in general the character actors that make up the group do a good job. The problems with the highlighted performances, I believe, are the fault of the director and editor, like anything else. Although they certainly guessed most of the movie.']
