The film has a great history of written genre. It has all the usual Columbo ingredients; The way Lieutenant Columbo approaches and joins his suspect, the way the mystery unravels for him, the Columbo dog, the game of cat and mouse, which is great in this case and, fortunately, , also a bit of good humor for relief, mainly related to the character Columbo. Everything is written despite the fact that it does not even have a truly original concept. Columbo hunting a detective / writer of murder novels had been made more than once before in a Columbo movie. <br /> <br /> It is also a very well directed film by James Frawley, who after that directed another 5 Columbo films, in the 70s and 80s. He provided the film with style and some really cool and memorable sequences. <br /> <br /> It is one of the Columbo films that move more slowly, despite not having a long execution time. This style and approach does not always work well for a Columbo movie, but in this film it does, which may not be at all thanks to the film's performances. <br /> <br /> Most of Columbo's films also did not star in a well-known big star or star in the early days of filmmaking, like his killer's movie. This film stars the unknown 81-year-old Ruth Gordon. She did not star in many films throughout her career, but some know her well, mainly because of her role in "Rosemary's Baby," which also earned her an Oscar. He had a realistic acting style and something unusual, that some people would not like. She earned her 4 Oscar nominations throughout her career, before her victory for "Rosemary's Baby" in 1969. She also has a great interaction with Peter Falk in her sequences. <br /> <br /> The movie also The stars of a young GD Spradlin. I say young because I only know him for his last productions out of his career, even though he was already 57 years old at the time of this Columbo production. He is still alive but retired from acting, since 1999. <br /> <br /> An entry of the Columbo movie even better than usual. <br /> <br /> 8/10
