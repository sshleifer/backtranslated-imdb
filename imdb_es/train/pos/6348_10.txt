Jim Carrey is good as always, and although there are quite a few "Jim Carrey moments", it's definitely not a "Jim Carrey movie". <br /> <br /> It is mainly aimed at children, and I managed to enjoy it as such a movie. It was promoted in Israel as another Jim Carrey movie, so those who expected a rare comedy were disappointed. <br /> <br /> The movie has good times and works well as a movie for children. I can not say that I LOVE this movie, but again I am not your target audience!
