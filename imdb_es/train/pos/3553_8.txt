Guys and Dolls is a movie that wants a remake. It was made forty-eight years ago. Its two main stars are dead or 409 pounds. Although a remake, with big stars now, would be a blockbuster, it could not capture the magic that came into this version. Its unlimited energy can not be recovered, nor the sheer joy that comes from seeing something like this: a great wide-screen entertainment movie. <br /> <br /> Marlon Brando (the last time he recorded a speed of 409 lbs the last time I heard) plays Sky Masterson, one of the biggest players in New York. Frank Sinatra is Nathan Detroit, whose fucking game as often as he can-find-a-very easy to use is famous throughout the city. However, when the only place left to keep him is to charge $ 1,000, Detroit needs the money quickly. He bets Masterson $ 1,000 who can not take missionary Sarah Brown (Jean Simmons) to Havana with him the next day. <br /> <br /> Guys and Dolls is nothing more than nasty guys who sing and dance, which usually, as it does here, add to the fun. It is obvious to see how it was a Broadway musical: there were not so many sets and the scenes were long. If I complained about one thing, it's how uneven the songs were. Sometimes, there were two songs in one scene; Other times, thirty minutes passed without one. Guys and Dolls is never boring, just a good time. <br /> <br /> My rating: 8/10 <br /> <br /> It has not been rated.
