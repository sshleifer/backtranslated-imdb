Michigan, Edgar Allen Poe, a toaster and a frying pan. . . If you do not mind the genre of horror movies and psychopaths, and you have a special place in your heart for the twisted, this is the movie for you. A surprisingly well-developed first film, "I Hate a Minute," has all the appeal of major hits like "Silence of the Lambs" and cult classics like "Army of Darkness." The editing and effects are well done, better than many films in the genre. Kallio weaves an intricate history of torments drawing both the Bible and Poe's writings. At a time when the big budget, the big-name films lack a lot of substance, the independent film has resurrected this moribund trait. If you love Michigan, a good story or a decent thriller, check out "I hate a minute."
