['I really enjoyed this documentary about Kenny and Spencer&#39;s attempt to release &quot;The Dawn&quot;. It was a great look at how outsiders try to get inside to make it big. <br /><br /> The story was well put together and organized in an interesting way that made the film flow well. Certainly worth a watch. My only complaint is that there seems to be no closing. Maybe that&#39;s part of the point. We expect it but in reality that is not what happened (or it usually happens). <br /><br /> The movie is also an excellent way to see the personality of Kenny and Spencer outside of their Canadian television show. You can see a little of what is to come. <br /><br /> I hope to have the opportunity to see The Papal Hunt.']
