Doubling it as Beckham is full of intriguing scenes, but it has a predictable stroy line in general. It is about a girl named Jess who is trying to achieve her lifelong dream of becoming a famous soccer player and finally has the opportunity when she is offered a position on a local team. There are so many limits and limitations that she faces that they retain her, but she is still determined and hard working. I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good light movie and wants to be inspired by what people can achieve. The song options are really good, 'shut up, my son, just keep going ... to your destiny and you create limits and complications'. Anyway, I hope it has been helpful for your needs in a review. Double as the great Beckham movie
