When all the aspects of the film are added: dance, sing, act, the only one that stands out as the best of the cast is Vanessa Williams. Her dedication, energy and eternal beauty make Rosie the. Perfect paper for her. I've never seen someone portray Rose with such vitality! The talent for the song of Vanessa is shown to perfection with all the songs she plays as Rose and her acting skills never cease to amaze me. Her dance is so amazing, even if some people say that the choreography was bad, her dance skills were better than ever! I recommend this version instead of '63 only because I find that, although Vanessa's performance is long, it's excellent, not to mention the fact that Jason Alexander and the rest of the cast are also very impressive (with the exception of Chynna Philips .. What the hell were you thinking when they released it?) <br /> <br /> In general, I would say that this version is wonderful and I recommend that everyone see it.
