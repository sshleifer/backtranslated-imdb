['This movie really deserves more recognition than its obtaining. It really is an impressive and rich portrait of blood ties, favors and loyalties within the world of crime. The film is recorded to perfection and delves into all the classic themes of crime, such as betrayal and power. This film is a movie for spectators, it requires attention, understanding and rewards at the end. He is the godfather of Hong Kong and is a welcome change instead of another wire combat, epic martial arts that seems to be the biggest contribution to the world of Hong Kong and Chinese cinema. It has an arrangement of great characters, actors and development, although it is fair to say that I had to see it twice just to detect what was happening with some of the characters due to their many interactions in the film. In total, 8/10 Great characters of the plot, but there are characters that do not stand out enough and that the music did not really cheer me up and, at times, I felt that it did not synchronize well with the action (there is action by the way ) so he loses some points for that.']
