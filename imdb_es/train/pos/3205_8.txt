I saw this in the theater and instantly I thought it was good enough to have it in a video. However, anyway I'm a fan of science fiction action movies. <br /> <br /> Without revealing any of the stories, it's worth seeing if you like science fiction without having to think a lot. The story is basic, and the plot is very good. It's worth seeing! <br /> <br /> Maybe they'll make a sequel? :) <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
