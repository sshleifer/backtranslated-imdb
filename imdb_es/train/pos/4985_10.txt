People do not seem to give Lensman enough credit when it's due. Some issues that are key to understanding Lensman's experience have been overlooked. <br /> <br /> The year: for the year it was made (1984), Lensman presents some of the most impressive effects I've seen. As a person who sees a lot of animation from the early 1980s, Lensman is unique in his use of what appears to be computer-generated images at a time when computers were extremely primitive. Kim's battle against the geometrically cut pods in the laser maze can be taken as an excellent example of this. Every time I see that I have to repeat to myself that it was in 1984 when it was made. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack: Lensman has one of the craziest soundtracks I've ever heard, and this crazy hysteric. The rhythm permeates every corner of the film. Lensman lent himself greatly to two Western errors and managed to deal a little with the first: the need to fill every second of silence in a movie with music and the need for a heroine. While the music is well tuned and galvanizes scenes such as the battle of motorcycles at Thionite Factory in Radelyx, the theme of the heroine fails due to the great value of Chris. It is interesting to note that constant music thwarted my attempts to eliminate noise when I was archiving the lensman from an analog tape to a digital format, since there was not a single second of silence available to use as a reference point. <br /> <Br /> Western Influences: Helmut - sounds like "helmet" and has roughly the same voice as Darth Vader. Clarissa Fairborn: has the same hairstyle as the princess of SW and her name sounds suspiciously similar to Marissa Fairborn of Transformers. Assume the role of Solo Solos flying the boat and having some technical knowledge. Buzzkirk - a definite improvement in Chewbaka. The lens: a nice concrete copy of the force that appears less as an opportunity to preach Christianity in the audience than in the original SW. While strength was based on belief much more than concentration, the lens is a tool of pure concentration. Theoretically, anyone could handle the lens. The lens is much more limited than the Force: it is purely a defensive / offensive weapon. Technology: the Boskone alliance has interesting meatball sponge boats. They look like stormtroopers with only red uniforms instead of white ones. The idea of ​​a DNA weapon was nice if it had only developed. The Galactic Alliance resembled the Starblazers (or whatever it was called, the series of the 60s in which they fought against the Xylons). There were not enough battles from ship to ship for me; This was greatly improved in the second Lensman movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, a note about Worzel. This character is a unique and very interesting character design that, fortunately, continues with the second movie. <br /> <br />
