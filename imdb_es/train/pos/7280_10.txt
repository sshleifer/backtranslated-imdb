To see this as a child. Although he probably finds it horrible now, it was a bit creepy since he was only seven years old. I also remember having worked on a puzzle on Saturday afternoon while watching it, so I was not paying much attention. However, the scene with the rolling rocks has been recorded in my mind ever since. I have asked many people if they have seen this movie but without success. 12 years ago, one person mentioned that he had possibly seen it, but thought it was simply a dream; A fancy whim like the wind. It is not a dream, my friend. Not dreaming now. Again, I have not seen it since, but I can not wait to find a copy and put it in my VCR. Everything that can remain embedded in my mind for 23 years deserves a '10'.
