I had never seen this program before, although it was highly recommended by my family members. Interestingly, my girlfriend lives in Hadfield (the place of filming) and she pointed out some reference points when I first visited. <br /> <br /> This sparked my interest, so I bought the first series on video and sat down to watch. Besides recognizing some of the places, I was not surprised in the least. Once again, the BBC was responsible for producing another example of the best comedy in the world. TLOG is easily classified as Red Dwarf, Fawlty Towers and Monty Python as the best. <br /> <br /> Suffice it to say that I am hooked to the program now. The characters are excellent and show an unusual depth while retaining a realistic edge. The appearance of the program is perfect and reflects the sometimes somber feeling of the North (without disrespecting Hadfield, I found a very cozy and warm place). <br /> <br /> I just hope he continues with his originality throughout his career (which is based on the second series that ended his replay in the UK last night, it certainly is). <br /> <br /> Well done, the BBC!
