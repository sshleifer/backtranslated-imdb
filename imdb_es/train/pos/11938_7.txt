I enjoy movies like this because of its spirit, without a play on words. It's a decent, clean movie about a baseball team that is lagging behind, and a young fan wants them to win, since his father told him that was the only way he would come back for him. <br /> <br /> The spirit shines in two ways: a fun cast with Danny Glover and a young Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and the heavenly herald Al, who takes the dynamic form of Christopher Lloyd. It is an energetic movie. It makes you smile, and it really gets you involved in sports. <br /> <br /> There is my complaint. The only thing that bothers me a little is these sports movies that make you an unexpected fan for the team. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that. It just seems strange to me that I leave the movie thinking that the Angels are a strong and great team, when in reality my basic loyalty, as it is, resides in the Toronto Blue Jays. It's interesting, really. If it's just a movie about a team of non-favorite children, then that's fine.
