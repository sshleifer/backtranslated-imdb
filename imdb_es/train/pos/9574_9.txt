This has to be one of the best movies that come out of HK in a long time, I was anxiously waiting to get this movie in my hands just looking at the title. Lots of fantastic actors in this program and I was particularly impressed by the incredibly incredible behavior of Sam Lee and Edison's portrait of a murderous machine, which completely reversed his image as a normal idol. I would definitely recommend it to those who are looking for an elegant and action-packed film. However, I must warn you that it is also a depressing movie, since all the characters in the film are in a kind of dead end and their own problems, and struggle to breathe. It makes you think about what life really is.
