"Such a Long Journey" is a well-designed film, a good photo shoot and a showcase for some good performances. However, the story is a mix of subplots and characters so peculiar that it becomes a kind of Jack of all plots and master of none. In addition, Western audiences will probably find a bit more esoteric of the Parsee culture, something more than obscure, so that their arms move in 1.7 hours. Recommended for those interested in India.
