['There is a story, but more essentially, the world of this movie starts in chaos and gets organized in the course of ten minutes. <br /><br /> It is a celebration of life and an optimistic affirmation of objective and good truth. Representing along an unexplored axis in the previous cinema, this film should be taught in all high schools. <br /><br /> * CHIASMUS *']
