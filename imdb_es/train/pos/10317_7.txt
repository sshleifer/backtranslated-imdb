Do you know how Star Trek fans went to all the Star Trek movies, even the really bad ones? Why? To see their heroes in action once more. That's what I feel for Doc Savage. I'm a big fan of the character, and the prospect of seeing Doc and his team on an adventure was overwhelming. And the first 20 minutes of the movie only increased that sense of anticipation. Then they decided to create elements of several adventures of Doc and throw them into this movie, which resulted in a somewhat disjointed movie. Here there is much promise, diluted by a series of unfortunate choices (music, elements of the "camp", etc.) But the spirit of Doc is there, and that is what those of us familiar with Doc and his team respond to. . So, on my way, what I'm trying to say is that this is not a bad movie: it's just not as good as it should have been. And anyone who is a fan of Superman, James Bond, Indiana Jones, Buckaroo Banzai and many other characters should see this movie just to get acquainted with the hero who gave them all inspiration.
