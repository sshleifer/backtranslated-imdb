['I want to warn you that there is a very bittersweet quality in this comment. Also, this comment will be much more meaningful to you after you have seen the movie. <br /><br /> Although it is tragically sad to say, that movie bears a resemblance to my life that is so surprising that it is very scary. The rest of you will never know how accurately that film describes how people who have been in situations like that act and react in their later lives. <br /><br /> This could not have been a work of fiction; It had to be based on personal experience. <br /><br /> My testimony of how good the movie was is shown in the fact that, although it was one of the best movies I&#39;ve seen, seeing my life represented on the silver screen was such a painful experience that I will never be able to see it again. <br /><br /> But I sincerely recommend it to everyone else as an opportunity to look into the soul of another human being to the extent that you have probably never experienced it before or will never again. I know for sure, because that is my soul that you will be observing.']
