As with a group of boys at school, we should make a gesture of approval. Even the Grim Ripper made us smile. Those two strange things made me laugh, Bill and Ted were the most stupid and funny of the whole movie. This is much better than the first. And yet, for some reason I feel that something is lost. Something big. Something important. He made a better house and girlfriends. No, I would say better villains. Use clones instead of robots. I gave this one 7 out of 10 because of those two robotic shots. <br /> <br /> The Grim Ripper, do not be scared, it's not the deadly type, it's fun. When he fell from the sky, I broke my stomach. Splat, I'm not sure of those aliens. Where are they Scientists? No way.
