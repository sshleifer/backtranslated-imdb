I have not seen this in more than 20 years, but I still remember things about it. <br /> <br /> This movie could not have been done in color. Light grays are the ones that do it, and was life really that simple in the 1950s? What stands out most in my memory is that Perry Smith goes to the gallows. His breathing under the hood just before they came out of the trap. I do not think I can see that again ... once is enough. It's like that anonymous guy at the beginning of "Papillon" who is dragged terrified to the guillotine. The guy who said he saw this on a double bill with "Dead Man Walking" should also have added the last 10 minutes of "I Want To Live." <br /> <br /> Some of my ancestors who were "aristos" went to the guillotine in 1794-95, so my feelings about the death penalty are quite intense.
