I love bad movies. Not only because they are often as entertaining as "really" good films (like the Pirates of the Caribbean series and other Hollywood movies), but they are often much better than those movies. And that's the reason why I love Italian cinema in the 70s and 80s. And that's the reason why I love especially this movie, The Barbarians & the Company. <br /> <br /> Director Ruggero Deodato has made some really good films, like House on the Edge of the Park, and also his Interceptors Atlantis and Live Like a Cop, Die Like a Man are nice action movies. But this is really bad. The barbarians is such an idiot movie. Peter and David Paul as the barbarian brothers Kutchek and Gore are very funny, due to their lack of charisma and acting skills. But if they can not act, they scream and scream every time they do something important. In one scene, people try to hang the Barbarian Brothers, and escape in a very extraordinary way. <br /> <br /> Bad acting, bad special effects, very stupid story, bad direction, really everything is bad in this movie. I can not describe how much I laughed when I saw this first time. The Barbarians & the Company is a classic of the camp that everyone should see once. If you thought that Plan 9 From Outer Space is a fun camp, this will be a real killer.
