The writer / director Peter M. Cohen portrays for the first time a hilarious and insightful perspective of the world of dating. The story unfolds when the four male protagonists meet weekly at the local restaurant to discuss their dating problems. We meet Brad: a Wall Street playboy with quick wit and a sharp tongue; Zeek: a cynical, sensitive writer; Jonathan: a good sexually perplexed boy with an affinity for hand creams and masturbation; and Eric: the married man, who appreciates his weekly meetings with his single friends in the hope of getting some enlightenment for his boring and banal marital existence. The trials and tribulations of the lives of men in New York are expressed in a funny way, reflecting that of Sex in the City and the new HBO comedy The Mind of Married Man, and they provide a shrewd light for fraud. The story takes a turn when the three singletons meet Mia, played artfully by Amanda Peet, and everyone falls in love with her. She seduces each one with her strange ability to adjust to the personalities they exhibit. When they realize that they have met and fallen in love with the same woman, they chose her because of their friendship. Whipped is a realistic portrait of the world of dating, one that the critic did not recognize. In simple language, they lost the point. The protagonists here are cartoons of real people. The exaggerations are hysterical, they mix satire and humility, and should not be taken as seriously as the critic's contempt suggests. Watch this movie, you will laugh from beginning to end.
