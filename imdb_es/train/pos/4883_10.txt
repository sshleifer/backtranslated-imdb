We, as a family, were so delighted with 'The Last of the Blonde Bombshells' that we bought a copy for our home video library. <br /> <br /> The performance is A1 and the cast contains many favorite actors and singers. The theme is unusual and the script well written. The music / songs are timeless and it takes us back to our young days when we sing the songs at the top of our voices. Summarizing the story here would ruin the "plot", since it is really nice to sit back and enjoy the story as it unfolds. Anyone who is looking for a laugh and a lot of music.
