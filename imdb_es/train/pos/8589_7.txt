I will be honest, I finally verified this movie not by the stars, although they were reasonably visible and convincing, in particular by the three protagonists, or even by the convincing story of a breach in the Presidential Secret Service (something I have been informed through the extras DVD of this program has not yet happened, assuming it's true, it's extraordinary!). I got it because it was run and it has a choice from none other than Detective Meldrick Lewis! Well, it's okay, Clark Johnson, one of my favorites from "Homicide: Life on the Street" and a veteran (mostly) television director. I would say that he does it as well as he can with a project that can be seen, but quite average, despite the possibilities. <br /> <br /> The veteran and ace Secret agent Pete Garrison (Michael Douglass) has to find out. whoever is blackmailing him and who killed his friend, attacked and blew up an Air Force One helicopter and is firing for the Prez. (David Rasche, does anyone remember "Sledgehammer"?). Your relationship with the first lady (Kim Basinger, clearly one of the first HOTTER ladies we've had, fictitious or real) is certainly not helping her position. He has to discover the true mole in the service and avoid the hunting dog as hunting for his former best friend and fellow agent and boss (Kiefer Sutherland, almost completely in "24" mode). Add to other agents of the Service (Martin Donovan and the astute, something difficult to buy like Eva Longorria's concert) and somber foreign characters and has a fairly standard political thriller that does not aim as high as it pretends and achieves the desired one, if the results They are disappointing. <br /> <br /> The summary line is about the best way to describe how this program develops without giving spoilers. The DVD extras seemed more insightful and interesting than the movie, although the film itself was entertaining enough to keep most (myself included) interested.
