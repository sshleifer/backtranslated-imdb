I always follow the Dakar, so when my husband bought the Charlie Race to Dakar DVD, I could not wait to see it! Of course, we had seen the broadcast of the race when the real race started, but that never gives the background and specific equipment. <br /> <br /> If you saw Long Way Round, then you will not be surprised. the language that frankly seems to me more fun than offensive. <br /> <br /> I think the only thing that bothered me about the DVD was Charlie's hair, but he had a style before Dakar, so my feminine need for neatness was mitigated; Tho could have lived without the "flames" und lol As with LWR, the preparation was as interesting as the race itself. I almost cried when Charlie broke his hand, and I made a face for every bruise he suffered while training ... and of course the death of Andy Caldicott ... it was a terrible tragedy, but then every year there is something. <br /> <br /> Russ drives me crazy, although his attitude has improved a thousand times over the cynical argumentative that was in LWR. It's great to see him get along so well now with Charlie. <br /> <br /> What I learned from this odyssey was: 1. never let Scorpion prepare your vehicle for ANYTHING! - they had months to prepare the X5, and even the day before the team went to Lisbon, Scorpion had only done half of the things that had to be done, and the vehicle was a pain throughout the race; 2. The organizers of the Dakar must put a lot more work into their driver / driver recovery plan, leaving Matt (and presumably a large number of other drivers / drivers to dry them the way they did) was nothing less than culpable negligence; 3. Charlie has an endearing enthusiasm for the 'hard and tough' adventure, but he needs to tighten up a lot to really act as he would like, and finally, 4. Charlie and Ewan are planning another of these events called Long Way Down in 2007, and No I can wait to get my hands on it: D If you love bicycles and / or really nice guys 'have a chance', you have to see this, I guarantee you will love it. It is very entertaining. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, for Simon Pavey: you sir is a hero, I was so impressed by his "silent achievement" and the fact that it really is over ... simply amazing, considering how difficult What is this career? And, for Charlie, Matt and the rest of the team, thank you very much for doing it. To think that a relatively green team could have accomplished so much is truly admirable. You are all wonderful.
