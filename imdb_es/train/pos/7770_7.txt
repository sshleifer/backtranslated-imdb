"Written in the Wind" is a melodrama by Douglas Sirk. Douglas Sirk was rediscovered by "Cahiers du Cinema", Fassbinder, etc., which qualified him as a master director. I think it's due to the sophistication of his cinematography. "Written on the Wind" offers exquisite color images and beautiful decorations. . But I wonder: is this enough to carry a movie? The performance in "Written on the Wind" varies from weak to regular (with the exception of Robert Stack, it is convincing as the weak and spoiled playboy). Lauren Bacall, normally a powerful presence on the screen, is a mistake in this movie. Dorothy Malone as the seductress, the "femme fatale" free of worries is fine, but lacks the strength for the role. Rock Hudson is efficient but insensitive. <br /> <br /> The plot has very interesting ingredients. The main characters are: <br /> <br /> A stiff patriarch <br /> <br /> his alcoholic son Kyle (Robert Stack) (never loved by the disappointed father) <br /> <br /> his frustrated and the nymphomaniac daughter Marylee (Dorothy Malone) <br /> <br /> Lucy (Lauren Bacall) - a woman of principles, formerly secretary and now married to Kyle <br /> <br /> Mitch (Rock Hudson) - brought Together with Kyle and loved by the patriarch. <br /> <br /> Secrets beyond the door, a love triangle, frustration, fights, laughter, death, etc. Well, when I read the summary of the story on the back cover of the DVD, I thought I was waiting for a treat. My mistake! Why? I will try to explain: "Written in the wind" is taken seriously and tries to tell a dramatic story. As I said before, acting, in general, is not good enough, intensity is lacking. There are many strong scenes in the story, but the actors simply do an efficient job. I think that maybe with the Italian or Spanish actors those scenes would have been thoroughly explored, they would end (for us) in an explosion of laughter or tears. <br /> <br /> What we have left is the beautiful cinematography of Douglas. Sirk For me this is not enough. If you want to enjoy a good melodrama, see "Adventurer".
