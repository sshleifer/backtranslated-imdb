This movie is practically impossible to describe. The alternative title "Do not Look Up" is much more descriptive. Like most Japanese cinema, the story is not as linear as the American one. The story revolves around a director who is filming a story about a ww2 deserter. The set is delighted (?) By an actress who died (?) During the filming of a television program in the 60s. The director is the ONLY one who saw this show. If you've seen Ringu (director Hideo Nakata is the same) and you liked it, you'll like the ghost actress. I loved the ghost actress much more than ringu. A truly terrifying and disturbing movie. a 10!
