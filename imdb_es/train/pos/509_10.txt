"Broken Bow" takes us back to where everything started. Set 150 years in our future and 100 years before Kirk, Spock and McCoy. This installment of the "Star Trek" franchise is, in my opinion, the first series since "TOS" to recover the feelings of amazement, danger and emotion of "Go where no man has gone before". Scott Bakula is the perfect cast as Jonathan Archer, the first captain of the first "Star Ship Enterprise". He and the entire cast really show a true reverence for the Star Trek legacy. John Billingsley is brilliant as the extraterrestrial Dr. Phlox, and Jolene Blalock is totally delicious as the tempting but logical scientific officer of Vulcan T'Pol. Broken Bow is, in my opinion, the best main episode of any of the Treks, and I think Gene Roddenberry would surely be proud.
