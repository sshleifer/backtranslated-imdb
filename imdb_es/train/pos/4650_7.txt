As an employee of the Swedish Air Force, I enjoyed the pleasant flight scenes of Gripen and Hkp 9 (MBB Bo 105) in this film. One of the few disappointments was the EWS 39, in this case an inert missile Rb 75 (Maverick) painted black with the letters "EWS 39" in white along the side. The real pods of jammer definitely do not look like that, at least not what I've seen. <br /> <br /> But apart from that, it's an entertaining movie with a very funny ending (the last minute). Anyone interested in seeing several Swedish military units, including the now legendary SSG, in the film should see this one. <br /> <br />
