['I have had a morbid fascination with tornadoes for more than 40 years, since my fifth grade teacher, a Texas native, told stories he saw in his youth. Fortunately, I have lived all my life in the mid-Atlantic states, where tornadoes are rare and generally not as violent as those in the Midwest, but I&#39;ve had two close encounters, one in PA and the other in NJ, in the decade pass. <br /><br /> I enjoyed the family scenes, particularly the conflicts between Jack and Dan Hatch. When the tornado was near, Dan knew almost everything he had to do, and probably learned this at school, since I know that tornado safety is an important issue in parts of the United States where these storms are more frequent. However, the characters in the film did two things that some people believe they are supposed to do or that they are safe to do in tornadoes, but that they should not be done or are unsafe. <br /><br /> When the siren sounded for the first time, Dan and Arthur went through the house and opened the windows. For years, this is what people were told to do, but tornado security websites now discourage doing so. In addition, people were shown hiding in an underground passage of the highway. This method was popularized by a video of the early 1990s made by a television crew during a relatively weak tornado in Kansas. However, in the most severe tornadoes, people can be expelled from these underpasses. This happened during an outbreak in May 1999 in Oklahoma. <br /><br /> The tornadoes in this movie were successful in the fall, which is not a common time for them to happen. (Once again, one of my close encounters took place at the end of September). In addition, they traveled from northwest to southeast, while most of these storms in the northern hemisphere extend from southwest to northeast. However, this is not so unusual. A famous tornado that hit Joliet, IL, in the early 1990s traveled in that direction (as did the one involved in my other close encounter). <br /><br /> I think the movie should have premiered in the spring. This film was based on a book that, in turn, was based on a real event that happened on June 3, 1980. But it was still a compelling story.']
