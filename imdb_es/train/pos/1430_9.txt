This was playing in our theater in Amsterdam and the movie we wanted to see was exhausted, so we went to this, without knowing anything about it, other than that it was a documentary about the planet. We are very happy for our misfortune, since this was a very powerful film about life and the delicate balance that we all share with the rest of the inhabitants of the Earth. This movie has one of the most stunning pictures I've seen in a movie and it took me to places from deserts to oceans to rainforests and showed things I had never seen in a movie, TV or book! "The Earth" is a movie that all students must see before they get tired. I will encourage my niece to watch this movie since she will inherit the planet that we left her. This is also a movie to watch on a theater screen or on a very big TV, since photography is very powerful and exotic.
