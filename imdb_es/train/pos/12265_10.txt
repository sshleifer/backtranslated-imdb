"Tintin and I", in the first place, they seemed to me like a masterpiece documentary. Photography and editing are really impressive (almost anti-Dogma). <br /> <br /> We follow the life of the cartoonist Hergé de Tintin through an open interview of 1971. The Tintin series was drawn in the background. Of the great ideological struggles of the twentieth century. In the midst of these, Hergé has his own demons to fight with, and much of his drawing activity seems like an attempt to tame them and escape to a world of perfection. <br /> <br /> Although there are spectacular photographs. panoramas of drawings of Tintin albums and also some reconstructions and readings of passages of the albums, Hergé's story is told completely through interviews and archival material, and never through reconstructions. <br /> <br /> Hergé lived the turbulent life of A true suffering artist. But the fantasy world that emerged from his imagination will continue to surprise readers over and over again.
