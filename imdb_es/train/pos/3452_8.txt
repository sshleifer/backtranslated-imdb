I thought it was a pretty good movie and it should have been released first in theaters. It would not have been a huge box office success, but it would have made quite good money. The movie has suspense and makes you wonder how much of this is happening in the real world. Justin Timberlake did a good job. I did not expect Justin Timberlake to do a good job. Considering that it is his first film, he did a good job. This is a movie that is good to take back and see when you just do not know what you want to rent that night. I should go pretty well. The cast was great. So I recommend that everyone watch this movie!
