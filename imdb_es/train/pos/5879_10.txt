One of the most sensible comedies to hit the screens of Hindi cinema. A remake of Priyadarshans 80s Malayalam hit Boeing Boeing, which in turn was a remake of the 60s Hollywoon hit of the same name, Garam Masala raises the standard of comedies in Hindi cinema. <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar once again Demonstrates that she is one of the best superstars in Hindi cinema that can make comedy. It has combined well with the new piece John Abraham. However, John still remains in the shadows of Akshays and is not up to the occasion. <br /> <br /> The new girls are adorable and do justice to their roles. <br /> <br /> They should see the comedy. Leave your brains away and laugh for 2 hrs. After all, laughter is the best medicine! Ask Priyadarshan and Akshay Kumar !!!!!
