I thought Ice Age was an excellent movie! As a 30-year-old woman with no children, I seem to still enjoy these fun and witty animated films a lot. Sid is the best character I've seen in a long time, better than Bartok in Anastasia (although he was really comical, and did not believe that his character could be equaled or even defeated) and even more humorous than Melman in Madagascar. I have seen the film at least 15 times (obviously I have it) and I quote the film at work (many times ... yes, still). My favorite scene is the part where Sid says "Oh, oh, oh, I love this game". and Sid and Manny continue to discover what the squirrel is trying to tell them about the "tigers" ... "Pack of wolves, herd of bears, herd of fleas, herd of whiskers, herd of noses, pack a dermis?" pack of lies, package of problems, package to top, package of birds, pack of flying fish ... "or whatever it is! That's the funniest part of the whole movie, although I also liked the humor very much behind "put lazy on the map" and many other parts as well.The only animated movie that can be compared remotely with Ice Age is "Brother Bear".
