I have seen this movie only once, on television, and it has not been repeated. This is strange when you consider the garbage that is repeated over and over again. Usually, horror movies are a source of fun for me, but it really scared me. <br /> <br /> DO NOT READ THE NEXT POINT IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE <br /> <br /> <br /> The scariest thing is when the townspeople chase the preacher where his wife is almost dead ( they had been poisoning her). He asks who the hell you are anyway. One by one they give their true identity. The girl who pretended to be deaf to corrupt and seduce him says "I am Lilith, the witch who loved Adam before Eve".
