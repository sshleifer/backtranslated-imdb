This movie is ridiculous as hell! I think it was written like a serious movie, but when it came time to shoot, Michael Cooney said, "Hey, let's put some humor in and spice it up!" The characters are actually slightly developed, too. Oh, and the death sequences are the best. One thing I hate, however, was the weapons dryer. What was the reason for all this?
