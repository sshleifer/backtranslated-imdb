['This is one of those historical films that must be placed in the context of time. The darkness in Tallinn was realized in 1993. It was a period of chaos, confusion and disorder not only for the common inhabitants of Estonia but also for innumerable citizens of Estonia. other ancient nations that were part of the powerful Soviet empire. It was in such a tense climate that a young country called Estonia was born. As it is known that newly established governments face teething problems, Estonia also faced numerous problems when some corrupt officials manipulated the machinery state to fill their dirty pockets by using their selfish means. This is one of the central themes of this movie. The darkness in Tallinn appears like an Estonian film, but it was made by a Finnish director, Ilka JÃ¤rvilaturi. He has done everything possible to infuse as many possible doses of Estonian humor. That is why it can be said that it is a comedy film with political overtones. As ordinary people participate in this movie, we can say that this movie means good versus evil. It is not a new concept, since it is available in most religious books of different religions. The darkness in Talinn shows us how common governments can also be overthrown by corrupt people. A good movie to watch on a sunny day.']
