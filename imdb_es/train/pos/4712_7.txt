The jokes are obvious, the gags are corny and the characters are characters that walk, but I could not help but laugh at his movie so entertaining. No matter how many times I see it, I still like this one a lot, and I recommend it highly for all the nonsense entertainment lovers. It contains many citable moments, and some of the best visual gags that I have seen to this day. If you have had a bad week and need to laugh, rent this on your way home on Friday night so that your weekend is a good start.
