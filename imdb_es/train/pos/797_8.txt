To those who have not followed the case of the murder of Anne Marie Fahey. You are missing one of the saddest and most complicated murders of all. The killer is the popular Delaware attorney, Tom Capano, and the victim is the Programming Secretary of the Governor of Delaware, Anne Marie Fahey. Their relationship was a well-kept secret until his disappearance and murder. She wanted to leave him but he would not let her go so easily. On the other hand, I had a lover and a wife and four daughters. Where did you find the time to have two lovers and a domestic family life? In addition, the case is extremely complicated and fascinating for a four-hour mini-series. While the actress who plays Ms. Fahey does a good job, she does not have her hair long and dark. Your other lover is definitely more attractive than the real woman. Mark Harmon looks better and has an Emmy-winning performance as Tom Capano. It would be better with the actual locations of Delaware and Philadelphia. With the executive production of Ann Rule, it adds precision to the organizational characteristics of Anne Marie and her personal battle with an eating disorder. These bits of information can be overlooked by any other executive producer or director. If you have not read the book, it's worth it. Ann Rule is a fascinating narrator of the real crime. It's ironic that Mark Harmon plays Tom Capano. He also played the former friend and subject of Ann Rule, Ted Bundy in another book adaptation many years ago. It was brilliant then and now. He does an above average job with an amazing story. Even President CLinton offered his help in the case of Anne Marie Fahey. And now, former Gov. Tom Carper is now the United States senator for Delaware, who defeated current Senator Richard Roth in the November 2000 election. If you do not think the movie is interesting, then read Rule's book.
