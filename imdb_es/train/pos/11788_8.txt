I really believe that people are taking the wrong approach in this case. First of all, I find this short film very entertaining and interesting. I only take it for what it is. I believe that suspense and mystery are ingenious in their insinuation of the observer. Another thing that caught my attention was that it immediately involves the viewer even though there is no clear story, only clues and pauses, and the emotions that the characters represent that give you the impression that there is a story of everything that is . continuing Nobody else could have done better than Lynch. This is the essence of the lynchism in its maximum expression. Of course, I agree with anyone that people who begin to see this with the desire to entertain themselves without any really imaginative work on the part of the viewer, will be disappointed. And in good right. Lynch is not about that. At least this side of Lynch is not. The one who helped make Lost Highway / Mulholland Dr. in full swing here and the people who just wait to be entertained as if they were watching something else, they just do not know what this is all about. My opinion is that Darkened Room is about messing with your animal core, your instinctive self, by giving you the means (image, sound, situation) through which you react instinctively. It's not about pleasure of any kind, it's about getting the desired reaction from you. And, that, my friend, is pure art.
