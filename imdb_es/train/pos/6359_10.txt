If you went to this movie to see a great presentation of the academy awards ... well, but if you wanted to see a fun and charming adaptation of an old classic, you'll love it ... Jim Carey was amazing as always. The story line was great, some parts added, like the Grinch story, made it even better. Ron Howard never loses the rhythm ... But although some ADULT comments were added and excision was added, this is considered a children's or family show. Try not to lose sight of that ... if you really do not enjoy the movie ... and as for the comments about Ron Howard, try to direct a great movie and see how it goes ... it's not as easy as it seems. ...
