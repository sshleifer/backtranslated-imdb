This was a gem. Incredible performance by the protagonists Liam Cunningham, Orla Brady and the whole cast. The film raises an issue not only relevant to Ireland and Irish history but to many communities around the world and many marriage units within those communities. With intensity and sincerity, the film shows how convictions and religious traditions propelled a loving and passionate family. The title "Divided love" could not capture it better. Although it was a real story and happened in Ireland on the 50th. Seeing how the life of the whole village is eroded and how the "pogromos" begin reminds me of Russian history. Intolerance and prejudice are still too powerful in the world and, unfortunately, are deeply hidden within human nature. As in the movie, the character of Liam Cunningham says "hatred had always been there beneath the surface." It was interesting to observe the moral decisions that people were taking in this story. Also the character of a Catholic priest and what happened to him at the end of the story was quite significant. However, history gives hope that the love of two people can conquer everything and love makes us better and stronger. The character of Liam Cunningham goes through the whole transformation in the course of history, becoming the man he always wanted to be. Once again, acting is a superior category. The story is fast-paced. The Irish countryside is as beautiful as ever. Highly recommended
