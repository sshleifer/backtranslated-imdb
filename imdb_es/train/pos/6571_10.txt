<br /> <br /> The first thing I have to say is that I have Jake Speed. I've seen it at least 10 times. This movie is one of the funniest movies ever made. The film begins with Margaret (Karen Kopins) trying to find her sister. His sister was kidnapped in Paris and the family has not heard anything. Along comes Jake Speed ​​(Wayne Crawford), telling him exactly where his sister is and making an offer to find her. Jake Speed ​​is a hero. He does not work for money because he just wants to help and have a good adventure. His partner (Dennis Christopher) follows him and writes his adventures in novels. This movie is a great adventure. It's hilarious, it's full of action, it's just great. I guess it's a cult movie with a small group of followers. Crawford is perfect like Jake Speed ​​and throws some phrases that he will never forget. Kopins and Christopher are also good as the girl and the companion, respectively. John Hurt, the guy with the stomach swollen in Alien, plays the devilish and perverse villain that adds to the fun. In many ways, this movie is similar to Indiana Jones, in a way it is similar to the James Bond movies. Maybe it should have been called Indiana Bond, but whatever its title, it's a very nice movie.
