Almost 30 years later, I remember that this original PBS movie was almost unbearably tender. Periodically, I check here at IMDb hoping that someone has had the good sense to buy the rights and put them on a DVD. It's September 2004, and I'm still waiting: deep sigh. <br /> <br /> One of the two main actors went on to a small career, mainly in a prime-time nighttime event; The other, Frances Lee McCain, was seen in small roles here and there for a few years. But nothing of what they did before or after coinciding with this little film that occurred, as I recall, in a series of short PBS that showed original scripts of new and promising playwrights. <br /> <br /> I saw it every time I showed up on PBS, maybe 2 or 3 times. That was before the era of video players, so I have no record of that, except in my mind. <br /> <br /> 12/31/2006 In addition to the above: Happy New Year, ladies! This wonderful movie is finally available on DVD at ladyslipper.org. As I understand it, DVDs are recorded from the author's personal copy.
