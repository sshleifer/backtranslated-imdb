Classified PG-13 for violence, brief sexual humor and drug content. Quebec Rating: 13+ (should be G) Canadian Home Video Rating: 14A <br /> <br /> I've seen Police Story a couple of times. In my opinion, Police Story is Chan's best movie of the 80s. Originally I did it because he did not like the other police movie he had to star in, which was The Protector. I have not seen the protector, so I can not compare. The acting is not so bad and the plot is quite good. I remember the plot well because I saw this movie a while ago, but what I do remember is that this movie has a lot of action, scenes of risk and comedy. What you need a good movie of Chan. If you can find Police Story and you're a fan of Chan. Buy this movie! <br /> <br /> Execution time: 106min <br /> <br /> 9/10
