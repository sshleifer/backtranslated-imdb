Horror movie with a slightly slow start: give him the opportunity to start cooking. History is built on interest and complexity. The characters and the plot subvert expectations and clich√© at all the right times. The magnificent locations of New York City (sandy, real) are a fantastic antidote to the commercial imperatives of "Sex in the City"; in fact, the whole movie is an antidote to the HBO / Hollywood notion of New York City, sex and relationships. It is a rare movie that treats its characters in an honest and compassionate way. I LOVED! Great cast with remarkable performances by Steve Buscemi, Rosario Dawson, and his love interest (he forgot his name!).
