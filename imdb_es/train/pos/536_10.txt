Few films can be seen almost 60 years later, but they are still as fascinating as this one. Technological advances have not come out of this classic love story. The special effects used are remarkable for a 1946 movie. The acting is excellent. David Niven, Kim Hunter and especially Roger Livesey do an outstanding job. The use of Black and White / Color adds to the creative nature of the film. It has not been seen on television for 20 years, so few people are aware of its existence. It's my favorite movie of all time. Waiting and waiting for the DVD release of this film for so many years is, in itself, "A matter of life and death."
