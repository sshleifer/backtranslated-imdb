['A piece of trivia that often forgets this family movie is a business one. <br /><br /> At that time, in 1994, this film maintained the record of the biggest premiere of the film in the history of the film (and can continue to hold). It was held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, no doubt in honor of the &quot;Angels&quot; of the original movie, who &quot;persecuted&quot; the Pittsburgh Pirates. In this remake they &quot;chase&quot; the California Angels. <br /><br /> Anyway, the premiere was held in the now defunct Three Rivers stadium, home of the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Pittsburgh Steelers at that time (the Pirates are now at PNC Park and the Steelers at Heinz Field). The premiere was held on a movie screen that was five stories high inside the stadium and kept (and may even continue to hold) the record for the biggest movie premiere in history, shown to 60,000 fans. Danny Glover, Tony Danza and Christopher Lloyd attended the admiration of thousands of sports fans.']
