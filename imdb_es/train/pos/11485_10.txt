Zero Day leads you to think, even to think again why two children / young people would do what they did: kill each other by killing their classmates. It captures what must be beyond a strange way of being for two humans who have decided to withdraw from common civility to define their own mutual world through coupled destruction. <br /> <br /> It's not a perfect movie, but given the money / time that the filmmaker and the actors had, it's an extraordinary product. In terms of explaining the motives and actions of the two young suicide / killers, it is better than 'Elephant'; In terms of being a film that gets into our skin 'rationalist' is a movie much, much better than anything else. You probably see. <br /> <br /> Defect but honest with terrible honesty.
