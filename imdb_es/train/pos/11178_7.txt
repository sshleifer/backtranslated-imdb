SPOILER MINOR <br /> <br /> The underestimated Shock of Stephen King. It's not perfect, no matter how much the imagination stretches, even if the performances of Dale Midkiff and Denise Crosby were better, there would still be mismanaged mystical history elements to contend with. The old cemetery of Micmac, the sick sister of Rachel and Jacob-Marley, a Victor Pascow, never come together at all coherent, and the film in some places feels confused and full of things. But few horror movies are really perfect, and what may be missing in other areas makes up for their willingness to shock. 'Pet Sematary' may actually be one of the cruelest horror films in recent memory, with its zombie baby killer and its insensitively insensitive interpretation of Zelda. It is politically incorrect, it has no taste, it is free, and yet it makes us writhe with repulsion in a way that "safer" horror films can never do. Add to that one of the best performances of Fred Gwynne and the ingenious direction of Mary Lambert, and he has an extremely satisfying horror movie, even with the hokey ending. Highly recommended for lovers of the genre. 7.5 out of 10
