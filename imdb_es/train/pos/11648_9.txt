There are people who claim that this is another Mexican film ultra violence of "bad language." They are right, but more than that, this film is a call to create awareness of what we have become. The terrible truth hurts or gets bored when you have already accepted the paradigm of living the third world as the only possible goal. One of the most important things about "Cero y van cuatro" is the open invitation to a deep reflection about our current identity. Is that what we all are? Is that all we want to be? I am abroad and I realized how spoiled Mexican society is when the Tlahuac incident came to light. I still can not understand the spectators who witness a mass-transmitted murder. I almost vomited when I saw some of the images. It was not Iraq or Rwanda, just a small town near Mexico City when the massacres were carried out with the indulgence of the media and the government. The recreation of a similar situation in this movie surprised me deeply. The other stories were good and showed other situations of corruption, dishonesty, betrayal and violence, but I consider that "Tamales de Chivo" is the best. <br /> <br /> The movie is deeper than some "bastard" and "asshole". laughter Those do not make sense compared to the actions of people. With some exceptions, they are all perfect examples of human garbage. As in real life, honesty is becoming the exception rather than the rule in our country. In addition, honesty is only miraculously rewarded.
