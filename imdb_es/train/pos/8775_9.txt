Excellent effort of Warner Bros, starring Errol Flynn in one of his best performances on screen. He is often cited as his best, and I really can not judge him completely until he has seen his "Dawn Patrol". However, his work on "They died with their boots" takes some heartbeats. I'm a big fan of Flynn (he's my favorite actor after James Mason, it also helps that he's an Australian) and I think he's wonderful, a great presence on the screen and also a great actor. It is the centerpiece of "Gentleman Jim" as the legendary boxer with the elegant footwork, but is also backed by a literate, warm and funny script, and the direction of Raoul Walsh. Every Walsh movie I've ever seen loses the rhythm, it really was a born filmmaker. Walsh directs the scenes of the rings perfectly, as he does with the lighter moments and that touching, great final scene between Ward Bord and Flynn. Add to that great production values ​​(the "Gay Nineties" never looked better!) And a lovely cast of cast, and it's practically perfect entertainment. Alan Hale usually played as Flynn's partner, but here is his father, and it still works. Alexis Smith is Flynn's love interest. The couple is madly in love to fight with each other.
