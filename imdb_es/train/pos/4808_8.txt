THE YOUNG VICTORIA is a piece of history elegantly disguised and reproduced that benefits from some fine adjustments, a solid direction by Jean-Marc Vall√©e of the Julian Fellowes version of the young girl who would become the longest reigning monarch of England: Victoria. Much of the first part of the film, that part when Victoria is a girl whose ascension to the throne is challenged by her mother (Miranda Richardson) and Sir John Conroy (Mark Strong) seems to crawl and get lost in the multiple costumes and scenarios. variations But once Victoria (Emily Blunt) is of legal age and is courted by Prince Albert (Rupert Friend), the film flourishes. Blunt is a strong actress and finds that delicate line between the infatuation of girls and the real dignity that makes her an excellent figure for those in the court who seek to control the 'child queen', including his secretary Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany ). But as she matures in her role as queen, her attention is focused on the handsome German Prince Albert, and in a love story that has endured in the memories of all is combined with the concept of joining Royalty with concern for the care of his subjects, very due to the sensitivity of Albert. The film takes us to the birth of his first of nine children and then ends with some statements about the influence of the effect of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert on the various Royalties throughout Europe! It turns it into a night of beautiful costume drama and allows us to appreciate the growth of two young stars in Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend. A solid if it is not transported epically. <br /> <br /> Harp Grady
