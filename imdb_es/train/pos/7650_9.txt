Wow, I loved this movie. You may not have had the funding and publicity that the latest Hollywood blockbusters get, but it has twice the emotional impact. The story revolves around this Utah family and it is the connections between the people in the family that give the film its impact. The main protagonist (Giovanni Ribisi) plays his role very well, at no time lets you believe that he is acting all his feelings. However, it is his brother (Elias Koteas) who stole the program. When the two were in scenes together, they joined together, giving fantastic performances. Great cast, great movie.
