MÃ©ndez and Marichal have provided us with a serious, convincing and painful analysis of the social, spiritual, economic and political crisis that have generated 108 years of colonialism in Puerto Rico. A beautiful island with the most hospitable people I have ever known, and yet, as our nation refuses to face its imperial responsibilities, Puerto Ricans can wither and die. <br /> <br /> The spiritual crisis of the colonial situation in Puerto Rico has created, in case of undermining families, and the basic institutions that underpin any society. Corruption is rampant to the extent that people do not pay taxes (which has caused a fiscal crisis for this nation) and a sense of cynicism and distrust permeates the culture of the island. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, a grant allowed this however, a powerful movie to be produced. <br /> <br /> A must see. . .
