I just got back from a preview of this excellent science fiction movie. His style is definitely unique and very well made. It was filmed with real actors, but it became a black and white comic strip style that I had never seen before. It goes one step further than Sin City, and it does it well. It is a successful combination of comic and French cinema. The story and the mood remind Blade Runner, and if you liked this, surely you'll like this one too. The story is intelligent, never boring and has some nice little twists. This movie is a must see for any movie buff, except perhaps for those who do not like science fiction or b & w.
