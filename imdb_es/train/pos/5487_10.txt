You have never seen anything like it. Once the blow begins, it is the most dazzling thriller and that is presented to you on the edge of your seat that you have never seen, even if you know the result. And everything is real, because it is a documentary, incredible. <br /> <br /> By the time it ended, it was on my list of the 10 best movies of All Time Great Movies. <br /> <br /> Ignore the fans of the right wing. Everyone I know who has seen this movie gives it a 4 star rating. Even if you do not care about politics or Venezuelan politics, you will feel nervous and, believe it, on the edge of your seat. <br /> <br /> It's a roller coaster.
