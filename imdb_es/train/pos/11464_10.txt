The most disturbing aspect of this film is not that there actually are massacres in schools like the one described, but the truth is that they are made by teenagers like Cal and Andre ... normal children with normal families. By using a handheld camera technique on the Blair Witch, Ben Coccio manages to bring us to the lives of two friends who have some problems in high school, although we are never told exactly what is behind those problems. They seem typical: many people hate high school, so what? A part of you simply does not believe that they will ever carry out the well thought-out massacre on Zero Day. The scenes of surveillance cameras at school during filming become more powerful for that reason. You can not believe that it is really happening, and that it really happened. The technique of the handheld camera also creates the illusion that it is not a scripted movie, a brilliant idea given the subject.
