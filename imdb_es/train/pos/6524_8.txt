<br /> <br /> Whether you're interested in pirates, pirate movies, American history in New Orleans / early 19th century or Yul Brynner, watch this movie for yourself and decide for yourself. Do not be discouraged by several mediocre reviews. My reaction to this was that he is entertaining, well acted (mostly), has a very witty dialogue and does an excellent job of portraying the charm, appeal and legendary fascination of privateer Jean Lafitte. While not all the events in the film are historically accurate (can you show me any historical film that succeeds in this?), I think the film is accurate in its treatment of the role that Lafitte played in the history of New Orleans, and the love Relationship of hate between the "respectable" citizens of New Orleans and this outlaw who was one of the favorite children of the city. Do not worry about what the film does not do, but look at what it does, that is, its study of one of the most intriguing historical figures in New Orleans and America.
