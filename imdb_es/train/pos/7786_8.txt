This film was directed by Victor Nunez, who also wrote the screenplay (Ulee's Gold). Pleasant and direct writing, which was nominated for the Independent Spirit Award, considering the daily life of Ruby. What we see is a piece in the life of young Ruby. Ashley Judd (Sisters) won the Independent Spirit Award for Best Female Leader for this role. Ruby is beginning to live alone and is establishing her own identity. Explore jobs, friendships, friends, sex, a typical search for young adults. The film won the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival. As an independent film enthusiast, I chose the film because of Sundance. I appreciate this type of film, because it does not carry the luggage of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Although the stories are completely different, it reminds me of Nobody's Fool, with the eyes of Paul Newman. The later film is a part of the everyday life of a common man. I like that. The story is very well told, and all we had to do was sit down and enjoy the story. The only thing I'm not sure about is the title. I'm sure there are not as many bugs and flies in paradise as in Florida. Because I'm allergic to mosquitoes, Florida is not a paradise for me, it bothers me a lot to think of Florida. I become a complete red boil. I recommend this movie! Favorite scenes: Ruby and her friend Rochelle Bridges, played by Allison Dean walking on the beach in Panama City, Florida. In fact, the sand is very white. I have been there. Favorite phrases: "The need has always been a good excuse." "All the fuss about finding a man is not at all different now, who he is going to be, when and why." <br /> <br />
