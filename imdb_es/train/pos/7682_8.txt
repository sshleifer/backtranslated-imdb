Holly addresses the issue of child sexual exploitation that is rampant throughout the world (approximately 2 million children are trafficked each year) and does so with sensitivity and without manipulation, a difficult task that the Priority Films team does with big success. The American actor Ron Livington stars in the film with the new actress Thuy Nguyen, a Vietnamese actress who plays Holly, and together they present what is a common place for people in the famous K11 red light district in Cambodia. Although it addresses a heavy theme, the film maintains moments of laughter and hope as we get to know the characters up close, preventing the two-hour movie from being too difficult to see. I'm glad that a movie like this attracts the world's attention to the problem. Child prostitution must stop and this is a very good first step. It's great and a movie that EVERYONE should see.
