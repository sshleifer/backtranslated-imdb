One of the best documentaries released in recent years. Some points ... <br /> <br /> 1. Hugo Chávez was elected president of Venezuela in 1998, his support came largely from the poorest regions of Venezuela. <br /> <br /> 2. In 2002, a coup d'etat briefly deposed Chavez. At that time, Irish filmmakers Kim Bartley and Donnacha O'Briain were in Caracas, filming a documentary about Chávez for British television. His film deconstructs the blow and its consequences, and records in an electrifying way the story that takes place in the place, outside and inside the presidential palace. <br /> <br /> 3. Chávez set out to free Venezuela from the free market policies imposed by the United States. Although Venezuela's oil was already state-owned, it was administered for private benefit by executives whom Chávez wanted to replace. <br /> <br /> 4. Despite being the fourth largest supplier of oil in the world, Venezuela remains immersed in poverty, its resources are literally absorbed by foreign multinational companies. <br /> <br /> 5. The documentary begins by portraying Chávez's first years as president before the coup. It focuses on its popularity among the poor and its various policies that were popular among working-class locals (educational plans, distribution of oil revenues, grassroots democracy, etc.). <br /> <br /> 6. Chávez was a great defender of education and printed thousands of copies of the Venezuelan constitution, encouraging children and adults to study and understand it. <br /> <br /> 7. When Chávez came to power, he immediately pledged to redistribute oil profits. This, understandably, made the oil companies nervous. <br /> <br /> 8. A media war broke out. The six private television stations quickly began to oppose the state television station. They questioned Chavez's motives, sanity and sexual orientation. <br /> <br /> 9. Without the support of the media, the coup would not have succeeded. The film makes it clear that beatings depend heavily on the media to spread information and that news can be easily invented. <br /> <br /> 10. Under the pretext of "restoring democracy", the opposition silenced the state television station, dissolved the National Electoral Board, the Supreme Court, the National Assembly and took control of the military. <br /> <br /> 11. Monetary interests, backed by the military elite (encouraged by the United States and the CIA), organized a march of citizens in the presidential palace to carry out the coup. Snipers fired on Chávez supporters, but private media stations edited the images to make it appear that the response fire pointed to the opposition march that, in fact, had been safely diverted. Police fired on Chávez supporters, further bleeding the streets. <br /> <br /> 13. Chávez, captive, refused to resign. Of course, the media / government lied that they had resigned, but the members of Chavez's cabinet communicated the truth to the international community, which finally sent the message to Venezuela on cable television. <br /> <br /> 14. People rose up pressing the return of the president they had elected, whom only a referendum could replace constitutionally. <br /> <br /> 8.9 / 10 - With a duration of just over an hour, this document is too short. However, it is a fascinating piece of journalism and deals with a form of "media warfare" that is rarely addressed. It makes a great piece of company for "The Battle of Algiers". <br /> <br /> It's worth a visit.
