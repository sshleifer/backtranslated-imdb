['I am a lover of Jane Eyre and a purist, and this version includes almost all the important details of the book, and the characters are represented as I imagined them. Jane Eyre is a complex story of great richness and can not be delivered correctly in a feature film format, so she needs a television miniseries. Timothy Dalton&#39;s Rochester is probably the best of all. There has been a lot of discussion about how attractive he is and his age. In the book, Jane (the narrator) describes him as &quot;around 35&quot; and is not young, but he is not yet middle-aged. I think Timothy Dalton was about 38 years old when he did this, so that&#39;s fine. Also, we only have Jane&#39;s opinion of whether Rochester is handsome. She has just met him and he asks her bluntly what he thinks. As an inexperienced and humble girl, I can not imagine her saying that she thought him handsome. The actor who plays Rochester needs to show us the character of man, and this is perfectly fulfilled. I love the relationship between the two protagonists, which is the crux of this story and the humor of their encounters. Other versions have spoiled it, but this does it well. The 2006 version with Toby Stephens (37) is in progress on BBC1 and is very good, so I&#39;ll decide if it&#39;s my favorite when it&#39;s complete. <br /><br /> When I go back to see this series, after seeing the 2006 version, I have decided that this version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clark is the best! Charlotte Bronte&#39;s dialogue is preserved and this is essential for the power of history. Modernization simply does not work, it&#39;s a Victorian story and having an archaic poetic discourse adapts to the characters. This version has an excellent cast: Zelah Clark is small and the height difference between her and Rochester is important; Timothy Dalton has a real presence and is an incredible actor. There are no additional scenes to deviate from the plot and the script includes all the essential scenes, but leaves unnecessary details aside, reaching the point and grabbing. I recommend it to all the true fans of Jane Eyre.']
