Hilarious just begins to describe this type of an authentic force of the Star Wars (Luke: how strong? Vader: the strength of a small pony), in which, being the master that is, does not even break to sweat , cleverly saving himself the mascara leak ... -and that's almost 2 hours of spinning throughout history, his birthplace, Europe and more. <br /> <br /> From the middle of Heimlich's night, "I invented a maneuver!" a "... do you have a flag of the British Empire?" and the old gods, "Jeff, the God of cookies!" and many more, this is funny. <br /> <br /> And I confess to having broadcast this video dozens of times over the years. Like a British transvestite, vogueing in a chair, it's a long shot of a rental after all, especially one that goes back 10 years. And yet, the material is not only timeless but almost spectacular, and turns the present into nothing more than an amplified version, more fun / sadder than we were a decade ago, although now that I think about it, it may just be a coincidence.
