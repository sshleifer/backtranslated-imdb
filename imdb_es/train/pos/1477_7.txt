I was watching this movie on Friday, April 7th. I did not see the last scene (because I was talking to my brother and my mother-in-law at the same time). Can someone tell me what happened to him? I observed a bit that her husband was hearing that someone was talking to his wife in the bedroom and then opened the door, she is already dead. <br /> <br /> What happened to him? Committed suicide? How could she fix everything, like phone calls, while she is at home when her husband was talking to this strange admirer? Anyone can explain me, please. I'm so curious! (In the end, I read that she suffered from a personality of multiple disorder). <br /> <br /> Thnks before.
