What could be more daring than the idea of ​​private detectives getting involved with the women they are supposed to be spying on? And most of the dialogue as it is written is perfectly banal. <br /> <br /> But the actors make the dialogue into something that makes sense. You can see real people behind the unreal lines. And the address is wonderful. Each scene does exactly what it has to do and ends without prolonging it too much. <br /> <br /> I showed it to several friends in the mid-80s because I was puzzled to see how such a bad material could become such a good movie. Friends also enjoyed it.
