A group of popular high school students play a cruel joke about Marty nerd (a sympathetic performance by Simon Scuddamore) that leaves him horribly disfigured. Five years later, the gang returns to the high school now crumbling and abandoned for a meeting. Of course, an angry and vengeful Marty appears dressed in a jester costume to avenge her tormentors. Writers / directors Mark Ezra, Peter Litten and George Dugdale bring out all the captivating cliche clich√©s that make these 80s corpse-counting movies as fun as cheese: fake jumps, prowling Steadican shots, a fierce storm, an incredible madness Hard rock soundtrack, a good sample of free female nudity, a ridiculous "what the hell?" supernatural climax, sticky makeup f / x, and one of those crazily lazy "everything was just a terrible dream", false endings. On the other hand, the complicated assassination games deliver the gruesome products: the bloody highlights include the explosion of a man's stomach after drinking a poisoned beer, a woman taking an acid bath, a man crushed under a huge tractor and two people who are electrocuted in the middle. to have passionate wild sex. Caroline Munro, a thirty-year-old British terror siren, is very sulky as an American teenager in the first third of the movie. All actors in the cast provide solid performances, with a particularly outstanding work by Carmine Iannaccone as smartaleck leader Skip Pollack, Billy Hartman as the scruffy male headbutting Frank, and Donna Yeager as the fox Stella. Co-producer Dick Randall has a funny cameo like Munro's maniacal agent, Manny. The music of Harry Manfredini, in a bad mood, recycles without shame the signs of his scores of "Friday the 13th". The astute cinematography of Alan Pudney does the trick. Well, junk fun.
