I love these "Diaper Baby" movies! You could not make a movie like this today and it's rich in film history. It's silly and the movie was made to make you laugh, and that's what it does. How they ever made these children "act", I'll never know. I think they are beautiful and children make me laugh, but so do the others who made this film, since it shows the naivety that existed at the beginning of the 30s. You have to remember that this is when the film industry was very young , the stock market had collapsed, the world depression was beginning and these movies were created to give a person a break from the real world. The fact that you can watch movies for five cents is beyond my comprehension, but dinner for 25 cents is also. It was a different moment with a totally different mentality.
