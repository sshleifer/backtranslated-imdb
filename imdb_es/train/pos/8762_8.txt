"What would you do?" It is a question that will remain in your mind for weeks after seeing the emotional Brokedown Palace. You will also wonder if Alicia (Danish) was telling the truth or not, a problem that remains unresolved, and rightly so. This is a particularly well-acted and beautifully filmed movie. Although it is sometimes slow, its rhythm reflects the storyline, but much of the film will have it on the edge of its seat; wanting to know what happens next. The ending will also leave you imagining yourself in the shoes of the main characters, played brilliantly by Kate Beckinsale and Claire Danes. The performance of Bill Pullman is also commendable.
