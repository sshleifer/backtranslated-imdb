['This is an excellent movie. It involves many things: the search for a serial killer, the bureaucracy of Soviet Russia, the drive of a man and the relationship between this man (the main detective) and his superior. <br /><br /> What hits me the most is the relationship between Durokov (Rea) and Fetisov (Sutherland) (excuse the spelling, please!). For some reason, it is moving to see their evolution from hostility and offensive, becoming respect and camaraderie and working together. A line in the film sums it up for me: &quot;He would say something witty, but he&#39;s overcome by emotion.&quot; <br /><br /> Excellent performance of the entire cast, even the smallest parts were performed with credibility. <br /><br /> This is not a fast-paced action thriller; In fact, it sometimes moves like a slow drama, but it&#39;s worth it. Very satisfying and no exploiter of crimes at all. <br /><br />']
