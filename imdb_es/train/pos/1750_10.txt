Well, let me say something about these actors, they really were a good decision and, from experience, having actors really makes the dialogue come alive. If you enter this even fifteen minutes late, you will be in shock, the movie will have already begun. You will not want to miss the first jokes, assuming you have not missed any jokes. <br /> <br /> Wow! I have never seen a movie that ends with such a final ending. Do not be hard, I mean, I loved it, but I was surprised that it stayed that way until it stopped! But I'm getting ahead of myself, let's start from the beginning, when it started. The scheme of the plot is like this, there is this man, and not to give away any spoilers, (* Spoiler Alert! *) (He has never had any sex (!) They use this plot device to put the story in motion, and there (intentionally or not, could go anyway) some funny situations that had the main characters, some with irony, and jokes, and uncomfortable situations, you know. <br /> <br /> The director uses the advances in technology by combining the film filmed on the set and the dialogue with script, music and jokes to make a funny movie, designed as a comedy, where it takes us on a journey from the opening credits to the end with a completely complete movie I entered into this I was expecting to see a funny comedy because of what I already knew, and I felt as if I had just left a theater that only played a funny comedy. TEN STARS !!!
