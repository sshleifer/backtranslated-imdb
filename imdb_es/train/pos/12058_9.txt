Spectacular horror movie that will give you chills once you have installed. The atmosphere is very spooky and elegant, the score is chilling, but the best thing about the film are its performances. It is rare that the performances scare you and the solid performance of this movie plays an important role in the fear factor. <br /> <br /> The story is very interesting and catches your attention from the first minutes. Although the woman in black does not have much time in front of the screen, she makes the necessary appearances to relax the audience in some bright scenes. The dialogues are very descriptive and make your imagination work, and that's when it becomes really scary. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity, look at this in the theater, it's a totally different experience but as terrifying as this movie. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best Ghost movies and is aimed for people who want to be scared.
