First I saw this as a child living in East London. The Luftwaffe Hitlers scars were too obvious and the landscape of the film reminded us of our street. I remember having nightmares after seeing him. The strange thing is that it really has no date if it is considered a piece of social history in film fiction. <br /> <br /> Apart from a globally destructive war, the scale of the machines was very bad, now there is more nanotechnology, but in general, an excellent and well designed work. It was interesting to see how space travel was perceived at that time. I would think that firing a spaceship from a giant gun would almost kill the astronauts. However, a lot was fine. The desire of man for war, the inhumanity of man for man. The means of war as a catalyst for development. <br /> <br />
