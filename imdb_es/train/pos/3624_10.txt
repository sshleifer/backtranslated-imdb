The rookie kept me smiling from start to finish. Dennis Quaid played the role perfectly. The child who plays his son was fantastic. He made this a father-son movie to remember. The messages are good. Follow your dreams. Failing in the pursuit is fine as long as you try. The emotion is palpable. I think this movie will be a classic.
