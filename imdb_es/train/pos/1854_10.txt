Having developed a critical eye for cinema, and a love for good cinema, I went to see Antwone Fisher with my symbolically contained breathing. Although I am an unconditional fan of Denzel Washington, both for his ability as an actor and for his public persona; I am a fan honest enough to admit the (very few) occasions in which the brand has not reached one or two movies. And I could be wrong about that, after all, I'm not an actor. But this was different: Denzel would pour his professional experience into a film about the handling of one of the most delicate topics known to man: the abuse of a child. Like his directorial debut, nothing less. And develop the film to indicate that it would successfully present the triumph of a man. I did not want to disappoint. <br /> <br /> And it was not. <br /> <br /> What I saw is a movie full of promises that connected different audiences and gave the inexperienced. spectator: a brief, but sincere, eye on the life of a young man whose childhood was a living hell, but who triumphed in spite of everything. This movie did it, and not a dry eye of any color in the theater proved it. It is necessary that someone knows the themes of this film to know when the truth is presented. A talented filmmaker is needed to tell the story convincingly when he has not experienced it. And if it can attract more audience and make an audience respond emotionally, without pity, the filmmaker has done his job. In any movie. Black, white, purple or polka dots. That's what makes good movies. Bravo, Denzel Washington, Derek Luke, Joy Bryant and, above all, Antwone Fisher, you won.
