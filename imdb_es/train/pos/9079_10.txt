This program will be successful because it attracts all adults no matter where they are in their relationship. As a man married for 26 years, I sympathize with the character of Patrick Warburton: he loves his wife, but assumes that she knows it. I also enjoy its monotonous delivery; You never get too excited or too low. A nice set of characters. This will be a good addition to the Monday night lineup. <br /> <br /> I do not know how David Spade will be in his role. It is best enjoyed in small doses. She also seems a bit old to continue being trolling for women. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the pilot and I hope to see how the series develops.
