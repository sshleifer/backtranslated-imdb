The sequel to the ever popular Cinderella story reminded me of something they did with one of the films of Beauty and the Beast. Basically they are three short stories in 1. <br /> <br /> Well, the mice are adorable (I love Gus! It's very cute!), And Lucifer is amazing (as always). I also liked some of the newer characters, (Pom Pom was adorable and I liked Prudence). Still, the story was somewhat limited, but very cute. So, I vote 7/10.
