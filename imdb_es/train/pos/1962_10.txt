What an exciting ride! Twisted and stimulating. Once again, Sharon Stone impeccably removes her beautiful and fascinating character from author Catherine Tramell. The original basic instinct takes place in San Francisco. The sequel takes place in London, where Catherine has moved now. Both bustling cities, known for excitement, haute couture ~ and a perfect place for someone like Catherine Trammel to reside. David Morrisey, ("Derailed"), plays the soft role of psychiatrist Dr. Michael Glass. The character that David Thewlis plays as Roy Washburn with Scotland Yard, is a refreshing farewell to his role as Lupine in the Harry Potter series. Striking cars, designer clothes, sex, drama, humor, tension, - all the "basic instincts". The mind is leaning along. Great script From the climactic opening scene to the surprise ending, this film is anything but boring. Everyone in the theater was glued to the screen.
