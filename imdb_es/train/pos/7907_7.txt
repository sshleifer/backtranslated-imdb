I could not be less in agreement with the qualification that was given to this film, and I believe that this is a sample of how the majority of spectators of all the world are of short mind. Really ... Do you forget that cinema used to be a kind of art before some magnates tried to make it just entertainment? This movie is not entertainment, at least not the easy entertainment you get in movies like Titanic or Gladiator. It has style, it's different, it's shocking ... That's why most of you have hated it so much: because it does not try to please you. It's just a story, a very rare one, I admit it, but after all, just a strange story. It's not a great story, not even a great cinematic work, but I think it's worth a 7-star rating just for the value of the author and the director to shoot a story that is not made to please the audience, so Billions of copies are sold and further enrich the large studios. This film is, for me, a film similar to European art made in the USA. UU., And all those involved in the realization of it deserve respect. Either by courage, or by the unique sense of humor.
