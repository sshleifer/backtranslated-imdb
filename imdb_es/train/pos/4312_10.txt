If you have not seen this excellent movie about life in the 90s (in L.A.), then you have missed a special gift. This is one of the most incredible and powerful films that has been made about the life of Americans in the 90s and even moves to the current world in which we live. It covers everything from raising a child, prejudices (more than one way), love, adultery, empty nest syndrome, selfishness, etc., and the list goes on. This story is accumulated to reach a definitive climax and then, when nothing else matters, always return to love with friends and family and love for life. It helps us to deepen ourselves and make us look for what we want out of life. It makes us ask questions of ourselves. Have we done enough for others, are we like this, etc.? Sit back and enjoy an exciting and exciting movie that I'm sure others will enjoy forever. <br /> <br /> Take note of the wonderful performance of Mary Mcdonnell, Kevin Kline and Danny Glover throughout this film. These actors are incredible and really show the true brightness and meaning of the message that is sent to us all. These are 3 of my favorite actors of a lifetime after watching this movie more than 10 years ago. I still enjoy it again and again. Also enjoy the wonderful soundtrack with her and do not forget to count how many times you see the helicopter fly and try to discover that it is a symbolism for the movie? Hmmm ... I almost forgot that this is probably the first serious question of Steve Martin Acting in any movie I've done. He also does an excellent job in this movie. This may come as a surprise to most of you. Sit back, relax and enjoy a good movie ...
