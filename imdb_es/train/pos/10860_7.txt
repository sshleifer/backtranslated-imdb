This is not as violent as I expected, which makes the violent scenes seem more brutal and effective. <br /> <br /> There are many twists and turns and stabbings in the back and double crossing along the way. The movie makes it difficult to know which side a particular character is on. <br /> <br /> The plot is peaceful with a good dialog and character development and offers an interesting insight into the functioning of the Triad gang that follows. <br /> <br /> The violence when it arrives is brutal, there are no weapons or scenes of martial arts with special effects, this is credible in the face of your violence and, despite all the dialogue, you can never forget that the Triad is a violent criminal organization. <br /> <br /> The ending is surprising but completely consistent and credible.
