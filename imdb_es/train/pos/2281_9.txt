There are numerous films related to World War II, but Mother Night is very distinctive among them: in this film, we are introduced to Howard Campbell (Nolte), an American who lives in Berlin and is married to a German, Helga Noth (Lee) , who decides to accept the role of a spy: More specifically, a CIA agent, Commander Wirtanen (Goodman) recruits Campbell, who becomes a Nazi propagandist to enter the highest levels of the Hitler regime. However, the agreement is that the United States government will never recognize Campbell's role in the war for reasons of national security, so Campbell becomes a hated figure throughout the United States. After the war, he tries to hide his identity, but the past returns and pursues him. His only "friend" is Wirtanen, but even he can not do much for the avalanche of events that fall on poor Campbell ... <br /> <br /> The story is deeply moving, as we watch Campbell's tragedy , although A great patriot, is treated with disdain by all those around him. Not only that, but he also gradually realizes that even the people closest to him have many secrets of their own. Vonnegut gives us a moving atmosphere, with Campbell's desperation increasing and almost suffocating the viewer. <br /> <br /> Nolte plays the role of his life, in my opinion; it is even better than in "Affliction", although in both roles it interprets tragic figures that are destined for self-destruction. Sheryl Lee is also excellent, and the same can be said about the entire cast in general. <br /> <br /> I have not read the book, so I can not evaluate how the movie compares to it. In any case, this does not matter here: my criticism is based on the film itself, and the film deserves a 9/10 without reservations.
