This story was never among my favorites in the works of Christie's, so I was pleasantly surprised to enjoy this adaptation. The reason for the mouse was effective, although a little exaggerated, the bones of the story are there, although more emphasis is placed on the secondary argument 'crime in the past'. All the students were almost as I had imagined them, although it is a pity they were not a more cosmopolitan group, perhaps the revised configuration of the thirties did not allow it! I thought they had taken some very bold risks with the filming; Maybe it's because I have not reread the book for a long time, but it seemed pretty obvious to me who the killer was for his appearance in some telling shots pretty soon. <br /> <br /> Humor was much more frequent in these early poirots. Sometimes it works, but I found a lot of pretty heavy things in this episode (although I did smile in the disposable line of 'Lemon sole'). In general, however, a solid entry in the series, although it is not one of the best.
