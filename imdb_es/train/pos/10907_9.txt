['I was flipping the television and HBO showed a double hit of incredibly horrendous medical conditions, so I turned to my twin sister and said, &quot;Hey, this looks fun,&quot; I really love documentaries, so we started watching it . At first I thought Jonni Kennedy was a young man, but then it was explained that due to his condition, he never went through puberty, therefore the loud voice and the smaller body. He was on a crusade to raise money for his cause. I had a wonderful sense of humor combined with a beautiful sense of spirituality ... I cried, I looked a little more, I laughed, I got up to buy another Kleenex and then I cried a little more. Once &quot;time is up&quot; by Jonni Kennedy, he flew to heaven to be with the angels. I was more than ready; He had learned his lessons from this life and was free. I recommend it highly. If you do not fall in love with this guy, you do not have a heart.']
