Note: these comments are for people who have seen the movie. <br /> <br /> Vanilla Sky is a brilliant, complex and exciting movie that explores exactly what the tag line says: LoveHateDreamsLifeWorkPlayFriends. Maybe the plot of the film can be focused for the confused spectators if one looks at it from a different angle. <br /> <br /> Considering the following: <br /> <br /> Now, I have not been very careful through the film scene by scene, so I will have to examine my statements more thoroughly ( and I welcome your thoughts), but try this and see if the film does not fit in its place: Where exactly does the "splice" arguably occur? ? <br /> <br /> Now, I am not talking about the splice as explained by the "technical" LE, since that sequence itself could be interpreted as a rationalization within the mental / dream / coma state of David Aames, but the real Splice between reality and dream. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that the reality of the automobile accident, the way it was filmed (without explosion, for example) is a probable "splice" point, and that any particular sequence that contains an existential sensation / dream / coma / not reality, whether it is shown on the screen before or after the accident, is actually a part of Aames personal journey towards self-realization within his own mind. <br /> <br /> In that sense, then, we are left with two questions at the far end (if you know more, let me know): Aames is really disfigured and where does he wake up? <br /> <br /> If it's not completely wrapped up in the exact sequence of details in the In this plot, or at what particular point your scattered dreams are, this movie becomes a fascinating exploration of a human on a journey to find yourself and to whom. That means in today's pop culture society. <br /> <br />
