Carmen is one of the best movies I've seen in my life. It is difficult to say who is the best performer: Antonio Gades, Cristina Hoyos and Laura del Sol are excellent. They take out their soul. It is a beautiful story of the inseparability of life and myth; The myth penetrates everyday life. The dance becomes life and all life is danced. Real people at the same time live their own lives and become another person, represent the parts of the lovers of antiquity. The magic continues.
