The story of Mrs. Patty Duke about her life and her struggles with manic depression was like the one in my life. I saw myself acting like her. I was so surprised by the similarities in our lives that included the sexual abuse we both suffered as children. <br /> <br /> I watched the movie when it first premiered in 1990 and I loved this movie. Anyone who has struggled with manic depression could get a lot out of this movie. It does not matter if he showed his prizes or what they were for. That is not the problem here. The problem is how Ms. Duke had an illness and struggled to survive and won. Ms. Duke has much to be proud of in her achievements with her struggles for the survival of a disease that often leaves many victims hopeless. <br /> <br /> Unless a person has struggled with this disease personally, they do not know it. To the hell they have to live with. The film for me was a success because it showed the real problems and how a person who is depressed and manic acts. It was so real ... so, so real. It was like watching me up there on the screen. <br /> <br /> I wish I could thank Mrs. Patty Duke in person for having the courage to inform the public about her illness. Bocka
