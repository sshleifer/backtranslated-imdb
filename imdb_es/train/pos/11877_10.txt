['Directed by Brian De Palma and written by Oliver Stone, &quot;Scarface&quot; is a film that will not be forgotten. A Cuban refugee named Tony Montana (Pacino) comes to America for the American Dream. Montana then becomes the &quot;king&quot; in the drug world while relentlessly driving his crime empire in Miami, Florida. This gangster movie is very violent, and some scenes are unpleasant to watch. This movie has more than 180 F words and lasts almost three hours. This movie is entertaining and you will never get bored. You encourage the Lord of Drugs, and in some scenes you discover that Montana is not as evil as other Lords of Crime. This is a masterpiece and I recommend you see this. You will not be disappointed. 9/10']
