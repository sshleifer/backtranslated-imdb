['This movie premiered the year I was born and I&#39;ll have, like me, 70 in 2007. I saw her again last night, I had not seen her since high school. While it was full of the feeling of 30 and the performance was a little stereotyped, however, it was excellent. The story of Pearl S. Buck came to life through the magic chemistry of Luise Rainer and Paul Muni. The novel that earned Buck the Nobel Prize for literature comes to life under the baton of Sydney Franklin, who along with an excellent script tells the story of the peasant, Wang Lung, whose father gets a girlfriend for him, a slave of the kitchen. from a local owner. In Buck&#39;s story, Wang&#39;s success is backed by his willingness to listen to his wife, most of the time, and the love of the land. In the end, he realizes that his wife, like the earth, is the source of his wealth, happiness and immortality. Buck&#39;s stories always had strong women in a critical place to influence the outcome of events in the pre-feminist world. Luise Rainer, born in Germany, gives life to a peasant woman, tentative but determined, in her portrait of Olan. Muni also captures the naive but honorable Wang, eventually trapped between the two worlds of the rich and the peasants. Other classic characters include Charlie Grapewin, Uncle Henry of Kansan by Dorothy Gale of Wizard of Oz, Walter Connelly as Meow, Deceptive Uncle and Keye Luke as Son Number One, but this time, not Charlie Chan. <br /><br /> A classic can be defined as a movie that you can watch again and again and never get tired. If that is the case, this movie is a classic, without a doubt.']
