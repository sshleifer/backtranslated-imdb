Kenny Doughty as Jed Willis is more attractive in this role than any male porn star, even though he keeps his pants on. <br /> <br /> The movie tore at my heart reminding me of the intensity of the great explosive love of my life. I do not think I can think of another movie, except maybe Romeo and Juliet, of Zeffirelli, that captures that dizzying joy that good. <br /> <br /> The other drawing of the film is the eccentric English characters who enjoy the scandal indirectly. In that sense, it's more or less the same appeal as the Midsomer Murder or the Miss Marple mystery, without the chaos. <br /> <br /> This is a great antidote to the simulation of horror currently popular in the United States and any relationship between people of different ages.
