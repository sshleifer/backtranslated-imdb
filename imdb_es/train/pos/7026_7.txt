When I was 17 years old, my high school organized Bye Bye Birdie, which is not a big surprise, as it is the perfect material for high school and is said to be the most staged musical in the world. <br /> <br /> I was a student music and retained strong memories of the production and its songs, as well as a persistent disdain for Dick Van Dyke's movie version that had (deliberately) hidden Elvis references and camped for an audience in the 60s. <br /> <br /> Then, when the 1995 version of Jason Alexander hit my cable TV screen, I was delighted with what I saw. Alexander becomes an exceptional performance as Albert, a performance in stark contrast to his best-known character in a certain television series. The rest of the cast is entertaining and convincing in their roles (Chynna Phillips is perhaps the only one who does not seem her role, supposedly a naive and innocent schoolgirl). <br /> <br /> But the best of all is that the musical The familiar numbers of the show on stage are preserved in this film and performed as they should be the musical songs of the stage (allowing the absence of a stage). <br /> <br /> Therefore, if you know the musical (and few do not). ), then take a look at this telemovie. It makes the scenario show justice in a way that probably can not be improved, which is good enough for me. What is better than representing the work of a writer faithfully and with color and style?
