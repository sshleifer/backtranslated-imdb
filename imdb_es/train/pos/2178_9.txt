With lots of sunlight, diffuse light and shadows that filter through the windows and rooms, tracking shots moving through the crowd with a handheld camera, fast-paced editing and extreme approaches here and there, photography is the thing in this interesting, artistically. movie made. <br /> <br /> The plot of this film begins as a little fluff on a beauty pageant. The film starts on a warm Sunday at the local pool, where we meet the lovely Lucienne, also known as Lulu (played by Louise Brooks), a bit of a show-off in front of the open-mouthed men by the pool, she soon decides get in. to represent France in the beauty contest Miss Europe, much to the chagrin of her very jealous, promised stick-in-the-mud (a man quite annoying, really). Walking on the track, the ten participants are shown in swimsuits, while the winner is chosen as the participant who receives the longest applause (I was wondering, could not the girls walk more slowly to prolong the time, and so So much the applause?) The catwalk ?!). Lulu is soon being persecuted by a Prince and a Maharaja, but her attractive boyfriend does not like the attentions that other men or his adoring public give him, in fact (I think he only wants her at home, cooking His meals, and stay out of sight, huh ?!). <br /> <br /> Louise Brooks is beautiful and charming, her presence helps to improve this film, but it is really the way that she photographed what interested me the most. . A little distraction is the strange bent sound, which is a little off. However, the impression in this version looked very clear and full of good contrast. Seeing this, I simply tried to ignore the sound problems and see the movie visually, and found that the movie is excellent, that it's worth watching.
