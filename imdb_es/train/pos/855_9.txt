['This movie is fantastic. Finally well written characters that you can love for all your good and bad. Pierce Brosnan is completely hysterical in this modest role. I think it&#39;s the best thing he&#39;s done. He has performed other roles that showed nuances of being capable of this type of work in full-blown, but this role finally gave him the space to run with him. I almost died when I crossed the hotel lobby in underwear and boots. And Greg Kinnear and Hope Davis are also a couple they aspire to, as well as the actors they aspire to. Kinnear is so ridiculously nice that his turn at the end is really gratifying. You give the good actors a good job to play with and they give us something else back.']
