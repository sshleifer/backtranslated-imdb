It was simple and, nevertheless, very beautiful. I think that the whole sense of sexual segregation in society, which can be bitter, was very delicate. He had a kind of bitter hummer. The fact that most of the actors were not professionals made the film more tangible and more realistic. There was also a "documentary" side of the film. The best scenes were those that all the girls, who were forbidden to watch, listened passionately to the soldier, who is supposed to watch them, transmitting the game. If you are Iranian, the applause and family dancing in the streets after winning a game, fills you with national pride! If you're not Iranian, you'll still love it!
