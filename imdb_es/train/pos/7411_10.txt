The key to joy and beauty, pain and sadness of life is our ability to accept that life is basically what it is, so we do not constantly fight against that single and convincing truth. In doing so, we find peace. Elegant in its simplicity, but so difficult to understand for most of us. <br /> <br /> In this film, the director shows us this truth but allows us to discover it in our own way. This is a beautiful but simple story, more than a fable, which is played very well. Seeing the actors is more like being in a room with real people than just seeing the actors. <br /> <br /> I struggled with how to write a review of this good movie so that others would be motivated to see it. I'm at a loss. The story is about men in a bathhouse. It sounds like a true shutdown, right? But, nothing could be further from the truth. The American title for this film is The Shower, but that is almost an antithesis of an important thematic element in this film, which is the bathroom. I'm still at a loss. Talking about the story or the characters will not do them justice. <br /> <br /> So, I'll just tell you how much I enjoyed watching this movie and how exciting the experience was. I also entertained a lot. I was deeply concerned about the characters and I was deeply concerned about what happened to them. For any story, that is the highest form of praise. <br /> <br /> If you were moved by films like The King Of Masks or Not One Less, then make sure you watch The Shower. Netflix has it and the quality of DVD sound and video is excellent. I saw it in the original language with its English subs well done and well placed. <br /> <br />
