All the scenes were combined perfectly. This movie had a wonderful cast and crew. I mean, how can you have a bad movie with Robert Downey Jr. in it, none has ever existed and will never exist? It has the ability to brighten up any movie with its incredible talent. This movie was perfect! I saw this movie sitting alone on the shelf of a movie in "Blockbuster" and as if it was calling me, I could not resist picking it up and bringing it home with me. You can call me sappy romantic, but this movie just touched my heart, not to mention that it made me laugh with pleasure at the same time. Even though it made me cry, I admit it, in the end, the whole movie improved my vision of life thereafter. I suggested to my brother the horror, the action and the pure humor of a brother who loved this movie. This is a movie with a good sense of feelings. It could make you laugh out loud, touch your heart, fall in love and enjoy your life. Each time you spend on this film, keep in mind that you are consciously making the decision to live and feel this inspiring film. Who knows? What would happen if it could really happen to you and keep your mind open to the mystical wonders of life?
