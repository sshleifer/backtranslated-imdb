I have read the Blaise modesty for several years, collecting numbers from the strip. After the fiasco movie made many years ago based on the first book "Modesty Blaise", I was surprised that the result was so good. <br /> <br /> What I got was a movie that was not based on action or violence. The director had focused on history and psychology. How was modesty created based on your own history and what parts of your life were affected by your non-childhood? I think these things will give a better understanding to the next (I hope) movie. I just loved old-style movies. <br /> <br /> However, not everything was so good, the game was not so good. Almost boring and unreal. The performance could also have been improved. I do not think the bad guy in this movie felt real, the only reason he was there was for Modesty to have someone to tell her story. They could also have expanded the movie, showing more about when she builds "The Network", but I guess that will be for the next movie. <br /> <br /> And, please, forgive me for my bad English.
