This movie amazed me so much that I looked at it at least once a year. Sometimes I find it uncomfortable. Sometimes I find it empowering. And I always find the human and real characters. It is a film that shows the harsh reality of life in Los Angeles, beginning with the recurring search lights of helicopters that analyze the dangers that lie so close to the ordinary life that the characters carry. It is also a movie that shows you how the kindness of a stranger can change your life and allow you to make a difference. The Grand Canyon reminds you that every action you take, whether intentional or not, has powerful repercussions. I found that this movie is similar in many ways to Robert Altman's film, Short Cuts. Both had a list full of stars of actors and actresses perfectly chosen, and both films allowed him to gradually see how the characters interrelated and affected each other, for better or for worse. The Grand Canyon did a better job of providing a cohesive message, (hope in the face of desperate reality), than Altman's film, although I found both of them intriguing in their own way. This movie is a definite must see !!!
