Men can enslave Lollo, if they wish (or their lollos, she gave his name to a slang for breasts in French), but the ladies have an even more delicious bite in the divine Gerard Philipe, who is not only beautiful but Can act. Do not be discouraged if your version does not have subtitles, because in this simple story of love and war, in which everything is fair, they are not necessary. All you need to know is that, at the beginning of the movie, Lollobrigida reads Philipe's palm and tells her that he will marry the king's daughter. From then on, the story is quite clear from the French gestures and games of running, jumping and playing with the sword. <br /> <br /> On the negative side, the evidence of the story and the tenderness of the tone become a little tired, and it is annoying that the French apparently consider themselves far superior to Hollywood to even disturb the possibility of their incredible acrobatics. And, of course, people who do not speak French get lost from time to time ooh-la-la, like: A virtuous girl: I must tell you that my heart belongs to Fanfan. Seductive: Dear, what made you think I was interested in that trifle?
