I was attracted to this movie the moment I saw a preview of it on Oscar night. When I read about Kay Pollak, I was hooked. We, the Americans, are fools for a child who returns. <br /> <br /> I understand that this movie was a great attraction in Sweden. As a very provincial American, I can only speculate about the reason. Maybe it's because of Lena's provocative joke at the beginning of the film and other social commentary, but maybe it's because of the central message that I think has the same appeal everywhere in affluent societies. <br /> <br /> The message of this film for me is the same as that of the movie Titanic. Life is short people and, as far as we know, is all we have. It can be removed at any time. So is not it a pity that we spend so much time hiding behind the walls that separate us from other people because we are so afraid of being hurt? Knocking down the walls is painful, but feeling alive is on the other side of those miserable walls. Feeling alive is worth the risk. Give and you will receive. So start living NOW. <br /> <br /> Many people are criticizing this movie for its lack of characterization and other flaws. I say that you are all pseudo-sophisticated. Grasping people is a parable, a fable for us rich Westerners who are materially rich but whose souls are in extreme poverty. <br /> <br /> So join a choir or a band or help build houses or distribute food for those less fortunate than you. Spread a little joy and make the world a better place while you go out and communicate with your neighbor. Writing a check is not enough. We are a social species, by the way. Even the humblest of your peers can affect you in ways you never thought possible. <br /> <br /> Robust individualism has its place, but it is overrated.
