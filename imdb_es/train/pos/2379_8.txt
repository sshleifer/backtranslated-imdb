H.G. Wells Classic has had several Incarnations. The version 05 'Speilburg and the classic version 53' But only this one remains completely faithful to the book. Nothing is changed, nothing is eliminated. <br /> <br /> Originally released as a 3-hour movie. The director cut the film to 2 hours of pure excellence. It has a chapter by chapter display of the pages of novels that "Wells would be proud of." History is how everyone remembers it. The Martians invade the Earth with capsules containing an army of tripod war machines. The people of the nineteenth century Earth are ill prepared to repel the alien forces and fight with cannons and weapons that are thrown shells directly from the Walkers and when humanity is no longer a world power, they are saved by the smaller organisms of the earth. . <br /> <br /> The film is an excellent achievement for director Timothy Hines, who has great potential since he gave life to this vision with a meager budget of 5 million. Nowadays B-Movies have bigger budgets.
