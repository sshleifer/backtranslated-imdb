['The movie celebrates life. <br /><br /> The world is preparing for the innocent and the pure souls, and everything has &quot;Happy End&quot;, as in the final scene of the film. <br /><br /> The film has a wonderful soundtrack, mix of Serbian neofolk, gypsy music and jazz. <br /><br /> This film is a very refreshing visual poetry. <br /><br /> The experience of observation is as if you had been sucked into another colorful, romantic and, sometimes, rough world. <br /><br /> Like Mr. Kusturica, the movie should be.']
