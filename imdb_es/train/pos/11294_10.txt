This movie does it well. As a former USAF aviation cadet, I can tell you that this movie has it all. The tedium of the application process. The wait for the word. The joy of acceptance. The concern to do it through the course. The pain of seeing one's friends (perhaps the best of them) disappear. The anguish of paying the final price: the death of the aviators students that flow. The glory of graduation. Always flight, flying, flying. Many are called, but few are chosen. We paid for what we would have paid anxiously to do.
