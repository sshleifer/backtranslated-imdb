Rohinton Mistry's multi-layered novel seemed impossible to adapt for the screen, but the resulting film is full of passion, emotion, humor and pathos. The story is somewhat slow, but there is always something on the screen to captivate the audience. The film perfectly captures a particular moment and place with pinpoint accuracy. All the actors are Indian, few known by the "Western" public, but it is a pleasure to contemplate them, especially the girl who acts in a very convincing way. Do not be intimidated by the title and the summary of the plot, this is a movie that can be seen on the big screen. We have a lot to learn from it.
