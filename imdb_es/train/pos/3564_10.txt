{Possible spoilers that come ... you've been warned.} <br /> <br /> This is absolutely one of my favorite musicals and musicals of all time! (The other one is Damn Yankees with Gwen Verdon, Tab Hunter and Ray Walston) As we all know, sometimes the brightness (not to mention the songs) of a show is lost in its transition from stage to screen. This is, for the most part, DEFINITELY not the case here. <br /> <br /> The sets are divine, bright and colorful, the characters are bigger than life and you can not stop loving them, and Michael Kidd's The choreography is absolutely stunning. (I'm glad to know that they used the original Broadway choreographer) <br /> <br /> All the actors "bounce the ball" (that is, they have an insurmountable chemistry) to perfection in this film. Frank and Marlon are absolutely credible as the owner of the oldest permanent floating junk game established in New York, and the most famous player who bets even on the tiniest things, like his fever, which rises to 104 if he does not accept. penicillin. The sweet and fresh face Jean Simmons is perfect for the role of Sarah (although it is true, her songs to sing are not as exceptional as those of Isabel Bigley or Josie de Guzm√°n): the mission doll with a heart of gold and a trip to cure everything And finally, but certainly not least (on my list anyway) is Miss Vivian Blaine, taking up her role on Broadway as Miss Adelaide, the singer and dancer of Hot Box who would finally like End your 14 year commitment to Nathan with marriage, and get rid of him. herself from the psychosomatic cold she has given her. <br /> <br /> First of all, congratulations to Stubby Kaye and BS Polea while repeating their Broadway roles as Nicely-Nicely Johnson and Benny Southstreet. There were never two more adorable players than these guys. <br /> <br /> Brando is superb, as always, and although he does not have the voice of Robert Alda or Peter Gallagher, forget it, because he has this sense. of determination to carry everything he can to his role as Sky Masterson. "Luck Be A Lady" gives me the chills every time I see him do the number. Especially nice to hear him say "Dad ... I have cider in my ear". <br /> <br /> Simmons is charming and nice in a role that adapts well to his appearance, voice and the way he behaves. He longs for her not only to win Sky (or, in the end, to believe him), but also to help people overcome their bets, drinks and other sins, and live a life with God. His interpretation of "If I Were A Bell" is splendid, to say the least! <br /> <br /> Sinatra is the man. He is so perfect for the role of Nathan Detroit, and here he sings parts that Sam Levene of the Broadway cast could never (excellent actor, but the guy was a bit deaf ... imagine). I really enjoyed the addition of the song "Adelaide" ... I wish someone would sing ME like that. The fresh and elegant behavior of Frankie transcends the limits of this film. But the most important thing is that you want her to marry Adelaide. <br /> <br /> And speaking of Adelaide, Vivian Blaine is pure perfection in this role. From the accent of her chorus "Lamentation of Adelaide", she is simply great. And she is also my favorite part of the whole movie. She really makes you feel for Adelaide ... especially when she cries right before and then again during "Sue Me". I still have not decided if I like "Pet Me Poppa" better than "Bushel and a Peck" ... maybe I like them equally. Either way, she does something fantastic with those, as well as with "Take Back Your Mink." (It saddens me that they have omitted to "hollanderizar" of the film ...) She is absolutely WONDERFUL, not to mention hilarious, and my favorite part of the whole movie. <br /> <br /> One of the best things about this movie is its lingo. It's a mix of high class and street slang. They never use "Is", "I" or "That's right". It's always "It's", "I'll do it" and "That's it". In general, Guys & Dolls is one of my favorite movies and musicals of all time, and it is one that you should take the time to watch every time it is produced. My only complaint? Not "Marry The Man Today." Now that's a good song.
