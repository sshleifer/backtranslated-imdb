['The film never pretends to be something spectacular like many movies do. The films are held as a fun and entertaining moment. And that is exactly what it was. It&#39;s the Korean version of a Bring It On man. <br /><br /> From the beginning you can feel for the rest of the movie and how it will end, but the enjoyment is not in the surprise turns or in the way the film is a carbon copy of another. Instead, enjoyment takes place on the journey of how the remaining 2 &quot;thugs&quot; became men in their own right. That&#39;s why the movie is fun and entertaining. <br /><br /> The camera work, especially the dolly movements were very well executed. The script, which was a bit weak, was too nice because the characters were not two-dimensional, but were full of life and desire. This movie will not win any Oscar, nor any DVD sale, but a fun watch and a fun experience.']
