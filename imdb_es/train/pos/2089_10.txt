"The Good Earth" is a great movie that you do not hear much of. There are many disasters and big events, but it is also a love story not passionate. All this happens in little more than two hours, which is short by today's standards. The special effects and costumes are very good for the period of time. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised that Luise Rainer has received an Oscar for such a limited role. Basically he only has three emotions: submissive, hungry and with a broken heart. <br /> <br /> The performances of the Asian and Asian-American actors are spectacular. <br /> <br />
