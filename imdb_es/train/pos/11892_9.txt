Pialat films people in extreme emotional situations, usually with several violent scenes. In La Gueule Ouverte, he is dealing with the devastating effects on a woman's husband and son when she dies of cancer. In A Nos Amours, the adolescent's sexual experimentation leads to violent confrontations with her family. Here we have a pretty spoiled young woman who leaves her husband to face a sexy ex-convict. His motivation is a bit murky, since Loulou is unable to read or discuss something more challenging than television programs; On the other hand, he has a fabulous body (I wonder why Depardieu never made a sports movie to show that physicist, he would have been a great rugby player). <br /> <br /> The casting is awesome. Isabelle Huppert is not allowed to give an insipid and inexpressive performance (she has given many); Depardieu plays Loulou with all the dynamism and charm he could wish for: see the scene in the bar, where he is stabbed in the bowels, he runs away and seeks treatment, then he restarts with Nelly. Guy Marchand, with those coal black eyes and anguished look, plays Nelly's husband perfectly; It is a good repetition of the couple in Coup de foudre.
