About a year ago I finally gave up on American television. I thought about leaving television altogether until a friend who had lived in England showed me some shows that included The Office, Extras, Blackadder and The League of Gentlemen. That's when I decided to switch to British television. Among all the shows mentioned above, The League of Gentlemen is easily the darkest and most twisted of all, providing guilty laughter and material that is not found in any other comedy I've seen yet. The characters included are the most unhappily married couple, a butcher who puts ingredients in the flesh that are not said (probably for the best), a deranged couple looking over a local store that only serves the local people, and the worst veterinarian of all time. This program is one of the best I've seen.
