Pirate idiots, a baby, a safe, a plan and a baby. Add them all and you'll get the best comedy you've never heard of. <br /> <br /> Even with a bit of star power (at least a-less ... okay, b-plus?) this movie had very little publicity. <br /> <br /> But that does not diminish his genius. <br /> <br /> Excellent writing, solid delivery and a credible group of characters. Some truly classic lines, and a fun touch at the end. <br /> <br /> This is not a diluted "Nutty Professor" comedy. These are the bad guys of the low life. They speak the language of the bad guys of the low life and do bad things of the bad guys. But they do it for your fun and entertainment, and they do it well. <br /> <br /> One of the best comedies I've seen in my life.
