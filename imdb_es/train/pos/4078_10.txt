This is one of my favorite movies of all time, PERIOD. I can not think of another movie that combines so many good cinematographic qualities like this one. This movie has it all: action, adventure, science fiction, good versus bad and even some romance (without even an innocent "peck" in the cheek between Pazu and Sheeta). Maybe the best thing is that you do not have to be in Mensa to "get it" and enjoy the movie like you do with other Miyazaki movies (I do not know you, but I watch movies to take a break from thinking). This is just a pleasant and enjoyable movie that everyone will like, so do yourself a favor and buy it. The only bitter note is the American dubbing. I thought Vander-Geek was just annoying. But all is not lost, the original Japanese version is on the set of two discs and it's amazing! Who cares if you can not understand spoken Japanese? If you can read at a second grade level, watch the original Japanese recording with English subtitles. You will not regret.
