I can not see the point of burying a movie like this in the sulfuric sarcasm, when in no way is it meant to be more than a vehicle to entertain the children and prepare them for the next line of merchandise to beseech madly. /> <br /> This is a funny movie. My children sat quietly through the whole thing and loved every minute of it. Of course, the villain is a bit exaggerated with his foolish disguise and manic laughter, but this is much easier to take than the dark, grim and very morbid Pok√©mon 3. <br /> <br /> My children have I have been watching Pokemon since it began and soon they are reaching the ages when they will "put aside childish things" and move on to others. I'm glad we can enjoy this together.
