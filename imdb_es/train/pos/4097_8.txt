Youth, sexuality and the French countryside: one of the most unique films you'll ever see. If you can see it, it is not a feat if you consider how difficult it is to find copies (a combination of scarcity and censorship). Sometimes it is erotic, sometimes unpleasant and sometimes fun. A bit boring in the middle too, but in general you can not call yourself a weird movie buff until you see it at least once.
