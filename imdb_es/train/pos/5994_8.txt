['I had the pleasure of seeing the short film &quot;The Cure&quot; by director Ryan Jafri. What really impresses me is the camera work and the music. <br /><br /> I think that many young filmmakers (like myself am one of them) will experience difficulties with cinematography when they just start making an indie. We see that the exit is not exactly what we have photographed or is below our ambitions. But this film, debut in the direction of a young director, was handled very well on the screen. The movement of the camera, the color, the lighting, the composition contribute to the story and emotion of the film. <br /><br /> And music, as a key element of the cinematographic language, also helps a lot. <br /><br /> It is difficult to portray a woman&#39;s heart, her desire, her fear, especially in a short film. But still, I must admit that I am not a fan of v / o (narration), especially when the film moves by narration, instead of shots and cuts. My personal opinion about part of the narrative is that, in my opinion, the narrator tried too much. So the energy moves the audience away from the emotion of the movie. <br /><br /> In general, it is a very well made short film, I could see the contribution of a director. Very good, Ryan! I greet from China, looking forward to your next one. <br /><br /> tim']
