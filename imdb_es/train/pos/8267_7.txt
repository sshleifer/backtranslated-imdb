Brown of Harvard is a film difficult to pin down. We expect much more from our movies these days, so it is useful to remember that the audiences of the 1920s were a little more innocent. William Haines is charming as the rogue who has to trip over pain and humiliation to find success and even glory. All the relationships in the film feel very forced, EXCEPT, by the homoerotic tie between Billy and Jack Pickford, the nerd of the city. The film has it all, romance, tears, love, death and even sports ... It is an excellent education about how society has changed in the 20th century.
