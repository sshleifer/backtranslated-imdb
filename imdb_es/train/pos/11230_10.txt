Several news agencies have spoken and reported on Hidden Frontier for their long commitment to creating the best Star Trek stories and for providing an example of the union that was the mission of Gene Roddenberry. His focus on homosexuality, depression, war and acceptance of different races is on a par or on the other Trek series and films. The value of production began as smaller and choppy, but over the 7 seasons of production, the performance has improved, the stories are more complex and the visual graphics have become softer and more impressive. In Season 6, Episode 1, Countermeasures, there is one of the greatest space battles in the history of Trek. The ships are well represented and the space battles are impressive and exciting. The real attraction of Frontier is not the ships or the funds, but the people and the interaction and growth of the characters. There are also winks to other series and films of Trek with places and characters that we all know. I recommend any Trek fan to review Countermeasures and will be hooked.
