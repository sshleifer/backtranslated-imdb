The master of the film show Cecil B. De Mille goes west. Using three legends of the old west as their protagonists (probably never met), Gary Cooper plays Wild Bill Hickock, James Ellison as Buffalo Bill and Jean Arthur make a beautiful Calamity Jane. The story is only useful for De Mille to hang some wonderful action sequences, like the great attack of India. Scenes like that are extremely well done. If you do not mind the somewhat exaggerated performances of the cast, this is a very entertaining west. Look for a very young Anthony Quinn who plays the role of a brave Indian who participated in the battle of Little Big Horn. This part at least he noticed in Hollywood.
