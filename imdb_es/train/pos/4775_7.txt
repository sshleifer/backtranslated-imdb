If what you are interested in is an action and an adventure in a movie, we recommend that you look elsewhere. On the other hand, if it's a lazy day and you want a good movie that matches that mood, check out "The Straight Story." <br /> <br /> Richard Farnsworth presents a convincing performance as the Gentile and Alvin Straight, gentleman, in this real story of Alvin's journey on a lawn mower across three states to see his estranged brother who has suffered a stroke cerebral. <br /> <br /> Farnsworth is perfect in this role, as he travels long and winding road, making friends of strangers and passing out many grandfather's advice about the family along the way. The story progresses as slowly as the mower, but somehow manages to keep the viewer watching, waiting for the next life lesson that Alvin is going to offer. <br /> <br /> Stretch out on the sofa, relax and enjoy. It is the only way to see this very good movie, which qualifies a 7/10 in my book.
