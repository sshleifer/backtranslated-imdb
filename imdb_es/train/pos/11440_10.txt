I went and I saw Rivers and Tides again today. It's the second time in two days and yes, I watch movies that I like as many times as necessary. Yesterday I was impressed by the brilliance of Goldsworthy's images and work. This morning, when I threw the coins, I received # 29 The Abysmal (Water). Goldsworthy has an affinity with water, hence the title. I received the fifth line of change that moved to # 7 The Army. For Blake Art it was a war. Anyway, I knew I had to see the movie again. <br /> <br /> I read one of the few online reviews of the SF Examiner. The critics loved the movie, but said that Goldsworthy's comments got in the way of his enjoyment of the movie. He prefers to have only the images and the wonderful soundtrack. So I realized that when I saw her for the second time. <br /> <br /> Yesterday I thought I would vote for Andy Goldsworthy as the King of the World. Well, today I could go a little beyond the images and listen to what I had to say. Could you enjoy the movie without your comments? What he is doing, what he is saying goes beyond "art". His understanding of Water, Time, Stone, Change, and so on made me think that man is the reincarnation of Lao Tsu or some Avatar. Some of his works / words are like Zen. His knowledge ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie is only (apparently) shown here in the Bay Area. Be a trendsetter Go to your local cinema and tell them, do not insist that they have to book a movie you've heard about. It's called Rivers and Tides. <br /> <br />
