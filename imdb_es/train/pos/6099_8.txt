I still have VHS copies of this program grainy, late at night, without cable, waaaaaayyyyy when, commercials at night and all that, when I would stay up until the weirdest hour in which I would oppress this program, I could only record it. <br /> <br /> The series was not really ABOUT Freddy Kreuger, only the first couple of episodes actually involved him as anything other than a Rod Serling-esquire announcer. Instead, each episode was a different nightmare, using the traditional themes of horrible childhood horror, dating, cannibalism, dating, money, death, dating and ... mmm ... dating. <br /> <br /> From the episode in which a teenager accidentally says "I will love you forever" to the wrong girl, and stays with her (literally, at least for a moment, they grow together ...), to which a young stewardess goes home with a strange man, only to find herself in her cabin, where she has a trophy room full of other hostesses, and one that I only vaguely recall that she compared blind dates with hockey (and injuries and sanctions that accompany it). definitely the most terrifying thing in the series. <br /> <br /> One episode had Jeffrey Combs (Re-Animator, etc.) as a motivated pizza merchant with a tasty secret ingredient. It's not original, but it's still creepy and funny ... <br /> <br /> Even so, some of the episodes were great. My personal favorite was "It's a miserable life", where a young man is caught working at his parents' hamburger restaurant, when he wants to go to college. Caught talking to himself and doing little puppet shows with old cheeseburgers, until one night when a strange guy crosses the road and suddenly his life is no longer the same. No, not Freddy, just a hooligan with a gun. It turns out that the whole hallucinatory episode is just that: the last thoughts that go through the child's head ... together with a bullet. <br /> <br /> The second half of the same episode (many of the episodes of Freddie's Nightmares were essentially two loosely connected short stories) followed his girlfriend, who was also injured, but did not die on the drive- by, and that is taken to the "fucking hospital" - they pile up in all the creepiest clich√©s of the nightmares of the hospital, and then, since they sew your mouth by accident or you wake up during an operation, until your boyfriend is dead try to attract you to the morgue for a little hug. <br /> <br /> Again, that was my favorite. <br /> <br /> Some of the episodes were much more foolish, like ALMOST EVERYTHING THAT HAVE BEEN AVAILABLE IN THE VIDEO. They put the bad guys as representatives of the series, and then nobody likes them, thinks that the program stunk, and then they do not put more in the video. It's a Miserable Life is only available on PAL DVD in England, but I'm still going to buy it.
