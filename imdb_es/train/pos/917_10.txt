['I saw it in July and even with the Christmas theme, I found it moving and sensitive. It is not for someone with a real mind, since it is full of fantasy and charming moments that sometimes do not make sense. William Russ did a great job as Hank. I&#39;ve only seen him in the remake of The Long, Hot Summer, where he played a weak character. But in this, the expression in his eyes, while Hank considered the things that were happening to him, was wonderful and tender. Valerie Bertinelli was excellent and charming as always and very credible in this role. And Peter Falk, like Max, was splendid and always showed a smile when he appeared in several important scenes. There were many special scenes, including the one in which Hank realizes who Max was in his life. It&#39;s not for everyone ... especially those who are not in the &#39;feel good&#39; movies, and this is definitely one! If you like everything to be perfect and make sense, avoid this. But I think it&#39;s worth it to see it again, that&#39;s why I recorded it. (Yes, some of us still have VCRs :) :)']
