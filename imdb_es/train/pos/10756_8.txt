['Very interesting and moving documentary about the tragedy of the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. The main theme is the heroism of the American firefighters who tried to rescue as many people as they could. The film is deeply emotional and quite disturbing. The people seen on the screen have lost their lives! Recommended.']
