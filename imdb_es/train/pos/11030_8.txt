Seeing Cliffhanger gives me nostalgia for the early years of the 1990s, a time when virtually every new action movie could be described as "Die Hard in a / on a". Cliffhanger is "Die Hard on a mountain", and pretty good, for what it is. <br /> <br /> But unlike the Passenger 57 and Under Siege, which are decent Die Hard clones on their own terms, Cliffhanger dispenses with the closed feeling of many action movies and hugs stunning landscapes that, in their vastness, threaten with overwhelming and trivializing the conflicts of the people who fight and die between the peaks. <br /> <br /> Years before other films like A Simple Plan and Fargo dramatized crime and murder in snowy places, Cliffhanger director Renny Harlin recognized the visual impact of the juxtaposition of brutal violence and shadowy struggles to survive in a cold and indifferent natural environment. <br /> <br /> The opening sequence has already received important praise, all it deserves: its intensity allows us to forget the artifice of the camera and the actors and simply believe that what we are seeing is really happening. Not even Harlin's shot of the fallen stuffed animal, which is powerfully effective but threatens to become a joke (and repeated in Deep Blue Sea), or the ridiculous expression on Ralph Waite's face, can dampen the power of the sequence. <br /> <br /> The next impressive piece is the shooting and robbery on board the plane. As written by Stallone and Michael France and directed by Harlin, the audience is immersed in the action by not knowing initially which agents are involved in the robbery and which are not: the bloody crosses are completely unexpected. As Roger Ebert has observed, the specialist who performed the transfer in the air between aircraft deserves special recognition. <br /> <br /> Later, during the avalanche sequence, one of the terrorists / thieves seems to be falling as the snow wall carries him down the mountain. As far as I know, no one was killed in the making of this movie (a small miracle, considering the extreme nature of some of the stunts), so obviously a mannequin was used for the shot. But the shot itself is still impressive because we wonder how Harlin (or, probably, one of the directors of the second unit) knew exactly where to put the camera. <br /> <br /> I'll take Sly Stallone as my action hero any day of the week, because he's one of the few movie stars I've seen who is completely convincing as someone who can endure a lot of physical and emotional pain and , at the same time, feel that pain. The role of Gabe Walker truly complements Stallone's acting strengths: he plays a greater and more vulnerable action hero, who delivers an impressively low performance as a mountain savior who must redeem himself. <br /> <br /> In contrast to Stallone's Walker, many of the action heroes inspired by the comic and post-Matrix of today, is a common man who becomes a hero without any paranormal or computer-enhanced skills. In Cliffhanger, the hero almost freezes to death, and his clothes start to show great tears when he barely escapes one dangerous situation after another. It is startled when it is hit and bleeds when it is cut, particularly in the sequence of the cave when it takes a rock-style hit from one of the rabid dog villains. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that the villains are absolutely despicable. I really contribute to the effectiveness of the film: when I saw this film for the first time as a teenager, I was supporting the good guys every step of the way and anticipating when another bad guy would bite the dust (or rather, the ice); At one point, I actually applauded when one of the film's coldest characters suffered a violent death. <br /> <br /> The British accent of Lithgow is as unconvincing as the occasional model aircraft or helicopter model of the film, but fundamentally a good actor, and one of the few who can perfectly recite silly dialogue: a scene, looking at his hostages Stallone and Rooker, trying to decide what tasks to give them, actually says "You, stay! You, go!" Even a better actor, like Anthony Hopkins, could have had problems with that line. <br /> <br /> Even if Cliffhanger occasionally dismisses credibility, he does so only for the sake of a more entertaining show. <Br /> <br /> At the beginning of the movie, for example, Lithgow openly tells one of his men: "Remove [Stallone] when I get off." No true criminal brain would have made this mistake even unconsciously: his carelessness allows Rooker to shout a warning to Sly in the face of the rock, and this precipitates a fight between Stallone and the bad guys who try to knock him down. the rope tied to his leg. <br /> <br /> Lithgow could have given his order by a more subtle means, but the sequence might not have been so fun to see if it had not given Rooker the opportunity to openly challenge the arrogance of his captor. <br /> <br /> Made largely in the style of a Saturday morning series or (sometimes) a western, Cliffhanger is built on such a solid foundation that it survives some weak elements that would have undermined a minor movie . <br /> <br /> In addition to the painfully obvious airplane models mentioned above, the weak moments include a couple of scenes filmed in cheap indoor sets with REALLY fake snow, as well as two other scenes with bats and Wolves that seem unnecessary in a narrative already full of action. Finally, Harlin's decision to film some of the scenes of death in slow motion seems useless, since the technique does not contribute anything to the scenes. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that Stallone is now too old for action movies, because his character in this movie seems so believable that inevitably, I wonder how he would be years later. But perhaps it's better that Cliffhanger stands alone of all times, without a sequel: there are already enough tired and obsolete movie franchises. There was an unofficial sequel that called itself Vertical Bound: compared to that clinker, Cliffhanger belongs to the Top 250 list of IMDb. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8 (Very good, especially considering most of the other Stallone movies).
