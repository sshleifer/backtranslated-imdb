This is a good movie, a good family movie to see if you have nothing else to do. If you expect this movie to be word for word from the book, you will be very disappointed. I was a little disappointed because I read the book several times when I was in elementary school. <br /> <br /> It's about a new kid in town called Billy. He makes a bet with the school bully and the bet is not like most bets. Billy has to eat 10 worms in a day or the stalker wins. <br /> <br /> The acting is fine, probably the worst part of the movie. Children actors exaggerate too much in many things. They think it's an apocalypse if Billy does not eat the worms. However, Hallie Eisenberg did a magnificent job. <br /> <br /> The plot is good as a movie, but it stinks like a book adaptation. I could watch this movie without looking at the time ... sometimes. <br /> <br /> In general, this was a good family movie with some weak points. I rate this movie 7/10.
