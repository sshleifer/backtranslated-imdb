This film is based on the art of Frank Frazetta, the illustrator of mythical fantasy. Some of the characters come directly from his paintings (the Death Dealer is the best example). Surprisingly, the animation manages to maintain the original art feeling. Bakshi is well known for his intensive use of the rotoscope (the technique of plotting a live action sequence) and this film is no exception. However, since the theme of the film is quite realistic (all the characters are human), this works quite well. <br /> <br /> But what I really like here is the plot: for once we have a story with interesting characters and beautiful action sequences, a really horrible villain and a beautiful babe. This movie has the feeling of the best Conan comics, it's not surprising since Roy Thomas is the author of the Marvel series of our favorite Cimmerian! This is a far cry from the horrible live action of Conan, not to mention the entire B film of the genre. <br /> <br /> Definitely recommended!
