I really liked this movie when it premiered, and I still do it, because the story makes you feel hopeful with life in general and with people ... one of the things I like about Lawrence Kasdan movies. In addition to the positive vibrations of the film, there are other reasons to please the Grand Canyon. On the one hand, it has an outstanding cast ... Kevin Kline and Danny Glover, for example. In my opinion, Crash, the highly acclaimed film that won the Oscar for best film, was very similar to this movie. The difference is that the Grand Canyon makes you feel positive. Crash had the opposite effect with me; It was very dark. I would choose Grand Canyon Over Crash any day.
