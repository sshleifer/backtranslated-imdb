Other critics here seem to think that this is a horrible movie. That is simply not true and a little unfair. <br /> <br /> The performance is of good quality and the direction moves forward with a decent fluency. I do not think there's anything wrong with the way we intertwine Tarantino-esquire stories. Maybe it's just a new tool for principals to try. I thought it made the movie much more interesting. Maybe some elements of the script need to be adjusted, but that's the only fault I can find. Nestor Cantillana offers a great performance, since Sylvio, also Antonella Rios, is impressive and worth it just for the price of the ticket.
