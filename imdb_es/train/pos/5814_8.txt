With all this going on right now with MJ, I started listening to his music, watching the strange documentary here and there, looked at The Wiz and looked at Moonwalker again. Maybe I just want to have some idea of ​​this guy that, in my opinion, was great in the eighties to decide if he is guilty or innocent. Moonwalker is part biography, part movie that I remember seeing in the cinema when it was originally released. Some of them have subtle messages about MJ's feelings towards the press and also the obvious message of drugs is bad. <br /> <br /> Visually stunning but, of course, this is all about Michael Jackson, so unless you like it remotely MJ Anyway then you're going to hate this and you'll find it boring. Some may call MJ an egotist for consenting to the making of this film, BUT MJ and most of his fans would say that he did it for the fans, which, if it is true, is very kind of him. <br /> <br /> The Real Feature The film when it finally begins, only lasts 20 minutes or so, excluding the Smooth Criminal sequence, and Joe Pesci is convincing as a psychopath, all powerful drug lord. Why he wants MJ to die so bad is beyond me. Because MJ heard your plans? No, Joe Pesci's character said he wanted people to know that he is supplying drugs, etc. so I do not know, maybe he just hates MJ's music. <br /> <br /> There are many great things in this as MJ becomes a Car and a robot and the whole sequence of Speed ​​Demon. In addition, the director must have had the patience of a saint at the time of filming the child. The bad sequence, since normally the directors hate working with a child, let alone a lot of them playing a complex dance scene. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, this movie is for people who like MJ at one level or another (which I think is the majority of people). If not, then get away. Try to send a healthy message and, ironically, MJ's best friend in this movie is a girl! Michael Jackson is truly one of the most talented people who have honored this planet, but is he guilty? Well, with all the attention I've given to this topic ... hmmm, I do not know because people can be different behind closed doors, I know for sure. Either he's an extremely kind but stupid guy or one of the sickest liars. I hope it is not the latter.
