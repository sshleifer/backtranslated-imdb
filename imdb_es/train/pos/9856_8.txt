(Spoilers?) <br /> <br /> I was not sure what to make of the movie. Not too much of a children's movie. Definitely one should watch with a father because it includes death and death. But I was surprised that I entertained a little. <br /> <br /> I felt a little disappointed for the 81 minutes of time we had. (even less without the credits) And the trailer makes you think that the rodent is a main creature. But unfortunately, they torture him. Right until the end of the movie. Those two complaints docked the 2-star movie. But I do recommend the movie. Even for a sequel. <br /> <br /> 8/10 <br /> <br /> Quality: 9/10 Entertainment: 7/10 Playable: 7/10
