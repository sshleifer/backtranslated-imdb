I had expected this movie a lot since I saw the trailer, which looked like a political drama, starring three of my favorite actors; Al Pacino, John Cusack and Bridget Fonda. And even though it was directed by Harold Becker, who has done an unequal job, he and Pacino combined in SEA OF LOVE, which is among each of his best works. But the interference at some level (to begin with, several of the scenes in the original trailer do not appear in the film) and the change of tone (the subsequent trailers make it look like a thriller) make this, although observable, can not be watch. have been. <br /> <br /> What is very bad, because I really wanted to like this movie. There was great potential here to be a movie about how government can still be worthwhile despite all the corruption, and to make a complex statement about that corruption, not the usual good guys against the bad guys. And there is good performance here. Pacino and Cusack are very good, and Danny Aiello gives one of the best performances of his career. But Fonda is wasted in his role, has nothing to do, and while there is merit in the central plot, when it becomes a thriller, the film loses its way, recovers briefly in the final scene between Cusack and Pacino, and then it falls down completely at the end. I wish I could like this more, but no.
