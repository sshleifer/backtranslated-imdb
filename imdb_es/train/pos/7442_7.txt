I rented the movie (I do not think it was released here) expecting the worst. The previews made the movie look horrible. In fact, I was very surprised, it was worth seeing; It was written loosely, almost like a whole movie. I had some very funny moments and, although defective, it is an effective satire on the program and on the people of the program without being too scathing. It is flawed, mainly because of the horrible soundtrack of the effects of the "comedy", but in general it is presented as an honest and, in general, true way of the show in a way that taller or Larry Sanders. <br /> <br /> At the moment it is fashion to criticize Jerry Springer, he is also an easy target. Springer could have made Citizen Kane and proclaimed himself "the worst movie ever made". I recommend this movie to anyone interested in the show. A defective but innovative and interesting film.
