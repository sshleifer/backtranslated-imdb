Mr. Blandings builds his dream home can be the best Frank Capra / Preston Sturges movie that neither has ever done! If you love Bringing Up Baby, The Philadelpia Story, The Thin Man, I Was a Male War Bride or It's a Wonderful Life - movies made with wit, taste and the occasional tongue panting firmly on the cheek, take a look. The post-World War II life is simple and idyllically portrayed. <br /> <br /> Grant is at the top of his form playing the mouse of the city venturing into the life of a rural squire. Loy is adorable as his wife before now. The cast of supporting characters is compared to You can not take it with you and contains an early part of the future Tarzan Lex Barker. Art direction and editing are well above par. <br /> <br /> The film never leans towards the low income venal slapstick of the latest adaptation of The Money Pit.
