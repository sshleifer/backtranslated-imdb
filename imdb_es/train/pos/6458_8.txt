A beautiful film that deeply moves the simple but divine aspects of humanity. <br /> <br /> This movie was almost perfect, and seeing that nothing in this world can be truly perfect, that's pretty good. The only minor thing that I subjectively oppose is the rhythm at some points in the middle of the story. The acting is also very good, and all the actors easily are main actors in high profile films. The actual direction seems to have been well thought out, and the script must have been incredible. There are some really impressive moments of prefiguration, and a pretty beautiful and continuous circular composition of the story. <br /> <br /> The moment in the movie, when the main character achieves that feeling of being in heaven is the perfect ending for A truly brilliant thread.
