This is the movie I've seen more times than any other (I think I saw it on average once a year since it was released). And every time I see it, it's equally fantastic and always reveals something new to me. The cast was probably a combination of the best in Yu's cinematography. This film is an absolute necessity for any film lover who respects himself. In the same league: Maratonci trce pocosni krug, Balkanski spijun and Otac na sluzbenom putu. This is a movie poker that everyone should have in their collection of private videos.
