['This movie, for the last ten years, has become one of my favorite pseudo noir experiences. The three strands of history that Kazan gives us have their unique and separate pleasures. The domestic conversation between Bel Geddes and Widmark, the movement between the rooms, the small gestures like the telephone directory that Barbara places in the chair under her son so that he can get to the table, those intimate intimate exchanges between husband and wife, all They are well made. and natural More than anything, I love your porch, that second living room where it is clear that they spend a lot of their summer time. The second thread is the professional relationship among many in the film, but especially among the characters of Widmark and Douglas. It may not be totally original and it may become a bit violent, but in general, it is presented as real, respectful and efficient. The third thread, the dirty tale of Blackie and his small gang in tatters, brings us closer to a dark and terrifying black world. Palance&#39;s Blackie is as cold as a block of ice. This self-proclaimed businessman, this self-made man has a complexity that we only use briefly. For me, this movie is still a completely satisfactory experience.']
