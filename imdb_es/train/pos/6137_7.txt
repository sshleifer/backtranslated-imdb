What a great jewel this is. It is an unusual story that is fun to watch. Yes, it has singing, but it's very well integrated into the story and it's very melodic to listen to. It was so nice to see; I enjoyed it from beginning to end! <br /> <br /> The film takes place in England during World War II. It is a witch apprentice who is looking for a missing part of a spell that she needs. She uses her harsh "magic" to transport her and 3 children under her care to various destinations to find her. They were joined by their correspondence teacher, who is surprised to learn that the lessons of their school really work. <br /> <br /> Although special effects may seem a little outdated at first, once you get used to them, they become part of the charm of this movie. In fact, the movie won an Oscar for these effects! <br /> <br /> The movie is innocent and funny, and it's hard not to like the melodious songs. The characters are wonderfully interesting to watch. I think that anyone at any age could find something that he likes about this movie.
