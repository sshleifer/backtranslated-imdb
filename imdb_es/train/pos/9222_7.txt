['There have been very few large format films set in postcolonial Africa, and the ones they have are a mixed group. This, with its altruistic pretensions of exposing slavery in the 1970s, shows the best and worst values of Africa, which are not very different from the values of humanity as a whole. It also has shortcomings, given the undue influence of Western preconceptions of Africans and, especially, of Arabs. <br /><br /> Dr. Anansa Linderby, the beautiful African American wife of English doctor David Linderby, is captured by Arab slave traders, along with a teenage Sanufu and a boy. The main slave trader, Suleiman, is almost the entire Arab scene, with its florid and, at times, humorous rhetoric, and gestures to match, which would not be out of place in &quot;Continue, follow that camel&quot;, but they are not up to this standard. the film deserves Peter Ustinov, of course, had more than enough skills to address some of the shortcomings of the script, and rescued what might otherwise have been a pitiful one-dimensional character. <br /><br /> Continuing with the stereotyped theme, the three Arab employees of Suleiman are not intelligent and one has pedophile tendencies toward the child, which fortunately do not appear on the screen. <br /><br /> One of David&#39;s first ports of call is the local police officer, a stereotyped pompous and incompetent African bureaucrat. David then meets two stereotyped white expatriates, an Englishman (Walker, played by Rex Harrison) and an American (Sandell, played by William Holden). Sandell is a mercenary with &quot;conventional&quot; views on mixed race relationships, which he initially refuses to help unless David provides the advance payment. Won for David&#39;s love for Anansa, and aware of his own inability to find love, he agrees to take David in his helicopter to help find Anansa. They find Suleiman and his captives crossing the border and can not chase them to the neighboring territory. As a result of Sandell&#39;s hesitation and David&#39;s lack of experience with firearms, his helicopter is shot down, but David survives. <br /><br /> Then we see David introduced to Malik (Kabir Bedi), an African who has lost his family to Suleiman and now is only driven by revenge. They find the Sanufu girl with a Tuareg group and they know they are on the right track to find Suleiman. <br /><br /> In one of the most heartbreaking scenes, they kill a group of slave traders only to discover that it was not Suleiman&#39;s group and they have no choice but to send their captives to the Tuareg they knew before. <br /><br /> Later we discover that the young man who had been raped is a witch doctor and, in an excellent scene with supernatural insinuations, he uses his knowledge to kill one of Suleiman&#39;s henchmen. Anansa for his part, and despite the skepticism of the child, manages to design the disappearance of the other two employees of Suleiman. <br /><br /> By then, Suleiman and his slaves are within days of reaching the slave market. <br /><br /> Suleiman, now without doubt that Anansa is a &quot;problem&quot;, tries to sell her to an obscenely rich Arab prince (Omar Sharif) who is corrupt but intelligent. Upon discovering that Anansa is an American working for the UN, the prince decides, in an unwise manner, to continue with the negotiation without considering the consequences. The scene in which the two men haggle is one of the best in the movie. <br /><br /> In the slave market, the young man is sold to a middle-aged German pedophile, and we have left to guess whether the child will still be considered &quot;wunderbar&quot; when his owner is at the receiving end of his skills as a witch doctor. <br /><br /> David and Malik finally face Suleiman and there is a bittersweet ending from Malik&#39;s point of view. <br /><br /> Ultimately, David and Anansa come together again, and Malik, whose life is in ruins, can be consoled with having seen the task that was proposed completed. <br /><br /> The general plot of the film is excellent, but it loses its marks due to its stereotyped interpretation of almost all the main characters. The credit should go to all the major players to address many of the shortcomings of the scripts.']
