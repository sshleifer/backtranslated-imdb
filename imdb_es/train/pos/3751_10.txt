I know that you have already entered this in film festivals (or at least I think you have done it, I can be inventing it), but I think that there should be "the best animated short film" in each one. Bravo. I can not wait for the full movie. I realize that you may not hear this often due to the strange nature of your animations, but that you listen to it now and accept it as the truth. Congratulations my friend. Well, now I'm just trying to get ten lines of text ... Although I still mean it. And here comes another - SIZE! - and I can not stop here yet. This is extremely annoying and at the same time I have nothing better to do. In fact, you're likely to see all your movies in another spasmodic "Jason Steele Marathon." I have many of those. <br /> <br /> -R
