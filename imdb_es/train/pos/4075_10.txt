Laputa: castle in the sky is the bomb. The message is as strong as his newest and most pure, fantastic and flying pirate works, how could it be better! The art is totally amazing and the soundtrack, which is reused many times after this (I'm not sure if it was the first time I heard it) and provokes me the most emotional sentimental response of any film soundtrack. Sheeta, the female protagonist in this film is totally amazing and the child, Pazu is also a great role model: live alone! The plot is classic Miyazaki. I'm not going to give it away, but the end is really great. I classify this as one of the best three of Miyazaki with Nausicaa and Spirited Away. You may also want to check out Howl Mobile Castle when it comes out (I hope next year) if you like Miyazaki, pay attention to this as it is available in the US. UU Enjoy, Piper A
