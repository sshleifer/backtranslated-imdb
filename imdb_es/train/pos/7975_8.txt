I love Malle's documentaries. They are so simple and effortless, but they are still so fascinating. I have no idea why this documentary works. It is about Glencoe, Minnesota. 5000 people live there and nothing happens, really. But still Malle manages to make it fascinating and interesting. His love for humanity, even racist or homophobic people, is so overwhelming that you can not help it, but also fall in love with them. <br /> <br /> Malle filmed most of it in 1979. She came back 6 years later to see what had changed. This would have been a good movie without the material 6 years later, but this little addition makes it great. It may seem that Malle was only doing what has been done in the series Up, but in reality it is not. The Up series are about people. Malle's emphasis is not so much what happened to each person as what happened to this community. And the change is great. 1985 is the Reagan era and farmers are suffering. Once it was a proud community, now nobody sees much future and parents expect their children to be educated and do more than agriculture. <br /> <br /> This documentary is quite relevant today. Our financial crisis started today because of what was happening then. Take a look at these final words of the film, uttered by an older lawyer in the city (in 1985): <br /> <br /> "Well, I have high hopes in this country because things are going well. It can only be characterized in my mind as an obsession with greed, and a nation does not live long with that obsession, and in particular with a democracy that ... There is something good, there is a lot of good in this country and a lot of good people and they're not going to ... they're not going to subscribe to this greed philosophy that's happening now, it's horrible. " <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it took more than 20 years and a hell of a headache before that happened
