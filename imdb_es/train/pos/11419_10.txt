The debut of Claire Denis is both brave and confident. In this representation of life towards the end of the French colonialist Cameroon, he explores the relations between men and women, in black and white. <br /> <br /> With the black servant 'Prot√©e' as the main object of desire and oppression of the film, the film enters taboo territory from the beginning. Denis creates an image of life through a series of character relationships that keep the viewer informed on the screen. The mood of the film is perfectly reflected in the camera work and (lack of) lighting. <br /> <br /> A great speech.
