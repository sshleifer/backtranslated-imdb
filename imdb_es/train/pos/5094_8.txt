['If you are a purist, do not waste time; Otherwise, hold your hat and enjoy the adventure. I loved the version of Stewart Granger / Deborah Kerr: I&#39;ve seen it dozens of times, but this movie is just as good, but different. I will not detail the differences because it would ruin the movie. Also, it&#39;s a pleasure to see Alison Doody again (I&#39;m a big Indiana Jones fan), Patrick Swayze is as good as Quatermain, and the cast is excellent. I think the quality of the support is one of Hallmark Production&#39;s trademarks and this movie was no exception. The cinematography is splendid and the score is perfect. If you are looking for entertainment, you will not be disappointed.']
