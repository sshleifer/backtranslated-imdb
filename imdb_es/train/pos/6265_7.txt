Nick and Kelly are ready to get married, but Travis (Kelly's dog) takes Nick to a strange blue wall that will change the honeymoon for Kelly. Richard Burgi and Susan Walters play Nick and Kelly and make a good couple. Nick loves to drink, smoke and play pool with friends for fun, but Nick suddenly abstains from this kind of fun. Sex is the only thing he loves because he wants a child. We discovered that an alien race is dying and needs to cross paths with women on Earth to save their population. It becomes a survival battle between humans and aliens with the participation of the dog population. A good movie.
