This was a good movie with a powerful message of love and redemption. I loved the transformation of the brother and the repercussions of the horrible disease in the family. Well acted and well directed. If there was any failure, I would have to say that the story showed the typical suburban family and its difficulties again. What about all people from all cultural backgrounds? I would love to see a movie where all these cultures are shown, as in real life. However, the movie skyrocketed in terms of its values ​​and its understanding of how an illness can bring someone closer to its creator. I loved the movie and it brought tears to my eyes.
