Normally I am not a fan of strictly romantic movies but I heard that this was good. I was stunned. Easily the most romantic thing I have ever seen in my life. Wonderful. Bright, sweet, fun and full of heart. The chemistry is impeccable, just like the writing and the direction. <br /> <br /> Ethan Hawke and Julie Delphy are so natural and sweet that they really think they are a couple. <br /> <br /> Movies catch you right away and they will not let you go. You can not look the other way nor can you stop listening to them. Even small moments simply melt your heart. <br /> <br /> This has jumped into the ranks of one of my favorites. A masterpiece.
