THE LIGHT LISTENER (2006) ** 1/2 Robin Williams, Toni Collette, Bobby Cannavale, Rory Culkin, Joe Morton, Sandra Oh, John Cullum, Lisa Emery, Becky Ann Baker. (Dir: Patrick Stettner) <br /> <br /> The Hitchcockian jockstrap gives Williams a discreet, low-key performance. <br /> <br /> What do celebrities and fans have? What is the close paranoia that one associates with the other and why is it almost the norm? <br /> <br /> In the last Derange fans' scenario, based on the real events, Williams plays a talk radio character named Gabriel Nadie, who reads stories written by air and has accumulated an interesting fanatic in the form of a boy named Pete Logand (Culkin) who presented a manuscript about the tribulations of his young man with problems to the editor of Noe, Ashe (Morton), who gives it to Nobody to read it for himself. <br /> <br /> No one is disturbed in a natural way, but ultimately is intrigued by the existence of a Pete nightmare that was abducted and sexually abused for years until finally rescued by a nurse named Donna (Collette, who had an excellent performance) who has adopted the But his correspondence with Nobody reveals that Pete is dying of AIDS. Naturally, nobody wants to meet the fans, but suddenly he is in doubt about his possible hidden motives when the seed is planted by his estranged lover Jess (Cannavale) whose sudden departure from his New York City apartment does not have anyone in an emotional extreme that she has only now has become a tempest in a teacup when she decides to investigate a little about the background of Donna and Pete by discovering some truths that she did not anticipate. <br /> <br /> Written by Armistead Maupin (who co-wrote the script with his former lover Terry Anderson and the film's new director, Stettner, and based on a true story about a fan's deception, he discovered that he has some Hitchcockian moments that move at full speed like any good traditional kettle ... It helps that Williams gives an outstanding and discreet performance as the good-hearted personality in conflict who really wants to believe that his fanatic number one is in fact real and loves him (the only thing who has escaped his own reality) and has some terrible and disturbing moments with the creepy Collette, whose only physical trait I will leave without mentioning, but underlines the desperation of his character that can make you hit to the core. /> <br /> However, the film runs out of gas and eventually becomes a bit repetitive and predictable despite the fact that Stettner, a quirk and mystery finely directed by S tettner, it's worth listening to your own inner voice: be careful what you expect.
