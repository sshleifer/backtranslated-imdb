Excellent farce! Which, of course, is all that is intended to be. Fortunately, there is no social or political message, nor is there any attempt in that direction. Could the plot really be taken, or have it taken place at some particular time or place? It is unlikely, since, after all, this is simply, simply, a movie, and movies come from the imagination, not from reality. The only objective of this film is to entertain, certainly not educate, and entertain, with a charming and joyful reality thrown to the winds. I think most would agree that from the documentaries we expect enlightenment and authenticity. But for entertainment I want what today is described as a "piece of cake", that The Mating Game is in all aspects. For a few giggles and a sassy laugh from time to time, this is a fantastic fantasy.
