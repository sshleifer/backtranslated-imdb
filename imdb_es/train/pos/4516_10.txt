From Educating Rita, Julie Walters has been one of my role models, and her performance in this as a woman who helps the man she loves to be in tune with her feminine side is magnificent. He would never have believed that his character was in the hands of a minor actress, but Walters achieves it with enthusiasm and elegance. Adrian Pasdar gives his best performance to date in the men's leadership.
