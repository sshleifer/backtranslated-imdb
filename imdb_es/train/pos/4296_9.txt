This would have been my number one movie of the year in 1991, except that it was surpassed by the brilliant JFK. This is such a wonderful movie! I loved. I love stories in which the lives of different characters intersect with others and how they face their lives. Kevin Kline is good here, but he is surpassed by Danny Glover and, especially, Steve Martin. I've never really liked Martin or his style, but here it's great. I loved all the speech he gave Kline near the end about the Grand Canyon. The writing was excellent. Larry Kasdan is, IMO, a great dialogue writer, like Kevin Smith and Quentin Tarantino. Here, he has formed several three-dimensional characters and well thought out arguments, and messages that give a positive feeling to our lives. A really excellent movie. 4 out of 4 stars
