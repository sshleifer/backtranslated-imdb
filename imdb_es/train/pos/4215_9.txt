In this excellent twentieth-century Fox movie, the metropolis is a labyrinth of despair in which scavengers and predators survive by living on one another. Think of urban landscapes lower than insignificant humanity in a sombre expressionist symbolism. <br /> <br /> A prostitute has her bag snatched in the subway. It contains a microfilm, and a communist espionage network will do everything possible to recover it. Two parallel investigations are carried out while spies and police search for valuable information. <br /> <br /> Anti-hero pickpocket Skip McCoy is played in complete safety by Richard Widmark. He knows that the police are his inferior moral and intellectual equals, so he makes fun of them: "Go on," he tells Captain Dan Tiger (Murvyn Vye) "accumulates an accusation. This ruthless world, the police are just another gang in the streets. Just as Candy, the whore, bribes Lightning Louie to get a clue, the police are busy paying the pigeons for information. <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe that when Widmark made this movie, he was already middle-aged. . The 39-year-old star, who ends his contract with Fox, plays the upstart Skip McCoy with the irreverent effrontery of a teenager. Today it may not be acceptable for the romantic protagonist to strike his love interest in unconsciousness and then reanimate it by pouring beer in his face, but by the customs of the time it meant hardness, and Candy, after all, is a fallen woman . br /> <br /> Jean Peters is radiant like Candy. Here, right in the middle of her five years of B movie fame, she is beautiful and sexy like the whore with the golden heart. She is the victim of history, a martyr of her beauty as much as anything else. He has good intentions, but he is constantly being manipulated by cynical men: Joey, Skip and the cops. <br /> <br /> The real star of this movie is New York. The urban panoramas and the metro stations that cross the streets offer a claustrophobic evocation of the city as a living and malevolent force. Like worms in a rotten cheese, human figures run through the roads of the city. Elevators, metro turnstiles, sidewalks, even a silly waiter acts as a conduit for the flow of corrupt humanity. People cling to any niche that offers security: Moe has his dirty room rented, Skip his dark shack on the Hudson River. As the characters move and interact, they are framed by a bridge architecture, or latticework of beams, or are divided by winch rigs. The personality of the city is constantly imposed. The angles and transverse beams of the beams of the docks are an echo of the plane of the street, and the cabinets of index cards in the squadron imitate the Manhattan skyline. When Joey's departure from the subway is prohibited, it's as if the steel tendons of the city were trapping him. <br /> <br /> A surprising proportion of this film was filmed in an extreme close-up. The character directs the plot, as it should, and the close-ups are used to increase the character. When Skip interrogates Candy, the foreground captures the sexual energy between them, avoiding the hostility of Skip's words. The beauty of Jean Peters is painted with light, in exquisite approaches of soft focus. The device is also used to increase the voltage. The sequence of opening, the rapture of the bag, does not contain any dialogue: the drama is totally based on the foreground because of its powerful effect. <br /> <br /> The snoops and the snoopers of the snoopers populate the film. Moe (Thelma Ritter) earns his living as an informant and his place in the hierarchy is accepted, even by his victims. When Skip observes, "she has to eat", he is singing a recurring chorus. In the same way that "direct" New Yorkers sell lamb or wood chops, the Underworld travels in the information base. <br /> <br /> And yet, even the pigeons are superior to Joey and his communist friends. Joey's feet in Moe's bed symbolize a transgression of the most basic moral code. Joey is beyond pale. Moe will not trade with Joey, not even to preserve his life: "... even in our fake business, you have to draw the line somewhere." <br /> <br /> "Pick-Up" was made in the depths of The Cold War. Richard Nixon had just been chosen as the Republican vice presidential candidate, after having made his name with his fake Alger Hiss exposes: a fake communist microfilm and all. McCarthy's essays were a daily reality. We see the cops in the film against "the traitors who gave Stalin the atomic bomb". <br /> <br /> New York can be seen as a giant receptacle in which human spoils commit traps, shrieks and murders. The containers form a leitmotiv throughout the film. Moe wears his brand of tie box, and Candy's bag, microfilm container, is the engine of the plot. Skip keeps his only possessions in a submerged box, symbolizing his secret street wisdom. The coffins of the poor, who move on the Hudson in a barge, are containers of one more load that moves around the ruthless metropolis. <br /> <br /> The film is a masterpiece of composition. Candy is shown above the skunk. Jump down the ramshackle walkway of the hut, which means your moral descent. When the weapon is placed on the table, extreme perspective makes it look bigger than Candy: violence is beginning to weaken compassion. The lovers are eclipsed by the shadow of a docker's hook, reminding us that their love is neither pure nor absolute, but depends on the caprices of the sinister city. Enyard the communist is a shadow on a wall, or a puff of disembodied cigarette smoke. It's like the lonely stray cat in the trash, a predatory ghost of the night. Camera shots from under the hoods of taxis, newspaper kiosks and hospital bed bars constantly reinforce in us the awareness that we are all stuck in the metropolis. We are the cushion of civilization.
