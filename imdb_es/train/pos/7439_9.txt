The Ancient Mariner is a truly classic work, as was the original poem. The context / environment with the old sailor itself is good, clear and unpretentious. The artistic work that accompanies the reading of the poem fits perfectly to the time / period of the stage and the work itself, taking the audience to the period with an immobile but moving accompaniment, using excellent strategies of motionless movement alone well conquered by the public. Producers of the pre-MTV era and much less apparent in more current jobs. (MTV brought to television and video a static movement that travels, often irrelevant cuts, from topic to topic without movement forward and without clear relationships with theme or history.) The voice, the intonation and the vitality of the reading of Redgrave gives life to this poignant poem. With all their fear, strife and pain. In addition, the smooth movement of the video emphasizes the cadence and the occasional monotonous tone (in this case, a positive mood under the theme of the story itself) of the author's interpretation of the sad and spooky tale of the former sailor. This is a must for any love for classical poetry, the sea, a tall story, which almost seems true, and a story that has left a lasting impact on our world and culture. Who does not understand the meaning of an "albatross"? Or the concept of "water, water everywhere and not a drop to drink?" A truly good experience Thank you, Mr. DaSilva, for giving us life to this, so that we never forget it.
