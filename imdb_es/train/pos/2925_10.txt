During the uprising of Eddie Murphy, a woman in the audience yells at Eddie and a man from the audience responds. what is said is, women - DO MR ROB (this is a character from Saturday night), the man responds with SHUT UP BITCH. unlike the previous post that said that women shouted at Gumby, this is wrong, although the post-er said he was there, they must have a hearing problem! despite what the post-er says about not being able to listen to it on DVD, listen carefully, since you can really hear it on the DVD - DO MR ROB !!! I hope this helps anyone who is curious about the outburst greetings gaz !!!!!! !!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!! !!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!! !!!!!!!
