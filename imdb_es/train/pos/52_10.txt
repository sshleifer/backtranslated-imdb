This movie is incredible. If you have the opportunity, look at it. Although, a warning, you will cry your eyes. I do it, every time I see it, I own it and have seen it many times. The performances are exceptional. It is about darkness and pain and loss, but there is hope. This movie made me see the world differently: indirect experience, according to my English teacher. Also, if you have seen it, observe the interesting use of shadows and light. Home room is a phenomenal movie, and I qualify it with 10/10, really, due to the excellent performance, the incredible plot and the heartbreaking dialogue. Very tense, very emotional. It does not give all the answers, but it makes many positive points about humanity.
