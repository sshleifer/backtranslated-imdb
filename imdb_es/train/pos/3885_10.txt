I was introduced to "Eddie" by friends from "across the pond" who know that I like smart humor. I prefer comedians who can be stimulating while entertaining, like George Carlin and Dennis Miller. In 'Dress to Kill', Eddie provides the same kind of social observation humor that stimulates your thoughts on a subject and, at the same time, causes your side to be divided at the same time. There is a wide range of topics in this stand-up and they are simply hysterical. The piece on how to decide the artistic name of Englebert will leave you sharp! <br /> <br /> Thanks Andrew and Catherine! ... and "Do you have a flag?"
