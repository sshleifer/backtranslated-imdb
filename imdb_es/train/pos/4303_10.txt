This is an excellent movie with a stellar cast and a great performance. I never get tired of seeing it. I especially love the scene in which the character of Danny Glover and the character of Kevin Kline, namely Simon and Mack, have brunch together. Kevin Kline is so natural and it seems that his manners are effortless and one with which you would meet often. So it's a very "real" movie. <br /> <br /> One of the most powerful scenes in the film, however, is at the beginning of the film when Simon arrives at the scene where Mack's car has broken down. The film also has a strong message and is different from the stereotyped message that a film carries where there is a person who preaches his guts to an audience. Instead, the emotions and situations of the actors emit a powerful message that works better without the use of words. And finally, Mary McDonell is brilliant as always.
