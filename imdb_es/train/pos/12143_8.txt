Brilliant movie, the next best movie for The Drunken Master (Jackie Chan). I recently bought it on an original VHS and I have not seen this movie for 15 years, but still as good as it was back then. The acting was terrible and the dubbing was even worse, but those characteristics that make this movie (and many other Chinese Chinese kung fu films) are great. The choreography is impressive and the story is basic. I have never seen Shaolin's 36th camera, but I know it's the same movie, but Gordon Liu plays San Te, but San Te in Thr Return to The 36th Chamber is played by a different character. He has a lot of comedy value and brilliant kung fu.
