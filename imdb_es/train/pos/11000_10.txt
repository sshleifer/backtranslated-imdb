If you entered the film with expectations, throw them away now, because no exaggeration will make this film fair. <br /> <br /> Sorting this movie into one genre would be criminal. It's a spy thriller, it has elements of noir, fragments of action, science fiction and cyberpunk, all united with a brilliant narrative, twists of the plot and a magnificent cinematography. <br /> <br /> Much The comments here have focused on the derivatives being, both in good and bad way, from other films. But as they say, all of Shakespeare's cribs of a story, so once you can overcome that, you'll find an incredible journey. <br /> <br /> You'll have to suspend your disbelief at some points, and while the set never gets amazing, there are lots (read: the elevator) that suffer from a low budget and somewhat cheesy visuals. However, do not misunderstand what it means that it is on the same level as the scurvy Sci-Fi channel movies, because this is at a much higher level. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for action, you should activate far. This is pure psychology. But if you're willing to sit down and devote a good 90 minutes of your life to a new cinematic experience, do it now! Watch this movie now before it becomes great to have seen it!
