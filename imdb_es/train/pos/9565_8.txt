Dog Bite Dog will not be for everyone, but I enjoyed it a lot. Full of slaps, stabs and shots (but do not worry, the advantage is a terrible blow), can be described as a violent challenge through Hong Kong and Cambodia. Edison Cheng plays Pang, a Cambodian murderer in the city to kill a lawyer. Despite being dirty from his trip, he is almost immediately seated at a huge table in the middle of an obviously expensive restaurant. If this seems too far-fetched to you, you should probably avoid this movie. It was my signal to suspend disbelief and I had a lot more fun. <br /> <br /> Pang Pang is Wai (Sam Lee), a young and nervous policeman who likes to hit people almost as much as he likes to smoke. Wai follows a fine line in which Internal Affairs is investigating him, and his father, a legendary Good Cop, is in a coma after a drug deal that went south (the implication is that Wai is letting his father take the control for their own corrupt deals). <br /> <br /> There is a car accident, many murders and a strange and uncomfortable love story that is offered here, all in almost a comic style. I suspect that the humor was deliberate (no one uses huge concrete howitzers without an eye for the extravagant nonsense), although the exaggerated nature lost some of my audiencemates. There are at least three points in which the film could have ended, and in 109 minutes it could have benefited from a more relentless edition, or the elimination of one of the narrative threads (happy things worked well, so I would have stayed outside the interactions with the three parents). <br /> <br /> I am inclined to give you a pass (high), however, if only for the end? Rarely have I heard so many people laugh so hard in what should have been a moving moment. This is one to see with a group of friends who love the ridiculous.
