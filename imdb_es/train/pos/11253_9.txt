This is an extremely long movie, which means you can get bored long before it becomes interesting, but its duration gives your characters the chance to find a permanent bond in their sympathies. <br /> <br /> If guilt moves you from the disgusting you will find it particularly heartbreaking, because it is a story that finds its heroes among the wicked and the weak. If you can love a monster, you will cry for Magnus Pym, the spy who betrays everyone, especially his country, his friends and family, a man who has also been manipulated and shaped since childhood by those same people. <br /> <br /> There is not a truly nice character in all of history, nor a loyal, "moral" personality to sympathize with. But seeing everything without the help of a handkerchief would be quite surprising. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed it at the end. Well worth it for people who like the inciting films about the lowest human character.
