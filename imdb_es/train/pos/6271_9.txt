I liked this movie. It was pretty cool It has everything: cars, gun shots, fights, and even a token girl. It does not excel in any of these things, except for the cars. A little shooting, a bit of fighting, a little kissing, and a lot of cars, with a big chase near the end. The jump, you can say, is not practical, but according to our good friends here in the IMDB, it is possible, so the film is not as bad as people are painting it. It has something of quality, and I liked to look at it. In fact, I loved the movie. And I did not have to turn off my brains to see it. I did not always think "Is this possible?" or vagabond like that. 9 in 10.
