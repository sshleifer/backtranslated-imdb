It's really weird that you have an insider's view of a media hoax that has been so widely reported as official "truth" and has caught so many "news" agencies with their pants down. This film, in my opinion, deserves all the prices that exist in journalism: it is objective (yes!), Courageous and a real "scoop". It can be done without comments, false scenes or important questions: everyone, including Chávez, goes crazy with his own words. The filmmakers "just" had to keep track of the events and keep their cameras moving. <br /> <br /> The Venezuelan elite teaches us "how to depend on a president and sell it as a victory for democracy". It is incredible that they have lost in the end, until now. As far as I know, the largest television station involved was only revoked its terrestrial license, they are still transmitting by cable and satellite. I recto infección that George sociedades or Barack Obama are so toleEST after a coup attempt. But then, you do not have to worry. <br /> <br /> The fact that the scam "Chavez sympathizers shoot innocent civilians" was heartily repeated throughout the world reveals how biased the so-called "free" (established) media really is. they have converted, or have always been, just more. An important lesson for anyone interested in what "really" happens in the world. <br /> <br /> The famous challenge of "objectivity" always comes into play when journalists dare to oppose the general opinion, or reveal unwanted facts that accuse "us" - it has been true with the effects of the atomic bomb, the secret history of the United States of spread of "democracy" around the world or the war in Iraq that, according to Johns Hopkins, has killed 1.3 million Iraqis so far, not to mention the 60,000 Afghans (in 2003) that are never mentioned. To be objective, Saddam Hussein was less harmful to his people than the United States. And EE. UU He is ready and willing to be more detrimental to the Iranians than he is. <br /> <br /> I am quite curious about the upcoming trial of some leaders of the Khmer Rouge before the International Court in The Hague, whether there will be mention of "our" participation in the support and training of the guerrillas Pol Pot in the 80s, when the Vietnamese had largely defeated them. Probably not. <br /> <br /> All the more reason to resort to independent media to obtain balance, if not exposure of fraud.
