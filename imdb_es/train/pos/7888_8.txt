Freddy Krueger, the stalker of dreams of Elm Street, returns in this sequel to Nightmare 5, the dream child. I hope I got the number correctly. There have been many, and this is one of the best. especially for the cameos of Rosanne Barr (then Arnold) tom Arnold, johnny depp, (who made the first nightmare in 84) Alicia Cooper (singer) will see Freddy as a tormented child, a teenager who loves pain and as a type of family (spooky) the effects are very funny and creative, the cast also includes Lisa Zane (Billy's sister) breckin Meyer (road trip) yaphet kotto (alien, live and let die) and Amanda Donahue (the father knows more ) I was One of the people who saw this in 3d, well the end. I love 3D movies. I missed the first wave in 3D in 1953 (I had not even been born yet). The second wave was in 1983. I'm like all of Freddy's movies. This stands out as one of the best without counting the first, which was absolutely brilliant, Freddy became the new monster of the 80s and 90s, along with Jason Voorhees, Chucky, Micheal Myers and Leather Face. Can you imagine a movie with all of them? I recommend it to all Freddy fans and horror fans. Freddy is a great cut.8 out of 10.
