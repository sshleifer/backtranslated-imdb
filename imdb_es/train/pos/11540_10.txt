This is the work of Neil Simon who received many compliments! "The Odd Couple" is a unique jewel that lasts inside. You have Felix Ungar (Jack Lemmon); a hypochondriac, fussy fanatic and a large thorn in the side of his roommate, Oscar Madison (Walter Matthau); a total slob However, these men have great jobs. Felix is ​​a news editor, and Oscar is a sports writer. Both of these men are divorced, Felix's wife is nearby, while Oscar's wife is across the United States (the west coast). Well, what can you say? Two men who live in one roof without going crazy, is impossible and improbable. It's a lot of laughs and a lot of fun. I liked the part where when those two British neighbors talk to both gentlemen, and after Oscar kicked Felix out, he gets lucky and lives with them when he refused to dine with them the night before. It was about time Felix needed to lighten up. I guess all the fans are clean to lighten up. They may be fussy, but they must also be patient. A very funny movie, and a new classic. "The Odd Couple" by Neil Simon is a classic movie that must be seen. 5 STARS!
