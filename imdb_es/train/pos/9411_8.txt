Sidney Stratton has problems maintaining jobs in several textile factories, mainly due to his experimentation in textile laboratories. Stratton is experimenting with a formula for a new fabric that would create the ultimate fabric, one that never gets dirty, wrinkles or wears out. When Stratton finally creates the fabric, he creates enemies in all the textile workers (who will lose their jobs) and the owners (who will lose money since a factory has the exclusive rights), so that Stratton in his white suit becomes the man most wanted. England. The film is ideal and only Ealing could have done it that way. The performance of Guinness (and a great supporting cast like Greenwood, Thesiger and Parker) and the direction of Mackendrick make the film a delight, but the real hero is the story itself, a good satire for business and industry with additional elements of drama, romance, and suspense. Score, 8
