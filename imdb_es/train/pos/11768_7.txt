This movie surprised me in a good way. From the box I got the impression that it was an action thriller, but it was too much fun to be, even though it was something exciting. <br /> <br /> There are many interesting phrases and funny situations in this movie and James Belushi was born to do Bill Manucci, he does a great job. The rest of the cast is not bad either, and especially Timothy Dalton is a delight. <br /> <br /> The story can be quite confusing at times when new characters appear during the movie. Things get complicated as nobody rarely tells the truth about things. If you do not pay attention, things may get a bit messy at the end, but I really liked it. <br /> <br /> Louis Morneau is not as well known, but he has done a good job with this one. and I never really got impatient while watching the movie. <br /> <br /> It's worth taking a look at the men.
