I found this movie very funny, I loved how it was done with the politics of modern sports. This movie is not as fun as South Park, but it's pretty funny. And since I'm a sports fan, I loved how they made fun of some of the most ridiculous things in sports. This film is great also for sports lovers, probably better for them in reality, since they have to go through life wondering why people follow sports so tightly when there are so many rules and complexities unhealthy in sports and the fact that it means absolutely nothing. I also found the game that occurred to them interesting, it's like a horse with bases and psyches (for the person who shoots). In general, I recommend you watch this movie and you think you will end up loving this movie. However, if this comedy style is not your favorite, you probably will not like it. (but that's with any comedy movie)
