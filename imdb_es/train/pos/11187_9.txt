Pet Semetary (1989) 9/10 The Creed family has just moved to the small town of Ludlow. The family consists of a father, Louis, a mother, Rachel, a brother Gage and a daughter, Ellen. They are received with kindness by Jud Crandall. Jud is 89 years old and could basically tell you the whole story of Ludlow. <br /> <br /> Behind the new Creed house, there is a path that leads to a pet cemetery (spelled pet sematary). When Ellen wants to come up to see him, Jud voluntarily takes the family on a trip. That is the beginning of hell for the Creed family. <br /> <br /> When Rachel and the children are gone, Ellen's cat church dies. Jud feels that Ellen is not ready for the death of her cat, so she suggests that Louis follow him down the path, past the pet cemetery. <br /> <br /> Jud tells Louis about this cemetery, once used by the Micmac Indians. Luis buries the church, without Jud's help. A couple of days later, Church returns, alive, but from hell. <br /> <br /> This movie was one of two horror films that could really scare me, in addition to "The Exorcist". The best performance would always be Zelda, Rachel's sister with spinal meningitis, or Victor Pascow, a ghost trying to prevent the Creeds from making the mistake of returning the things of death. <br /> <br /> The music in this The movie plays an extravagant role. It is both sad and mysterious. Goes with the movie beautifully. <br /> <br /> 9/10
