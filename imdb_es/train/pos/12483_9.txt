Although I was in this film playing the role of Sheriff Hodges, I still managed to jump in several places and I thought I'm not that easy. I could say that I am interested in the film and, yes, I am, but I did not see the finished product until 12/27/2006 and I was extremely satisfied. I'm not a fan of horror movies as such, but I love old "B" movies and black and white sci-fi movies. This movie will make you "think" when you know that something is going to happen, then it's not like that, then it happens. It will keep you completely unbalanced. I would suggest seeing the film first, then the director's notes and the special features. It is so well written, directed and filmed, and I can personally tell you that it was a real pleasure to work with this cast and crew. I sincerely hope to be part of the future projects of Brian and Laurence.
