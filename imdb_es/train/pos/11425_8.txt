The story is about a little girl growing up in colonial Africa, but it is much more than that. <br /> <br /> Any person who grows in the South will experience the same things. A longing for another, one of a different race, that can not be consummated. Even a look is forbidden. There are no words necessary. Your facial expressions say it all. <br /> <br /> It is the story of a black servant, Protée (Isaach De Bankolé) and a white woman, Aimée (Giulia Boschi). Their desire for the other is so strong that they torture each other because they can not have each other. <br /> <br /> The girl, France (Cécile Ducasse) is alone and spends all her time with Protée. She really can not see this dance. <br /> <br /> One of the most irritating aspects of the film is the laziness of the colonials. They can not even undress to go to bed alone. There the world is about to end; They just do not know it yet. Their racist attitudes will be erased by their presence. <br /> <br /> I think I would like to visit this Africa. It seems so calm; Especially at night when you only listen to the animals.
