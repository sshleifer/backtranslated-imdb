An unusually serious action player played by a cast and filmed by a director who obviously took the material seriously. Imperfect, as is to be expected of a film clearly shot on a tight budget, but the drama involves: it is one of those films that when repeated at the nauseum in Cinemax 2 or More Max or whatever you call it, you end up watching blocks of 40 minutes when you're supposed to work. Along with W / "Deathstalker 2", "Chopping Mall" and "The Assault", a reminder that Wynorski is a much more talented director than many of his fellow low-budget brothers, who has a real ability to keep up with a genre movie, when you're really interested in the material (ie, do not bother watching any of his Shannon Tweed movies with a 3 or a 4 after the title!) Actors who have had very little to do recently ( Mancuso, Ford, even Gary Sandy for the chrissakes) really put everything into some of their best roles in years, since for Grieco, he looks right, although his performance is a bit of a single note, it's clear that his character he supposes that he must self-destruct. The movie, but Grieco does not convey it at all. I checked IMDB and I see that the writer also wrote "Sorority House Massacre 2" and "Dinosaur Island" for the director, both minor classics in their own rights, but obviously "fools" like those of Roger Cormon Cinema. This is more like some of the best 70s images of Jonathan Demme and Jonathan Kaplan, which give him the element of exploitation, but at the same time offer scenes of drama, a real step forward. Not "Citizen Kane", and the comic final moments are a bit disturbing, but they are well-written people, driven by the character, above average, directly to the video. Small achievements like this should not be overlooked when they occur, which is quite rare (as I was reminded when I tried to sit on an Albert Pyun monstrosity called "Heatseeker" the other night: this low-budget thing is not so easy as it seems, but that's another story!)
