The movie was totally awesome and great. The graphics were excellent and incredible. Especially, Flik was excellent and impressive in the film, it was fun and, at times, smart. The circus bugs are colorful and they are excellent in the movie. The grasshoppers were also excellent and great in the movie. Hopper was a pure and perfect villain. Even, Dot was cute. When, the bird comes to eat the insects, that scene was excellent and good. Even, the last scene was amazing and great. Even Flik's inventions were good. Building an artificial bird was a good idea to scare off grasshoppers. When the ants are building the artificial bird, that scene was good and nice, you really should appreciate the creators of "The Life of an Insect".
