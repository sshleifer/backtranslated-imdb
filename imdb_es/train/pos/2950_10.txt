If you ever became sad about not being able to get a DVD movie, you were probably looking for 'Delirious'. How often do you laugh when you watch comedy routines? I was too young to see Richard Pryor at his best, and when I was old enough to see Eddie Murphy's 'Delirious' and 'Raw' (not so funny) I never knew where Eddie got much of his inspiration from. Now that I'm older, and I've seen both Pryor and many of the comedians after Murphy, I realize two things: Everyone WANTS Eddie, while Eddie HAS ARRIVED FOR Richard. That's the big difference: Eddie was original, funny, provocative, thoughtful? and more. It was something never seen before. It was everything we have always needed. These days Eddie Murphy is bored and old. but he was once the king, and 'Delirious' was the largest castle ever built. Truly one of the funniest routines of all time.
