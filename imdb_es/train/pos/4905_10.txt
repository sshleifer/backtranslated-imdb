"An album of songs so old that everyone thinks they're new." This film has the elusive combination of rhythm and mood that differentiate some movies from the first moments. And why not? Outstanding Talent of Dame Judith Dench as a widow who plays the saxophone with a street musician to help her make the right songs, Olympia Dukakis as the happy widow who lives in a Scottish castle on the pension of her many marriages, Ian Holm as a drummer . who loved all the members of a girl swing band (more or less) of World War II. But wait, there is more. Add Leslie Caron on the bass, and the incomparable Clio Laine in the lead vocal, at last, and the Blonde Bombshells are the most popular band in England since the Beatles. Well, it's okay, not really, but this movie is a winner. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth (Dench) spends the whole movie trying to gather the Blond Bombs to play at her granddaughter's school dance. And before you roll your eyes, imagine how difficult and courageous it would be for a group of sexegenarian women to take the stage in front of the Britney Spears generation after an act called "Open Wound". <br /> <br /> In an age at which career actresses are over when they turn 30, the second album of most bands is a compilation of great hits, and the music of more than one Month has almost no chance of airing, it's great to see real talent, real music and really good movie comes from, where else, the BBC. <br /> <br /> I love this movie, and I know that I will see it many more times and I will enjoy it more and more.
