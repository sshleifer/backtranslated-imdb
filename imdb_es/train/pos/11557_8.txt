They often laugh out loud, sometimes sad stories of two divorced men who work: Lemmon, a neurotic and clean "householder", and Matthau, a shrewd athlete, who decide to live together to cut costs. <br /> <br /> Very well photographed and directed. The script is very complex, that is, there is always more than one side in almost all the lines. The particularly funny scene involves 2 British sisters (Evans and Shelley) who seem to have fun with everything someone says, but when Lemmon bursts his pictures of children and, yes, ex-wife, he has the girls sobbing with him before. Matthau can appear with the promised drinks! <br /> <br /> Very entertaining.
