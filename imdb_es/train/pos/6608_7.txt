There are around 25 years of inspiration in him. Starting with the existential themes of Blade Runner, as well as the vision of the future, with corporate advertising posters that advertise their products, the technology of the latest Matrix films and the Spielberg AI, and finally the graphic novel in black and white has a style similar to that of Sin. City. The creators have put a lot of effort into the visual department and the result is a well-developed neo-noir future. Add a detective story and you have an interesting movie. I know what I wanted to be, but despite the impressive images, it was not enough to reach the final destination.
