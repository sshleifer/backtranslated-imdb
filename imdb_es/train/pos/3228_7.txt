['David Webb Peoples meets Paul Anderson ... if it sounds strange to you, then you&#39;re right, because he is. <br /><br /> Peoples is known for its scripts with moral implications of what is right and wrong, the value of life, etc ... He covered these issues in Bladerunner, without forgiveness, and almost in all his scripts, there is something in that sense. <br /><br /> The first successful film by Paul Anderson was a violent thriller. It is not surprising that all his other films have it! And here is a violent thriller with moral implications! <br /><br /> The script of the towns is quite evident in the first half of the film. The soldiers trained from birth, taught to kill and never had a normal life. They are replaced by better genetic engineering soldiers and Todd, one of the original soldiers, is left on a planet and killed. There he has to deal with a group of refugees, some want him to stay, others hate him and here is an interesting drama. BUT THEN... <br /><br /> ... The bullets begin to fly when the new soldiers move towards the planet for a military exercise and try to kill all the people. There is a great violent and noisy action, and the Peoples script becomes an action festival for Anderson. It&#39;s hard to believe that the script was originally written that way, but the final product is better than I expected. Once the action starts, entertaining, even if it is not very attractive, stimulating and exciting. 7/10 <br /><br /> Classification R: a lot of violence.']
