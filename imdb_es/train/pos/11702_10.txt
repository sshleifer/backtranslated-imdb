A thief in the night has to be the best of all the thrillers of recent times. I have no idea what people complain about what people are whining when they say that these movies scared them into accepting God. They just needed to find an excuse and blamed A Thief In The Night. Do not listen! These films not only speak of one of the many possibilities of tribulation, but they are also fun to watch in their simplicity. In fact, they are low budget and that is a bit obvious, but not too obvious in the first viewing. I had no idea because I really assumed that many movies like these made in the 70s included low budgets all the time. <br /> <br /> A thief in the night tells the story of the young and cynical Patty Myers, who lives for what is presented to her, until her husband and almost all his friends disappear in the prophetic outburst of which all They warned him. At first, the film is not based on it until the rapture occurs. What it entails is to show that everyone else around you is becoming a Christian and believing in Christ, which is often what happens to many people. Everyone around you who once knew and loved will leave forever, and the one who stays behind is the one who blames everyone but themselves. No one can blame himself because he is always right. <br /> <br /> Like these who complain about the movie. These people must be adult adults. I am thirteen years old and you do not see me whimpering, especially because I was exactly like Patty before I again accepted Christ in my heart. For those who have not seen it, if you want a bit of everything in a Christian movie instead of a stereo, all the others are wrong movies, which you will enjoy A Thief In The Night. Do not hit it before trying. Something new is always good. Trust your own instincts.
