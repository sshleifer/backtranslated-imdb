['The part of The Grinch was created for Jim Carrey and I was very impressed with his performance. Not being a big fan of him, he was worried but pleasantly surprised with the result. Taylor Momsen as Cindy Lou, who was the cutest girl I&#39;ve seen on the screen for a long time and showed a maturity beyond her years in her acting skills. I even felt attracted by the tears in a moment! I have never read the book of Dr. Seuss&#39;s story, so I did not know what to expect, the mood was quite dark. In general, I enjoyed the movie (apart from the songs!) And I would recommend it, especially for the family.']
