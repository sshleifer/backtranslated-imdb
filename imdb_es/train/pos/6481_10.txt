I saw this series when I was a child and I loved the details and I never forgot it. I finally bought the DVD collection and it's just what I remembered. This is how a doco should be, impartial and objective. The images of the film are incredible and the interviews are fantastic. The only other series that I found the same as this one is 'Die Deutschen Panzer'. <br /> <br /> I just wish Hollywood would sit and watch this series, then they could make some great war movies. <Br /> <br /> Note. Band of Brothers, Saving Private Ryan, Letters of Iwo Jima, Flags of our parents and When the trumpets vanish.
