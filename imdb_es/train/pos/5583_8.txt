I gather that at least a few people saw him on September 2 at TCM. If you knew that Hedy had to change her name to avoid being associated with this movie when she came to the US UU It was a big scandal and I guess the original premiere in the USA. UU It was so complicated by the censors that it was practically unintelligible. . I saw it because I had just seen a documentary about "bad women", actresses of the censorship board prior to the US film created in the early thirties. It seemed to me that they got away with more than the most "sensational" shots of Hedy in "Ecstasy". In fact, Hedy looked positively innocent on this, by today's standards, and it was nice to see her beauty intact. It was a beautiful lyrical movie to relax. I loved it for what it was: a simple romance. I saw it after recording it previously during an early insomnia. I would love to see the first version released in the United States for comparison purposes.
