Given the opposite circumstance of 2009, where the reality is that we have a black president, this film acquires a quite powerful historical significance. For entertainment value, this movie seemed attractive and disgusting to me. Of course, the flagrant racism of the time left me quite behind, but I also found music and dancing incredible. It's also great to see Sammy Davis Jr as an actor of such small children. He plays Rufus Jones, a young man who is being consoled by his mother. He is told "why would you be president one day?" This was so ridiculous in 1933 that he mocked and thought it was attractive, charming and fun. Most of the film is a fantastic sequence of what the government would be like if it were directed by a black man. They represent that the government seats are like a revivalist Baptist church. <br /> <br /> The fact was that when I came across this movie, one day it attracted me. It is very well done and it is very entertaining. I think that if we can see beyond racism, we can see this movie because of all that it brings us. In fact, realizing that not only is it not ridiculous to have a black president, but that it is normal, makes this film much more relevant. It clearly marks a moment in time for our collective consciousness.
