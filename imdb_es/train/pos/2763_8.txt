People tend to complain about the amount of movies that are made about people with mental disabilities. I do not see this as a valid criticism, nothing more than complaints of too many movies about any kind of people. Jaco van Dormael does a wonderful job with the script and the direction. Daniel Auteuil and Pascal Duquenne work perfectly together, with Duquenne basically playing himself. The film covers a surprisingly large field of events, and she is not simply happy to review what was seen in "Rain Man". The ending is quite depressing, but it does not ruin the wonderful previous story. <br /> <br /> 7.8 out of 10
