The movie did not work well at the box office. <br /> <br /> I saw it in a preview. <br /> <br /> I've always liked the movie. <br /> <br /> I live in one of the cities mentioned in the film to which the past players have moved. <br /> <br /> It's not the best movie that has been screened, but it's nice. <br /> <br /> Robin did well with her Paper. <br /> <br /> The movie's best line at the beginning, by Robin's character, Jack: "I was that SOB!" He cleaned himself here so as not to offend anyone. <br /> <br /> I was glad when it came to the DVD a few years ago in the box / screen box format. <br /> <br /> I'm not a soccer player. fan or a true sports fan. But, you do not need to like this movie.
