Clint Eastwood returns as Dirty Harry Calahan in the 4th film of the series Dirty Harry. Clint is older, but he still has it, Harry was told to take a vacation after a problem that occurred due to a robbery (where the memorable phrase "Make My Day" comes from!) But the city where he took a vacation was worse, a woman became a vigilante after a rape attack at a fair and begins to receive the punks one by one. The last movie to see Sandra Locke in a Clint Eastwood movie. An improvement after The Enforcer that was a bit more of a comedy and less serious. Clint Eastwood sunglasses were gargoyles that are best known for the sunglasses that Arnold Shwartzeneger uses in The Terminator. It's worth seeing if you like Clint Eastwood, Dirty Harry movies or crime action movies.
