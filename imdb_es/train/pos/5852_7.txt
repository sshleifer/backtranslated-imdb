This was the first PPV in a new era for the WWE as Hulk Hogan, The Ultimate Warrior, Ric Flair and Sherri Martel were gone. A new crop of talent needed to be pushed. And all this began with Lex Luger, a former NWA heavyweight world champion who received a title shot against Yokozuna. Lex traveled throughout the US UU On a bus called Lex Express to inspire the Americans to join behind him in his attempt to defeat the Japanese monster (which was actually Samoan) and make the WWE Championship back in the hands of the Americans. As such, there was a lot of anticipation for this game. <br /> <br /> But all good PPV needs a billboard and this had some good things. <br /> <br /> The night started with Razor Ramon defeating Ted DiBiase in a good match The story of this was that DiBiase had chosen Ramon and even offered him a job as a slave after his loss by shock before the 1 -2-3 Kid in RAW in July. Ramon, angry, had partnered with the 1-2-3 Kid team against the Money Inc team of Ted DiBiase and Irwin R Shyster. To resolve their differences, they were given one by one the DiBiase vs. Ramon and Shyster vs. The Kid matches. Razor was able to solve his part of the deal after hitting Razor's Edge. <br /> <br /> Then came the Steiner Brothers who put the WWE Tag Team Titles on the line against The Heavenly Bodies. Except for the interference of "The Bodies" manager Jim Cornette, who hit Scott Steiner in the throat with a tennis racket, they could get the victory in a decent game. <br /> <br /> Shawn Michaels and Mr Perfect had been fighting since Wrestlemania IX when Shawn Michaels faced Perfect after his loss to Lex Luger. Perfect had cost Michaels the Intercontinental Championship when he distracted him in a title match against Marty Janetty. Michaels had regained the title and was putting him on the line against Mr. Perfecto, but now he had a powerful ally in his corner with his 7-foot Diesel bodyguard. Micheals and Perfect had an excellent game here, but it was Diesel who showed the difference, pulling Perfect out of the ring and throwing him into the steel steps for Shawn to win in the count. <br /> <br /> Irwin R Shyster avenged the loss of his teammate tag team earlier in the evening, which easily explains the 1-2-3 Kid. <br /> <br /> Then came one of the big games of the night when Bret Hart prepared to fight against Jerry. Lawler for the title of undisputed King of the WWE. But Lawler came out on crutches, saying he had been injured in a car accident that day and that he had organized another opponent for Hart: Doink the Clown. Hart and Doink had a passable match that Hart won with a sniper. Then he was jumped from behind by Lawler. This led to WWE President Jack Tunney in the ring, who told Lawler that he would receive a life ban if he did not fight Hart. Hart then destroyed Lawler, winning with the sniper, but Hart refused to leave the warehouse and the referee reversed his decision. So after all that, Lawler was named the undisputed king of the WWE. This combat was followed by Ludvig Borda destroying Marty Janetty in a short combat. <br /> <br /> The Undertaker ended its long rivalry with Harvey Wippleman, which began in 1992 when the Undertaker defeated Wippleman's client Kamala in Summerslam and continued when Wippleman's last monster, The Giant Gonzales, destroyed Taker in the Rumble and then again at Wrestlemania, with a decisive victory over Gonzales here. Gonzales then turned against Wippleman and called him after a bad game. <br /> <br /> Then came the moment of the action of six men like Smoking Gunns (Bart and Blylly) and Tatanka defeated The Headshrinkers (Samu and Fatu) and Bam Bam Bigelow with Tatanka fixing Samu. <br /> <br /> This brings us to the main event with Yokozuna, flanked by Jim Cornette and Mr. Fuji, putting the WWE title on the line against Lex Luger and everything was on board the Lex Express. Lex came out attacking, but Yokozuna took control. Lex returned, as he was able to avoid a banzai fall and then the body struck Yokozuna before taking him out of the ring. Luger then attacked Cornette and Fuji while Yokozuna was told. Luger had won a good game !!!!! The balloons fell from the ceiling. All the heroes came out to congratulate him on his victory. Yokozuna could have retained the title, but Luger had shown that he could be defeated. The only question was, who could beat him in the ring and take away that title?
