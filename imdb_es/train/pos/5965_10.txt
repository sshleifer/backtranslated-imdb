I gave this a 10 out of 10 points. I love him so much. I am a child of the 80s and I am totally into heavy metal for many years. Those are the reasons why I like this movie so much. It's great to see those posters in that child's bedroom (Judas Priest, Lizzy Borden, Raven, Twisted Sister ...) and his vinyl collection (revealing the evil ones by Exciter, Rise of the mutants by Shock Metal Master Impaler and Killing it's my business for Megadeth). In addition, the soundtrack of FASTWAY is totally incredible and fits very well with the plot. If you like metal, then TRICK OR TREATMENT is your friend. Do not buy or see this movie for OZZY or GENE SIMMONS because they are in the movie for a few seconds, see it because of the soundtrack and the story that will take you back to the glory of the 80s. You will not be the same person later.
