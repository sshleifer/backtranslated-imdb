['I caught the last half of this movie on cable one night and I was surprised at how morbid it was. Even when one of the two victims is more deteriorated, the camera continues. the persistent shots of his corpse being discovered and his figure in the concentration camp that is stored in a body bag are moving and depressing. Do not watch this movie if you are already depressed. Then again do not look at it if you feel really good.']
