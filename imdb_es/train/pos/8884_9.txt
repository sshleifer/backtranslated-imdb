I really enjoyed the 60's. Not being of that generation (I'm waiting for "The 80's") it was interesting to see a unique four-hour capsule for that era. <br /> <br /> A major problem in the film, however, was the imbalance. The film was in the portrait of the families. According to the promotions I saw for the film on NBC, the story was basically about two families struggling with problems in the United States in 1960. I may have missed something, but I think we learned more about the white family than about the African-American family. <br /> <br /> I really believe that the 60s used music to describe the scenes better than any dialogue that could have come from the mouths of the actors (all of whom are very talented). This is very visible at the end of the first part (approximately two hours later) of the miniseries. <br /> <br /> Very good movie!
