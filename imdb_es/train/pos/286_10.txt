I read many messages when I was in theaters and they were all bad ... I think you have to be a type of person to enjoy these movies. If you are not a person who enjoyed Waltons or Little House ... You will not understand or enjoy these movies ... <br /> <br /> Now, about the permanent joy of Loves ... I knew that HE was a bad news for me the beginning of the movie ... I wish it had shown more end instead of just thinking. This movie has a lot to do with Jeff ... it's 6 years later, so you know he'll be interested in Girls. <br /> <br /> I want to say that until now I have enjoyed the 4 movies. ... I was not crazy about books ... I can not wait until the next movie. The way Clark talks will catch you every time. I'd love to see January Jones make an appearance ... Maybe a family reunion or something.
