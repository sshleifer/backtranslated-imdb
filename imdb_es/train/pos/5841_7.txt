The story of farmers and people of the people who love peace fighting for land, water, law and order, and the respect and final subjugation of entrenched livestock interests and their contracted weapons had worked better in previous films ( Shane) and probably later as well. There are some good action scenes and the overall design of the story, excluding a disappointing ending, is well executed. Law, order and religion have their roots in the city, but the old order of cattle, cowherd and gunmen units still exists. The clash of the two occurs in a well-organized ambush scene where the inhabitants of the city ride directly into a trap. Granger, a former gunman, plays the guy who is rejected by the same villagers who need his skill with a gun.
