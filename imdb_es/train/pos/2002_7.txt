Up to a point, I liked this movie more than the original VAMPIRES. I found that the movie is pretty misogynistic. As a woman and a fan of horror, I am used to the fact that women in danger are a basic element of the genre. But they only slap Sheryl Lee too much. In this movie, Natasha Wagner is a more complete character, and the main bad guy is a girl. Arly Jover (who played a fellow vampire in BLADE) is very otherworldly and deadly. Jon Bon Jovi ... well, yes, he's not a great actor, but he does it well. At least he does not start singing. Catch it on the cable if you can. He's at Encore Action this month.
