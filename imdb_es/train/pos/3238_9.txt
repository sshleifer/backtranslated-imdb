The Finnish version of "Short Cortes" by Robert Altman, set in the small rural town of Äänekoski. The episodes present a kaleidoscope of the eternal events, problems and emotions of human life: joy and love, deception and disappointment, despair and death. I was particularly impressed with two episodes. The first is the story of the young waitress, who tries to awaken a romance for her coworkers: she radiates an overwhelming joy of love and life. The other episode is presented and the old man who died in a hospital and his wife trying to help him die with dignity. Especially striking is the way in which the elderly couple have to fight against the humiliating practices of the hospital and their loneliness contrasted with the "routines" of the hospital crew (despite the signs of occasional empathy). Compared to Altman's classic, this film is perhaps less professional, but it is definitely a great work of art.
