Slow but beautifully mounted story of the American Revolution. Griffith's storytelling seems much less harsh than in his earlier historical epics and his work in the paintings is fully integrated into the action. Lionel Barrymore is an absolute sow, Neil Hamilton is poor but precipitate and Carol Dempster is ... well, Carol Dempster is most of what is wrong with Griffith in this period, but it does not show up often enough to slow down the rhythm and drama. <br /> <br /> Note that the triviality of this movie says that it originally arrived in just over 2 hours when it was first released, but that there is no cut that lasts more than 90 minutes. However, the release of the DVD has been presented at a slower fps speed that increases the voltage and returns it for a little over two hours. <br /> <br /> Much better in terms of storytelling than in sound versions, like THE PATRIOT. While not quite in the league of Griffith's best, like WAY DOWN EAST and BROKEN BLOSSOMS, it's a great way to spend a couple of hours.
