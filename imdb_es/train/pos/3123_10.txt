This is the first 10 out of 10 that I have given any movie. What made this movie so good for me? Constant action: there are no slow parts, good acting, intelligent writing. I also liked the filming style where the instability and the different angles just made it feel like you were part of the scene. Finally, I can watch an action movie that does not try to please all sectors of the audience (that is, there is no forced romance). <br /> <br /> I liked the first two Bourne movies, but I loved this one. . <br /> <br /> Warning: after seeing this movie, you will be full of adrenaline and want to relax a bit before driving!
