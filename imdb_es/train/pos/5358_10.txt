This is one of the great movies of the 80s in MY collection in which I think all the time. <br /> <br /> The Running Man is one of the best and most different Arnold films to date and when I saw The Running Man for the first time, I was so excited to see a movie like this one. I love all the fights and this is really a special movie. He also has Jesse Ventura, the legendary professor Toru Tanaka, Sven-Ole Thorsen, the beautiful Maria Conchita Alonso, Yaphet Kotto, Kurt Fuller, Richard Dawson and Thomas Rosales Jr., who seems to always like death in his films because he has been killed in films like Universal Solder, The Lost World, Robo Cop 2, Predator 2, and others. All Arnold fans should love this movie from start to finish because it's action-packed, full of stars and one of Arnold's best to date!
