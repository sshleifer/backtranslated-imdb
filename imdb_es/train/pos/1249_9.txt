I thought this was a splendid showcase for Mandy's body body. If you do not expect anything else, such as intelligent plot twists and credible character development, you will not be disappointed. Consider this a Sports Illustrated session whose character is killing people, especially those who threaten to stand between her and her 'Mommy' (Suzanna Arquette, who obviously does not want to play the sex kitten, she leaves it to her daughter). <br /> <br /> Mandy's face is a bit too perfect, but her body is a full fire of 5 alarms, up there in the ranks of Sophia Loren when it comes to natural avidity, a perfect 7 a 10 waist-to-hip ratio, and splendidly configured legs, up to the feet. (There has to be an ideal configuration of thighs to knees and calves to ankles that is totally pleasing to the eye - Mandy is certainly the model for this idealized ratio). <br /> <br /> And there is not a flat butt to boot, which seems to be the bane of many busty pups with curves everywhere except in the "lower hemispheres". Mandy could have used a double body in the back shot of losing her towel as she descended to the candle-lit whirlpool with her blindfolded German No. 2 victim, but for all she could see in her bikini shots, I had not needed a double to prove it. <br /> <br /> Mandy's acting skills had little to do with her impression of a psychotic 'Mommy's Girl', with the obvious erotic nuances of lesbians. His bisexual nature (leaving him boinkear in the hot tub after a long flirtation with the German No. 2, who was also his mother's lover) added an additional dimension to an otherwise one-dimensional caricature of the female adolescent cornea in conflict with pathological murderous impulses (always by water with men: the final destination of the Latin housekeeper was published in the televised version for a dark reason). <br /> <br /> The Uber-Nordic facial features of Mandy along with her Uber- The voluptuous body can be a blessing or a curse. If Mandy really wants to continue her career as an actress, I would advise her to immerse herself completely in the Romance languages, especially in Italian and Spanish, and perhaps in French, although I do not know if they would go for her type. But this would allow him to reconcile Bo Derek's face with his Vida Guerra body, but perhaps his face is too Nordic, and he has shown too much of his extraordinary body in a corny movie to allow him to advance to any more fame that was enjoyed by Michelle Johnson of the 1980s, whose first fame in Blame it on Rio was followed by a series of skin films that failed to take off. <br /> <br /> Vambo Drule.
