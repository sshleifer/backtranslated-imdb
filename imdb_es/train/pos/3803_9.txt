What people do not understand about this movie is that it's not a beginning, an intermediate part and an ending, it's just the conclusion of a 26-episode television series. Then remember that when everyone talks about how the world was not sufficiently explored. All this was done in the television program. <br /> <br /> In spite of how great and impressive the images are, I think the argument of *** SPOILERS *** between Lian-Chu and Gwizdo near the end of the movie was What really made me love this movie. Seeing the characters he had followed throughout 26 episodes of fighting was so agonizing, and seeing Gwizdo walking sadly alone in the middle of the floating ruins while Lian-Chu sharpened his sword almost in jerks. <br /> <br /> Then we had a total contrast with Lian-Chu fighting against these incredibly incredible dragons (that had appeared earlier in the series) while Gwizdo babbled madly and indirectly threatened to kill Zoe. * Tremor * I am surprised that this particular scene has not been mentioned more in the warnings. Any child who has a little sense can see that Gwizdo was not himself and was completely determined to strangle that child. It was enough to bother me, and I am 15 years old. <br /> <br /> The world is amazing, the plot is much better than most billionaire blockbusters, and it was a good way to see some of my favorite characters go. Check it out. :)
