I remember when this movie went to the Academy Awards and it did not win in any category. For my life, I can not remember what he was facing, but I can say one thing: it was one of the best movies I've seen in my life. And the fact that Steven Spielberg directed the film did not convince me a bit. <br /> <br /> Essentially, it's about the trials and tribulations of a black woman as she grows from a girl to a woman. There are many insinuations that are disturbing and horrifying, but all are necessary to see how much this woman has endured. On the way, we see other women who have had to endure their difficulties and walk with them until redemption. Whoopi Goldberg gives his best performance in this movie. Danny Glover should also have been at least nominated for his role in this movie. <br /> <br /> And the best part of this movie is that it treats its subjects in a human way, not like some of the extravagant shows like the most recent "Beloved" did. I encourage anyone of any race to watch this movie. 9/10
