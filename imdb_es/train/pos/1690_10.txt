I found the memorable quotes looking for video clips; they forgot one of my favorites ... <br /> <br /> Old person 1: Do you remember the first time they played that thing? <br /> <br /> Elderly person 2: Remember the pterodactyls. <br /> <br /> Elderly person 1: And I can remember that you fell in love with that, hook and sinker. <br /> <br /> Elderly person 2: Oh, I did not. <br /> <br /> Old Woman: You did it. You put a big bucket in your head and you went with them, army boys, to fight the Martians. <br /> <br /> Elderly person 2: Still not dead?
