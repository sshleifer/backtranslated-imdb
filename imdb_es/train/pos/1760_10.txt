THE 40 YEARS VIRGIN (2005) **** Steve Carell, Catherine Keener, Paul Rudd, Romany Malco, Seth Rogen, Elizabeth Banks, Leslie Mann, Jane Lynch, Gerry Bednob, Shelley Malil, Kat Dennings. A hysterically funny and high-concept comedy about the titleholder Andy Stitzer (played wonderfully by the perennial second banana Carell in a truly extraordinary comic performance that will surely take him to the A list), a technical services representative for an electronics store in the southern California. He discovered his secret identity by a trio of well-intentioned but totally clueless coworkers (Rudd, Malco and Rogen, each more fun than the other) determined to deflower his friend no matter the cost. What follows is an improbable but very warm romance with a vivacious mother (the wonderful Keener has a lot of fun here) which leads to adding more fuel to the fires within Andy. A surprisingly good-humored and unapologetically romantic comedy; the most entertaining since "There Something About Mary" with an astutely observant script by director Judd Apatow and Carell that features some amazingly impressive sequences that include a David Caruso joke that is very successful, homophobic comments of discredit, data-a-paloozas and demystifying the war of the sexes with blatant aplomb. A true winner and an instant classic; The funniest movie of the year.
