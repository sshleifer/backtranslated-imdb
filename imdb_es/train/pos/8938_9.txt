A wonderful film version of the best-selling book and the Broadway play about the lives of Sadie and Bessie Delany, two African-American sisters who lived for more than 100 years and told their story of having witnessed a century of American history. Ruby Dee and Diahann Carroll give very good performances as Bessie and Sadie, respectively. Amy Madigan is also good as Amy Hill Hearth, the New York Times white journalist whose article about the sisters launched the book, etc. Many of the flashback scenes and even many of the current ones are very powerful, if not so inspiring. as in the book That is the only real drawback, combined with the fact that certain aspects of the story are not presented clearly, such as the interracial background of the mother of the sisters and why her father was so severe. But apart from that, a very well made film, excellently interpreted and powerful.
