It was a great pleasure when this program was underway because it was such a new, innovative and original program. This makes all the shows I've seen look boring. At the time that the first episode was broadcast, I was fascinated and I got hooked on all the characters very easily (which usually never happens because I always hate some characters). It is a pity that this program does not have a third season, since it has to be one of the best programs I've seen and that does not exaggerate my feelings towards the program at all. Nothing can replace Pushing Daisies, because what could ABC find to replace this show? This is easily the best television show. <br /> <br /> I came for Kristin Chenoweth and I stayed because I fell in love with the whole show.
