It may not be the absolute best entry in the Hammer House of Horror series, but it certainly wins the prize for the most artfully titled episode! "The house that bled to death"? I could scream this title all day without getting tired of it! And in addition to the wonderful title, this short film also benefits from a script written with solidity and a handful of genuinely suspenseful moments. It may require additional visualization before you fully understand the peculiar final touch, but it is definitely an original idea for a short horror. The story begins with images of an elderly couple drinking tea in their middle class house. The husband sadistically kills his wife and, several years later, the "damn" house is still for sale. A young couple and their cherub daughter move and begin to restore it, but mysterious events occur that especially affect young Sophie. His beloved cat dies and even his birthday party is ruined when one of the pipes in the house suddenly sprays the guests (this is a particularly spooky sequence!). Is the old house really haunted? Or maybe seemingly useful neighbors cause all the horror? The answers to these questions are provided in the original and unpredictable climax, and there is even room for a real shock at the end. Tension builds up masterfully and the titular house is full of spooky landscapes, like the pair of rusty machetes used by the husband to murder his wife. However, a little warning, the sequence with the cat is hard to see when you are an animal lover. In conclusion, another winner of the short Hammer television series!
