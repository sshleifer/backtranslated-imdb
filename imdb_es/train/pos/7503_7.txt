The movie was good, quite entertaining. The cast was quite good, and I seconded what the previous commentary mentioned: Glenn Quinn was outstanding and only he is enough reason to see this movie. In this film he played the selfish "evil" friend and the manager of the band. <br /> <br /> There are many songs performed by "Beyond Gravity" in this movie, but this is not a surprise, since The Movie is a VH1 production. However, if the soft rock / pop music is not to the liking of someone, we could also advance those scenes. <br /> <br /> The plot of a band that tries to reach the top in Los Angeles but has to overcome many obstacles on the way are not very original, but they are entertaining, with some surprising plot that are given here and there.
