As the series is released, "Zorro's Fighting Legion" is one of the best action series of the thirties. Made in a period in which the studios could still present a large cast, it has wall-to-wall action in its 12 chapters. <br /> <br /> In 1824 the president of the newly formed Republic of Mexico, Benito Ju√°rez (Carleton Young) is trying to put his new country on a solid financial footing. To that end, it has arranged for rich shipments of gold to be sent to the capital from the local San Mendolita mine. <br /> <br /> Members of the plot of the local council to steal the shipments in the name of Don-del-Oro to God golden armored, that with the help of the local Yaqui tribe, hopes to settle as the ruler of Mexico . Opposing him is Don Francisco (Guy D'Ennery) who forms a legion of locals to help Juarez. When Don Franciso is killed by men from Don-del-Oro, a stranger, the Fopish Don Diego (Reed Hadley) arrives in the city. Diego, also known as Zorro, takes charge of the legion with the help of his friends Ramon (William Corson) and Juan (Budd Buster). The symbolic heroine of the piece is Ramon's sister, Volita (Sheila D'Arcy). <br /> <br /> Both Diego and Ramon occupy seats in the local council Counsil. It soon becomes evident that some of the other members of the Council are allied with Don-del-Oro. First there is the President of the Council (Leander de Cordova), the chief of the militia Manuel (John Merton), the President of the Tribunal Pablo (C. Montague Shaw) and Gonzolez (Edmund Cobb). Zorro suspects that one of these men is Don-del-Oro, but which one? <br /> <br /> What follows are several escapades of Zorro and his companions of the followers of Don-del-Oro. We have the ever present bridge of rope that collapses, the deep abyss between two cliffs on which only Zorro can jump to safety, and the usual assortment of explosions, fires and coaches and cars that crash or go down the cliff. Congratulations to Republic's excellent doubles team led by the legendary Yakima Canutt and the Yrigoyens, Bill and Joe. Canutt performs his characteristic trick by jumping on a team of fugitive horses and then falling under the coach, which he repeated in other films, including John Ford's "The Diligence" the same year. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Zorro finally unmasks the fake god Don-del-Oro and restores peace in the valley before riding into the sunset in Chapter 12. <br /> <br /> Other in the cast include Jim Pierce, Curley Dresden and Charlie King as the men of Don-del-Oro. and if you look closely, you may discover the bits of the future serial star and the Lone Ranger Clayton Moore and the double Canutt risk in bits. By the way, "Big" Jim Pierce can best be remembered for playing Tarzan in "Tarzan and the Golden Liom" in 1927 and for his marriage to Joan Burroughs, the daughter of Tarzan's creator, Edgar Rice Burroughs. <br /> <br /> Completely pleasant.
