Here is a decent horror movie in the mid-70s on a door of hell in New York that turns out to be an old stone house. There seems to be a lot of gates from Hell around, but of course, this unconscious model happens to decide that she needs some space from her boyfriend / girlfriend and, therefore, she simply chooses one, which is disguised as a nice apartment and Reasonably priced Meet several strange neighbors, and even attend a birthday party for a cat. When meeting with the real estate agent because he hears strange noises at night from the top floor, he discovers that it is SUPPOSED that she and an old priest are the only tenants. Whoa! So, who are all these weirdos? Her boyfriend (a slimy lawyer, played by Chris Sarandon) begins to rummage and discovers that things are not what they seem, far from it. This has some pretty spooky scenes and the idea of ​​the old crisps that are their neighbors "sometimes" different from what they seem is quite intriguing. A bit of decent blood and even a parade of less than normal people towards the end make this a decent watch, and although I've seen this many times on TV, the uncut DVD version is much better, of course. It's not a bad horror movie, maybe a good piece of company for "Burnt Offerings." 8 out of 10.
