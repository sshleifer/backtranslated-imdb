The second part (actually episode 4-8) of the hit Danish television series is slightly inferior to the first, but it also has a lot of laughter and fear. This time, Udo Kier plays two parts, like the baby monster and his father like a demon. Other highlights on this occasion are Doctor Krogshoj from Søren Pilmark, who must face the horrible revenge of Dr. Helmer, and once again, the patient Mrs. Drusse tries to solve the mysteries, in the style of Miss Marple. It ends in a cliffhanger and after the death of the main actors Ernst Hugo Järegård (Dr. Helmer) and Kirsten Rolffes (Mrs. Drusse), he wonders how they can ever do Part III, but I hope Von Trier will do it. It is a shot. Unfortunately, Morten Rotne Leffers, the # 2 dishwasher of Down syndrome, also died soon after. Look for Stellan Skarsgård in a cameo. ***
