Clean family-oriented film. I laughed, I cried ... I loved it. I was worried that I would not be able to see Steve Carrell as anything other than an idiot from Michael from The Office. Boy, I was wrong. He should win an Oscar for his performance. I will definitely buy this on DVD when it comes out. My husband enjoyed it and he does not like the movies of this "guy". I saw him with 2 other couples in the range of 30 years and we all agreed that it was the best movie we had seen in a long time and, undoubtedly, the cleanest. Only 1 word cuss! I'm not even sure why it was PG13. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes comedy, drama, romance and more!
