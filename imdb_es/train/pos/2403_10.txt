I must warn you, there are some spoilers in it. But to begin with, I have "Spanish Judges" in February, I think. It was mentioned that it was the last copy, but as I see, it was not on hold. But anyway, I have it. I thought it was good. I wanted to see this mainly by the great actor, Matthew Lillard (I'm surprised that no one in the reviews mentioned the scar), although it is a bit of a low budget, it would be worth spending enough money to make this film. Man, what a good actor. <br /> <br /> The story is about a scammer known as Jack (Matthew Lillard) who "claims" to have merchandise called Spanish judges. If you do not know what the Spanish judges are or have not seen the trailer of this and this is the first review you have read, I will not even say what they are. I imagine it would be a big turn for no one knew what it was. He needs protection, so he hires a couple who are also swindlers, Max and Jamie (Vincent D'Onofrio and Valeria Golino), as well as an offender named Piece (Mark Boone Junior). He has a girlfriend who will not even tell anyone his name because he is from Mars, as he said. So they (mainly Jack) call her "Girl from Mars". Everything starts well, but then it becomes a great game. A game that involves some lust, lies and betrayal. <br /> <br /> There were some excessive acts (Matt and Valeria, as well as Tamara, were not one of them). There were some scenes that could have done better and the score could also have been a little better. Some of the results were really good. The theme they used for the beginning and the end (before the credits) was a good song choice, that's my opinion. The scene of the fight at the end could have been a little longer and a little more violent, but what can you do? One more comment about Matt: Damn it, play a smooth and elegant swindler. <br /> <br /> I know this is a criticism, but I need to make a correction to NeCRo, one of the criticisms: Valeria Golino is not a newcomer According to this site, she has been acting since 1983. For me , and hopefully for others, is well known as Charlie Sheen's Italian love interest in both "Hot Shots". films. But good criticism. <br /> <br /> Although I think it's one of the rare movies I've seen and it's really good (that's why I gave it 10 stars above), I will give the rating of what I thought when I saw it for the first time. <br /> <br /> 8/10
