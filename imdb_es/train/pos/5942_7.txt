I really liked BATMAN: DEAD END, I thought I had a theatrical feel and that, given the possibility, Collora could make a good movie. This trailer did not give me the same impression. The story line, or the potential story line, was pretty good, but because of the acting and the special effects it made me feel that this would have been a good movie for television or a television show. <br /> <br /> First, Michael O'Hearn is not so good a superman In fact, I thought that he, in his brief appearance, was a decent Clark Kent. I'm sorry, I just do not think SuperMan is so fond. The suit that Kent had masked its size. Batman can have the body of a bodybuilder but not Superman. Supes is toned without a doubt but not in bulk. Anyway, I did not care about all his postures and his transformation from Kent to Superman seemed cheerful. Now, this may not be just O'Hearn's fault, it is possible that Collora has to take part of the credit for poor writing and direction. <br /> <br /> Second, the special effects for flying were spectacular. Superman flies through the sky. If it was obvious that this Superman was flying close to the ground, with telephone wires and buildings visible above it. I do not think there was any full body shot of Superman flying. Obviously, O'Hearn's harness and rigging must be located in the lower part of the torso. <br /> <br /> In general, it was a good trailer. I would probably pay to see a movie, if it ever was made, and I would make sure to watch it on television. The story line, an alliance between Lexcorp and Wayne Industries, Superman jealous of Lois' attraction for Wayne, Lex and Twoface to defeat Superman and the joining of forces between Batman and Superman is a good idea. I'm sure that with a bigger budget and approval for a full movie of Collora and company, even O'Hearn could offer a decent movie. Certainly, one better than most of the nonsense based on comics that come out of Hollywood lately.
