I just watched "Behind Bedroom Doors," and this was the first softcore movie with a solid story behind it that I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> We started with two neighbors: Vivian and James. Fenway (Julia Kruis and Eric Carrington), and Lillian and Gabe Harris (Nicole Sheridan and Chris Gustafson). Vivian seems to be a housewife, James is a lawyer who runs for the district attorney, Lillian works in real estate and Gabe is a successful plastic surgeon. Do you have all that? Now, let's get into that. <br /> <br /> Enter Abby, played beautifully by porn star Chelsea Blue. She's renting the house across the street from Fenways and lives alone. At the beginning of the film, James looks out the window and sees Abby playing with his girlfriend, Gigi (played by the prolific Monique Alexander pornostra), and secretly begins to wonder what it would be like to be with her. The next day, Abby becomes familiar with the four and seems to be a good woman who, by chance, is living an alternative lifestyle. She makes a pass to Vivian, who seems surprised and says: "Oh ... I ... it's not like that". Everything seems fine ... until the plan starts. <br /> <br /> First, Abby shows up at Gabe's office, naked, and asks Gabe if she should get a tits job. This is where we get our quote from the movie: <br /> <br /> "Tell me about Gabe". "What do you want to know?" "Is Gabe happily married?" "I'm married." "There are problems ... let me guess, your wife stays at home and does everything you ask, but she is a good girl". "Yes." "She's not a bad girl?" "Do not." "Does that door have a lock on it?" <br /> <br /> You know what happens next ... Abby gets with Gabe, right there in the exam room. After that, she puts a small show in her window for James, who approaches and does not waste time having sex with her. What James does not know is that the teddy bear on the piano with the flashing red eye is actually a camera that records all the festivities (it's very obvious anyway). Abby returns to have sex with Gabe later, and this time Gigi joins to make it a trio. Now that Abby has something in both men, she requests $ 100,000 of each to buy her silence. Not only could it ruin James's candidacy, it could destroy Gabe's practice. <br /> <br /> While Gabe and James struggle with their guilt, Abby finds time to seduce Lillian, who "experimented" with women in college. . That was a long time ago, but you would not know that seeing her in action with Abby, she looked like an old professional. <br /> <br /> While Gigi follows the plan, she seems to be jealous of everything. The sex that your girlfriend has. "It's just a business," says Abby. Surely they will follow confessions and apologies, as well as some surprising information about Abby's true identity. It seems he has been doing the same thing with different men in many different places. Gabe and James use this information to counterattack Abby's blackmail. <br /> <br /> Now, to sex. The sex scenes were pretty good, and considering that all the women involved in this film, except Julia Kruis, have a long history of pornography, I would not have expected less. Nicole Sheridan's four scenes were the best in the film, and the trio came in second. Monique Alexander only undressed once, but was a relatively minor character. Julia Kruis was an important character and she undressed the same number of times. I guess since I was surrounded by experienced hardcore professionals, I did not have to have so many sex scenes. <br /> <br /> To finish, "Behind Bedroom Doors" had a great story, which improved the overall rating of the film. I consider it worthy of admiration. <br /> <br /> Women: A- (Nicole Sheridan was good at this movie, better than her latest performances in Fred Olen Ray's comedies, at least she can do some drama.) Chelsea Blue was a scene thief - She was not as bad as the antagonist, I would give her an A for herself, Julia Kruis was her usual personality, I wish Monique Alexander had more face in this movie, though. <br /> <br /> Sex: B (Solid and solid sex scenes.) Nicole Sheridan's performances were almost of an unconditional quality, Chelsea Blue also looked good in her scenes, the two girls and girls' offers were not scorching, but the screen warmed.) < b /> <br /> Story: B + (I liked the dialogue and the main story.The performance of Chelsea Blue was good for the genre, and I was impressed by Nicole Sheridan's turn in the drama). <br /> < In general: B (This was a good smooth film, I'm glad I could see this one, I was pleasantly surprised. If Chelsea Blue wanted to do more of these things, I would be welcome at any time. That also applies to Nicole Sheridan, although she is probably better at comedy. I do not care about hardcore girls who can act doing softcore movies.)
