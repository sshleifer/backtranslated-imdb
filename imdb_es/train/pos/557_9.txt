While driving from Skagway, Alaska to Dawson City, Yukon a couple of years ago and I was impressed by the scenery, I can not help but wish that this film, although it has beautiful color and panoramic views, was filmed at the actual location. Jasper in the Canadian Rockies is a great place, but it's not yet the real place where the movie takes place. When the story moves to Dawson, it is when I feel that Anthony Mann, who used the outdoors so well, could have done the most if he had filmed in the real place. James Stewart here is again a man struggling within himself, one side of him does not want to get involved and help the people who stand in his way to earn money, and the other side simply can not look away from the murdered people . Ruth Roman is the ambitious woman who does not care who you step on, Corinne Calvet is the nice girl. Mann is excellent at directing the shootings, but the highlight of the movie is how well he does it in outdoor scenes. Use the outdoors as much as possible and get help from the winter landscape, the predominant target, as it was with the greens in "The Naked Spur" and the browns in "The Man From Laramie". Like all Mann-Stewarts, this is a traditional western, with a difference in the elaboration of Stewart's character, which is more complex.
