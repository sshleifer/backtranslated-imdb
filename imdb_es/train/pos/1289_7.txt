First of all, the film is an ingenious work of art (film). The plot was full of surprises, a small child who pretends to be an adult inherits a million dollars and how he spends it. I mean how crazy this is. Walt Disney really outdone himself this time. Comedy is most of the time expected but the other times unexpected. I mean, this movie was good or this movie was good. He also teaches a lot about young wise men and I, this guy, is really smart and a little smart. But it also stinks. How the hell could a boy like that boy get a hot police babe and his father released him. That's like letting a killer be freed for ten years. If I had to do that, they would hit me with a 'suble jack' (a huge stick that itches when it is used to place your asses very hard). That child is really lucky. Back to the story. The movie makers really knew what they were doing when they made this movie, but still it's not perfect. The acting was good and bad. The boy and the woman did not have chemistry, nor the father, but the brothers were excellent. ' The special effects on the other hand were lame. Also, this movie is not based on reality. I hated and loved at the same time.
