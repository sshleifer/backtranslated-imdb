When I first heard about this movie, I thought it would be like The Duchess (2008), but when I saw the first 30 minutes of The Young Victoria, I knew that this would not be a solid movie. Almost everything in this film is great, the costumes are really amazing and the configuration is also very well shot. <br /> <br /> The only thing that really disappointed me was the performances. Emily Blunt (The Devil Wears Prada) is the protagonist of the film, gives life to Victoria and with this film, she shows that she is a great actress and maybe she is choosing a first Oscar nomination for her performance. Rupert Friend is almost insipid like Prince Albert, but he has a great chemistry with Emily Blunt. Paul Bettany is also solid as Lord Melbourne, although he expected more from him. Jim Broadbent and Miranda Richardson have supporting roles, but they are forgettable. <br /> <br /> For me, the movie seems unfinished. Maybe the writers have changed too many things in the script, I do not know, but that's what I feel about the movie. <br /> <br /> But overall it's a great movie about the early years of Victoria with a great performance by Emily Blunt.
