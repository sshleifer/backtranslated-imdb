This is my second time for A Perfect Spy. I saw it 2 or 3 years ago and I liked it. I still like it. It is natural to compare with the other great series of Le Carre de la beeb, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. Tinker Tailor focuses on the "game" of spies; Perfect Spy gives us the other axis: what kind of person is a spy. There are a number of themes that these films share, along with others in the genre. <br /> <br /> Ambiguity (moral, sexual, interpersonal) that creates a multidimensional space of true versus false, inside or outside. love against responsibility In a way, these characters are happier when they are treated in a very miserable way by those they love and respect, "stabbed" in their various nuances. <br /> <br /> The subject of parents and father figures is also important. One of the most intriguing characters of A Perfect Spy is Rick, the main character of Magnus, perhaps the father of Ersatz. Throughout history he betrays and is betrayed. A rogue who always manages to climb the ladder again when they have knocked him down, who seems insensible to what others think of him, asks Magnus every time they meet: "Do you love your father?" and never, "you love me?" Maybe I'll say it somewhere else, but A Perfect Spy is a love story. <br /> <br /> Another issue is that of malignancy. The nature of the business is to make others turn against their government, against their friends and associates, against their values ​​and beliefs. In each of the Le Carre movies I've seen, The Spy Who Came From the Cold, The Mirror War, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, The Smiley People, and A Perfect Spy, Turning and Becoming is the basis of the tragedy . <br /> <br /> Finally, it's not so much a theme as an artistic touch: in each of these films there is usually a single shot, or maybe two shots for the story. Violence, torture, cruelty are always under the surface. We see their results not as blood flows or damp cells of the prison, but in the objects to which the characters of Le Carre cling, since they are sucked in an inescapable way towards the mud. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen The films above, and you enjoy A Perfect Spy, they are waiting for you. I would also recommend the series The Sandbagger (Yorkshire TV), whose second and third season begin to reach the level of this type of complexity. The IPCRESS file and the funeral in Berlin are nice, although light. For political intrigue, try A very British coup, House of cards and Yes, Minister / Yes, Prime Minister. <br /> <br /> If only a Briton helped you make The Three Kingdoms, there would be a film with intrigue and complexity.
