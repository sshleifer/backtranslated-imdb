While watching this movie I began to feel very nostalgic. As a child and growing up in a rural area, I felt like I was a child again! The swimming pond (called "tank" in central Texas), runs through the countryside as a wild and free spirit! The story was very credible and I totally lost it and I cried towards the end. Through the pain we go through in life ... life goes on and there can be forgiveness.
