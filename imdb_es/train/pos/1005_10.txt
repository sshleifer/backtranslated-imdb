Verhoeven's movie was absolute and complete garbage. It's a disgusting trick of a director and he should be ashamed. By his own admission, he read 2 chapters of the book, got bored and decided to do the whole process from scratch. <br /> <br /> Heinlein would NEVER have supported that garbage if he had been alive to see that. Basically steals the name, mocks the book's policy (which is a good part of it), and throws some T & A so that the average American viewer does not get bored. <br /> <br /> This anime is not perfect, but at least it is for the most part accurate, the best I can say.
