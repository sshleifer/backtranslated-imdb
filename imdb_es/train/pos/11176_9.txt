Ok, first I have to point out the fact that when I first saw this movie I was 9 years old. If I had seen this two weeks ago for the first time, I probably would have noticed that this is just another cable TV horror movie with some well done scenes. But when you are nine years old, you simply do not care about those facts. This scared me very much back then, especially the Zelda scenes mentioned above (and still do). Today I am hooked on this movie. I have to see this maybe once a month, and on every new year's eve I see it with a pack of 12 beers and a bunch of friends. It's like an appetizer for a good party! I agree a little with those people who said that acting here is quite unintentional. Midkiff and Crosby look the way they wanted Louis and Rachel to look, but you can not see much devotion or feelings on the faces of these two. Hughes and Gwynne practically save the scenes that "the Creeds" interpret. What I really want to say about this is the fact that there really is not any other movie that has any kind of similarity with Pet Sematary, and I do not mean the zombie stuff here. THE ATMOSPHERE OF THIS MOVIE IS ANY NEW AND ONE OF A KIND. Honestly, how many times have you seen a movie that superficially looks like a cable TV, but it leaves you with a chill compared to the best horror coolers that exist? Well, I broke some of the cast balls a minute ago, but I must say that all the pieces on that level also perfect the overall performance to perfection. But hey, tell me if you really know any movie that is similar to Pet Sematary! I would really love to know ... And I do not mean the night of the undead here ... this is an incomparable comparison compared to those things.
