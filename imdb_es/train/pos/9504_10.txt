As many people know, Mexican cinema was very poor after the so-called Golden Age of Mexican cinema, fortunately, during the late 90s and early 21st century, great films like The Law of Herod, Bajo California, Amores Perros, and You also appeared Mama Also and, of course, The Colonel Does not Have Who Writes You. The Colonel ... is a wonderful film, which retells the classic story of Gabriel García Márquez, eliminating the elements of magical realism and replacing them with the harsh reality lived in Mexico, not only by people like the Colonel, who await His pensions, but for more than half of the Mexican population, they live in complete poverty. The characters in the film, satirically, represent classic characters found in Mexican society, like the Nationalist Colonel, the cold and even ambitious priest, the hypocrite, but at the same time the loyal compadre, the tolerant and patient wife, the hidden homosexual, etc. The film is a must if you want to know more about Mexican society and, especially, if you want to see a magnificent movie, one of the best directors in Mexico.
