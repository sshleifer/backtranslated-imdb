['The most important reason why I had to see this movie was that it is starring Susan Swift, an exceptional and very unappreciated actress. Time travel movies generally do not interest me and movies about witchcraft do not matter, but this movie was fascinating and scary. It was not based on extravagant special effects and was not so focused on time travel that the viewer is lost and confused. This was a really creative film kept simple and focused with a great performance of all.']
