It is very easy to qualify that movie: "A PURE MASTERPIRA PURA". This opinion is formulated for the following reasons: the performance of the actors, seem to be citizens of that time, 1100 a. C. They perfectly personalize the characters. A second reason is that the poetry expressed by Homere in his poem is well given by the production. Among others, the narrations made by the choir give a particular atmosphere that makes us part of the artistic interpretation. Third reason: the reconstitution of the decoration is absolutely perfect, in the Mediterranean regions, where the action of the poem took place. And, above all, the excitement is in the appointment. I repeat my thanks: "A PIECE MASTER PURE".
