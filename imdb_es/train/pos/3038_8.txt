['As Douglas MacArthur affected more human lives, for better, than any other unelected American president, he deserved a better cinematographic biography. It&#39;s not that Universal&#39;s &quot;MacArthur&quot; is bad. It just is not all that it should have been. <br /><br /> Interestingly, the potential was there. From the very early episode &quot;Star Trek,&quot; &quot;The Corbomite Maneuver&quot; (1966), to the recent HBO films &quot;Something the Lord Made&quot; (2OO4) and &quot;Warm Springs&quot; (2OO5), director Joseph Sargent has Become one of the most prominent. film directors expressively human, a man able to subtly model the emotional nuances of the performances of his actors and take the audience exactly where he wants them to go. The producer, Frank McCarthy, also gave us &quot;Patton&quot; (197O), the legendary Jerry Goldsmith obtained both films, and Universal widely emphasized the fact that the film had &quot;four years of preparation and production&quot;. However, for all this, &quot;MacArthur&quot; is perfectly adequate, and not much more than that. <br /><br /> The film begins in early 1942, shortly before the besieged general, ordered by President Franklin D. Roosevelt (Dan O&#39;Herlihy), fled the Philippines to avoid being captured by the Japanese. So, this movie omits: <br /><br /> · The birth of MacArthur in 188O in a border barracks in Arkansas, still subject to attacks by Native American tribes, which states that his extraordinary life spanned the distance from bows and arrows to thermonuclear weapons; <br /><br /> · Your West Point graduation, first in a class of 95, <br /><br /> · How he joined his famous father, General Arthur MacArthur (who had won the Medal of Honor in Missionary Ridge in the Civil War) on missions in Japan, China and, most importantly, in the Philippines; <br /><br /> · His heroic exploits in the 1914 excursion to Vera Cruz; <br /><br /> · How he jumped over the trenches of World War I like a mountain goat, often wounded and promoted with blinding speed to the Brigadier General; <br /><br /> · His postwar service as the youngest and most progressive commander of West Point; <br /><br /> · His participation in the council of war of Billy Mitchell in 1924; <br /><br /> · His tour of the Bonus Marchers in 1932; <br /><br /> · Their efforts to sustain an Army that lacks sufficient funds as Chief of Staff in the early 193os; <br /><br /> · His retirement from the US Army UU To become Field Marshal (!) Of the Philippine Army; <br /><br /> · And the reactivation of its commission by FDR shortly before the outbreak of World War II. <br /><br /> All this is omitted in favor of MacArthur&#39;s prolonged images that try to combat seasickness while being evacuated by the PT boat. Therefore, we know that &quot;General Mac&quot; is a legend, but not why; Nor can we appreciate why the accusations of cowardice were so hurtful to &quot;Doug Dugout&quot;, and therefore are so unfounded. <br /><br /> The rest of his career is now direct: his campaign &quot;Hit them where they are not&quot;, the fulfillment of his promise to the Filipinos: &quot;I will return!&quot;, His crowning achievement, the victory of peace. in post-war Japan, then the difference of opinion with President Harry Truman (an appropriately fighter Ed Flanders) over the conduct of the Korean conflict that resulted in his absolute dismissal, and finally, his proclamation to Congress that &quot;the old soldiers. .. they just fade away, &quot;After which he did that. All quite historically accurate, and all presented with a very deliberate lack of comments. <br /><br /> Sargent and the producers almost painfully distance themselves from decorating the historical record with their own approval or disapproval: if MacArthur&#39;s actions seem noble, they present themselves as such; If they appear selfish or grandiloquent, let those conceptions register without comment. Since Joe Sargent is quite adept at subtly manipulating the reactions of his audience, again, seeing in Warm Springs, this refusal to offer comments seems quite intentional. Historically, that may be advisable, but it almost nullifies the viewer&#39;s efforts to place this extraordinary man in any kind of rational perspective. <br /><br /> And, finally, there is a kind of &quot;cheap&quot; feeling in the movie, like &quot;Midway,&quot; released almost at the same time. Both films were relegated to the directors of &quot;television&quot;: Sargent in this case, Jack Smight in &quot;Midway&quot;, and both have an aspect made for television. Even the departure of Jerry Goldsmith, while perfectly useful, lacks the subtle nuances and grandeur of his theme &quot;Patton&quot;, just another way in which a larger man in life is commemorated with a very common movie. <br /><br /> There was vanity and pettiness in this man, indisputably; there was also greatness and, loving it or hating it, one must recognize the fact that MacArthur did what no military commander before him had done: he won peace. <br /><br /> In the end, &quot;MacArthur&quot;, like so many cinematographic biographies, is a good place to start the investigation of this remarkable man, but a poor place to end it.']
