This started as a movie about Bronx street culture in New York. What he achieved was to give birth to a new culture and way of life for the American youth. What other movie has done this, except Rebel without cause? One of the most important films of all time. The elements are simple but fascinating. The story is timeless, young people try to triumph against all odds. However, the story is always believable and never depressing. The characters are so realistic, an inhabitant of the city, I would recognize them as neighbors. The story is entertaining and comes to a satisfactory end. Buy this for your permanent collection. It's a piece of American history.
