Of all the films of the 1940s and 1950s, this has to be one of the strangest and funniest to watch. I say this for the four main actors: Orson Welles, Rita Hayworth, Everett Sloane and Glenn Anders. <br /> <br /> The first two names are familiar to everyone, but it was the last two that made this film so entertaining for me, especially for Anders. His character, "George Grisby," is one of the strangest people I've seen in the movie. His voice, and some of the things he said, have to be heard to be believed. Slaone is not far behind in the "strange" category. Hayworth is not so glamorous with short blond hair, but it's still Hayworth, which means a lot to eat with your eyes if you're a boy. Welles is as fascinating as ever. A tip: if you have the DVD, activate the subtitles in English. Your character in this movie is Irish and you need the subtitles to understand everything he says. <br /> <br /> Welles also directed the film, which means it has excellent camera angles and wonderful facial close-ups. You also have a unique ending, visually, with a shooting in a mirror house. Good thing! As strange as this film is, he still thought that the carnival atmosphere as buffoon in the trial near the end was too much and took away the seriousness of the scene. Apart from that, there are no complaints. <br /> <br /> This is a great entertainment, which is the name of the game.
