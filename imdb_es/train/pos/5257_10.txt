I must say that this movie has given me a double personality. I have been told again and again to CLOSE and start talking like a normal person. But, it's very difficult ... no, not the wang. Did you find it disgusting and disrespectful? Well, get in the mood for a lot more. This movie is very dirty! It is not a movie to show your grandparents, but you should show it to an adolescent or an immature boy in your place of work. Anyway, let's go back to the voice gestures. Fortunately, this site has some ladies (did anyone in the study notice that there is supposed to be an apostrophe (?) Between the e and the s?), So you can always have something good to tell your boss or the police. I have a sheet in my wallet.
