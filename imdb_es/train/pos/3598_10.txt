Being a person who does not usually enjoy boxing movies, feeling that they only focus on boxing and not on the characters, this movie really moved me. I loved being able to see the protagonist Diana (Michelle Rodriguez) go through so many things in such a short time, it was amazing for me. Michelle (Rodriguez) did a wonderful job playing Diana, especially because this was her first experience as an actress, she showed real emotion and represented Diana beautifully. All the actors had chemistry on the screen and made this film even more amazing. I recommend this movie even to those who do not usually watch boxing movies. 10/10
