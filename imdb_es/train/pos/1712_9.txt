['This movie was a disaster at the box office, and the reason behind this is the innocence of the movie, the sweetness of the story. The music was good, the story is very simple and ancient, but the presentation of that story is very good, the Director did everything possible. Abhay is excellent and impressive and once again shines in his role, he did his best in the comedy or emotional scene. Soha looks so sweet in the movie. The cast of stars at rest was just fine. The music and all the songs are good, Himesh is awesome as a singer here. Do not miss this movie, it&#39;s a wonderful movie and a good feeling for us. Abhay better work to date. I will give 9/11 to Ahista Ahista.']
