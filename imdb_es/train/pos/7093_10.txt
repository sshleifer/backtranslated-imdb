With 'Twelve Monkeys' you should pay attention, but if you do, you are likely to find a lot to appreciate. I know I did it. The story is interesting and it's about time travel. A virus killed many people in 1997 and a guy named Cole (Bruce Willis) is sent back to 1990 and 1996 to find a cure for the virus. In 1990 he is arrested and placed in a psychiatric hospital. There he meets Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt), who probably has something to do with the virus. He also meets psychiatrist Dr. Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe) who does not believe him in 1990. When Cole disappears from the psychiatric hospital while being chained and locked in a room and reappears in 1996, Kathryn begins to believe Cole's stories . br /> <br /> The movie plays constantly over time. Cole makes a phone call and leaves a message in 1996, is picked up in the future and "they" send someone. For Cole that person appears only a few seconds after the phone call. These things happen throughout the movie and, therefore, you must keep the attention. You could ask some questions but since you can not have an answer, it is better to agree with the movie. <br /> <br /> 'Twelve Monkeys' works like science fiction, with some great images and a dark atmosphere. , and it works like a thriller. You are never sure what will happen next and that helps the movie. It may have some flaws in the story, but since it is a fictional thing like time travel, you must accept what the movie tells us and try to enjoy it. That was the easy part for me.
