Performance of the caliber of the Oscar by Peter Falk in a paper written in the Oscar. I loved the balanced and nuanced exploration of a long-standing marriage: how often do we get it in the movies, where usually the film ends when the boy and girl meet? This is a film for adults, a complex vision through the eyes of all parties (husband, wife, child), how each one has adapted to the other in the past and grows during the story. On top of that, he gave me about 10 big laughs, and I'm one of those people who normally sits without amazement when the rest of the audience laughs. This was one of the few really fun movies I've seen. Great, original jokes.
