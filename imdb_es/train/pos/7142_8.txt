Holes, originally a novel by Louis Sachar, was successfully transformed into an entertaining and well-made film. Starring Sigourney Weaver as the warden, Shia Labeouf as Stanley and Khleo Thomas as Zero, the roles were interpreted very well, and the actors well represented their roles. <br /> <br /> The movie had interconnected stories that all drove to the end. The main story is about Stanley Yelnats and his punishment for spending a year and a half at Camp Greenlake. The second story is about Sam and Kate Barlow. This plot is about racism and is the deepest story in the film. The third is about Elya Yelnats and Madame Zeroni, which explains the 100-year curse on the Yelnats family. In my opinion, these stories were woven very well. <br /> <br /> Contrary to the beliefs of many people, I think it is not necessary to have read the book to understand the film. The movie is reasonably easy to understand. <br /> <br /> The performance in the film was well done, especially Shia Labeouf (Stanley), Khleo Thomas (Zero), Sigourney Weaver (the director) and Jon Voight (Mr. The other members of D-Tent, Jake Smith (Squid), Max Kasch (Zig-Zag), Miguel Castro (Magnet), Byron Cotton (Armpit) and Brenden Jefferson (X-Ray), enhanced the comic relief of the film. . However, the best parts were with Zero and Stanley, who formed a great team together. <br /> <br /> Although Holes is a Disney movie, it deals with some serious problems such as racism, gunfire and violence. The dramatization of the film in some points is very well done. <br /> <br /> I would suggest this movie to people of all ages, whether they have read the book or not. You do not have to miss It.
