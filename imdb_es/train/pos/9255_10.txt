If you want a fun game with a lot of subtle humor, then you will enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> I do not understand why anyone could enjoy this. Take it for what it is: a vehicle for Dennis Hopper to get in your head and make you laugh. It's not Shakespeare, but it's well done. Ericka Eleniak is absolutely beautiful and holds herself in this - better than any Baywatch episode - and shows an ability for subtle humor. Too bad I have not had many opportunities to expand that. <br /> <br /> Tom Berenger fits perfectly into his role as "Royal Navy" and William McNamara does a solid job as a con man. <br /> <br /> Take a walk through Hopper in the middle of chasing "The Cherry on this Sundae" and you have a movie that kept my attention and made me laugh. I bought this one when it was available. <br /> <br /> Brain-candy.
