Honestly, this movie seems too depressing for my own good. It is VERY depressing until almost the end. There's no way I can justify judging a character who did things I did not like (well, except for the unpleasant character played by Fredrick Forrest). But it is still very frustrating to see people behaving this way, lifting walls around themselves when a word or something like that could break the ice and promote healing. <br /> <br /> A horrible tragedy hits a family in Montana. They believe that they have lost a child, but it turns out they have lost 2. The key is that, if they only communicate and face the pain together, they will not end up losing their second child permanently. <br /> <br /> But they just can not. Something is preventing this family from sharing their sorrows. Some relatives retreat to silence and resentment, while others point to guilty parties (and then continue and cheat on their poor pregnant wife by seducing the dead girl's beautiful girlfriend ... Andy's character is actually a snake!) The only member of the family that does not threaten Arnold is in some way his grandfather (Wilford Brimley). The grandfather seems to be able to talk to the child without judgments or even children's gloves. He seems to know what the child is thinking, although Arnold is not saying much these days. It is really a blessing for the poor child to have someone he can turn to. Nobody else seems to understand the fact that Arnold could be in shock, deny it, or that his way of grieving may not be the same style or at the same speed, as expected. It is very easy to judge, get angry and feel that someone is "made of stone" simply because they do not grieve in a way that we think they should. <br /> <br /> The story is very calm and naturalistic. You're not going to get a spoon-based narrative or some lazy Hollywood resolution. He was very concerned that this child was so overwhelmed with guilt that he felt it was necessary to hitchhike several hundred kilometers to apologize to Andy's wife, for something that should not be blamed. Arnold could have accidentally killed his brother, but nobody is responsible for the end of that marriage, which apparently was terrible, except for the two people in the marriage. Arnold did not get into the car with a pedophile or a murderer. <br /> <br /> Robert Duvall and Glenn Close are frustratingly effective as parents who somehow can not find in themselves to communicate with their child, to find out what Arnold is going through. Jason Presson, whom I have not seen anywhere else except a childhood favorite called EXPLORERS and a spooky ghost story called THE LADY IN WHITE, did an amazing job like Arnold, a great performance by a child actor. <br /> <br /> Aside from being somewhat slow at times, THE STONE BOY is an excellent and very depressing movie.
