Red Eye is an exciting film by the creator of Freddy Kreuger, Wes Craven. Wes Craven describes the story of a regular hotel worker Lisa. After attending his grandmother's funeral, he decides to take the red-eye flight. During the wait, meet this man named Jack Rippner, (how good is that?) And become friends. Ironically, they both sit side by side on this plane. So this is when the horror begins. This movie is exciting and for the weak-hearted people who do not like horror / emotion movies, let's say it's possible that they can pee on their pants. This is an excellent example of a production of bone agitation. Wes Craven did well with this movie. He chose the right actors, like Rachel McAdams, a smart and sexy girl who knows what she is doing and is cautious of everything when acting in a movie. Cillian Murphy, the terrifying and horrifying actor who can relax you in the bones before his incredible acting as the bad character in this movie, and his face can really widen your eyes. Wes Craven did an excellent job and I hope he makes more movies like this one.
