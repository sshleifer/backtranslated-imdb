['This movie really captures the feeling of freedom ... and what is worth the freedom of your own integrity ... in the most pleasant and joyful way. It is not a serious adventure, but hilarious. <br /><br /> History reflects life. We do not always get what we want right away, but we discover that we get what we need to understand why we did not get what we wanted ... which results in us getting more than we think we would get! You will get this once you see the movie. <br /><br /> And this movie is really about finding love and knowing that you have found it and that it totally changed your life. <br /><br /> It&#39;s one of my favorites of all time ... it&#39;s not easy to find but it&#39;s worth hunting ......... I guarantee you&#39;ll see it more than once!']
