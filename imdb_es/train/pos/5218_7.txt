['The flock is unfairly labeled a &quot;Se7en&quot; minor scam. There really is no reason to compare the two, except maybe for the similar scenario in the final showdown. <br /><br /> Now that it&#39;s out of the way I&#39;m going to go into why The Flock is very interesting in some ways. It is primarily a play rather than a complete thriller about a very attentive social worker who watches over sex offenders. At the beginning you can clearly see that your work has surpassed you. It is evident in two scenes in which he first interviews an offender and slaps him, and second when a woman tries to pick him up and all he can think about are the usual questions on his questionnaire. <br /><br /> Gere is very good like Errol Babbage, the social worker mentioned above. His way of doing his job is no different from that of a police officer, he carries a gun and is constantly checking the newspapers and providing information to law enforcement officials if some of his &quot;herds&quot; may be responsible for a sex crime. He is also a person who has lost all the happiness of living and his only relief seems to come from demanding his own vigilante justice in his flock. Twice you see him smile, once when he apologizes for having roughly treated his partner and the other after beating a member of his flock. <br /><br /> Like a thriller, The Flock is not as successful. Something confusing and with some irritating plot holes, but it has a series of striking pieces. <br /><br /> In general, The Flock is a solid drama about a man who performs dehumanizing work and, in the end, has to work hard to prevent the abyss from swallowing him. The world we live in is a very sick place and the most distant one. You can distance yourself from the worst the happier that person is. The Flock gets that point very well.']
