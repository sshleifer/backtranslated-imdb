I saw his movie in Dallas, Texas, when it was released in 1986. I remember that they gave prizes for showing up to watch the movie. After watching the movie I can see why. The movie was not bad, nor was it great. The problem with this movie was that it was trying to tell a parallel story. They created a new story, new characters and tried to wrap it around the Masters saga. My biggest complaint is that the plot is about a second wave of Robotech Masters that attack the Earth. They even used the same scenes from the Master Saga but with different dialogues. When I was a kid, I loved the movie. But unfortunately I have not seen him as an adult and I can not give a better review. Looking back I was disappointed, but now I would love to see the film and re-evaluate my position on it. Having said that, will anyone release this movie for the whole world to judge? I love Robotech and I can not wait for The Shadows Chronicles.
