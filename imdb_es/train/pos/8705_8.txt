Despite the title, The Sword Bearer, and the cover of the DVD (action / herioc poses of The Sword Bearer) this is not a superhero movie. <br /> <br /> (Minor Spoilers) Follow the story of Sasha, The The Bearer of the Sword, who is cursed for having a retractable sword in his forearm. Great to say, but no, this is real life. If you had this power when you were a child, you could control it when, say, you face a crazy man, or when your mother's boyfriend is hitting her. And if you do not control it, how do you face being a double murderer at the age of 12? <br /> <br /> This is essentially where Sasha is when we meet him. Wandering aimlessly after another murder (like A Bout de Souffl√©). Then he meets Katya, and the couple instantly falls in love, giving Sasha a real reason to live and trying to change their ways. However, his past is still pursuing him, in the form of two police officers. <br /> <br /> That is essentially the story, and there is practically no action on the screen, although much if it is suggested. <br /> <br /> I really like this movie. Unlike many Hollywood "superhero" movies, we have very little history, there is not a bad guy (unless you have The Sword Bearer himself); there is a lot of heart and a good development of character. <br /> <br /> It's worth checking out if you can find it.
