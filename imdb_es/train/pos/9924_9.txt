Ah, Domino is really a breath of fresh air, something new in the world of cinema. I enjoyed the movie a lot because of the intricate plot, the varied characters and the intense camera effects. I have seen some complaints about the work of the camera and, in fact, according to the creators themselves, the striking and wild shots were the culmination of the mistakes made over time. Everything you see is the desired effect. Maybe some complain because something like this has never been done before, although that is what distinguishes it. In a deeper aspect, what you are seeing is how Domino sees things through his eyes, think about it. <br /> <br /> When it comes to the story, I do not see anything wrong with it. Despite its "messy" nature, according to some, it is in fact just a quick way to tell stories. The plot really is not that hard to follow, if you really concentrate on what is happening. Maybe it's just me because I see films of many different aspects, such as acting, plot, etc. I am not an "interpreter" or anything that chooses movies apart, it just seems to me. That said, I think this is an excellent movie, despite its future as a cult classic, a blockbuster or whatever. <br /> <br /> And the characters, well, there's no doubt how varied the cast is. I think the cast is excellent, because they all do good jobs to portray their characters effectively, that's what makes a film a ladies and gentlemen. All the characters are very unique and one advantage is that you can witness a small fragment of each of their lives, which makes them even more different. Basically, I personally loved the cast and the characters. <br /> <br /> All those who hit and burn this movie may not see it as I do, or it just does not appeal to them. It does not matter, this is a great movie in itself, no, it's a great movie period.
