['I liked a kind of lonely lady. Give Pia a rest. She looks great and has beautiful eyes. What&#39;s not to like? The scene in which she was raped by Ray Liotta with a garden hose was cruel and cruel. Actually, many of the things that happen in this movie are rude and cruel. But it is a film of poor quality. Many films that are of poor quality are not all bad. I liked this better than Valley of the Dolls, which was not only of poor quality but also boring. At least this was not boring. <br /><br /> Pia undresses a lot and seems a bad writer. Seeing her talk about Pushkin and Byron with a boy three times his age is incredibly incredible. I&#39;m sure Pia is a good person in real life, she just does not project the vibes of the writer. She seemed much happier when she worked as a hostess for that guy from Saturday Night Fever and wore a shiny nightclub dress. <br /><br /> A couple of scenes are fun. In which she tells the two-time actress that she is pregnant, he rolls his eyes and tells her to &quot;stop walking around,&quot; all the time he&#39;s almost making fun of every flying bimbo. <br /><br /> Pia&#39;s nervous breakdown scene is good. It was probably a mistake to go so supernova in him (the vortex of floating faces and the cry of freezing, now!) And his subsequent catatonic stupor is somewhat exaggerated. <br /><br /> However, the acceptance speech is a hoot. I want to see someone deliver that speech in a drama class. <br /><br /> But, again, we are talking about garbage. You could find something worse in any movie of the week in the eighties.']
