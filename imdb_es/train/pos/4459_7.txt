For films like 'Anchors Aweigh', few have been awarded so many Academy Awards in a warm-up for happy hour. Either 1945 was a besieged year for a good movie or they were still suffering a shock from Billy Wilder's 'The Lost Weekend' who wrote anything, starting with A on the ballot as the best image to please the loyal public of the musical image Given that Gene Kelly was nominated for this performance instead of his role in 'Singin' in the Rain ', then there had to be something wrong with the mounting systems behind the scenes at MGM. Of course, the study is in its best behavior during this tour so praised by the great studios and on the same Hollywood, useful for those who are trapped on the other side of the world. <br /> <br /> However, a musical sailor suit with the brilliant talent of Gene and Frank Sinatra is certainly a nice farce, despite the need for more people to yawn in the musical's previews so that the Today's public is not hit with unnecessary execution time. There have been many longer pieces before and since then, but in this case all the lovely scenes of Kathryn Grayson could have been deleted. Until the display of 'Kiss Me Kate' it may have been necessary for non-opera enthusiasts to see any of their films with the remote control in hand. <br /> <br /> If it was necessary to practice picking up women for 'On the Town' in 1949, maybe the lucky sailors did not have to promise an audition with Jos√© Iturbi and play the piano for a heartfelt interpretation of "Susie" . Few are lucky enough to get a screen test at the MGM gold studios. Then few are even more fortunate to be cared for. There is no need to lament the successful screen tests of Susan Abbot or Kathryn Grayson, but this makes the non-opera enthusiast continue to wait for the final pink slip to be delivered to both. <br /> <br /> But for everyone, the star talents are a good way and a higher than average score with a light but fun naval history, intertwined with ambitious navy youngsters good for the latest bursts of morale of war, makes Anchors' at least does not question choosing the wrong MGM movie. The direction is maintained while the cast takes the story in a beautiful color photograph. Every time someone breaks into music or a song, the film is a joyous occasion. <br /> <br /> The natural highlight of the film is the adventures of Gene Kelly in a fantasy world, culminating in a brilliant dance with Jerry the Mouse. This is a well-deserved number for Kelly's career, and it's good to know she thought about it before Fred Astaire started dancing on the walls and ceilings. <br /> <br /> It's not exactly triple taste. , sprayed rainbow, chocolate wafer, cream, cherry and banana ice cream, but it is a solid, square lump of sugar that somehow melts in your mouth and, despite the guilt, remains a pleasant sensation. <br /> <br /> Score: 7/10
