I have been a fan of Hindi films since I was 4 years old, but I have never seen a movie that is so moving and impressive, especially as a Hindi movie. In recent years, I stopped watching contemporary Hindi films and saw the classics again (Teesri Kasam, Mere Huzoor, Madhumati, Mother India, Sholay, etc.) But this movie changed everything. It's one of the best movies I've seen in my life. I discovered that not only was I moving, but I also found it very educational for someone who is a first generation Indian woman growing up in the United States. It helped me to understand my own family history, which was always something very abstract for me. But, "seeing" him, feeling him and understanding him helped me to sympathize with the generations before me and the struggle endured by the indigenous peoples. The film helped me put a lot of things into perspective, especially considering current world events. I never thought that a movie could change the way I think like that before ... it did. The plot is fantastic, the performance excellent and the direction is impeccable. Two thumbs up!
