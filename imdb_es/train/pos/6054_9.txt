I saw a preview of Freebird on the Isle of Man TT, since I had heard it in a couple of motorcycle magazines. Although I ended up mainly for racing, the appeal of seeing Phil Daniels in a motorcycle movie (yes, I love Quadrophenia like everyone else) proved to be enough to get me away from beer and parties. In the end! We did it! We, the British, have made a great motorcycle movie (and it's not like Torque). This is the best of British comedy. Remember my words, this is the best interpretation of Phil Daniels on the screen, and in regards to Geoff Bell, there is a new British legend that makes his name felt. I loved Gary Stretch in Shane Meadows' fantastic dead man's shoes and here he offers a poignant interpretation that can add to his growing cinematic reputation. This is a movie not only for us Bikers, but I think for everyone (even my girlfriend loved it). I hope he receives the same brilliant response on the continent as on the Isle of Man. I will not go into the details of certain classic scenes that this film has (watch out for the store), as it would ruin the fun, but I would say, go see, enjoy and have one of the best nights in the movies you've had in a long time. I really believe that this could be a cult classic. As they said in the TT ... C'Mon Freebird!
