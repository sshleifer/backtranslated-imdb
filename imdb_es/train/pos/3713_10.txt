With this film, it's about style, atmosphere and acting. True, I did not believe in all the developments of the plot, but it did not matter: the excellent performance, the unexpected twists of the plot and the wonderful atmosphere absorbed me and took me along the trip, and I had a good time. Kenneth Branagh is not only a great actor, but also a master of the accents, and proves it once again with an impeccable Georgia accent. He is surrounded by such talent in supporting roles (Robert Downey, Jr., Embeth Davidtz of Schindler's List and Fallen, Tom Berenger, Daryl Hannah and Robert Duvall) that I was simply impressed. I recently bought a copy of this movie, and I never tire of seeing it. Simply one of the best thrillers of the year. If you have ignored this movie (and you probably have it), then I suggest you look at it.
