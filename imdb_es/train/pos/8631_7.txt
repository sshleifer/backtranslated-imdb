['&quot;Like the first touch of pleasure and guilt, like a spontaneous and youthful flirtation of fascination and fear, like a climax of contrary emotions,&quot; said one of the film&#39;s fans after watching LOVE AT THE TOP, the misinterpreted version of Title of the stylish director Michel Deville&#39;s LE ENRAGE DE MOUTON. <br /><br /> Vincent Canby, in the New York Times, however, right after the film&#39;s premiere in 1974, he declared: &quot;LOVE AT THE TOP, which opened yesterday at the 68th Street Playhouse, is a 1973 French comedy that vaguely recalls a series of English comedies of the fifties, the rise and rise of the cynical youths who possess, and who possess, ambition. &quot; However, the significant difference he mentioned was the fact that LOVE AT THE TOP does not deal with the system of English classes ... (January 27, 1975) <br /><br /> Having left the evaluations for individual individuals, of course, the test of time has done its fair work. What can be said with certainty after more than 30 years is that we can hardly find films like LE MOUTON ENRAGE, where decadence seems innocent, where relationships appear as young enthusiasts, where feelings are so manipulative. <br /><br /> For Romy Schneider fans, it seems pointless to point out that this film is a must see, not only because it offers a unique performance (as it did in all its roles) at the height of his career (9 years before his sudden death). ) but because she is particularly attractive here. It is not TRIO INFERNAL where, as it were, &#39;forced escape&#39; and the ridicule of the sweet image of Romy, persecuted for years by the Sissi saccharine, is with its most discouraging manifestation, but a film where it is given a role fair to the brilliant actress. She plays Roberte, a woman who becomes the object of lust for the protagonist of the story, playboy Nicolas Mallet (Jean Louis Trintignant). It is he who obtains the financial benefits of lustful links. This movie can boast really memorable and unique shots of Romy, and give him some of his best scenes. Romy&#39;s sex appeal is unforgettable here. <br /><br /> Another strong point of the film is its execution of the content with a development of individual perception. As immoral as it may seem, the director makes perfect use of the contrast: conventions against pleasures, innocence against decadence, genuine lust in the face of an instrumental issue. Nicola has most of the features that viewers may like or dislike, which may be attractive or unpleasant; however, these are the characteristics that viewers must deal with seriously, more than saying, they are what we must all accept. Therefore, one is led to a peculiar world, softly wild and erotically unique to the main character. Although she sleeps with many women, there are two women who represent a kind of opposite worlds for Nicola: Roberte Groult (Romy Schneider) and Marie-Paul (Jane Birkin). He manipulates them, makes love to them, can not abstain as much from the desire for their bodies as from money; however, he perceives them differently. However, despite all this &#39;adult maturity&#39;, it is emotionally like a small child playing with a toy car on the table, a kind of &#39;detailed vision of the male mind ...&#39; in the form of comedy, as course. <br /><br /> Finally, there are very good performances, which means that LE MOUTON ENRAGE is slightly underestimated. Not only does the aforementioned Romy Schneider do a brilliant job of giving viewers an extraordinary insight into his role, but the young Jane Birkin seems to be convincing in the role of the young and inexpert stalker Marie Paul, Jean Louis Trintignant makes it possible to see Nicola the right way. This artistic merit that resides in the performances is accompanied by an excellent music by Camille Saint-Saëns, the melody that will ring in your ears for a long time. Therefore, apart from some defects of the film, such as old colors, slow action (sometimes), possible clichés (noticed by some viewers), the merits must be significant. <br /><br /> LE MOUTON ENRAGE, in short, is a clear manifestation of contrary manipulative tools in life. It is worth seeing as a moment in Romy&#39;s career, a prelude to strong eroticism, a chain of contrary emotions, of love and hate, appreciation and disgust compared to the first orgasm and the first angasm ... But we are not We humans. , &#39;spectators&#39;, movie buffs built on such contrasts?']
