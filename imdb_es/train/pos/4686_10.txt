This is by far my favorite movie of all time. This is mainly because he is not afraid to delve into some politically incorrect issues (such as spanking and female submission) that other dominant films are too shy to play. Nothing seems to be out of bounds in this film, since the director freely develops the story without worrying about offending the viewer. However, I do not think anything has been done here simply because of impact value or to offend anyone. Sean Young delivers an excellent and courageous performance. Most of the established actresses would not have taken on this role or asked for some important changes in the script before accepting it. The other cast members also do a good job. <br /> <br /> Have you noticed that this movie has not appeared on pay cable since a brief mandatory tour a year after it hit theaters? Have you ever wondered why? The obvious reason is that it simply does not fit today's political environment. It seems to me rather ironic that some premium channels now transmit soft porn (increasingly closer to hardcore pornography) but they will not broadcast a conventional movie like "Love Crimes". Unfortunately, even though this movie is only 11 years old, it probably can not be done today. <br /> <br />
