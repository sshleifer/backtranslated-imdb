I really do not know what people have against this movie, but it is definitely one of my favorites. It is not preaching, it is not anchored by its morality, it should not be controversial. It's just God Any possible god, regardless of religion. And it's really fun. <br /> <br /> Jim Carry plays Bruce Nolan, a television reporter who usually stays on the lighter side of the news, desperate to prove himself (more or less to himself) that he You can take it seriously and do a good job in an anchor job. This unit is what is slowly moving your beautiful girlfriend Grace (Jennifer Aniston) away. When the final straws are executed, he hastens not to laugh, but to shout before God, who in turn gives Bruce his powers. Bruce makes his life better for himself, until he feels guilty about helping others, where he continues to lose the point of his powers. Meanwhile, his constant enthusiasm for his own life makes him more selfish, leaving his relationship in a dangerous terrain. <br /> <br /> Well, that was a bit long. But as an argument, it works well. The step by step way in which we face the challenges of being God is much better than grouping your problems and is able to hide quite well. <br /> <br /> As you probably know by listening to this First of all, the film, Carrey's perfect performance remains in the character (which, fortunately, is him), and controls and gives ambiance to the scene of the movie scene. Whether they admitted it or not, the paper was written or rewritten exclusively for Carrey. Without it, humor would become flat, since humor is a partial execution. And the humor is very good in the first place. But without Carrey, he would feel like an aspirant. It is a wonderful life. <br /> <br /> Jennifer Aniston is great and, no matter what some may say, it does not act as the only excuse for the third act. At least, you do not think that when you see it. She gives a sincere interpretation and makes you forget you're watching a movie, she and Carrey feel like a real couple. <br /> <br /> The film feels ggooooodd (see the film to understand), has a nice feeling, approaches the idea adequately and better than expected and, in general, should never have slapped to save the Carrey's career (he was not going anywhere).
