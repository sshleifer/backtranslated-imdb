This movie is for Halloween what the "Christmas Story" is hilarious for Christmas: both are low budget movies, without stars of big names ... and both are two of the most incredible and fun movies available, both seasonal CLASSIC !! ! "Spaced Invaders" comes galloping from the start with warmth and humor and a great cast of characters ... the five foolish Martians, Klembecker the real estate agent, Russell the official, Vern in the "fuel supply depot" and many more ! You only have to see this movie to believe it, and, like in "Christmas Story", it gets better and better with every visualization and every time you see funny things! DEFINITIVELY ONE TEN !!!
