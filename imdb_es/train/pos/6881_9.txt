How can a movie that features the singing of Curtis Mayfield be bad? Can not The Groove Tube is a series of scatological blackout sketches that make fun of anything from 2001 to the Olympics. The maxima, (Koko the clown, the recipe easy to lubricate) outnumber the minimums (a "Distributor" too long), but even the minimums are fun. Best of all is Ken Shapiro's manic dance on a busy sidewalk in Manhattan (that's Shapiro, not Nat King Cole singing Just You, Just Me). Definitely dated now, but at that time The Groove Tube was irreverent, bold, cheeky and hysterically funny. Ken Shapiro made this little cult success, then 7 years later he made the opening of the Christmas Day bomb, Modern Problems (although I enjoyed it) and since then, unfortunately, nothing. (I could be playing drums in a jazz band) The Groove Tube is still an inexhaustible explosion of positive energy, a movie that 26 years after my initial visualization, it still gives me a lot of joy!
