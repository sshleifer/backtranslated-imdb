I know it was a good ending, but honestly it was amazing. I love when a movie ends in a terrible dark nature, but this time I was impressed that Darth Vader turned against the Emperor. I was really amazed. The harrowing sequence in that movie was when Luke is tortured and defeated by the Emperor / Darth Sidious. It is about to be destroyed when Darth Vader, the Dark Lord of the Sith, eliminates his dark master. A good sacrifice The cinematography of this film is impressive. I was surprised with all the ships of the Rebel Battle ships and with all the Imperial War Ships and Super Star Destroyers. I loved the new race Mon Calomari brought to the screen, the ewoks, the sullesteian (co-pilot of Lando) and many more ... Most of my favorite scenes are in that movie: 1-When Vader destroys the Emperor and suffers fatal injuries. 2- When Luke sees the spirits of Obi-Wan and Yoda and then appears Anakin Skywalker (Sebastian Shaw) (the biggest scene in Star Wars) 3- When LEia kills Jabba and strangles the crime lord Hutt. <br /> <br /> Personally, I like the script and the battle of Endor that present a terrestrial and space combat, as well as the best duel of Star Wars between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker in the Star of the Death. Post-script: The scenes with Leia in the slave bikini are memorable. 9/10.
