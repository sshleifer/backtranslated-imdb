['I remember seeing this as a child in the United Kingdom, fascinated by the story and the story of Laurence Olivier. We would not talk about anything else at school the next day. I imagine that the ratings for the first sample were huge. This is, quite simply, the best complete documentary series, despite the fact that they had to cut the story to the bone that they managed to capture so much. What is interesting is that the battles of Great Britain and North Africa were fundamental, but Americans do not recognize them as such. The series captures the rivalry between Mountbatten and the American generals, the suffering of German troops on the eastern front, the mistreatment of Japanese prisoners of war by US troops. The images of the holocaust made me, a non-Jewish European, feel guilty for the treatment the Jewish people received. I do not know why this is not number one in the IMDb rankings. Maybe they are showing their bias against documentaries. Spoiler - we won.']
