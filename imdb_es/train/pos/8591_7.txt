This was a pretty decent movie. This movie is good for just sitting, watching and entertaining. Only a typical Hollywood movie. This movie will never win an Oscar or anything and definitely does not deserve one, but I thought it was pretty good. It's something like show 24 but in movie format. If you like the set, we have to prevent the terrorist from killing the kind of movie of the president, then you will enjoy this movie. Personally, I think that story has been done too much, but The Sentinel adds a little twist to the mole in the Secret Service. All in all, this movie will not leave your jaw to the ground or change your life, but who says that every movie has to be that way to be good?
