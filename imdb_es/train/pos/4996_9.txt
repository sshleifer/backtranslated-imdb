I have seen tons of HK activists, and this is right at the top of the genre. The action scenes are as exciting and kinetic as anything you've seen in any action movie. Kung fu is spectacular, the pyrotechnics in sight, the work of acrobatics. The editing has a perfect rhythm, increasing the tension and complementing the fluid work of the camera. This film is directed by the old professional Corey Yuen, whose curriculum is full of some of the best works of the genre, including the Jet Li vehicle The Legend of Fong Sai-Yuk. If there is something missing in this movie it is the presence of a three-dimensional character, although Martin, the male protagonist, is closer to him. This movie is full of archetypes instead of characters: the sexy assassin, the silly thief and his girlfriend bitch, the cackling villains. Having said that, Shannon Lee has an excellent screen presence; She is great with fighting, acrobatics and weapons. When it is on screen it is difficult to take your eyes off of it. She is so good. Why is not this woman a big star?
