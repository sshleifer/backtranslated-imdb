Very often, a band gathers for a re-union concert only to discover that they simply can not join. It is not like that here. This concert is simply brilliance from beginning to end. These three musicians obviously met in advance and planned and planned what was needed to ensure that this was not just a nostalgic party to satisfy someone's ego. This is obvious from the beginning, even before they go on stage. Many faces in the crowd were not even born when these guys performed for the first time. From the first song they captured that old magic that was Cream, 3 men, 3 instruments, without problems. Clapton, by his own admission, said he had to make an effort for this concert because there were no keyboards, synthesizers, etc., so we can see it as well as possible. Ginger Baker demonstrates why so many drummers today speak of him as a kind of battery guru. Jack Bruce just great. They really managed to put together a piece of magic that will stand the test of time for many years. This is a 10 for me.
