['I saw this Australian movie about 10 years ago and I have never forgotten it. The film shows the horror of war in a way that Hollywood often overlooks. The relationship between the soldiers of the two countries at war is highlighted by the differences in culture and the final knowledge that in the end we are not really different in the interior. If you can find any kind of copy of this - buy or rent. You will not be disappointed, you will simply be surprised.']
