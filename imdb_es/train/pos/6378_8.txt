Atlantis: The Lost Empire has some of the best, smoothest animation and cleverly written dialogue of all the Disney movies I've seen. And I was convinced of that in the first 15 minutes. I especially love the voice work of Don Novello in Vincenzo Santorini and Phil Morris as Joshua Strongbear Sweet. Too bad the whole movie seems to move at about twice the pace that would be appropriate, at least in the first act. An important aspect of any Disney movie is a satisfying antagonist, which Atlantis does not provide. He is average at best. There is a mediocre twist in the middle of the movie. That is all. However, it is a great movie. Everyone should check it.
