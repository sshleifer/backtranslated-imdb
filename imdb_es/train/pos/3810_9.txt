this is my first IMDb review, I did not want to write one, but since I now only have 2 for this great movie, I feel compelled to add my perspective ... and no, I am not associated with the filmmakers in any way (yes, yes , How often were you here before ;-)) For your information, I'm in my last 20 years <br /> <br /> First of all, I must admit that I really like animated films, because What you see is limited only for the imagination of the creators and they were quite imaginative in this. Not so much in terms of history but in the achievement of a very unique and innovative visual style. The characters look good but far from real and work well for the film, after all, it's a fairy-tale world. But the backgrounds and the world in general are full of amazing images that my jaw dropped several times as I watched this. The mini blue dragon, similar to a bunny, fans the show and easily has some of the funniest moments of the film, it's an instant classic, like Ice Age Scrat. The story is not too surprising (a group of anti-heroes has to go out and kill the biggest dragon you can imagine), but who cares if the movie looks and sounds so good ;-) 1 thing I should point out, imo the The film is not suitable for VERY small children, since it has some darker scenes and perhaps fearsome for children under 6-8, I would say, these are just some scenes, but it is worth mentioning them. Anyway, I had a great time watching this and I can not wait for it to reach the shops in high definition to see it again and again just for the sheer beauty of it. <br /> <br /> 8.5 for me
