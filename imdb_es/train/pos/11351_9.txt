Excellent film The whole picture was filmed in Budapest, so I feel proud. My little problem was that the trains in the film belonged to the Hungarian State Railways (M√ÅV), and it is clear that they were used on large trains, not on local railways. According to the story, Chikatilo picked up his victims at local rail stations. Apart from this, the movie is excellent.
