In this documentary we meet Roger, the rich manager of a factory in China that sells and markets beads and other trinkets at Mardi Gras in New Orleans. Roger says that the factory girls love their work and are grateful for the opportunities it offers, but interviews with four of them tell another story. The sad lives of the girls are in stark contrast to the strange excesses of Mardi Gras himself. Filmmaker David Redmon should be commended for obtaining excellent and unusual images of everyday life within a complex of a Chinese factory, and for conducting a revealing interview in the camera with the head of the American company that imports and sells the accounts. The film is told convincingly and clearly fulfills its purpose as a window to what lies behind the ubiquitous "Made in China" labels.
