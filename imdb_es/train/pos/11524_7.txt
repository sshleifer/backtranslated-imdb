This is a quirky little movie, and I agree that there are also some extravagant performances. <br /> <br /> Follow the adventures of a young man who decides he wants to become a famous Las Vegas. Illusionist, and partly it is about following his dream, partly from the dreams of others and all about the tribulations of the entertainment world. I thought the movie was lovely, and it has a moment or two of real magic that makes it all worthwhile. <br /> <br /> Alan Arkin is great as the magician he never was, and his mentoring of Max proves it. a fun and moving relationship <br /> <br /> Not for everyone, probably, but if you like movies about the trip, then I think you'll like this one.
