After seeing "Whipped" in the projection of a dealer in the AFM the other night, I must say that it impressed me a lot. The audience was laughing all the time. Unfortunately, all the territories have already been sold, so I did not have the opportunity to buy the film, but I really believe that it will be a great success both nationally and internationally. I agree with the comment that "Whipped" should not be released as a male "Sex and the City", mainly because unlike "Sex and the City", "Whipped" is a satire on dating that is never taken too much in serious. "Whipped" mocks relationships in a way that most sexual comedies would not dare. In addition, the film I shot at the AFM had more of a plot and story than "Swingers," "Clerks," and "Sex and the City" combined. "Whipped" never slowed down for a moment and provided the audience with a continuous comedy. The performances of Amanda Peet and the rest of the cast were solid, which made the movie more impressive considering the budget.
