A real anomaly in French cinema, this desperate work has no equivalent in contemporary production. One would have to look at the side of "le feu follet" by Louis Malle (1963) (the fire inside) to find something that is not completely different. The effort of Harel. Ironic and cynical, having lost all his illusions, the hero, a computer scientist, has no more reason to live. Absolutely none. Separated from the human race, he seems to live his life as a kind of entomologist, studying his colleagues. One of them catches his attention: Tisserand-Jos√© Garcia interprets the most degrading part of the decade. Then, Tisserand will become a kind of prey: all his pessimism will spread to this poor man. The scene is the night. The club ends the strange relationship: the hero tells his victim that his life will always be unsatisfied unless ... Well, now the movie takes a more conventional turn, so to speak (perhaps Clouzot's misanthropy) but only for a time. <br /> <br /> The form is rare beyond the commentary There are wo voices over, one for the narrator who always refers to the main character as "our hero", one for the hero mentioned above. The story now takes place in Paris, now in Rouen, the city of Guy de Maupassant. In a scene with a shrug, the hero says that the madness of the writer was only the expression of his disgust for man and draws a parallel between his despair and that of Maupassant. <br /> <br /> This depressing movie is only suitable for an informed audience. Not because of the very short excerpts of X-rated movies, but because after watching them, you may feel depressed.
