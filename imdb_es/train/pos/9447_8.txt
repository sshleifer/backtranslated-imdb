The fascinating drama of four men on a weekend canoeing down a remote river. They are the pacifist Ed (Jon Voight), the adventurous and violent Lewis (Burt Reynolds), the obnoxious Bobby (Ned Beatty) and the sympathetic Drew (Ronny Cox). The first 40 minutes are great: there is an incredible sequence of dueling banjos, an interesting interaction between the characters and the impressive wide-screen cinematography by Vilmos Zsigmond. Then two Hillbillies attack Ed and Bobby. One of them violates Bobby ... and the trip turns into a nightmare. <br /> <br /> Simply incredible. The landscape is incredibly beautiful, but this horrible violence is happening. To be honest, the violation of Beatty has never bothered me, I am well aware that he is faking despite the good performance. This movie also shows how the characters change: Ed has proven his pacifism, Lewis weakens, Bobby is raped by one of the people he made fun of before, and Drew tries to stay sane. The direction of John Boorman is also very safe and the sounds of the forest and the river greatly help the mood. <br /> <br /> The acting is mostly good. Voight is good up front, it has been better. Beatty is also fine, but it is his first film and he has the guts to take on such a risky role. Cox is very good, especially when things start to fall apart. And Reynolds is simply excellent: one of his best acting jobs EVER! How this was not even nominated for an Academy Award escapes me. Also Bill McKinney and Herbert Coward are as credible as the Hillbillies. <br /> <br /> A powerful movie, NOT for children. Try to see an uncut version - the TV version is killed. In addition, letterbox visualization is essential to capture impressive images.
