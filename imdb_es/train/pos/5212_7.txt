['Star rating: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /><br /> Richard Gere, a remarkably bad actor who manages to deal with his appearance (now faded) instead of a strong dramatic talent, has always occupied a rather curious position in the American Hollywood scene, always a sure bet on the roles of leading men that still have a remarkable presence today. But nowadays it seems that he has settled more in this type of direct functions to DVD / limited releases and as such, it seems that now he is more settled in his fort. <br /><br /> You have to resort to some severe issue here like Earl Babbage, a cynical and hardened case worker, one of those workers assigned to a few hundred sex offenders in an area of the US. UU., That together with his new protege Allison Allthrop (Claire Danes) should lead to his latest case, deepening the kidnapping of a young woman while trying to forgive himself for a case that failed a long time ago. <br /><br /> This is a certain immersion in the darkest side of humanity, stepping on material definitely not for the apprehensive or those who seek a vision of light. And as such, it is a fairly strong, compelling, unbreakable film and not restricted by its direct budget to DVD. The only thing that really makes it go back is the excessive use of fast and restless camera sequences that are used in the most dramatic moments that look a bit corny after a while. But it&#39;s still part of the more solid material that I&#39;ve seen Gere in, which becomes tirelessly darker and more as he goes. ***']
