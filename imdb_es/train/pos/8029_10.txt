I'm curious to know what rifle Beckett used in the movie and also because of the caliber of the bullet he was supposed to shoot. If this is based loosely on Carlos Hathcock's attacks, I guess it's a 7mm. round. I'm also curious about the rifle itself. He also made a comment in the latest Sniper movie about the rifle that the Vietnamese man allowed him to use and that belonged to his father. Beckett mentioned that he thought it was the best sniper rifle ever made. I would like to know what rifle is that too. I know that this particular rifle was made around World War II or beforehand. I just could not see it up close watching the movie to identify it. <br /> <br /> As for the deaths of Mr. Hathcocks, his longest shot was 1.47 miles, and he had 93 confirmed deaths and 14 unconfirmed. After his wounds healed from the burn in Vietnam, he spent the rest of his career teaching snipers at the USMC the skills they would need in the field. His sniper career still mentions our brothers and sisters who train at the USMC. I discovered his name from my friend who is an ex-marine. Any information would be great.
