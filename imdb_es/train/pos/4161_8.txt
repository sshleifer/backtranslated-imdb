['Galaxy Express 999 (Ginga tetsudô Three-Nine). Made in 1979. Directed by Rintaro. Based on the original work of Leiji Matsumoto. <br /><br /> The little I know of the GALAXY EXPRESS 999 story was first published as a popular manga in the 1970s and was created by Leiji Matsumoto. GE999 is located in the same Star Wars space universe as Matsumoto&#39;s other famous space manga: CAPTAIN HARLOCK. In fact, the space pirate Harlock and other characters of that manga (such as Queen Emeraldas and Tochirô Oyama) make appearances in GE999. GE999 was a hit as manga and was soon followed by the popular anime series that included more than 100 episodes. It aired in 1978. A year later this anime movie appeared, which is not a sequel to the series, but summarizes the main points of the story in a two-hour movie. <br /><br /> The story unfolds in an unidentified future of Star Wars type in which traveling to different planets has become a possibility. The people of the future can have mechanical bodies in which they can live hundreds of years, maybe even forever. The protagonist, Tetsurô Hoshino, is a child who witnesses how a cruel Count Mecha, whose entire body is made of mechanical parts, kills the mother of Tetsurô. Tetsurô swears revenge and is convinced that he can only achieve it by having a mechanical body. To get it, you must travel to a distant planet with the Galaxy Express 999 space train. However, as Tetsurô comes from poverty, he has no money to get the expensive ticket. By chance, he meets a beautiful young woman, Maetel, who looks like her dead mother. Maetel offers a ticket to Tetsurô on the condition that she accompany him on his trip. And so the journey begins ... <br /><br /> The first time I saw this movie was last October, approximately in six months, and again yesterday. I feel that I must first talk about what bothered me the most in this movie: it seems very hasty. So, again, what can you expect from a 2-hour movie that tries to count the main points of more than 100 episodes of long series? In any case, the situations change at great speed and Tetsurô meets other important characters in the story, mainly by chance. I feel that manufacturers should have left something out or included an additional 30 minutes. <br /><br /> However, it can not be argued that GE999 has deserved its place as an anime classic. The animation itself, very true to the Matsumoto manga style, is detailed and beautiful to watch. Even after almost 30 years of its release, the animation has not been &quot;outdated&quot; but puts many later anime films to shame. The music throughout the film is pleasant to listen to even if it is something &quot;old&quot; these days (after all, it was the 70s). I have not heard any dub in English of this movie, so I can only comment on the audio in Japanese which is good. The voice actors give life to their characters, the most memorable are Masako Nozawa (known mainly as the voice of Goku in the entire Dragon Ball saga) as the excited and young Tetsurô, and Masako Ikeda as the quiet and mysterious Maetel. The secondary characters do not stay in the shadows, but they also have a life of their own, the most memorable for me as the waitress Claire. <br /><br /> The story itself is suitable both for those seeking entertainment for a couple of hours, and for those seeking deeper messages. GE999 is an entertaining adventure film, but it can also be seen as Tetsurô&#39;s journey from childhood to masculinity. The whole film is told from his point of view, so we are forced to feel what he feels. I think many people can relate to Tetsurô, because despite the elements of fantasy, is a very realistic character: young, disheveled, clumsy and naive. We follow him when he begins to see the differences between humans and machines and comes to the conclusion of whether he wants the mechanical body or not. Maetel, on the other hand, remains a mystery in the film and even at the end, when it reveals who and what it really is, it does not respond much to anything. Maetel can be seen as the dream of a growing young man, always close, but out of reach. <br /><br /> It is the strange but beautiful relationship between Tetsurô and Maetel that still awakens talking and questioning, and fascinates after decades. People have discussed whether their relationship is two friends, mother and child, or two possible lovers (which arouses much criticism, since Maetel&#39;s age is unknown and Tetsurô has not even reached puberty). Without any means to sound deep, I think the best term to describe them is &quot;soul mates&quot;. There is no doubt that both of them feel devotion, affection and love for others, but it goes beyond friendship, family and lovers. I think if their relationship is filled in any of those categories, it would get something out of the whole movie and the characters. The final scene, even if you already know what is going to happen, is still very moving and memorable. <br /><br /> In general, despite the rush of the plot and some corny scenes, GALAXY EXPRESS 999 has its place as an anime classic between films like AKIRA (1988) by Katsuhiro Otomo and GHOST IN THE SHELL by Mamoru Oshii (1995). The film is directed by Rintaro, who had previous experience with the works of Leiji Matsumoto since he had worked on the CAPTAIN HARLOCK series. Later, Rinatro directed a wonderful looking METROPOLIS (2001) that also questions the difference between humans and machines. <br /><br /> GALAXY EXPRESS 999 (1979) is a classic that must be seen at least once by all anime fans.']
