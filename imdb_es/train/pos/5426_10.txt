It's time for Gunga Din to be released on DVD. I can not say exactly how many times I've seen this good movie, but I never tire of doing it. The main actors worked very well together. Victor Mclaglen (Sgt McChesney), Cary Grant (Sgt Cutter) and Douglas Fairbanks Jr (Sgt Ballentine) are an unbeatable team. <br /> <br /> I just can not get over his exploits in India. His first look at the Sergeants Three, is when he sees them engaged in fighting with other soldiers for the so-called Treasure Map. The three sergeants are sent on an expedition to find out what happened to the communications line and enter a city almost deserted, or so they think. <br /> <br /> They take care of the necessary repairs and soon find some "residents" in hiding. Shortly after they are attacked by a group of crazy and barely manage to escape to the base. <br /> <br /> Later, they are sent to another mission that gives Sgt Cutter the opportunity to go and look for gold with Din. They find the golden temple and are trapped by the evil supporters of Kali. Din is sent to seek help and Cutter is captured. Soon, McChesney and Ballentine arrive with Din, and they are also captured. <br /> <br /> In the face of being killed, they look helpless while their Regiment comes to rescue them. The evildoers watch and are about to launch their surprise attack when a wounded Din climbs into the golden dome and blows his bugle, which then alerts the British to the ambush. By doing this, Din dies to shots. <br /> <br /> Soldiers attack the evil ones and soon defeat them. In the end, Din is honored, since he has become an honorary corporal in the British army.
