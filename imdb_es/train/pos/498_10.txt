This is what I expected when I premiered star trek DS9. It is not so slight DS9. That was a wonderful show in its own right, however, it never gave the fans more than they wanted. The company is that show. While it has a similarity to the original walk, it differs enough to be original in its own ways. It makes the ideas of exploration thrill us again. And that was one of the main ingredients that made the original so beloved. Another ingredient of the success were the relationships that developed between the members of the crew. The spectators really cared deeply about the crew. The company also has many promises in this area. The chemistry between Bakula and Blalock seems very promising. While sexual tension in a program can often become a crutch, I feel that tensions in the company can lead to much more and say much more than is typical. I think that when we deal with large scale characters of different races or species, we get some very interesting ideas and television. In addition, we must take into account the performances, Blalock is very convincing, since Vulcan T'pol and Bacula really have a whim and a strength of character that offers great performance. The rest of the cast delivered good performances too. My only complaints are the following. The topic. It's good is different, but a little cheerful for my taste. We need something a little bigger. It does not have to be orchestral. Maybe something with a little more electronic sound would be enough. And my other complaint. They sell too many ads. They could fix this by selling fewer ads, or by making all the shows party. Otherwise, we will end up seeing that the final act of the shows is wrapped up too quickly as was one of my complaints from Voyager.
