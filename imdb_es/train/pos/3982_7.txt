This short track by Joe McDoakes in particular was obviously inspired by the spectacular Thank Your Lucky Stars by Warner Brothers, one of those stars who boosted the morale of the war era. In that one, Eddie Cantor played himself and would be a comedian who would want to participate in films except for his resemblance to Cantor. <br /> <br /> George O'Hanlon, who starred in McDoakes shorts, is himself and McDoakes, who is just trying to get a break in the movie. Like Thank Your Lucky Stars, some players hired by Warner Brothers with a free moment wandered through this movie. <br /> <br /> O'Hanlon's was sent by the central casting for a small role of a line in a movie of the First World War, but Lookalike McDoakes receives the message. The poor man is so nervous about his great moment, that he begins to think of ways to fulfill his only line. Maybe sound like a real movie star would help. <br /> <br /> 86 belatedly after the exasperation of director Ralph Sanford and patient Clyde Cook, who plays a British cockney soldier, they find a niche in the film business for the poor McDoakes. It's worth seeing this short, very funny song that was nominated for an Oscar to find out what's wrong with O'Hanlon / McDoakes. <br /> <br /> Both.
