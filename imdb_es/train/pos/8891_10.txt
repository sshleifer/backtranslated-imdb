I agree with other comments that a lot of history was not discussed in the film, but it was not a documentary! He was destined to entertain and I think he did very well. <br /> <br /> I agree with the black family. The scenes with them seemed out of place. As suddenly, it would be included, but then I understood the history and the connection between the families and I found it quite good. <br /> <br /> Although it was not a recreation of In the sixties brought to light the great and important periods of the decade. I found it very entertaining and it's worth looking at it.
