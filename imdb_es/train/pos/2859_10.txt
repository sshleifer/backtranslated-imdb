I know this sounds strange coming from someone born almost 15 years after the program stopped broadcasting, but I love this program. I do not know why, but I enjoy watching it. I love Adam the best. The only disappointing thing is that the only place I found to buy the seasons on DVD was in Germany, and it was only the first two seasons. That's disappointing, but it's fine. I will continue to search online. If anyone has any advice on where to buy the second to the 14th season, send me an email to darkangel_1627@yahoo.com. I already have the first one. The only drawback is that the DVDs are from Germany, they only play on my portable DVD player and on my computer. Oh good. I still have it!
