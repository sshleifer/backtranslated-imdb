['Do not think of these films as a movie for children, the whole family can enjoy it. It&#39;s a weird mix of a movie, since it seems to have a movie inside, but at least it makes sense at the end (unlike modern movies!) It gives you all the elements of a movie (decent plot, good characters) - Good , is starring the Muppets, a list of minor celebrities * that the movies would claim. What is surprising is the fact that it can be a roller coaster of emotions, some sad, some moving, some funny and some serious. Everything makes a fun family movie that everyone can see together. <br /><br /> * The celebrities in the movie are actually the best stars of the day, but there is only one true star in the movie and no one dares to outshine Miss Piggy!']
