"CASOMAI" was the last movie I saw before getting married, last year. <br /> <br /> It was also the first movie I looked for, after I got married, because we promised to offer a copy to our priest. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, reality is not that. Apart from fiction. To all those who wrote that priests like "Don Camillo" do not exist in real life, I would recommend visiting my Priest Pe. Nuno Westwood, in Estoril, Portugal :-) <br /> <br /> To everyone else, I would only recommend that you watch this movie, before and after the "I do!" day :-) <br /> <br /> Rodrigo Ribeiro Portugal
