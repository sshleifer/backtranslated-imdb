I really enjoyed this true to form the person of Dick Tracy. This is a well-made product that used modern technology to create a comic-era story full of images. If you are a fan or have recently seen some of the old movies of Dick Tracy b & w, then you are sure that you will love this version. Pastel colors and characters larger than life, represented in a meticulously authentic shot of a bygone era, are entertainment as it should be. Personally, I consider that the musical element of Madonna is an important part of this film. The CD that presents his music of this film is something that I have often heard over the years, it is very well done and executed musically and in tune with that time. In my opinion, the best moment of Madonna both on screen and especially musically. This is sure to get the "child" in you.
