In the history of comic book-based films, "Mystery Men" is one of the most underrated. This is not a comic superhero movie! Follow the exploits of a motley crew of well-intentioned aspirants, including Mr. Furious (played by Ben Stiller), the bowler (Janeane Garofalo), the Shoveller (William H. Macy), the Blue Rajah (Hank Azariah) and El Bazo (Paul Reubens). "Mystery Men" simulates various aspects of superhero movies such as "Superman" or "Batman", such as sayings and questions about secret identities. Most superheroes are not billionaires like Bruce Wayne, but types of workers with low-class jobs and neurotic home lives. So it seems that director Kinka Usher is turning the heroes into something that the average viewer can relate to. I found "Mystery Men" to be visually stimulating and very fun. Even if it does not become a franchise, it's a pleasure to watch!
