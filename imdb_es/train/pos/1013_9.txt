['Stargate SG-1 follows and expands the Egyptian mythologies presented in Stargate. In the Stargate universe, humans were enslaved and transported to habitable planets by the Goa&#39;uld, such as Ra and Apophis. For millennia, the Goa&#39;uld harvested humanity, influencing and spreading human cultures. As a result, Earth cultures such as those of the Aztecs, Mayans, British, Nordics, Mongols, Greeks and Romans are found in the known habitable planets of the galaxy. Many mythical places known as Avalon, Camelot and Atlantis are found, or have existed at some time. <br /><br /> Currently, the Earth&#39;s stargate (found at an excavation site near Giza in 1928) is located at a top secret US military base. UU Known as the SGC (Stargate Command) under the Cheyenne Mountain. Colonel Jack O&#39;Neill (Anderson), Dr. Daniel Jackson (Shanks), Capt. Samantha Carter (Tapping) and Teal&#39;c (Judge) make up the original SG-1 team (some characters join and / or leave the team in later seasons). Together with 24 other SG teams, they venture to distant planets that explore the galaxy and look for the defenses of the Goa&#39;uld, in the forms of technology and alliances with friendly advanced races. <br /><br /> The Goa&#39;uld parasites use advanced technology to become Egyptian gods and are committed to galactic conquest and eternal worship. Throughout the first eight seasons, the Goa&#39;uld are the main antagonists. They are a race of alien parasites, very intelligent and ruthless, capable of invading and controlling the bodies of other species, including humans. The original archenemy of this race was the Lord Apophis system (Peter Williams). Other lords of the system, such as Baal and Anubis, play key roles in recent seasons. In the ninth season emerges a new villain, the Ori. The Ori are advanced beings with unfathomable technology from another galaxy, also committed to galactic conquest and eternal adoration. The introduction of the Ori accompanies a deviation from the main focus in Egyptian mythology towards an exploration of the Arthurian mythology surrounding the ori, their followers and their enemies: the ancients.']
