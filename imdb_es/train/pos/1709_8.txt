['After confusing a Halloween broadcast of Orson Welles&#39; classic radio adaptation of WAR OF THE WORLDS with a true Martian invasion, a group of Moronic martians appear on Earth with the intention of conquering, only their plans fail when they are really found out of his Element and really alone. <br /><br /> This really is often pretty good and fun, with some decent lines (just to see the memorable quotes) to boot. Most likely, it attracts science fiction fans. This has passed me the test of time, since seeing it again recently, it turned out to be much better than I expected. Despite a cast of nameless stars, this may be the funniest Martian invasion ever filmed. Interestingly, the Martians themselves seem to represent almost all the classic stereotypes of Action Heroes / Sci-Fi Heroes (youngsters of the 50s, fighter pilot, intrepid astronaut, brave soldier and mad scientist). Fun for all the family. <br /><br /> &quot;Prepare to DIE! Tierra Scum!&quot;']
