After Chicago, I was starting to lose all respect for Richard Gere and then The Flock appeared. So far, a nice smile and a couple of facial gestures can catch you, but he showed me that he has finally got his job and can act with the best of them. Clare Danes was also super as her "apprentice / replacement". Some have suggested that there was too much unnecessary violence, but I do not see it that way. Nothing that I saw detracted from this movie. I was very surprised that I had not heard of its premiere in theaters and, instead, I found it on Blockbuster. It really is an exceptional film with the perfect combination of action, suspense, emotion and social conscience. As good as 7 even? Well maybe. And you will see a better performance of Gere than someone who has left Pitt.
