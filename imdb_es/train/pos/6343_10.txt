Let me put the scene. It's school holidays and there's absolutely nothing in the movies. I'm with my friend deciding what to see. We are looking for a movie that starts soon and "The Grinch" appears. We buy tickets without knowing what to expect. What we got was a roller coaster of fun. <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey (to whom I must add is my number 1 actor in the whole world) was absolutely magnificent as the Grinch in this best Ron Howard film (the next one to Apollo 13). The way this movie was made, the stage, the actors, the props and the music was just amazing. It really brought to life this childhood movie. <br /> <br /> The story is based on the history of the grinch. As we all know, the Grinch is a horrible person who just can not stand Christmas. He lives well above Whoville and has never mixed well with the townspeople. But a little girl will change the appearance of The Grinch in life and in others in a drastic way. <br /> <br /> Cindy Lou Who (played by the adorable new actress Taylor Momsem) runs into the Grinch when she finds the nice part of him immediately. She tries to break the barrier and help the Grinch move and move. mix with the people of the city. <br /> <br /> This whole movie is a barrel of laughs for the whole family, both children and parents. A SOLID 10/10. Well done Jim. <br /> <br />
