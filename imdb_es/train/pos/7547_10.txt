['Cat Soup at the beginning seems to be a very random animated movie. The best way I&#39;ve been able to explain it is that it&#39;s pretty acidic. Although it is not totally random. The story is about Nyatta, a young cat and his sister Nyaako. Nyaako is very ill and dies, however, Nyatta sees that her soul is ravaged by death and is able to recover half. The story is about his quest to return Nyaako to life. <br /><br /> Although much of the content of this movie seems completely random, it is not. Most of it is symbolism for life, death and rebirth. You can also see references to other stories, such as Hansel and Gretal. This strangely cute short film has an interesting story, with a deeper meaning than that seen on the surface of the screen.']
