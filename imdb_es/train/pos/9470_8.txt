I'm not a fan of Steve Carell; however, I like this film about Dan, a council columnist, who goes to his parents' house to stay with his children and ends up falling in love with his brother's girlfriend. It is a story that has been told before, but not like that. There are simply too many small fragments that make the movie better than it should be. The cast is wonderful, and even if Carell is not my cup of tea, he is quite good as the widower who is supposed to know everything but finds that knowing is different from feeling and that sometimes life surprises you. Sometimes witty and wise in the way that it can be an annoying Hallmark card, the movie can still grow on you and be something more than a movie streak. Worth seeing
