David Aames is a rich and handsome boy who lives in New York City. When her "sleeping companion" Julie Gianni gets very jealous after David falls in love with Sofia, she gets David in his car and tells him that he is the only man he loves and with whom he wants to be, but seeing who is in love with Sofia, she decides to commit suicide with David in the car with her, driving from a bridge. David survives the shock, but remains with a disfigured face. Then he is accused of murdering Julie. The point is that David does not know what is real and what is not, since he still has these strange dreams (most of which are actually nightmares) and flashbacks, some of which simply do not make sense to him. However, everything will soon return to him when he begins to discover the truth. <br /> <br /> Well, here's a cast of stars, including Tom Cruise, Penelope Cruz, Cameron Diaz, Kurt Russell, Jason Lee and Noah Taylor who all give good performances in the movie. In the film, everyone postpones different things about characters such as happiness, sadness, anger, etc. really good. There is also a cameo in the film of the great, Steven Spielberg. <br /> <br /> Vanilla Sky is a well-made, different, interesting and original movie that will let you talk about it long after it's over. It is not just a thriller, but a true psychological thriller. The movie trailer is really good, but the movie is very different from what it could be. It has been very well directed and there were a couple of really cool scenes here as well. In short, a nice movie that should be paid close attention too. They are sure to have made many films of "Are they dead, if not who is dead?" Recently.
