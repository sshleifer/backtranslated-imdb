Two things chase you along L'intrus (The Intruder): who is the intruder and is it a movie or a dream that you are seeing? The ending is so shocking that, for a while, he can not answer any of these questions. The intruder appears as different characters, different men in different circumstances that do not belong to the scene, so they are expelled from it, in a kind or brutal manner, but often without emotional participation. The main character, Louis, is a despicable man. He has rough ways, some bad work and no heart. He needs one and goes after him. He has a transplanted heart and then decides to start a new life. Can this man succeed in his search for redemption? A guy like that could cut your throat with the fall of a hat. You know it, but Claire Denis does not encourage you to judge it. From time to time, there is a young Russian woman, a beautiful girl who seems to inhabit somewhere between heaven and earth, who judges him. She can even punish him. But not Denis. There is the character played by Beatrice Dalle, who does not want to do business with him: do not touch me, she says. But Denis lets this man be himself, he films it in his search for self-absorption. I do not know if what it films is the heart or the mind, but it is not the basic of the traditional plot. What she films, you get at the end. You know who the "intruder" is, you know why, more or less, and some scenes come back to your mind with all their meaning. But was it a movie or a dream?
