I'm not sure if this is some kind of masterpiece or just a shod of poor quality elevated by the performances and the visual effects. In any case, I'm sure I loved it. From the wonderfully twisted, spooky, intertwined stories, to the deliciously sinister presentations of Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone, to the vivid and eye-catching color with which everything is captured, this is first class trash and it's a lot of fun. Not to mention the sexually clever and finely veiled subtexts that permeate the entire film, always threatening to escape from the image of dialogue, but never do so. I would be lying if I said that the mere entertainment value of the movie did not contribute to my love for her, but there is some kind of strange art behind the unintentional comedy (or is it?) And I really really tried. I could really get into this melodrama theme.
