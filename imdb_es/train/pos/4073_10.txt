Have you ever wished you could escape from your stupid and stressful life in school or work and go on a magical adventure of your own, with one of your closest friends by your side, face all kinds of dangers and villains, and unravel the mystery of A lost civilization that is waiting for someone to discover all its secrets? Even if you are not too fond of fantasy, have you ever wished you could simply experience what it is like to be a child again, and not be careful in the world, just for a couple of hours? <br /> <br /> This is exactly what Miyazaki's "Castle in the Sky" is about. Pazu, a young engineer but very brave and ambitious, lives a rustic life in a mining town until one day, a girl named Sheeta falls from heaven like an angel and takes him on a trip to a place far beyond the clouds , while all the time they have pirates and military units hot in their way. In short, it's the incredible adventure that all children dream of at one time or another, and I can not help feeling that my worries fade away every time I see her. <br /> <br /> As such. Of the oldest works of Miyazaki and occupies a lot of place in the everyday world, the film is not as spectacular in its history as Spirited Away, Howl's Moving Castle or even Princess Mononoke. However, I find it difficult to say that any of these films is superior to the other, because the three films are, at one time or another, mystical to the point of being enigmatic, if not disconcerting, especially for the youngest. spectators <br /> <br /> "Castle in the Sky", on the other hand, does not try to be an allegory of any kind, nor is it a coming of age story; On the other hand, it is possibly one of the best representations of the interior of the mind of a child that I have seen. The work of art is not only beautiful, but the use of perspective from the eyes of children is simply incredible; Whether it's the "camera" panning to see the huge trees or the clouds on top, or the incredible sensation of height when looking at the ground or the ocean while hundreds of feet in the air, I just can not help but feel like I'm there with Pazu and Sheeta, just a child in another world, very far from reality. <br /> <br /> Even the children themselves do not have a complex relationship that suggests a need for hope like Ashitaka / San or Chihiro / Haku; Sheeta is the angel of Pazu, having literally fallen into his life from heaven one day, the absolutely perfect person for him from the beginning. As the film progresses, more and more of its true adventurous childhood spirit comes out through its kind words and beautifully realistic facial expressions. Not only are they an adorable reminder of who he used to be, but his endearing friendship never gives up throughout the entire film, but it is strengthened to the last frame. For that reason, I have fallen in love with them two more than with any other Miyazaki couple. <br /> <br /> At the same time, "Castle in the Sky" is an easily accessible movie Because no matter what kind of casual viewer you are, you will surely find your solution here. Mystery, action, drama, comedy, suspense, science fiction, romance, even some western ... everything is here, almost everything people go to the movies for (except maybe horror). That's why I can easily recommend it as a first Miyazaki movie; It is perfect for those who have no expectations of having already seen the incredible other world of some of their most recent works. <br /> <br /> Even the final song of the film, when translated into English, conveys the feeling of longing. the discovery of some kind of lost civilization, and some kind of soul mate, that can not be found in our mundane lives. "The reason why I miss the many lights is that you are in one of them ... The earth turns, it takes you, it takes us to the two, that surely will be". Miyazaki has always provided poetic lyrics to make final songs of Joe Hiasashi's magnificent scores, but this is the only one I've seen that is a touching love song and an inspiring dream. I found myself on the verge of crying just listening to him. <br /> <br /> It is possible that "Castle in the Sky" is not Miyazaki's most developed, spectacular or significant work, but it is absolutely perfect for what it really should be. : a true vision of childhood fantasy and a wonderful escape from reality for any adult who wants to have the same sense of imagination they had when they were little children without worry. Sit back, relax and love him for what he is.
