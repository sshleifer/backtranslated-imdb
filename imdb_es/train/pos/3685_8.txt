It is a joy to have seen this intriguing project. Very refreshing and educating. Not only for a filmmaker, who can learn what can be achieved in 5 minutes of screen time, but also as a public, who may not be so prepared for so much love in such a short time. <br /> <br /> 20 short films about love in Paris are all unique, but some of them, as expected, stand out. I thought that the segment of Tom Tykwer (Natalie Portman) was the best, although the mimes made me smile too. <br /> <br /> I clicked on the "spoilers" option for this review. Read is a sufficient spoiler. Just look at it. Do not read what I write, but watch the movie instead. <br /> <br /> And smile.
