Unlike other comments, this movie seemed fascinating, even with all its faults and the fact that some of the actors acted like zombies. <br /> <br /> Being a technologist, I found the experiments interesting and the hardware realistic. Although the reading of the minds of people through the computer sounds fantastic, now experiments are being done to do just this. I will observe that these experiments are at a very early stage, with results so far unfavorable. <br /> <br /> The characters in the film are well chosen. The girl, although exaggerating a bit, seems idiotic. The driver of the truck is a buzzer for the drivers of real trucks. The minister conveys doubts at the beginning, (the principal investigator tells the minister that he (the minister) is not sure if he believes that God created man or that man created God, but at the moment when the chips are falling , falls again). your faith. Only the doctorate plays the zombie. The secrets that they harbor are suitable for their characters. In the face of death, they react as real human beings would. <br /> <br /> The film is a warning against the dangers of unlimited surveillance by the government. As strictly a thriller, the film does not have enough emotions. As a scientific exercise with philosophical foundations, it is fascinating.
