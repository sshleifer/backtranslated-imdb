Some of Altman's well-known "masterpieces" now seem sadder to me. Maybe it's me. Like the last critic, I even like this "minor" Altman (recently shown on FMC), although I do not think it is targeting a wide audience. The political organization as a "microcosm" for public campaigns. Part of this satirical "docudrama" is now dated, like Dick Cavett watching the Tonight Show, but I found much of the dialogue funny and insightful (for example, "you're real, that means you're not a threat to anyone"). The story is not "deep", but I liked it. And the performances are fun, especially Cavett (as "himself"), Lauren Bacall as an aging conservative figure, Glenda Jackson (who actually became a member of Parliament) as leftist ideologist (in the opening scene lecturing at someone dressed like a carrot about the sanctity of politics), and Carol Burnett as a lost case. All in the inimitable Altman style, although it may not be as inimitable as always. But quite inimitable.
