I think this film adds to the diversity and is very accurate in terms of historical reconstruction. The way in which the different communities that go out together in Thailand are shown is very interesting ... The Portuguese, the Japanese and the different communities that are being administered by the king. The plots around the court are, as always, a struggle for power with a lot of betrayal. The closet is fine. The film is also made locally in Thailand in a reasonable production. The scene with the elephants as executors is very interesting. It's fun and I think it can also be used in schools for its historical accuracy, since it shows that Europeans in Asia were subjects of local kings in a very different way from the traditional Hollywood perspective.
