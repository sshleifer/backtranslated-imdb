The Europe of Lars von Trier is a worthy echo of The Third Man, about an American who comes to post-World War II Europe and finds himself caught in a dangerous mystery. <br /> <br /> Jean-Marc Barr plays Leopold Kessler, a German-American, who refused to join the US Army. UU During the war, he arrives in Frankfurt as soon as the war ends to work with his uncle as a driver of sleeping cars on the Zentropa railway. What he does not know is that the war remains secret with a clandestine terrorist group called the werewolves that attack the American allies. Leopold is strongly against taking sides, but is attracted and seduced by Katharina Hartmann (Barbara Sukowa), the daughter of the fatal woman, owner of the railway company. His father was sympathetic to the Nazis, but he was pardoned by the American colonel Harris (Eddie Considine) because he can help the German transport system to work again. The colonel soon recruits, or forces, Leopold to be a spy (without giving him the option or the opportunity to think about it) to see if the werewolves could carry out attacks on the trains. <br /> <br /> Soon, Leopold is caught up in an adventure by getting involved with both sides of the conflict in a mysterious and cinematic way, where everyone and everything is not what it seems. It is amazing to see how the naive Leopold deals with everything (his lover, the terrorists, the colonel, the annoying passengers, his unhappy uncle, even the officials of the railway company who come to examine his work ethic) before he finally reaches a boiling point, and with humor and violence. control. The movie is infinitely unpredictable. <br /> <br /> The film is shot with style, always done at night during the winter with lots of snow. His shot in black and white with color shots appearing randomly throughout. In addition, background screens that display images that act against act with images in the front. Add the hypnotic narrative of Max von Sydow, and Europe becomes a dream place that is out of this world. <br /> <br /> This is now one of my favorite movies.
