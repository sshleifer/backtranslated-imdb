I just watched the movie, and the most frightening thing was that the people who spoke during the movie sounded like the actors. The film had its moments, but it was also delayed and it was quite sick. Everything was meant to be a farce, but once you see the pathetic lives of the people in the movie, you think "People like this are all around us." All attempts to get the sympathy of the audience fade when the actors make one. stupid thing after another. On the positive side, there are some great (and funny) insults. I think I would wait for the video, but it was a good laugh. WARNING: Jerry takes off his shirt during the movie! (It's not a pretty sight!)
