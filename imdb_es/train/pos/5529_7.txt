The first time I saw this movie in a theater in France was about a year ago. He came and went with little fanfare, but I enjoyed it for the beauty of landscape photography and the fascinating images of wildlife. (The story, although nice, is really incidental - if you really thought about it, there is no way that most of what happens can happen in real life). I saw it again tonight, here in the United States, on DVD. Once again, I think it has a very limited distribution. The Blockbusters only had one copy, and I do not remember ever playing in the Cleveland art houses. <br /> <br /> Seen on my TV, photography is not so impressive, although it is still very beautiful. The images of wildlife are still fascinating. The story of the relationship between the 10-year-old boy and the fox is even less convincing the second time, when you know where he is going. <br /> <br /> Still, as I said, the story is incidental. It's a beautiful movie to watch, and if you like wildlife images, you should find this fascinating.
