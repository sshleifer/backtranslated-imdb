['Running Man fiercely cheats the modern American media complex, and hits its target in the dead center. It may be an easy target, but nonetheless, they do it. RM struggles effortlessly in professional wrestling (with some professional wrestlers like the Hunters), network television, Nielsen ratings, the US government (suggesting it is entertainment oriented anyway), crime and punishment, and Half a dozen other things along the way. It is far from the original novel by Stephen King, and Arnold is not the Ben Richards of the novel either. But who cares? It is basically an Arnie movie, with all the action sequences well choreographed and a single line that requires such a company.']
