I definitely recommend reading the book before watching the movie. This book won the National Book Council Award in 1978 and is a very exciting reading (it is not intended to be a play on words). It's not too hard to read for those who do not read often, so do not be afraid! The book seems to capture the passion of relationships more than the movie and the movie will make more sense after reading the book. Having grown up in Melbourne I could really relate to this book and this movie. Very few Australian writers were around the 70s, so little is documented about the way of life of a woman in an urban city of Australia during this era or class. It is a precious piece of Melbourne's history. It is a pity that it is documented as a kind of soft 80s porn movie. It is far from that and, as the other critic mentioned, do not read the DVD cover, as it does not represent what the film is about. Those who rent the movie based on this description will only be disappointed. Just remember that this movie was made in 1982, so do not wait for the Hollywood dramatization that seems to incorporate these days. This is what I like about that. It is also great to see Noni Hazlehurst in this role, she is simply fantastic as Nora and it is great to see her act really, because if you are the same age as the best you will remember her for her work in Playschool and Better Homes and Gardens. Who knew she hid this talent? This movie will give you a completely new impression of it. A classic Australian story!
