You will notice by the stars that I have given to this GREAT movie that "... before you see it for the first time" is implicit. I've never heard of this movie before and I saw it because this week (and the last one) was a very slow rental experience (it's not very good). I'm not sure how this movie got away from me. I love Lucy Liu and Jeremy Northam is great too. However, yes. <br /> <br /> This movie is an amazing example of what to do if you do not have a big budget. It had the right amount of plot and dialogue to make it very interesting and keep the viewer in the dark; just enough. The whole movie is you (the viewer) trying to discover the many twists and turns. I would have given this movie 10/10, however, some of the shots were pretty fake. I do not have too much against this movie, but I do not think it deserves a perfect score. <br /> <br /> Lucy Liu is beautiful and mysterious (as always). I think she's pretty underestimated as a serious talent. No matter her beauty (which is difficult), she really takes her papers seriously and does not rely on her appearance to lead her through scenes of sophisticated emotion. And she can also appear cold and even lifeless if necessary. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Northam does really well, at first, as a corporate geek rat, ready to run through any maze to prove his worth. However, as it changes throughout the movie, it is like night and day. I know some fans of Clive Owen, Jude Law or other hopefuls to become the next James Bond will hate me for this, but Northam could / could / should fit that bill. It is soft and cultured. He has a great posture and voice of Bond. I think he can also be cold if the situation requires it, and rather realistic. <br /> <br /> Great movie and, without a doubt, this moviegoer recommends that you watch it at least once. You like corporate espionage movies.
