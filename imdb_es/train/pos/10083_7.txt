The fact that this film was published on a DVD that was still formatted for television and with a blurred image really bothered many film purists ... and rightly so. This deserves a much better deal. <br /> <br /> The story is about a street artist who needs a child to pass on his trade (the rules of the day) and ends with a small girl (not the conventional one). path) ... and the problems that follow later. The old man had bought the boy at a slave auction and soon discovers that the boy is not a boy, which he obviously thought was the case. <br /> <br /> The old "Bianlian Wang (Xu Zhu) is kind of funny looking, with a missing tooth and a contagious smile." The girl "Doggie" (Zhou Renying) is a cute one. the story is how they manage after that.I usually like a good sentimental ending, but this gets a little dragged in the last 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> In general, it implies a complete story With drama, suspense, humor and sadness, do not expect a good quality image for the money you are spending on the DVD, until it comes out on a widescreen display, rent it out.
