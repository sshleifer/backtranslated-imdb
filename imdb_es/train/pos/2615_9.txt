While I was on a plane, reviewing the wide variety of movies, I came across Live! almost accidentally Oh boy! What choice <br /> <br /> I remembered seeing the trailer vaguely over a year ago and I completely forgot that I was not expecting more than another meaningless movie about a stupid reality show. Now I can easily say that this has been a hell of a walk. I do not remember the last time I was so excited, terrified. I'm not sure if it was the high altitude playing with my senses, but the suspense gradually grows through the film to a climax where you can not get away from the screen, literally sitting on the edge of your seat and biting your nails remaining. I have. <br /> <br /> First, you will go through a personal moral evaluation of your position on show justice. It will go from thinking "why the human being can be so cruel" to "why not after all?". Ask yourself if I would. Then learn about the contestants, their motives and begin to guess. Then, you will see a contestant pull the trigger one by one and you will be thrilled even if you know that the first candidate is safe. <br /> <br /> Good acting, good direction, with a cinematic experience that reminds you of those old movies in which I knew what would happen in the next scene, but I still craved more. <br /> <br /> * Spoilers * couple of things that would have changed: <br /> <br /> - the casting of the contestants. The farmer really moved me and we should have had a little more like him. The idea of ​​a rich writer who wants to be famous is a bit stupid, it felt like you did not care about some of the participants. Although this could have been done on purpose, I think the audience should have been able to partner with most of the contestants. - rules of the game, a big flaw: <br /> <br /> what happens if the fifth participant does not die when he pulls the trigger. Do you really think that the last guy standing will pull the trigger and run alone? they should have given all the contestants a chance to live, that is: if the fifth one is also blank, then nobody dies. <br /> <br /> It's interesting that I have not been bothered too much by these bad points because I really had a good time. I just wish I had some popcorn with me!
