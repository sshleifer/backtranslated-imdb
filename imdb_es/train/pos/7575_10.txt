Resident Evil: code veronica is an excellent video game well done, has excellent graphics, very comfortable controls, a great story and a very fun factor. The story of this is that Claire Redfield is taken to an island for trespassing on Umbrella Ground, and reaking havoc in her main lab while searching for her brother. Code Veronica graphics are very good, the effects of fire and rain are very attractive. The controls are comfortable, but the button pattern does not conform to the Dreamcast control, making it difficult to use. It's still fun to go through a strange and disturbing place, shoot the guts of the zombies. Code: Veronica also has a little "Romance" between the two main characters. You can also play as Chris Redfield, from Resident Evil 1. The sound in this game is better than ever, for example, even though I hate the new function, when the giant spiders crawl, their feet produce a disturbing sound and the pistols sound much more realistic. Excellent graphics, outstanding story, comfortable controls, and reali The sound stic makes Resident Evil Code: Veronica is a definite beloved. I give it a 10 out of 10.
