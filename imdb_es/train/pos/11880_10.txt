"Scarface" has a great cult following, even now, 22 years after its release. <br /> <br /> It has also been widely criticized for being very vulgar, unrefined, exaggerated and all bloated! These are people who compare Scarface with The Godfather movies. It is true that on the technical front (cinematography, script, direction, etc.) Scarface is far behind "The Godfather". <br /> <br /> But it is also true, that Scarface has and some other gangster Missing films, is the rawness, the crude approach of the mobsters. The Latino gang members in this film look much more threatening and real than any of the polished Italian or Irish gangsters of other gang classics like "The Godfather" or "Goodfellas". This is one of the main winning points of Scarface and I firmly believe that this fact has been dismissed as "insensitivity" by most critics! I have seen the original Scarface of 1932, and I must say that these two films are very different from each other and should be seen as two different films instead of praising the original for the "remake". <br /> <br /> Al Pacino has been criticized for being exaggerated and noisy in this movie. But, what is to be considered that this is precisely the way in which the filmmakers wanted Tony Montana's character to be? It is this angry young man who makes hasty decisions and throws tantrums every two minutes! He is not the quiet Michael Corleone here. He is Tony Montana, a very vulgar and uneducated individual who does not really think much and get angry all the time. <br /> <br /> Definitely, there is a feeling very similar to that of the 80s in this movie. The soundtrack is all from the 80s! I love some of the songs, which include 'The theme of Gina and Elvira', 'Push to the limit' and the instrumental title. <br /> <br /> There are some memorable and beautifully recorded sequences, including the famous chainsaw scene. , the blow of Rebenga, the first encounter with Sosa and the visit of Tony to the visit of his mother. <br /> <br /> On the proceedings: Al Pacino is brilliant as the furious Cuban refugee. He reportedly mentioned that he enjoyed playing Tony Montana the most throughout his career. And it really seems that he has thoroughly enjoyed himself in all his scenes! One wonders what "Scarface" would be like without Pacino. I could not imagine anyone else portraying Tony Montana and, in all likelihood, the movie would not be as effective without him! <br /> <br /> Steven Bauer shines as Tony's friend, Manny. <br /> <br /> Robert Loggia is wonderful as Tony's boss, Lopez. This is F. Murray Abraham (as Omar) in a small role. <br /> <br /> Then there is a bit of sweet eyes in the form of Elvira played by Michelle Pfeiffer. She looks beautiful and is appropriate in her role. <br /> <br /> The director exceeds a bit during a particular part in the climax. Without revealing anything, I would only say that that was the only small part that suffered due to improper handling. <br /> <br /> "Scarface" is definitely one of the most entertaining and one of the best gangster films ever made. outside. Enjoy it for what it is: a rough portrait of the Drug Lords and their ganglandas!
