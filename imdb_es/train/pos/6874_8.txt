A series of vignettes, most of them falsifying the television of the 70s, but also with some excavations in the government and American companies. One of the longest segments, "The Dealers" is not so much fun for me and I do not know what it is that is parodying. Some of the others, however, are absolutely divergent. I especially enjoy the kitchen segment. Most of the dirty words I know are used in the movie and, if you do not like frontal nudity, stay away.
