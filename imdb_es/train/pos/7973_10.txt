Maybe I'm a sap but this is the sweetest movie in history! I saw it for the first time when I was around 4 or 5 years old, and I cried. Between then and now (embarrassed at 15 years old) I have seen it more than 25 times and I have cried to each and every one of them. Do not worry, it's tears of happiness! And not everything is sap! There is also a lot of humor and comedy. In general, the issue of talking animals can be a big obstacle, but in this film this is not the case. My only advice: even if you like this, do not see the sequential ... cheesy! I suggest that everyone check this ... you will not regret it, no matter how big or young you are!
