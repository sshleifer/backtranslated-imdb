['This recreation of the infamous murders of 1959 in Kansas, based on the book of Capote, is recorded bluntly by Brooks and the director of photography Hall in black and white, which gives it a documentary feel. There are good performances by Blake and Wilson as the killers and Forsythe as a policeman chasing them. The scenes prior to the murders, filmed in the royal house where the crime occurred, with a soundtrack of whistling winds, are quite intense and chilling. Brooks directs with much enthusiasm and uses several interesting transitions between scenes. The only complaint is that it is a bit too long, with the outcome dragged and some preaching.']
