Ashanti is a type of film from the 70s (1979, to be precise). It reminded me of The Wild Geese in some way (Richard Burton, Richard Harris and Roger Moore on a mission in Africa). It is also a very good movie, and I liked it a lot. <br /> <br /> David (Michael Caine) is a doctor who works in Africa and is married to a beautiful Ashanti woman named Anansa (Beverley Johnson) who has trained in medicine in America and is also a doctor. While they are healing, one day she is kidnapped by some slavers who work for an Arab slave trader called Suleiman (perfectly interpreted by Peter Ustinov, of all people). The rest of the movie is David trying to get it back. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine is a brilliant actor, of course, and plays a character who is determined and ready to do anything to get his wife back. But rather desperate with a weapon and action items. First he was helped by an Englishman who campaigned against the slave trade that no one recognizes is happening (Rex Harrison!), Then briefly by a helicopter pilot (William Holden) and then by an Arab named Malik (Kabir Bedi). Malik has a score to settle for Suleiman (he is very intense in everything, he is a very attractive character), and that is why he goes with David to find him and recover Anansa. This implies a wonderful scene in which David fails miserably on his camel. . <br /> <br /> Then there is a lot of adventure. There are also many moral questions. The progress of the story is a little predictable from this point, and there are some liberties taken with the conspiracy to move things forward faster, but everything is quite forgivable. The question is: will David arrive at Anansa before Peter Ustinov sells it to Omar Sharif (yes, of course Omar Sharif is in that)?
