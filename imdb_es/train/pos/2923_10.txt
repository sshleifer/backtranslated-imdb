Eddie Murphy really made me laugh out loud in this HBO comedy show. I love your impressions of Mr. T, Ed Norton and Ralph Cramden from "The Honeymooners", Elvis Presley and Michael Jackson as well. The Ice Cream Man, Goony Goo Goo, is also fun. I saw this for the first time when it came out in 1984. I laughed so hard that I almost fell off the chair. I still think that this is very funny. <br /> <br /> Eddie Murphy, when I was on "Saturday Night Live", made me laugh a lot, he's one of the best people to come out of "Saturday Night Live". "Eddie Murphy Delirious" is his best performance alongside "Eddie Murphy Raw". <br /> <br /> I give "Eddie Murphy Delirious" 2 thumbs up and 10/10 stars.
