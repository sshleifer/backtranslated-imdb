One of the best movies ever made! Why he only got a rating of 7.6 is a mystery. This film is a window to the world of black experience in the United States. Visualization should be mandatory for all white people and all children over 10 years of age. I recommend seeing her with "The Long Walk Home" as a complementary piece. If you think that Whoopi Goldberg's work is about "Homer and Eddie" or "Hollywood Squares", think again. Do not miss this movie, you should have won the Oscar. (And read the book, too!)
