['There are two things that I like about Elvira, and both are bigger than her and keeps them hidden: her wit and her talent. A movie is the best thing to show how funny it can be or how it draws attention. With the look of a combined clone of Morticia Adams and Anna Nicole Smith, she inherits the estate of a distant relative only to discover that she is truly the heir of the occult. The comedy in this movie is the best of it, but it could have been much more terrifying and chilling. It is above all a picnic with as many horror movie references as the rampaging mafia or the fleeing heroine, stumbling and stumbling on their heels. My favorite part is when she uses her wonderful gifts to break the chains and keep her locked in the cemetery. The ending is as sweet as if it was written by the Brady, but the Las Vegas act at the end seems too great for this kind of movie.']
