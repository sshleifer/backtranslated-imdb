This movement really made me jump out of my chair in anticipation of what the actors were going to do! The performance was the best, Farrah should have won an Oscar for this, it was fabulous. James Russo was so good that he hated him, he was the villain and he played great. There are not many movies that have fascinated me like this. The cast was great. Alfie looked shocked with those big eyes. Farrah, who looked like a victim, and you relived her horror as she went through it. Farrah made you feel like you were there and feeling the same anger that you felt you wanted her to hurt you, but you also knew it was the wrong thing to do. The movie had you on a roller coaster and you went up and down with each scene.
