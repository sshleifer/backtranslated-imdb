I liked Antz, but I loved "The life of a bug". The animation that was put into this paid off. I will definitely get this on DVD. By the way, Disney should do a widescreen version of this movie on tape. (I heard talk about crushing all the characters on the screen in the standard video format). Most will have to agree that the final credits were the most fun! I only saw one of the two games, but I can not see the other one!
