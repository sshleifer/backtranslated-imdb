This is a powerful documentary about domestic abuse in Cameroon. The "sisters" in the law are lawyers and judges who in 2004 successfully prosecuted husbands for the abusive treatment of their wives and won a woman the divorce she desperately wanted through a Muslim council. It is quite long (about two hours), but fascinating in terms of both the individual plaintiffs and the defendants and the lawyers who successfully represented them in courtrooms presided over by judges. It will leave you, as you left me, with many questions about exactly how this change happened. How and when did women come to positions of authority in Cameroon? Have the various cases presented in this film had a significant effect on the treatment of women in general by their spouses? Was the granting of a divorce by a Muslim court, against the express wishes of the husband, a unique event? I am not suggesting that the filmmakers have answered these questions. They made the movie two years ago, not yesterday. And the movie they made deserves a wide audience.
