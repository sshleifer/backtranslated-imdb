The story is extremely unique. It's about these two pilots who save the Earth from strange beings, but they have to use a special speed that makes everything around them age quickly. The whole series is about pilots who are facing the loss of time, friends and mentors. . <br /> <br /> The ending COULD have been fantastic. It started to end with a total down note and left a real mark, but instead it ended with a super happy note from Disney and it bothered me VERY badly. <br /> <The animation is decent for 89, but it can not be compared to today's. I have also heard many complaints about the corny nudity. In fact, I found that it was something decent. The nudity for the most part was justified, except in episode 2 where there was an excess. <br /> <br /> In general, it deserves a look, but the ending prevents it from being a classic.
