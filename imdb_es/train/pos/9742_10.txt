This outstanding Argentinean independent film is one of the best of the year 2000 in all of South America, including Argentina, which produces an amazing number of quality films since 1999. Only in the year 2000, Argentina launched many quality films, which broke the Argentine title BO records. Half a dozen were internationally acclaimed, like this one, at major world film festivals. After watching this movie, you can see how homegrown Argentine films could recover 20% of their national film market last year. <br /> <br /> Directed by one of the best directors in Argentina, Daniel Burman, this film examines the effects of globalization around the world, but highlights its impact in Argentina, and in particular in the Jewish community of Buenos Aires. Aires Daniel Hendler is wonderful as the cute Jewish boy, who tries to survive and even succeed in today's business climate. Hector Alterio, one of the great actors in Spanish cinema around the world, is perfect as Simon, the Jewish father, as well as the rest of the cast, which includes Spanish and Italian stars. <br /> <br /> So many current issues in Western urban societies are explored, I do not have enough space to go into details. Daniel Burman intelligently interweaves them in the plot with different characters that embody different dilemmas. If this film is played at a festival near you, or on video, do not miss it!
