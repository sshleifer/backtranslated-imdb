From what critics and audiences indicated, BIRTHDAY GIRL had to be a great clinker. Still, because I love Nicole Kidman, I decided to rent her last night. It turned out to be quite worth seeing. Sure, it's not your basic American comedy, and you do not have to be a genius to realize it's a very British movie, but that's why I liked it. It was a change from all the other movies around, a breath of fresh air. Sure, there were some holes in the plot, but overall it worked. First, Kidman was fabulous again in a very different role, not very glamorous, but still very attractive. She continues to prove that she is one of the best talents in Hollywood. Your Russian accent is not only effective when you speak English, but sometimes you have long conversations in Russian and, if you did not know it was Nicole Kidman, you would never question its authenticity. Harrison Ford should have taken note of "K-19." In general, a small light film that works despite the horrible buzz.
