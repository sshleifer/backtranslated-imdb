['Once again, Stacy Peralta is faithful first to the people who lived the story. By allowing those involved in the genesis of big-wave surfing to tell us their stories, how they felt, and what they thought, you have the feeling of having been there. The film takes you from the fifties to the present, focusing on three main architects who contribute to the evolution and development of the sport. Sincere &quot;home videos&quot;, like the videos of themselves and their contemporaries, take you further in your world. The layers of music, culture, technical information, a pure vision of the participant&#39;s athleticism and the fabulous images of the great wave give you a complete perspective of this aspect of surfing. <br /><br /> It is worth looking at it thoroughly.']
