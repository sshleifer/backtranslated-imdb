Doghi is a wonderful movie and Renuka Daftardar is excellent. So is Uttara Baokar, who is usually excellent in most of his roles. Together with Kairee, it is an example of marathi cinema at its best. There are certain parts in both films that tend to be didactic: it probably would have improved the film so that it did not have the few scenes in which the social message is affected. These scenes probably arise from the filmmaker's political concerns, but the film is realistic and moves enough not to need it. But apart from these small disputes, it is a film that deserves to be seen more and one that I highly recommend. The concern of Sumitra Bhave and humanism shines.
