You're waiting to see if the remake is better or worse. I rated the Audie Murphy movie with a 3 (I'm a stern student), the second lowest I've given Audie (the worst is "Battle at Bloody Beach" if you're curious). I give this movie a grade of "8" (and I'm a stern student) It's the Civil War story of the renegade "soldiers", if you want to call them that, against the North. People like Quantrell and the men who rode with these outlaws. <br /> <br /> The original was a watery version, very clean cut, and still showed the horror of what these men did. Actually, movies like the previous version look better in mature audiences, who can discern the story. It would be more apt to qualify the original "R" and this, with its abrupt nature, a GP, because the newer film offers a very honest version, a message that a child can decipher more easily than the previous version. <Br /> <br /> The filmmakers since the early sixties have boasted of "realism", but few do. Instead, they only give it the monotonous landscape, monotonous disguises and monotonous events, but with the stereotypes of cardboard comics, the weakness of the spaghetti era. <br /> <br /> Modern filmmakers have realized this mistake. It is evident in a superior western style that we usually see today. This movie is an example. It gives the realistic configuration, but also gives us the characters that we can believe exist at that time. <br /> <br /> He has some moments of calm, which makes a complete situation a bit difficult, and he has some inexplicable situations. But unexplained situations are fine as long as the whole movie is maintained, and the characters are intriguing enough. <br /> <br /> It starts a bit corny, but it really improves. The main character is one that we can identify, and at least have some sympathy for him. Audie Murphy's character from the first movie really does not evoke sympathy, and is just too unmotivated. <br /> <br /> The character in this movie follows the lines of a true antihero. There is motivation, and a method for your madness. We never feel that it is really "right", but we can understand where it comes from. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of action in the movie. There is also some humor. A good scene is when the heroine tells the hero that he will not lie to him, and he reflects on that. <br /> <br /> This film manages to do what the filmmakers have been trying to do for decades. This team of directors and writers did it well. <br /> <br /> Recommended. Complete success
