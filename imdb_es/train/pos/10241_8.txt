I try not to take the ratings of IMDb seriously, but I was shocked when I saw the rating of 5.4 on one of my childhood favorites. It does not impress me so much at age 17, but as a family movie, this is a sweet and well-intentioned movie. Children will definitely adore it and will not care about the flaws, and adults can guess the actor behind each character and admire the subliminal messages of the movie. None of the films was preached in any way, in fact, it has a great message that was added to its sweetness. However, I must admit that the story is on the thin side, and some scenes like the death of Screweyes (which still scares me) can be a bit frightening. But the animation is well above average with nice colors and good character animation. The music of James Horner is very beautiful, and the song presented is memorable, catchy and fun. I really liked the characters, Louie is probably the most profound of all, but the dinosaurs were at least attractive. Martin Short's clown was both hilarious and emphatic, the part when he tells Screweyes "I quit!" He had me in stitches. My favorite is Screweyes, an effective villain who is clever and I suppose smart. In any case, I would like the film to remain in the part when it explains how it lost the eye and why they are afraid of crows because that way it could have been more developed in terms of depth. The script, although not worthy of an Oscar, has its fun and moving parts, and should keep children and adults entertained. The voice acting for me was what the movie did. John Goodman, Martin Short, Rhea Perlman, Felicity Kendall and Yeardley Smith all had solid performances, but a special mention must be made to Kenneth Mars, as he was absolutely magnificent as Screweyes and almost unrecognizable. All in all, this is a good movie. I do not get the qualification, honestly no. Of course, this movie is not perfect, and it's not as good as a dinosaur movie like Land Before Time, but it's very funny. 7.5 / 10 Bethany Cox
