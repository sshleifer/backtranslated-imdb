Kureishi has not been blessed with movies that justify the quality of his writing. The recent adaptation of transvestites as 'Intimacy' has ruined a great script. But Mother surpasses all her previous incarnations, eclipsing even My Beautiful Laundrette. A middle-aged woman overcomes widowhood by having a very carnal relationship with her emotionally weak daughter's boyfriend. The fact that you create all this is a credit to the quality of the performance as it is to the finite gift of writing. And in Daniel Craig we have an abrupt, reckless and abrupt antihero who denies the audience questioning why a young stallion contemplated sleeping with a dejected grandmother. Beautifully shot, the film fails only in the weak representation of the peripheral characters, but as a study of inconceivable lust, it is a winner.
