Let's cut a long short story. I loved every minute of it. A luxurious fantasy in the true style of the Arabian nights. There is an evil wizard, a beautiful princess, a genius and they all live happily ever after. Hollywoond modern has one or two things to learn from this classic. Only one objection: the special effects are quite old-fashioned (although to Sabu with the foot of djinn!)
