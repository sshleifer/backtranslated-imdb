Every child has that movie that appears on VHS when it has nothing to do, or when there is a nanny around. This was the movie for me. <br /> <br /> I can tell you the whole plot exactly, I must have seen it 100 times at least, and I can say it's a good movie for children / families. <Br /> <br /> I still have the tape, I have not seen it in 5 years, but maybe I will do it this week and be a child for the day. <br /> <br /> You just have to love the care bears, and their message. <br /> <br />
