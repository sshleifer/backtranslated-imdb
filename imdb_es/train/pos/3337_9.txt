This is a great movie for true romantics and sports lovers. <br /> <br /> Drew Barrymore is at her best in this movie. As a fan of Drew, it was very nice to see her shine after having had several failures. I had my doubts about Jimmy Fallon, but he gave me totally like Ben, the comic and crazed love of sports. The comedy in this movie is great, there were several moments of laughter out loud. <br /> <br /> Her first date began in a difficult way when he appeared in her apartment with flowers and she was sick to her stomach for eating a new place. earlier in the day Instead of leaving, he helps take care of her, helps her change into pajamas and then cleans the vomit on the toilet and in the bathroom and then tells her that she was "very much like a lady ... without pieces". Everything is going well between Ben and Lindsay all winter, but then the baseball season starts. Lindsay begins to realize how obsessed Ben is with the Red Sox and why this apparently great guy is still single. She tries to shrug her shoulders and think it's a good thing, since she has a busy work schedule and will not feel guilty for working overtime while he's at the games. He even buys all the books on the Red Sox that he can find, including one on 'The Curse of Bambino'. <br /> <br /> Everything goes pretty well until Lindsay has a false alarm at having lost her period. Both make them realize how serious they are getting and she begins to wonder if this is the person she wants to be with. A very moving part of the movie is that, after she tells him she has the period, she shows him sadly keeping a Red Sox sweater the size of a baby she had bought in case she was pregnant. <br /> <br /> Eventually, Ben tries to show her how important she is and decides to go to her friends' birthday party after she says "I had to check my calendar and when I saw that there was a game of the Red Sox / Yankee, I knew I would go on a bachelor party. " After the party Ben tells him that it was "the best night of his life". Shortly after he received a call from his friend who went to the game, he gave up for the party and said "IT WAS THE BEST GAME OF EVERYONE !!!", Ben is scared. she missed it and ends up hurting Lindsay when she says "A few minutes ago you said that this was the best night of your life", she says "well, that was a few minutes ago". <br /> <br /> So they separate for a while, realize how immature their obsession is and decide to sell their season tickets that they inherited from their uncle because if he did not, he would. "Remind him too much of what he gave up for them." Lindsay discovers it through a friend and decides to stop him realizing that he is doing it for her. He ends up showing very sweetly how his childhood love for baseball has been overshadowed by a new and deeper love, Lindsay. They still attend the games and even attend the final game of the World Series and St. Louis, and it's a happy ending for everyone. 2 thumbs up !!
