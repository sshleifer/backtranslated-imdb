The cat and the mouse participate in the usual chases when Jerry dives into a bottle of invisible ink and discovers that it makes him disappear. Instead of taking the opportunity to spy on a girl who is changing the mouse or something, use her new invisibility to torment Tom. And it's quite funny and quite inventive despite being a caricature of a joke. And the action never leaves the interior of the house, which is usually the feature of the T & J shorts below average. It is still worth a 7/10. <br /> <br /> However, I'm not sure how an invisible mouse can cast a shadow on the wall, it defies physics and the very nature of being invisible in itself.
