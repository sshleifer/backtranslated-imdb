['The first time I saw the Walking Tall movies was when I was about 8 years old and I thought that both Joe Don Baker and Bo Svenson did a great job, they should have it anyway because since I saw the movies, I have tried to learn a lot about the true Sheriff. Buford Pusser as I can. The 3 parts of the movie gave me chills and Buford Pusser was a true hero, I just wish he was alive today and there were more people like him. I&#39;d love to thank you for getting rid of all the crime and being so brave. I am very sorry that your family had to go through so much horror and pain. My heart is with them. So from a 30-year-old fan of Sheriff Pusser and the three-part films of Walking Tall and the actors who played it, please, do not be negative about these films and actors, they just tried to let us know how wonderful man is . The real Buford Pusser was and what a great family he had. And to all the young people who may not have heard much about Buford, I suggest you watch the Walking Tall movies and learn more about him.']
