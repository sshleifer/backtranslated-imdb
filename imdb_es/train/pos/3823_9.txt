I saw this movie in the worst possible circumstance. I had already missed 15 minutes when I woke up on an international flight between Sydney and Seoul. I did not know what I was seeing, I thought maybe it was a movie of the week, but I was quickly captivated by the performance of the main actress playing a young girl who had kidnapped her son. The premise began to take twists and turns that I did not see coming and for the final credits I was reviewing the flight guide to discover what I had just seen. It turns out that I was belatedly discovering Do-yeon Jeon, who had won the Best Actress in Cannes for the role. I do not know if Secret Sunshine is typical of Korean cinema, but I go to the DVD store to find out more.
