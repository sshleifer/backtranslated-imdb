This is one of the very few movies that are very erotic without being pornographic, although there is only a very rudimentary plot. There is not much live sound or dialogue; instead, the actors make voiceovers that describe their experience, why they participated, etc. <br /> <br /> It is a document. <br /> <br /> It's amazing. <br /> <br /> I can totally understand why nobody else tried to do something like this. There is something like this already. Is. :-) <br /> <br /> NB: The producer does not have the rights to distribute a DVD version. I have also never seen it sold anywhere; one can send an email to Mr. Boerner and request a copy on VHS.
