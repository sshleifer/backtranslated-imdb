Yes, it's exaggerated, yes, it's a bit cliché and yes, Constance Marie is a total babe and is worth seeing again and again! The jokes and jokes can get old and repetitive after a while, but the show is still fun to watch. As it is a family show, the humor is toned down and the writers have incorporated family values ​​and ideals among the gags. <br /> <br /> George Lopez is fun. Do not take it seriously and the show is a winner. I'm sure he did not want his character to be serious or a paragon of virtues. His outbursts and shouts of joy are hilarious ... <br /> <br /> I have to say that the only big, dark and bitter point is Benny. I hate the character ... so much so that each time it's on for more than 30 seconds, I turn off the TV so I do not have to listen to it. There is nothing funny in their dialogue or their jokes. As a mother, she has to be the worst and I am surprised and surprised that George, as a character, supports such a deplorable person for so long. <br /> <br /> Even so, at any time, I am tempted. When I see Benny, I think to myself: seeing her is much better than having to watch Bill Engvall's show. Now there is a bad comedy ...
