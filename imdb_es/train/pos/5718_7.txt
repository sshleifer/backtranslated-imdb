I wanted to see Sarah Buffy on the big screen, so I first bought tickets and then reviewed the reviews on IMDb. I was worried about seeing a bad movie. Well, I had fun watching the movie. Some parts, which were obviously meant to be scary, were actually quite humorous, almost like Buffy the Vampire Slayer. <br /> <br /> I do not think this is a bad movie. It is not a great movie either. Only a horror movie quite well done. It does not depend very much on special effects, but on camera angles, acting, music. In my opinion, the performance was good. Sarah did a very good job, quite convincing. The other actors were definitely not bad either, I liked Yoko. <br /> <br /> The sets are nice (and I do not care that the sets are exactly the same as they were used in the Japanese original). <br /> <br /> The moments of fear were often predictable. But not always. I've seen enough horror, and I did not expect to be scared now, but it happened at least twice. Nice. <br /> <br /> The film had some nice scenes that were almost original, like garbage traces, simple special effects for ghosts, the eyes of the child, the cat making noises, the gurgling. of the dead child and his mother. <br /> <br /> Do not go if you want to see Sarah in another episode of Buffy, because it's very different from her Buffy work, much more serious. Do not go if you just want to see films that collect Oscar nominations. It's a good horror movie, quite suspenseful. I gave him a 7.
