Who can watch a movie, look at Lucy Liu and not be very happy. That woman is incredibly beautiful and a talented actress. That is a difficult combination to find today. And Jeremy Northam. I heard his name many times, but I never noticed it. My advice to Hollywood is: "use it more". <br /> <br /> now about the movie: I saw him in one of my graveyard shifts. I do not recommend it to anyone. It's a bit complicated and mysterious for that. I still can not believe I did not see the end coming. I will not say what cause will ruin the movie. although to say that this is a sufficient waste. <br /> <br /> Now I guess I should cast my vote on this movie. I love dark mystical history, the actors did a good job and I love the work of the directors (natali) in the past. There is not a large audience for this kind of thing, that is also quite risky. You know what, I'm just going to give this job an 8 because everyone should see this. Then, again, the deduction of 1 point because there is always room to improve.
