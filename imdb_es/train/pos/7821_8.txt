Very rarely, Denzil Washington makes a bad movie and I think of it for Kevin Kline and, in this case, it must be one of his best films. It is more about a film about how strong friendship can more than the story of Steve Biko, although we do have an idea of ​​what the man was like and how far the reporter and friend Donald Woods came to preserve the man's name and let him know world. what rotten, rotten society was South Africa. The direction is outstanding of David Attenborough, as it was for Gandhi, although if there is some kind of criticism that can be pointed out, it could be throughout the film. Two and a half hours is a long time to sit through a historical movie. What is amazing is how he manages to control all the extras. Thousands of people in both films. This movie really opens your eyes to what happened before the breakup of Aparthiet and you can not help but be moved. 8 out of 10.
