['George Lopez never caught my interest in his comedy and he still does not. But this show is a work of art. It never shows where the jokes make you laugh every time you remember (and the jokes are memorable). This show has an optimistic look and the characters range from an old drunk to a dyslexic teenager. I do not know who writes this program, but that person does a great job. If you had continued with the program, I am sure you would get a positive response from the critics of this great country. If you are looking for a good traditional comedy, George Lopez is the show for you! The only bad thing is the title. George Lopez? Really? Imagine that the Prince of Bel-Air is &quot;Will Smith&quot;. Come on man! But for the rest, this show is genius! 10/10']
