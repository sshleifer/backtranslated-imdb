I just love this movie. It is a perfect example of the complete and amazing stories that emerge from Asian cinema. There was a recent Hollywood remake of this movie, with Richard Gere and the simply awful Jennifer Lopez. Please do not confuse the two movies. The original Japanese movie is moving, subtle and beautifully acted. The Hollywood version is the exact opposite. I was horrified when I saw for the first time the trailer of the remade version of the United States and who was starring. It is the typical rude commercialism not original Hollywood at its worst. The remake builds the argument that some foreign films can never be improved. The ONLY reason why the original movie was not seen more broadly is the American public's aversion to subtitles. <br /> <br /> One of the main reasons why this film would never work in an American narrative is that the conservative, ultra-conservative socially. The character of the Japanese public person is under discussion in this film. Certainly, the main character awakens to a more complete understanding of living a lively life through dance, but half the tension in the film stems from the stereotypes and ridicule that dance hall dancers face in Japan. <br /> <br /> Please try to watch this movie In its original form, not the terrible full screen. And, please, skip the remake of EE. UU ... is a superficial parody compared to the original Japanese movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, I know that the "original" movie is much older, and this is simply a Japanese take on the story, but the only two people who will probably see it soon are this and the new US version . <br /> <br /> Speaking of foreign films, I will make some quick recommendations: 1. Monz√≥n Wedding-I mention this first for a reason, outstanding film! 2.Johnny Stechino -Funny identity Italian fun and funny! 3.Shiri-A Korean action image that mixes Asian style and American-style plot 4. Run Lola Run-A German film that cleverly integrates your techno score. <br /> <br /> Well, just a quick list anyway:)
