The movie Freddy's Death, the final nightmare is as horrifying and disturbing as any other Nightmare on Elm Street, yes, it has a comedy essence, all the other movies, but how can anyone say that you will not find Freddy Krueger? fear, if you met this man in your dreams, you would not find it even more scary with a comic essence about him because his comedy shows that he does not care at all to kill you, that he finds it extremely funny, and Freddy also plays comic mind games with They, who in their own way are very disturbing, by using their comic forms, I think they make horror films Nightmare on elm street what they are today. The writers are extremely intelligent making Krueger funny and terrifying as opposed to Jason Vorhees, who says nothing and does not have the wit to really scare his victims, this film is as good as Freddy's and I would recommend it to anyone with a sense of humor and the way "Do not fall asleep!"
