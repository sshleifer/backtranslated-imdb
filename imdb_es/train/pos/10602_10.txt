I have to say that I loved the movie. He had his funny moments, some moving parts, all good. Personally, I really liked the movie because it is something that I can finally relate to my childhood. This film, in my opinion, is more oriented towards the young gay population. It shows how a gay youth would be treated while growing up. All teasing, insults and not knowing is something that, like most other young women, I will always remember, and now, finally, a movie that illustrates how difficult it is to really grow up as gay. Therefore, I would definitely recommend watching this movie. You probably should not really see it until a person is old enough and mature enough to understand it.
