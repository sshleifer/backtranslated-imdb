Day zero is based on the columbine high school massacre. and it's a daily video of two children. At the beginning you do not know what will happen, you think it's just a bad movie for students. until they start talking about the horrible things they're going to do in this school. until they start talking about cannon bombs and weapons and they're going to shoot in the woods. There is a lot to say about this movie. We all know that this movie is good. A movie that you forget when you watch a movie and when you watch a real video made by two guys. <br /> <br /> The two guys act like they're in a strange cult. They burn everything there is. like play station games books dvds school homework school stuff. These two guys can be anyone, your friends, your brothers or the people you see walking down the street. Go through there. Daily assets (and that's making a weapon.) In the videos they make, mention the harassment that happens to them and how people say things about clothes and things that you like, I'm not saying it's okay, but many. people do things like that. <br /> <br /> and it's also suspected that people like this because of the sensitive subject they chose in this movie. <br /> <br /> so that's my review in the zero day. <br /> <br /> and let's say that the final shooting scene is in poor condition.
