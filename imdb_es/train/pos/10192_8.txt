This is the Who in its most powerful form. Although before the masterpiece Who's Next, it would provide hymns such as Baba O'reily and Wont Get Fooled Again. This film shows the group in transition from mod rockers to one of the biggest live bands of the 70s. <br /> <br /> Daltrey shows what it is about being a leader, Entwistle stable as always. <br /> <br /> Moon is great, take a look at the ongoing conversation with battery technology, and watch it play "the side of the seat" while replacing the head of a drum. <br /> <br /> Townsend even seems to be having fun every once in a while! <br /> <br /> Considering that they took the stage at 2 a.m., no one in the crowd was asleep! <br /> <br /> There are not many bands these days that can produce a set as tight as this one and it's hard to imagine any of today's bands that produce a concert that in 36 years will be enjoyed as much as this one.
