This exciting story of intergenerational love, jealousy and revenge was even more pleasing to watch on DVD years after its transmission on PBS, with a sharper image and a clearer sound. My only reservations are that the plot has some unlikely moments and that some of the strongest Manchester accents are difficult at times. Luckily, even losing a word here and there will not ruin the fun: the main actors are ideally trained. Robson Green brings an enigmatic smile, an irresistible temperament and an athletic physique to his role as a young surgeon who falls in love with his boss's wife at the hospital where he has just started working. Francesca Annis is one of the most surprising 50-year-old women you can imagine; His performance rivals his beauty. (The scenes of love between these two show better than words how little they care about the difference in age!) Each of the supporting characters is clearly drawn and is also excellently represented. The mixture of concise dialogue and passionate excess makes this a charming miniseries. As Russell Baker points out in his introduction, he may not have improved morally when he saw "Reckless", but he will have a lot of fun. (The sequel, which is part of the DVD set, offers an outcome of two hours, but at the same time satisfactory, you will not want to miss it if you have enjoyed what came before).
