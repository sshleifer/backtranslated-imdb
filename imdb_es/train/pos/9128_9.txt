I must admit that Purple Rain is one of my deepest guilty pleasures. Purple Rain not only broke boundaries, established a decade, costumes, music, behavior and dance! To this day, my friends and I continue to play the soundtrack of Purple Rain and pretend to be the Prince and the Revolution. <br /> <br /> Now, the movie itself, I just wanted to say what I said in the title, because for the most part, this movie itself is made by music. The acting? Please, do not let me judge for that, since this is one of my favorite guilty pleasures, because I know it was not worthy of Oscar in any way. But I think the duo that took this movie was Morris and Jarome, his speech about passwords was more than hilarious. I just want to rate this movie in the concert sequences because I felt that was what the movie did. <br /> <br /> Prince is a musical genius and created beautiful music. While the movie and the acting are pretty bad, this movie is still fun to watch at night and even dance. This movie defined the 80s, so have fun. Prince would want it that way, just to party! Oh, boy, that sounded lame. <br /> <br /> 9/10
