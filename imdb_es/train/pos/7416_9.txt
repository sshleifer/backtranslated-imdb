['This film moves without being sentimental, meaningful without being pretentious. It tells a simple story of a family in danger of falling apart, as the invasions of technology and an advancing society make the family business increasingly unsustainable. <br /><br /> The performance is wonderful, although it is likely that none of us in the west have heard of these actors, we should have done it a long time ago, they interpret their characters with honesty and respect, they are defective characters, each with great weaknesses, but with so much clarity Humanity and the kindness that it is impossible not to get involved in history. <br /><br /> We need more films like this, we need more western filmmakers who create films like this.']
