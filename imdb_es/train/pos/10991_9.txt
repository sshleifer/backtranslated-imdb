Cypher is a movie that is worth seeing, because it is not the traditional science fiction movie. The artistic approach is painted with dark scenes and a kind of macro view of what is happening. The close-up view of the camera is how the director maintains the illusory plot. The science fiction aspect of the film is secondary to the plot of the film. The technology used in the film is not too impressive, however, the director makes good use of the accessories. <br /> <br /> The development of the character is intentionally superficial. The main character, Jeremy Northam, decides to immerse himself in the world of espionage. It is up to the audience to discover its enigmatic character and it is the enigma that keeps the audience interested until the end.
