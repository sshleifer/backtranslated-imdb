Castle in the sky is undoubtedly a film by Hayao Miyazaki. After seeing it for the first time I am happy to say that it does not disappoint. On the contrary, you get the value of your time, which means (as far as Miyazaki's movies are concerned), that's nothing less than excellent! <br /> <br /> Produced at the beginning of his film career, Castle in the Sky anticipates many of the trademarks in his later films, with strong (but young) female characters, forced to grow due to external circumstances, aided by Very interesting (and sometimes adorable) support characters. And, of course, the usual battle of nature against civilization, the flying machines (lots of them!), Beautiful painted landscapes? but, unfortunately, there are no pigs (at least that's what I've noticed, after all, I've only seen it once). However, Miyazaki had already had his theatrical debut two years earlier, with Nausic√£a, which was a dress rehearsal for Princess Mononoke, his masterpiece. Castle in the Sky is a bit apart from these two, with a smooth action filled with first 30 minutes, similar to his television series Conan, and his directed episodes of Meitantei Holmes. Here we are introduced to Sheeta, a girl who literally falls from the sky, and only Pazu finds her, a young man who works in a small rural mining town. Intrigued by her amnesia and suspecting a connection between her and the mysterious flying city of Laputa, Pazu is willing to help her discover where she is coming from, while escaping from the army and a gang of aerial pirates. As the film progresses, the plot becomes heavier and much more interesting, revealing Myiazaki at his best. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is very reminiscent of Spirited Away (or vice versa, since Castle in the sky came first), and like its director, Joe Hisaishi _the composer- starts with a very smooth score! This becomes more complex and beautiful as the plot progresses! <br /> <br /> A note in English dubbing, with a good interpretation of the two main stars, although Sheeta by Anna Paquin has a very thick accent (which the actress still had at that moment in her career), and One addresses Mark Hamil as Muska, compensates a charming but devilish villain! <br /> <br /> Do not miss these people!
