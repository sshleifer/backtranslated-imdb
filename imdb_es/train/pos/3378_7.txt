['This movie came to me highly recommended by Matt Groening. Well, actually I saw the Simpsons and Futurama and it is mentioned in both, so I thought &quot;what the hell&quot;. The film brings home some &quot;what if&quot; that make you realize how lucky we are in this time when we take for granted simple things like soap and water. Although it is interesting that in the year 2022 men still shave with a single-blade safety blade! It&#39;s nice that those responsible have not overloaded the film with unnecessary special effects, lightning guns, etc. Some attractive &#39;furniture&#39; once you discover what that means. Remember, &quot;Tuesday is the day of Soylent Green&quot;']
