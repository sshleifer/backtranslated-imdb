['The first time I saw this movie at a festival. There were many good movies, but few made me think much about that much later, and An Insomniac&#39;s Nightmare was definitely one of them. Tess is definitely a talented filmmaker. The shots were great. The casting was perfect. Dominic shone in her role that she did perfectly. There was not much to know about her character, but she wrote the story in such a way that we cared about him. And Ellen ... I can not wait to see where it ends! She is showing a lot of talent and I hope she makes some more movies. With all the budgets of a million dollars trying to get a cheap emotion, Tess proves that it is not necessary, as long as there is a good story and actors. Congratulations to everyone involved in this movie. And thanks to Tess and co. To distribute it on DVD!']
