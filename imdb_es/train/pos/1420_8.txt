In celebration of Earth Day Disney has released the movie "Earth". Stopping very far from any shrill message of pessimism and sadness, they invite us to some excellent images of animals in their habitats without feeling so badly for ourselves. <br /> <br /> The stars of the show are a herd of elephants, a family of polar bears and a whale and its young. The narrative begins at the North Pole and moves south until we reach the tropics, while the inhabitants of the different climatic zones traversed are presented. <br /> <br /> Global warming is mentioned while we observe the poles' digressions. bear; The decrease in sea ice islands in recent years is noted. We never see bears catch any seals, but the father's desperate search for food leads him to a dangerous solution. <br /> <br /> Caribou aerial shots migrating through the tundra is one of the most spectacular wildlife shots I've seen. Mountain range; One and the other of the wild birds that migrate are enough to reward the price of the entrance to see them on the big screen. <br /> <br /> One of the disappointments I felt was that, otherwise, fabulous shots of great white sharks that capture seals in slow motion were filmed. You never realize a characteristic of wild animals; Its incredible speed. The idea of ​​reducing the speed of the film to transmit a great speed with which I started (or at least it is the first time I remember seeing) the television program "Kung Fu" in the early seventies. <br /> <br /> An interesting side light is that as the credits accumulate during the finale some demonstrations of the cinematographic techniques employed are revealed. There are enough dramatic, humorous and instructive moments in this film to be a solid choice for nature lovers. Perhaps due to a selective edition (avoiding, as it were, the eerie end of a predator-prey moment) and the fact that this recording was published in 2007 and available on DVD, is a solid film in its own right. . And you can take your children! <br /> <br /> Three stars.
