I see many really negative messages from people who wrote in August, although the film did not premiere in the United States, at least, until mid-September. Maybe these are unhappy expats who live in South Korea who saw him early. I'm in the United States and I just saw him today. I thought the special effects were excellent, better than the trailer. The story was not Western, but I think we're all used to this from many other movies. It was not at all difficult to follow. The performance of the drivers was weak, but other people were quite good. There was humor in everything, too. I rated it with 8 because I had a great time watching it, which is what I was looking for.
