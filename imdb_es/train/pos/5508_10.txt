The year is 1964. Ernesto "Che" Guevara, who has been a Cuban citizen for the last five years, disappears from the face of the Earth, leaving a desolate Fidel Castro to announce that he is probably dead, when in truth he has left. Cuba moves to Bolivia to live a supposed identity. While living in La Paz, Guevara undertakes an idea to overthrow the corrupt and bourgeois government there. Once again, Steven Soderberg takes the place where 'Che: Part One' ends (only better this time). The pace is more appropriate, the acting work is very good (including the turn of Benecio Del Toro, like Che Guevara). Suffice it to say that it is probably better if you watch both films, to know the real story of Guevara and what kind of man he was (I had the rare opportunity to see both films in a single projection ---- talk about a long journey!) . As with 'Che-Part 1: The Argentine', this movie does not have a MPAA rating, but contains enough salty language and violence to easily engage with an 'R'.
