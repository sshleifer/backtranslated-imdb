Undoubtedly, 12 MONKEYS is one of the best films in the science fiction genre and director Terry Gilliam is no stranger to achieving such cinematic originality. An apocalyptic film that keeps you completely fascinated, 12 MONKEYS never gives up and makes you guess all the way. The excellent use of Philadelphia locations and underworld scenes creates a gothic sense of tragedy and two people caught in time in the wrong place. <br /> <br /> Bruce Willis escapes his macho image and portrays a true madman who is right. everything that happens He is really sane, but the people of the future (or present, if he wishes) distorts the head of this guy so badly through time travel, it is not surprising that he untangles himself. They send him to World War I right after they send him to the wrong year to discover how the Army of the Twelve Monkeys achieves the annihilation of civilization as we know it. Finally they understand it well and in what is truly an extraordinary script to match the performance, we can see Willis, Madeleine Stowe and an ominous Brad Pitt with cross references in the course of 6 years. <br /> <br /> Stowe is sensual and solid as the person who risks the person taking the risk, slowly begins to realize that Willis may not be as cracked as he seems. A captivating element of the relationship between her and Willis is their sense of "seeing" each other before, in another place or time. 12 MONKEYS is essentially about the time and the madness in which the futurists and the times of the present are submerged, when the murderers and a psychotic genius can alter the world. <br /> <br /> Philadelphia's burgeoning city is a dark city and gothic backdrop to Willis' plight to complete his mission which is, against all the usual stereotypes of Hollywood, NOT saving the world. He is gathering information. The film also plays tricks on the viewer, placing Willis in a new configuration in the fall of a pin. This must have been an extremely difficult image to make, but Gilliam seems to be the master of creating hard movies. He even falls into a mood that is reminiscent of other great works such as TIME BANDITS and BRAZIL. The screen is the canvas of this man and he knows how to paint a sometimes terrifying image of the world and its possible future within the general atmosphere of big-budget films. If you want sincere madness and ironic tragedy, see 12 MONKEYS. <br /> <br /> RATING: 9 out of 10
