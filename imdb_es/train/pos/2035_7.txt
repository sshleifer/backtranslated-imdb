Well, I'll go against the grain in this movie so it seems. Being a fanatic of confessed terror, I sat down to this without really knowing what to expect. After 2 or 3 minutes I actually found myself scared (quite weird). The film obviously has a small budget and is around Charing Cross Station, but the lack of money from the films does not distract from the story. Yes, the story is a bit exaggerated and it is not explained very well, but THE CREEP is an act of class and proceeds to cut and dismember everything that comes your way. MESSAGE FOR LADIES !!! THERE ARE CERTAIN PARTS OF THE MOVIE THAT YOU MUST CLOSE YOUR EYES OR AT LEAST CROSS YOUR LEGS! You will understand when you see it. <br /> <br /> In general, a good movie and it's a change to see a good Slasher movie that really scares
