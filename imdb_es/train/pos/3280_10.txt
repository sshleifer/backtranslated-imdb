['I&#39;ve only seen this movie once before, about ten years ago. I bought the DVD two days ago and after seeing it I think it&#39;s even better than I remembered. <br /><br /> Paperhouse is much more than a simple horror. He had an incredible level of emotion and a great characterization. Especially I thought Charlotte Burke was really excellent here. It&#39;s a shame she did not do anything else, since she was an excellent actress. His representation of the emotion throughout the film was perfect with the amount of subtlety appropriate to convey the message, especially at the end when he realized that, although Marc had died, he knew he would be fine. <br /><br /> Several scenes made me jump (which is a rarity for me in modern horror films), especially the scene in the bathtub, the scene in which Anna&#39;s father chased after her with the strange radio in the background and the part where the legs broke. and it crumbled to dust. <br /><br /> In short, an excellent and very moving movie.']
