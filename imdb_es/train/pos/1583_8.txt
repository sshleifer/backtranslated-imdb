['It always amazes me how many times you&#39;ll see something about World War II on German national television. One would think that they do not like to open old wounds, but not a week goes by without a documentary or a film about the horror and atrocities of this war. Maybe it&#39;s a way of dealing with your past, I do not know, but I&#39;m sure you can not blame them for ignoring what happened. And it has to be said: most of these documentaries are really worth seeing because they never try to ignore the truth and the same can be said about their films (think, for example, in &quot;Der Untergang&quot; or &quot;The Downfall&quot; as you Now it could be) that are also very realistic. <br /><br /> One of those films is &quot;Rosenstrasse&quot;. It tells a true story and addresses the issue of mixed marriages during the war, although the film begins with a family in the United States, today. After Hannah&#39;s father died, his mother suddenly became an Orthodox Jew although she had not been very religious before. She does not know where her mother&#39;s strange behavior comes from, but as she begins to dig into her mother&#39;s troubled childhood, Hannah understands how little she has known about her mother&#39;s past. <br /><br /> The fact that this film deals with the issue of mixed marriages during the Nazi regime is already quite surprising. As far as I know, there has not been another film that deals with this subject. (For those who still did not know: being married to a man or woman called pure Aryian meant for many Jews that they were not sent immediately to one of the concentration camps, but they had to work in a factory). But not only does it say something about the problems of mixed marriages, but it also gives a good idea of how these people were often seen by their own parents and family members. How difficult it was sometimes for them during the Nazi regime and how these people, most of the time women, did everything possible to free their men, once they were captured and locked in Rosenstrasse, for example ... <br /><br /> The acting is really good and the story is very well written, although the way it was presented at the beginning did not do it for me (and that&#39;s exactly the only part you&#39;ll see in the trailer). Maybe it&#39;s just me, but I would have left a large part of what happens today. At least the part that is in the United States, because the part where Hannah goes to Berlin and talks to someone who knows more about her mother&#39;s past, definitely works. <br /><br /> If you are interested in everything that has to do with World War II, and if you are not necessarily looking for a lot of action shots, then this is definitely a movie you should see. This is not a movie in which you will see battles or shootings, but it is certainly an interesting film, because it gives you an idea about an aspect of the war that only little is known about. I give it an 8/10.']
