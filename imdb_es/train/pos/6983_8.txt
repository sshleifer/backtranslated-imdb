I loved it, having been a fan of the original series, I've always wondered what the background story would be, it did not stop me from delighting. I also love the fact that, apart from Eric Stoltz, I did not recognize a person, this is refreshing, like BSG. It has introduced me to a lot of new talents, I can not wait for the series to begin to air. Well done to Ronald D. Moore and the team - excellent work. The special effects, the dialogue and the acting were all successful, and I felt emotionally tied in the story. I know there are purists out there who probably do not agree with my evaluation, but I felt that Caprica was far superior to most of the science fiction things produced in the last decade.
