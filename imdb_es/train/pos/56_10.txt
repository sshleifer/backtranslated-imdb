This is one of the most incredible stories I've seen. <br /> <br /> If this movie had been directed by Larry Clark, then this story about a shooting in a school probably would have shown through the eyes of the murderer and everything that led that person to go crazy in first place. br /> <br /> Instead, the plot focuses mainly on the consequences of a shooting in a school, and how it affected the victims who survived. <br /> <br /> I had seen Busy Phillips in other movies before, but she The performance in this movie is by far her best. The only other film I've seen with Erika Christensen is "Swim Fan" that made me almost not want to see this movie, but she also had a very good performance. <br /> <br /> This is one of the few movies I've seen that actually were able to make me cry. Trust me when I tell you that does not happen very often. <br /> <br /> Home Room is a beautiful movie, and that's all there is ...
