Cary Grant and Myrna Loy are perfectly chosen as a middle class couple who want to build the house of their dreams. It all starts with reasonable plans and expectations, which are shattered by innumerable complications and an explosion of the original budget. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of great laughs (even if the story is a bit thin) Make sure you entertain the fanatics of the stars or the Hollywood comedy style of the late 1940s. A definitive highlight occurs when a contractor goes through a reduction of all expenses, which must have sounded too much for a 1948 hearing. As he makes his exit, he assures the client (Grant) that he might be able to achieve a reduction of $ 100.00 of the total ... or at least $ 50.00 ... but certainly $ 25.00. Fun!
