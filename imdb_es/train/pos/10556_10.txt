I was not sure what to expect, but I'm glad I went to see this. An intelligent, slightly twisted comedy that makes you think. I was not sure how a director can create "nothing", but leave it to Mr. Natali and the brilliant individuals of C.O.R.E. to create another low-budget set that looks real (as real as nothing can be). Well worth your time and money, if you have the opportunity to see this, please go. You'll be glad you did it.
