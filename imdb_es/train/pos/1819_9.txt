When I first saw it, we borrowed it from our local library about a year ago and saw it about 3 times. We've seen it again and I liked MORE than I did the last time I saw it! :) :() <br /> <br /> The film is mainly about two dogs called Charlie and Itchy (voiced by Dom DeLuise and I love Dom DeLuise!). Charlie is half a gangster and half a good meal, which I like. Itchy is your partner. Charlie is killed by his friend (NO) and sent to heaven. When Charlie comes back to life, it is the beginning of an incredible adventure. <br /> <br /> The five main reasons why I am absolutely CRAZY about this movie: One: I love the characters (except Carface). My three favorites are Charlie, Itchy and a girl named Anne-Marie who comes a little later. Two: I love the period of the story in which this movie takes place. It is established during the prohibition in the United States. Three: The animation of Don Bluth (as always) is excellent. The funds are good too. Four: There is a strange emotion in this movie that keeps me on the edge of my seat. Five: The songs on this are lovely. My favorite song begins with "I need Brazil, the heartbeat, the emotion" ... <br /> <br /> So, look at this beautiful movie when you can, you will not be disappointed! :);) :()
