Stargate SG-1 is a spin off from the 1994 movie "Stargate". I am so happy that you decided to expand the subject. The program begins to roll from the first episode, a retired Jack O'Neill has to go through the door one more time to meet his old partner, Dr. Daniel Jackson. Through the first two episodes, we meet Samantha Carter, a very intelligent person who does not allow anyone to walk her, and there is Teal'c, a calm and compassionate warrior who challenges his false god and joins the team. <br /> <br /> The main bad ones are called Gouald, they are parasites that can be inserted in the brain, control them and do evil acts. Any Gouald who has a huge amount of power is often considered a "Lord of the system". The warriors behind the Gouald are called Jaffa, who harbor the parasitic Gouald on their bodies until the Gouald can be inserted into a person's brain. <br /> <br /> Through the episodes, we almost always see the SG-1, the exploratory team consisting of Jack / Daniel / Teal'c / and Sam, traversing the wormhole that instantly transports them to others planets (this device is called Stargate) and they encounter new or bad cultures. Some episodes are in the world, which means they do not go through the Stargate once in the episode and rather deal with the most serious problems on Earth. <br /> <br /> Over the years, you start to see a decrease in the SG -1 team so united, and more story lines of character building. This, in turn, means even more episodes in the world, which is perfectly understandable. <br /> <br /> My rating: 8.75 / 10 ---- Although most of this show is good, there are some examples of narrated stories. It is not always getting involved and less emphasis on door trips in recent years. But still, the first-rate science fiction!
