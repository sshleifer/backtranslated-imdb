'Cry Freedom' is a film about how far people will go to find the truth. <br /> <br /> The first half is an interesting portrait of an unlikely friendship between activist Steve Biko and editor Don Woods (played fanatically by Dezel Washington and Kevin Klein). While the second half deals with Woods in search of answers about Biko's death. <br /> <br /> Although most people favor the first half of the film, which focuses on the unlikely friendship between Biko and Woods. I found that the second half about Don Woods' struggle to make Biko's story heard all over the world is much more interesting.
