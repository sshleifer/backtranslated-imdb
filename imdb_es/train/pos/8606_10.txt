There seems to be no middle ground in this movie! Most of it takes place in a dream and, like most dreams, it is often silly and illogical. It is also a magnificent production with some great songs and excellent performances, especially by our angel. <br /> <br /> Jeanette's madness, the unknown insults and several other false steps in the reception of the dream are hilarious, and her jitterbug with Binnie Barnes is a surprise and a delight. At one point, she sings a fragment of Carmen, followed by Faust's final trio (holding a lap dog, for some strange reason), then "Aloha Oe" on the beach. <br /> <br /> It's a surreal comedy, tremendously entertaining if you can get into the rhythm.
