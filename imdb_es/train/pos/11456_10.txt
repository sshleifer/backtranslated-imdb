Andy Goldsworthy is a Taoist teacher of the first order, who expresses the Way through his sublime ephemeral art. In fact, time and change is what his work is fundamentally about. I bought his first book several years ago and my family has marveled many times. So it was a pleasure to meet the artist personally through this film, he is as patient and kind as you would expect, and he has some wonderful things to say about the natural world, the deepest of which is expressed in his occasional inability. to say it in words at all. It's like most children playing alone outdoors (if they do), creating things from sticks, sand, mud and snow before they grow up. Mr. Goldsworthy was given the gift and the mission to extend that kind of game to create deep visions of nature, and to open our eyes often tired of new and brilliant forms. And always with the greatest respect, gratitude and humor of a wandering and perplexing monk.
