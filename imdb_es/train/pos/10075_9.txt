['&quot;Masks&quot; is a movie in motion that works on many levels. In its simplest form, it is the unsettling story of a street artist who is linked to a young child while trying to convey his creative art (masks) to the next generation. Although, sometimes, the story turns the old man into a job, is so well designed (written, acted, directed, wonderful production values), it is easy to go beyond his difficult situation. And, if you keep that, the movie is, ultimately, very sweet and uplifting. Congratulations to all. This is a wonderful movie for children and adults. The trick is how to make Americans who do not like movies in foreign languages see it!']
