The closest I got to seeing this was a clip that was shown at an exhibition by Gerard Philippe in Paris about two years ago. I was not interested in the remake and, just after having made the original version just over half a century after it was made, I can only conclude that the inept fence was intentional, aimed at an obsolete goal. Hollywood had been fighting with realistic swords since the 1930s, when the greatest of all, Basil Rathbone, crossed his foils with Errol Flynn and others, so the technique was available and only left satire. After a while, you do not notice and you delight in the dialogue of Henri Jeanson that reminds the Prisoner of Zenda, both versions. Gerard Philippe certainly had the presence to achieve a role like this and Gina Lollabrigida was probably a little better than Martine Carol, the other obvious candidate at that time. The impression I saw was particularly bad and, at one point, broke completely, so maybe a DVD version would improve it.
