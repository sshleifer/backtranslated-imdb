While I was in the video store, I was flipping through the rents for a dollar and found this little gem. I do not know what it was about, but I had an instinctive instinct about it and, wow, I was once right. <br /> <br /> The story centers on two girls who have just survived a school shooting. One of the girls is Alicia, a teenager who is the only witness to the full attack and another is Deanna, another survivor who survived a bullet in the head by some miracle. Thrown together by destiny, they slowly begin to show a painful and beautiful healing sign and move on. <br /> <br /> I just hate when amazing movies fall through the cracks. Because wow, what a performance by Busy Phillips and Erkia Christensen without mentioning the rest of the cast! My only complaint is that the DVD lacked special features. Oh, and some of the jump cuts in the movie were a bit discordant. But ultimately an excellent movie.
