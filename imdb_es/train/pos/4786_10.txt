The Straight Story is the story of an old man who decides to visit his sick brother who lives on the state border. He decides to take the trip on his lawn mower because he can not drive and he wants to make the rip on his own. The film beautifully describes his journey and the lives he touches along the way. <br /> <br /> Richard Farnsworth presents a beautiful performance like the rest of the cast, especially Sissy Spacek in a endearing performance as his daughter, and Harry Dean Stanton in a small but infinitely crucial role. <br /> <br /> At first I felt that the story of an old journey through the countryside would be boring, but I soon discovered that Lynch, with all the ideas about the life of man, makes this a film that I would recommend to anyone.
