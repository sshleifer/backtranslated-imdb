When I saw this animation for the first time (maybe I was 15 years old) I was very impressed! It has a completely different style compared to the Japanese animation and I like it better. The whole impression of the film is more sinister and dark ... The colors are not so ... colorful. The characters do not talk much, there are no long and boring conversations of this and that (as in Ghost in the Shell). With its dark images, views of strange beasts and a sense of magic, it looks like one of those ancient Scandinavians. Stories full of violent and horrendous creators, enchanted forests and deep caves, inhabited by dragons, thunder, orcs ... and a mysterious hero to stop evil ...
