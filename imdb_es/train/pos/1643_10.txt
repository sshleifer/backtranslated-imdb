This is a movie that everyone should see if they want to see a great performance. Mr. Torn and Mrs. Farrel do an outstanding job. I think they should have it on TV again so that a new audience can enjoy it. Wonderful performances <br /> <br /> It gives you a real sense of what the pioneers had to go through, both physically and emotionally. Great movie unprecedented. <br /> <br /> It was done when Mrs. Farrel was very young. I had always thought of her as a comedian, but this is certainly not a comedy and it's just wonderful. There are very few dialogues, but that makes it seem more real. Mr. Torn as always is a great presence and only his breathing has a great feeling. I must see the movie.
