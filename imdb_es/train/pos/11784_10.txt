As has been well documented by previous posters, the real stars of Rockstar: INXS, and in fact is the sequel to Rockstar: Supernova, are Paul Mirkovich, Rafael Moreira, Jim McGorman, Nate Morton and Sasha Krivtsov. Do not you know who they are? They are the band of the impressive, tight and rockin 'band, whose skill and musical talent made of this show something more than a sad clone of American Idol. <br /> <br /> Do you remember the night of "strings"? That was the precision and musical perfection if I've ever seen it. Suzie McNeil's epic interpretation of Queen's "Bohemian Rhapsody", Ty Taylor's memorable cover of "The ones you can not get forever" from the Stones, JD Fortune sings "Suspicious Minds." The common denominator here is the impressive House Band. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that INXS was at its best, sadly they are a shadow of what they were before, although the live performance of JD has given a little life to their music. This show is all about the HB. <br /> <br /> Note to the producers: The third season (if we are lucky enough to make it happen) should be Rockstar: House Band. Get those guys a good singer and go to places.
