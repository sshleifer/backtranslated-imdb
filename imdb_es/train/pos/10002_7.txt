This is easily the most underrated cinematographic inn of the Brooks canyon. Sure, it's defective. It does not give a realistic view of homelessness (unlike, say, how Citizen Kane gave a realistic view of lounge singers, or Titanic gave a realistic view of Italians that IDIOTS). Many of the jokes fall badly. But still, this movie is very kind in a way that many comedies are not, and to achieve that in a story about some of the most vilified members of society is really impressive. He is not the king fisherman, but he is not shit either. My only complaint is that Brooks should have put someone else in the lead (I love Mel as director and writer, not as much as a leader).
