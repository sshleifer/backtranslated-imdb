After Dark, My Sweet is a great modern noir, full of sordid characters, dirt roads and, of course, sweaty characters. It seems that most of the great events of the last two or three decades have taken place in the south, where men shine and ladies, um, also shine. Why? Because it's hooooottttttttttt. And because they all look better wet (at least men do, sweaty women leave me sticky). <br /> <br /> Anyway, there might be some spoilers here. <br /> <br /> This movie is a wonderful example of everything a noir should be: constant rhythm (although some with attention disorders refer to it as 'slow'), characters clearly drawn (though not simple) , and tons of atmosphere. Noir, in any case, is about moods and attitudes. That's why the greats are not marked by your traditional definitions of 'great' acting (look at Bogart, Mitchum, Hurt and Nicholson, they (and their characters) were all but real, but they had style and impudence and they were in a crime movie that is exactly what you want). or fast-paced adventures (again, all great noirs seem to burn slowly like a cigarette). The great noirs create an environment and simply inhabit it with the characters for a couple of hours. <br /> <br /> After Dark My Sweet allows you to do that, and allows you to enjoy the company of some very interesting and complex characters. Uncle Bud and Collie are intriguing: they never let the audience know what really motivates them, and Patric and Dern (by the way, I love Bruce Dern) are perfect, especially Dern (see previous comment). They take the basic profiles of a character and give them depth and evoke our sympathies. <br /> <br /> The story itself is also interesting. There are better plots in the world of noir (here there is no mystery, mainly suspense), but this is solid. In any case, the plot simply "well" has more to do with the writing of Jim Thompson than with anything else. With Thompson, the plots are almost secondary; he avoided the labyrinthine tales of Hammett and Chandler by simpler stories with stronger and more confused characters. Watch a novel like The Killer Inside Me and you will see immediately (of the title) what it is about. When it comes to Thompson, it's not about that, it's about how it's about (to quote Roger Ebert). So, really, the relatively simple plot of a kidnapping is not the point and, if you do not like it, the jokes are good. <br /> <br /> The reason why this is an 8-star movie instead of a 10-star movie is because of the female lead. She's not bad, per se, but it's not Angelica Huston or Anette Benning (see the adaptation of Jim Thompson's The Grifters, if you do not know what I'm talking about, it's a better movie and should start with the contemporary noir). - is the best of the 1990s and challenges Blood Simple for the title of best from Chinatown). She simply does not have the chops (or appearances for that matter) and although she and Patric have some chemistry, I do not have it with her. Therefore, there.
