['It&#39;s amazing that so many people I know have not seen this little gem. All that I have turned on have returned with the same reaction: WHAT A GREAT MOVIE! <br /><br /> I have never worried much about Brad Pitt (although his turns in 12 monkeys and Fight Club show an improvement), but his performance in this film as a psychopath is disconcerting, dark and accurate. <br /><br /> all the others in the film offer excellent performances and the slow and deliberate pace of the film greatly improves the procedures. The feeling of fear for the characters continues to increase as they realize what is really happening. <br /><br /> The only thing that keeps this from a 10 in my book, is that compared to what came before, the ending is a little too long and exaggerated. But that&#39;s the only flaw I could find in this cult classic. <br /><br /> If you review this movie, try to get the cut of the director without classification and with lyrics for the best viewing option. <br /><br /> Rating: 9']
