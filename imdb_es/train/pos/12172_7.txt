['This film starts energetically, it has some slow moments in the middle, but it generally progresses well, it has some very good moments, then it disappears at the end of Act 3. I could see this in the premieres of Los Angeles 2 times. (with 2 different endings). Jason Lee is a star, but he is not tomorrow&#39;s leader. It is comical and has its own, but it is better to be served as a secondary actor. Julia Stiles does &quot;ok&quot; in a comedy role, new to her, but does not &quot;steal&quot; this movie, as a star of her caliber should. For an actress who has so much potential (10 Things, Save the Last Dance, O), it&#39;s hard to see her continue to play roles that are so &quot;normal&quot;, and then not make her take the role and run away with the Movie (as Daniel Day did -Lewis in &#39;Gangs&#39;). Selma Blair is also a good young actress and does a good job. I did not expect an award performance from her academy, and she did not deliver one, but her performance was adequate. Chris Koch delivers another movie that is &quot;above average&quot;. Maybe the problem lies in the script more than anything else. I liked this movie! But, it&#39;s not a movie where you walk away and say ... &#39;It was great!&#39; ... This &#39;history&#39; has been done many times before and there was not much news here. The rehearsal dinner scene was probably the best of the movie, and Larry Miller offers an incredible performance in a supporting role (it could be the best surprise of the movie). If you want to go see a movie that will make you laugh several times and have a nice evening, I can still recommend this movie, but unless you have changed the ending ... again ... go during the church scene, or You will surely be disappointed.']
