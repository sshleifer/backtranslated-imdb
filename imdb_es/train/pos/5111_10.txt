Does anyone know what kind of truck John T was driving? I think it's a Ford from the middle to the late 70s. This movie is my favorite as much as my wife's. It was the first memorable movie we saw as a married couple. The collection is of interest since it is similar to the first truck that I drove and recently I found another one like it. I would like to restore the collection. I have to look like the one in the movie. Also the music was amazing, and the acting was great. Where and what is the lady who played John's aunt? Did John also have a double for the scene in the tower when he almost fell? Also what year Mustang drove Debra W in this show. It looked like a model from the 60's. Thank you,
