Anyone who has seen this movie and reviewed it badly, would recommend it to Roger Ebert's review of this movie. He is one of the most respected critics in the industry and gave him 3 1/2 stars. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie. It may not be perfect, or spectacular, but I enjoyed it. A Chorus Line is not so much a story, as a group of stories about the lives of aspiring Broadway. I read reviews where people said that too much time had been lost in the romance between Zach and Cassie. That is an incorrect view. It is another story along with all the other stories that are told about each of the aspiring Broadway. What people do not realize is that those who are dancers for the Broadway shows go through the same things that the common man goes through. And that I think is really the point of the whole show. It is to show not only the talent of these special dancers, but also to give us some moving things to think about life in general. This is a study of life as a Broadway star. Anyone who has dreamed of becoming a Broadway star sees this movie with a great sense of relationship because it has gone through exactly what the characters are going through. <br /> <br /> This is a great musical. It has its slow points and, sometimes, it gets confused a little with the rhythm of certain lines of the story, but in general, I enjoyed it a lot. Take a closer look at the movie, and then maybe you understand what I'm talking about.
