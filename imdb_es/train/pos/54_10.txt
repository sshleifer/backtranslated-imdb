Home Room deals with a shooting at the Columbine-like institute, but instead of placating the incident, the film portrays the consequences and what happened to the survivors, their trauma, guilt and denial. <br /> <br /> * Spoilers * The shooting itself is treated as an unavoidable conclusion, with no more action images than the reaction of an almost teenage SWAT commando after shooting the high school killer. The movie has three protagonists; the detective who investigates the crime of which he does not allow himself to be condemned to any culprit and two adolescents who survive the incident, interpreted by a very young Erika Christensen and Busy Philipps. <br /> <br /> The two girls have nothing in common besides the shooting is organized because of that and the drama continues. <br /> <br /> Erika Christensen, although only 24 have been around the block so much that moviegoers know their solid and reliable acting style quite well. The busy Philipps, three years older than Christensen and unknown to me, surprised me with her overwhelming dramatic force and presence on the screen. This girl was the piece. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie and it connects with you because of its intimate focus on the fragile and growing relationship between the two traumatized girls. The Elephant of Gus van Sant (2003), although good, seems almost shallow and petty compared to Home Room when it comes to a dramatic style and performance. What I can see is that this film had very little screen time and exposure, much more than a loss for an equally traumatized United States. <br /> <br /> Ten out of ten
