['I think this movie is brilliant. There are many reasons why, but these are some of them 1) the good performance of Tom and Tyler 2) the brilliant scene of the machine guns that was a piece of brilliance 3) I thought the end was a good Turn because I never expected that in the end all the credit went to Sam Mendes. In addition to these 3 points, the shape of the film is also good. I am a film student at the university and we studied this movie in great detail and it was one of the best movies I&#39;ve seen in many years. I just want to thank all the people involved in making this movie. Finally, I would like to say that the best scene in the movie is the machine gun scene where John Rooney manages to kill. It&#39;s simply a brilliance when filming the scene in silence until John Rooney says &quot;I&#39;m glad it&#39;s you&quot;. It is much better. I think so, because the viewer creates his own sound and that sound is totally different for each viewer, just brilliant. <br /><br /> Thank you for reading this comment written by Ross Kirk, 16 years old.']
