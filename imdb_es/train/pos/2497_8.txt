In fact: the use of drugs, the shots in the warehouse, the bullet dodgers 'Matrix', a futuristic city with a mixture of Asian races and a lone vampire - all in the same movie - seems like a story that Solo could to be imagined by a Japanese pop / rock star. And that is exactly what 'Child of the Moon' is, and more. While all these elements combined may sound like the perfect theme for a B movie of the week, 'Moon Child' achieves it with just a few bumps and hiccups expected along the way. <br /> <br /> The film has a gritty feel, definitely independent, jumping from one scene to the next, not in a smooth transition, but in sporadic leaps and bounds, providing a glimpse into the lives of the characters and barely touching a true plot. But the film does not offer excuses, but it turns the story into one of friendship, love, trust and betrayal, all covered in sugar in the aforementioned elements of a futuristic society, confronting gangsters and vampires. <br /> <br /> HYDE as the somber vampire 'Kei' is excellent, it gives depth to the character and balances Gackt's overly jealous performance as 'Sho', an orphan who befriends Kei. Lee-Hom Wang also shines as the vengeful 'Son' who befriends an adult Sho. The story revolves around these characters and their family and friends throughout different periods of their lives, and how simple friendship can easily turn into pain and betrayal. <br /> <br /> While the action sometimes is too. Unrealistic and special effects appear only to show off, one thing that the film never does is to boast of the immensely popular Asian singers that it presents. Superstars as actors have their shortcomings, and also their characters. The movie rarely gets boring, and it ends where it should, after jumping a bit. 'Moon Child' is quite funny, fun at times, and even very touching: it's definitely worth it!
