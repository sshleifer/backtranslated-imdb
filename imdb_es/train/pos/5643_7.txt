Mary Pickford ("Born on the Fourth of July" as Angela Moore) is "The Little American" (of French origin); she falls in love with Jack Holt (like Karl Von Austreim), who moved to the United States with her German father and her American mother. The American of French origin Raymond Hatton (like the count Jules de Destin of "Fighting Destins") has fallen in love with Mrs. Pickford. The love trio finally ended up in France, with the Great War (the First World War, in retrospect) complicating their lives considerably. <br /> <br /> A film by Cecil B. DeMille, mostly entertaining, although with propaganda errors. The torpedoing and sinking of a boat that leads to Pickford is similar to "Titanic". The intrigue of war becomes dramatic when Pickford slowly becomes an undercover spy for France, while the Germans occupy their ancestral home. Of course, the German lover Holt arrives. It was hard to believe that it took so long to recognize each other as he approached the rape, but it was dark; and, the previous events made them believe mutually dead. The film goes far beyond its symbolism. By the way, Pickford was Canadian, though few could deny that she was not a "little American," for all purposes and purposes. <br /> <br /> FUN to detect "extras" that later became important stars include Wallace Beery, Colleen Moore and Ramon Novarro - especially, observe Novarro exhibiting a "star" quality during one of the most memorable sequences from the movie: Pickford and the wounded soldier who greet each other while he takes him on a stretcher. Novarro even gets Mary Pickford to write him a letter; Obviously, it has a future in images. Also heading for the future is Ben Alexander, who plays the boy "Bobby"; he becomes a reliable child actor, and grows to become a partner of Jack Webb in "Dragnet". <br /> <br /> ******* The Little American (07/12/17) Cecil B.
