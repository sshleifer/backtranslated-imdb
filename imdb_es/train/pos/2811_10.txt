Silverlake Life, The view from here, is an absolutely amazing film about AIDS and about a love relationship between homosexuals. Some images are really difficult to take, especially when one is gay or fears for AIDS, and probably by any sensitive person who sees it. It is not easy to make a film about such a terrible disease and its consequences not only on one's life, but on two. This film teaches how to take care of each other in such difficult times, but it never becomes too morbid, it still shows life at any moment, reminding you that outside of the theater or your room, life goes on, whatever the fate of some. People can be The characters are incredibly attractive, while we observe their intimacy in shots that never go beyond a very strict limit, they never reveal anything too private or offensive. Children should not watch this movie, but adults, whether they have to deal with such situations or not, should do so, and will not regret the tears they shed.
