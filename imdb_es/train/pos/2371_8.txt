I suggested renting this movie to my friend and he thanked me because he had already seen the movie and said he was fine. I thought the title was a bit corny since the version in our shop was called "The Fear: Halloween Night". I expected this movie to be a Halloween scam with a killer type of wood. But it opened with a good scene and the murderer killed two victims immediately and went ahead twenty years later, when his son who had seen him kill the two people (including his mother) and even saw that his father's suicide was going to an isolated cabin in the forest with his friends and his girlfriend, where he tries to face his fears until a wooden statue comes alive with the spirit of his father. Pretty good for a sequel and I never saw the first one.
