I enjoyed this movie, and after seeing it, I wonder how many 'Caitlin Rose' exist in the world. How many other girls have been subjected to this type of sexual abuse and tormented by classmates and have been too afraid to open their mouths about it? How threatening and cruel can teenagers be to each other, because as this film demonstrates, who is right is not the most important thing, is who is popular and feared, who manipulates the minds of young people and influences them to allow them to Does this kind of immorality happen? Tiffani Amber Thiessen has a powerful acting as a rape victim, and Brian Austin Green is convincing as the guy who is torn between the girl he thought he loved and his best friend. This is the kind of movie that does not reveal it. it deserves It's remarkable, and bright, too good to be just a movie made for television.
