Only get it. The DVD is cheap and easy to get, the duration is now standard and you have spent enough time without it. (When the home video started, at least there were three versions with missing parts ...) Everything you've read is true. There is no defense, no life without it. The color is exuberant and wonderful to see, and the production values ​​are quite good for a children's epic Saturday afternoon. But there is no doubt ... the entire Santa Vs. Satan's angle is so amazing that it made the film a success at that time and that a favorite cult video once really started. How good / bad / strange / is it? I only saw the TRAILER when I was a kid, and I remembered it for almost 30 years ... including Murray over the top voice. I told my older sister, and she called me a liar and I could not believe it was POSSIBLE that EVERYONE could do it. a movie in which Santa vs. Satan ... Add things to him like Santa who asks for the blessing of the Virgin Mary before starting Christmas Eve, the children want to capture him and make him his SLAVE ... and in an international children's store, and that probably comes close To many nightmares that children had in the 60s. Like others here, I see the thing in every holiday season now. (My favorite version is the Mystery Science Theater 3000 edition). But whichever way you choose it, the movie is a demented masterpiece and a total duty (along with Brianiac, by the way ...). It never stops making me laugh. Better, I think, then SANTA CLAUS CONQUERS THE MARTIANS. Some parts can still make you feel dejected or you just get scared. (How many parents do you know going out for a cocktail on Christmas Eve? "If you get bored, just go downstairs and play the piano." DANG ...) Freaky Bored, disturbing, funny, childish, weird ... hey , What more can you ask?
