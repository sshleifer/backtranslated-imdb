The first time I saw this movie on a movie channel (HBO?) Some time ago. I was a fan of Public Enemy, NWA and other early rap and had seen CB4 in theaters. Anyway, the promotion caught my attention, and I wanted to see what it was about. Well, from the beginning I knew it was going to be good (WARNING!) And I was right. The parody songs make it worthwhile to watch this movie again and again (My Peanuts), but the overall flow and delivery of the film were excellent. You have to love the satire of the rap groups (obviously NWA), certain rappers (Eazy E, Flava Flav, Ice Cube) and the humor of the three members of NWH. Who can forget Tone Deaf scratching his ass? It is a pity that this film has not received the credit it deserved, since it was surpassed by CB4 during its releases, but in my opinion it is a much better movie. If you know and like the 'gangster' rap of the 90s, you will be watching and laughing with this movie for a long time. If you do not like or do not like rap, you will enjoy jokes at the expense of the genre.
