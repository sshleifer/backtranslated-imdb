Homicide: The Movie proved to be a good summary of a well-written, well-directed and well-performed series. Loose ends that were not properly addressed at the end of the final season were tied. The entire series, and especially the film, provided a real aspect of life (and death) in Baltimore, a culturally unique city with an extremely high murder rate. My attraction for the series began long before I moved to Baltimore, but once I experienced life here, I realized how realistic it was. And the movie certainly retained that spirit. I will definitely miss the original new episodes of the series, but I am very grateful to NBC and the producers and the cast for giving us one last look at the dark side of Charm City.
