This is a movie that I decided to go see because I am a big fan of adult animation. I often find that when a film does not evolve around a famous actor or actress, but rather a story or style, it allows the film to look like a work of art rather than a sample of the actors' ability to differentiate their styles <br /> <br /> This movie is certainly more about style than history. While the story seemed interesting to me (a thriller that borrows the story and atmosphere of films like Blade Runner and many anime movies), sometimes it was a bit difficult to follow and it did not seem like everything came together as well as I could have. I definitely had a mixed sense of French animation and Japanese anime. Whether that is a good thing or not depends on the viewer. Visually, this film is a delight for the eyes and, in that sense, a work of art. <br /> <br /> If you like adult animation, or would like to see a movie that is different from most movies at this time. . I would recommend it. All I can say is that I enjoyed the movie experience, but I was a little disappointed because it could have been better.
