I really liked this movie because I have a husband like the guy in this movie. This movie is about Lindsey, who runs into Ben in mid-winter when he's not in baseball season. He falls in love, but when spring arrives, he receives the impact of his life when he is placed one step below on his pedestal that Ben La has placed. <br /> <br /> It's a fun movie with all the baseball obsession that Ben has. He can not separate from what he loves most, that's what makes him so funny and why so many women can relate to Lindsey in real life. Also, the people with whom he sits in baseball games are as obsessed as he is. <br /> <br /> It's a funny movie and you will not cross it out if you rent it.
