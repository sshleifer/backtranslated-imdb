This movie is one of those "WOW!" films. Not because it's the best movie of all time, but because it surprised me. It was not just a television movie, it was in Elvis. I can safely say as many imitators as there are, there was only one Elvis, but I can also say with certainty that Kurt Russel was very close to being the real one. It was one of the great imitations that I have seen. He made me believe it was really him. I learned a lot about Elvis' life from watching this movie. And do not get carried away by the television part, let it deviate, it's a really fantastic movie! And Kurt Russel may have been Elvis's twin :)
