Every once in a while this movie is released that nobody has heard of and it was filmed in a very short time with very little money and resources, but everyone goes crazy and turns out to be surprisingly great. This also happened in the 50s with quite a few small films, of which not many people have heard. There really are some amazing little gems from the 50s that are worth digging out. "Panic in the Streets" is another film like that that springs from the mind. Both are movies that are not really like the usual genre films of their time and are also made with limited resources. <br /> <br /> I was really surprised at how much I liked this movie. It was really a movie that improved and improved as it progressed. Like all "old" movies, it tends to start a little slow, but once you get into the story and with the characters you will have a real pleasure with this movie. <br /> <br /> The movie has a great story that involves espionage, although the film does not start like that. Start like this typical suspense game with a touch of black cinema. But "Pickup on South Street" is not really a movie by the numbers, so start taking your own directions very soon. Ensures that the film remains surprising but, above all, really refreshing to watch. <br /> <br /> I also liked the characters in this movie. None of them is really a good boy and all his flaws and weaknesses. Really human. He also has a great performance by Thelma Ritter, who even received a deserved Oscar nomination for. It really has to be one of the best female roles I've seen. <br /> <br /> Even despite its fairly obvious low budget, this is simply a great little original, special movie that deserves to be seen for more! <br /> <br /> 10/10
