I have read many negative reviews of this film and finally had the opportunity to see it on DVD. To be honest, I really do not know what the problem is with him. <br /> <br /> It's a decent murder mystery thriller, shown from several points of view, from an eccentric cast of often-drugged killers / suspects. , including the late king of porn, John Holmes. Read the synopsis of the plot to know the exact details of the plot of the movie. I want to contribute more to a review than to a synopsis. <br /> <br /> Many critics were up to now to give this film the lowest rating due to violence, but I really do not see it. MANY modern movies were worse. Saving Private Ryan was ultimately more violent than this movie, which is often based on implicit bloodstains that actual brutal murders (the murders described in this movie were made with lead pipes, after all). <br /> <br /> I was captivated by the two halves of the film: the first that showed John Holmes as a hopeless drug addict, and the second half by his side as a minor conspirator in a bloodbath without sense. The film has an excellent performance, despite the fact that Dylan McDemorant looks more than a little out of place in his motorcyclist personality and bad boy kid personality. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was also amazing, a fantastic mix of 70's B-side rock and dark pop, spread over a couple of hours in all the right places to Boogie Nights.
