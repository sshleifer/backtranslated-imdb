Simply, one of the funniest movies I've seen in my life. It is a parody of crime-life, a parody of everything that represents the Chicago 1930. - It is not necessary to underestimate this film because the rating is less than 5. It is an opinion of a mass, and the mass is hypnotized. Whoever decides to see it will regret it. Whoever decides not to see it will regret it more.
