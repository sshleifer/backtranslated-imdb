The symbolic use of objects, the editing of forms, the position of the characters in the scene ... all were used with so much abandonment by Hitchcock that you can really see what fertile genius he had. The way the wife moves from one corner of the ring to the other as the fight progresses, the editing when the wedding ring is placed on her finger ... while these may seem a bit obvious by the standards of today, in the silent era that Volumes spoke about history without being said a word. Even the title has at least four meanings that I can see; the boxing ring, the wedding ring, the bracelet that the lover buys and the love triangle at the heart of the story.
