At the risk of sounding a little sacrilegious, to see it for the first time, I'm a little inclined to put this on par with 'Shaun of the Dead'. Now, given that I see Simon Pegg as an unquestionable genius of comedy, I realize that this is a pretty big claim. And to what extent you agree with that last statement, it can be a good preliminary indicator of whether 'Fido' will attract you. <br /> <br /> Somehow, the comedy takes back the place where 'Shaun' left off, except that we return to the stereotypical city of the American half of the original era of the Living Dead in the 1950s. The wars of zombies have ended and the zombies themselves are becoming members of the community, rather tight and useful. This, so we are informed from the beginning, is largely thanks to the scientific advances made by the good people of Zomcom: a good play about romantic comedy? <br /> <br /> The beauty of the film lies in its description of a respectable neighborhood that maintains core values ​​while creating a place for zombies and the special dangers they represent. The charm and balance with which he does it is perfect enough. The themes you might expect from a more generalized kitsch comedy are: the appearance of a clean good life, keeping up appearances, repressed emotions, confusing parental values, social decorum and the plight of the alienated individual. <br /> <br /> It is a story told with a happy heart and a great attraction that comes alive in a vivid way because of the strong cast of the film. It is one of those jobs that really shows that everyone involved was angry to participate. It's also fun to imagine what Billy Connelly must have been like when he learned his script ... <br /> <br /> So to conclude, you probably appreciate the humor of this movie unless your father has tried to eat you.
