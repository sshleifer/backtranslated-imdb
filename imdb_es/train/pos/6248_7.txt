Being an Austrian, this has been a direct hit on my face. Fortunately, I do not live anywhere near the place where this film is made, but unfortunately it portrays everything that the rest of Austria hates about the Viennese (or people close to that region). And it is very easy to read that this is exactly the director's intention: to let your head sink in your hands and say "My God, how can THAT be possible!". No, not with me, the uncensored swinger club scene (in my opinion) totally exaggerated is not necessary, I see pornography, of course, but in this context I was more upset than put in the right context. <br /> <br /> This film tells a story about how deceived people who suffer from lack of education or bad company try to survive and live in a world of redundancy and boring horizons. A girl who is treated like a whore by her super jealous boyfriend (and is still coming back), a teacher who discovers her masochism by risking the life of her super cruel "lover", an elderly couple who has a daily cycle almost mathematical ( she is the "official replacement" of his ex-wife), a couple who just got divorced and her ex-husband suffers for the acts of his ex-wife, obviously having a relationship with his masseuse and, finally, a crazy hitchhiker who makes the More unusual questions to their drivers and stretches their nerves simply for being super annoying. <br /> <br /> After having seen it, you almost feel nothing. You're not even surprised, sad, depressed or wanting to do anything ... Maybe that's why I gave him 7 points, he made me react in a way that I had never reacted before. Whether that is good or bad depends on you!
