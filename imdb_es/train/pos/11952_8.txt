*** Scoop *** Woody Allen is definitely not my favorite director, but I enjoyed "Match Point". It was an excellent romantic and dark thriller that fortunately did not star in Woody Allen. He had the beautiful Scarlett Johansson in her. <br /> <br /> "Scoop" is Woody Allen's latest film and although it appears on this one, it's fine. He also presents Scarlett Johansson and the two work perfectly together. <br /> <br /> Johansson plays Sondra Pransky, a young college journalist who takes the life of the ghost of Joe Strombel (Ian McShane). Joe heard the scoop while he was in a boat with the grim reaper and a handful of other souls that the Reaper has taken. One of those souls is the secretary of Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman). She tells Joe that Peter can be the serial killer who walks the streets of England. Joe, with the scoop of life, comes back to life and gives this information to Sondra, during an act of magic. Sondra is in a magic show with the wizard Sid Waterman (Woody Allen). She becomes a volunteer to go in a box that disappears and, while she is in the box, receives Joe's visit. When she does not know what to do, she asks for help from Sid Waterman to help her solve the case. <br /> <br /> This movie has a nice and cheerful feeling compared to "Match Point" and yet it works. . Johansson and Allen work very well together. Allen's humor fits perfectly for this story and role. Hugh Jackman is fantastic as Peter Layman, the "alleged" serial killer. <br /> <br /> This is a fun little movie to see if you are ever looking for one to watch. The set of the cast works well together and the story flows and, sometimes, it is forgotten that seeing Woody Allen is the same. I say give it a try because maybe you like it.
