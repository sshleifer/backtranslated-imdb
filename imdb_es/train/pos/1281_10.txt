This movie is as good as hard to find. The hero of the film (and the writer and director) is Simon Geist, a man "with an agenda". He creates a fake magazine only to have the authority to interview the Los Angeles pigs (the actors, the models, the musicians) who believe that their own defecation does not smell. With an intelligent dialogue, Zucovic manages to do this. Of course, the budget for this movie was probably what he paid for a used car, but this movie is so solid and so well written that it works very well. Anyone who can recreate "The Scream" by Edward Munk in the reflection of a silver trash can at a local coffee shop should be nominated for some type of prize. Give this film a chance and listen to what it says ... because you HAVE been doing the same car since 1986 ... it's called 'the car'. Bravo, Zucovic, bravo!
