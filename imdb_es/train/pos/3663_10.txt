Perhaps the last film I would expect came from Vittorio de Sica and Cesare Zavattini (who wrote the novel on which this film is based). It's a neo-realist fantasy, a kind of oxymoron, really. An old woman finds a baby in her cabbage patch and raises him as her own son. After a few years, the baby is a small child (called Toto) and the adoptive mother is dying. He goes to an orphanage and, when he finally turns 18, he leaves. Immediately, he discovers that he has no home. Toto is optimistic, however, and will not let anything discourage him. A man steals his suitcase, and instead of getting angry about it, Toto becomes his friend and leaves and stays with him in a small shantytown. Toto takes some initiative and organizes the many homeless people who live in the area and build a better neighborhood. Soon, the landowner is trying to sell this parcel of land, and the citizens of the neighborhood have to protect themselves. After many attempts, the owner sets up a police force to get rid of the homeless. At this point, the film becomes complete fantasy (before this was a more comical / fantastic melodrama in the style of Charlie Chaplin). This material is so strange and shocking that it is probably better for others to see it for themselves. It's pretty amazing, and very fun. There are objections that you could raise about the plot of Miracle in Milan, without a doubt. Fellini and Visconti were very criticized when they began to move away from neorealism. I think I read this was widely criticized at the time of its release. At this point, however, it is very nice, I loved it very much. It may be my favorite of the Vittorio de Sica films, although Umberto D and The Bicycle Thieves are very, very close. 10/10.
