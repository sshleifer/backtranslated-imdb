Clint Eastwood returns to play his role as Dirty Harry, this time it is the case of a vigilante (Sondra Locke) who is killing the people who raped her and her sister at a carnival many years ago. Eastwood plays the role of him and the film is mainly more action than talk, not that I complain. Suddenly, the Impact is a pleasant entertainment.
