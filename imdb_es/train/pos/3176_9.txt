It happened that I captured this movie at a screening in Brooklyn: it is difficult to describe the plot; It has many extravagant characters, but let's say I would have a hard time choosing which one made me laugh the most, I would not know where to start. Even peripheral roles are well written and act well. <br /> <br /> There are numerous small touches that make it unique and very nice, it has some "devices" that open up and add another hilarious layer. It's refreshing to see it; Not some recycled things that I had seen many times before. If this film could reach a wider audience, I'm sure it would be a real pleasure for the crowd, the story is very original and sincere. <br /> <br /> Here are many things that I like, funny stories, setbacks and misunderstandings that make up the final act and the dramatic conclusion. Cross Eyed is a very funny movie with lots of hearts; It is a moving story with a fast-paced comedy interwoven. Definitely worth seeing!
