Lion King 1 1/2 is a very funny and addictive sequel. Do not wait for the production values ​​of a theatrical premiere, but expect the highest quality of direct premiere to video. <br /> <br /> It is set when Timon and Pumbaa begin to see the original Lion King in a dark theater. and they abruptly change tracks and begin to tell their own story. This is done with frequent comic interruptions. For example, during a particular tense moment, a home shopping commercial appears and an angry Pumbaa realizes that he has sat on the remote control. These little moments dot the film, and whether you find them entertaining or not will depend to a large extent on your sense of humor. If you are particularly bothered by movies that deliberately remind you that the viewer is watching a movie, this may not be your cup of tea. <br /> <br /> Animation is the best thing that they have invested in the Disney DTV line, and integrates almost perfectly with the original material. The newer and more independent material uses much of the artistic style of the original. All voices are well interpreted, although I could not help but think of Marge Simpson every time I heard Julie Kavner. <br /> <br /> Many of the jokes in the film will be recognized by the viewers as recycled in the film. generations, but they present themselves more with the familiarity of the comfortable peculiarities of old friends than with annoying repetition. <br /> <br /> The music has made me realize how much I enjoyed and miss a good musical integrated with a Disney feature. The opening feature of 'Dig A Tunnel' is well choreographed and fun. Timon and Pumbaa's take of the opening sequence of the Lion King and his introduction to paradise are also fun. The only problem was the repetition of 'Dig A Tunnel' at the end of the film, changing their letters and melodies from defeatist to uplifting. <br /> <br /> The story line is pretty well done, and the integration of new elements of the plot is done almost perfectly, although the final bit during the hyena persecuted stretched a little the credibility of the history. The new story does not seem to handle either the saccharine or emotion-laden moments, and it works best when it is resorting to full comedy. <br /> <br /> In general, it is worth buying. If you like all the additional functions that come with a typical set of 2 discs, then do it. For the penny that is still willing to invest in a good movie, wait until you drop four dollars or more and change it immediately. <br /> <br /> Damion Crowley.
