['It is not a bad movie. Somehow, they made me root for the Iranians to win the game played in the movie, although I do not know anything about football and I&#39;m not a fanatic. The ending on the bus was exciting. <br /><br /> The film itself deals with the issue of women in Iran, and how they are not allowed to enter sports stadiums among men because their oath is inappropriate for women. Despite this law, some women try to sneak in, but many of them are caught and detained. It is truly amazing that any society can still have antiquated notions of gender. In an interview, Panahi says that his films are documents of history and their injustices, and that one day in the future we will be able to see these films and see how Iran once lived. The future is expected to arrive sooner rather than later.']
