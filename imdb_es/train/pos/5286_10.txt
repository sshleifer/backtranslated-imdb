Part of what was so good about the classic Looney Tunes cartoons was their irreverence and how they were not afraid to do what they wanted. In this case, Marvin the Martian has the task of bringing back an earthling. Indeed, he meets Bugs Bunny, who warns of a mutiny by Marvin's dog. After Marvin finally catches the insects, by means of a bazooka of expulsion of the jacket of the Strait Acme! - Bugs has more things planned for the trip back to Mars. What I want to say is that, if you thought it was a major change in the Solar System when you plundered Pluto from the state of your planet, then you have not seen anything yet! Yes, "The Hasty Hare" does everything possible. The way they buy Acme products in outer space is beyond most people, but the point here, I mean "hare", is to have fun. And believe me, you will definitely do it. After all, a little space does not hurt anyone.
