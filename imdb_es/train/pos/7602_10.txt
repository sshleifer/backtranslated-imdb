The first season was amazing, the whole idea of ​​adapting to the island, while the mysteries were being explored (and seeing) was just phenomenal; Full of suspense, tons of suspensions and an incredible plot. I mean, I love the idea of ​​just watching them get used to the island. And then, seeing the smoke monster in the first episode, it really caught my attention. From then on, I was hooked. The second season was on par with season 1, just a little better. I loved the idea of ​​the hatches and the DHARMA Initiative. All the plot and sequences of season 2 were mysterious, spooky and exciting. I loved all the suspense that surrounds others on the island, but the story of DHARMA really made Season 2 unbelievable. <br /> <br /> Season 3 was not as good as season 1 and season 2 ... but, nevertheless, it's great. I loved seeing the stories of others, seeing their camp and seeing the most explored mysteries. ("Tricia Tanak Is Dead" is one of my favorite episodes). This season, although not so good, was impressive and fun, but above all exciting! Now, the fourth season. I had hopes for this season, and the first couple of episodes are fine, but then it REALLY started to be boring and monotonous. I mean, I REALLY despise the new "rescuers" like Miles and Daniel. The plot became old after the first two episodes ... and MOST OF ALL ... Season 4 was eliminated from something that made LOST a perfect series: The mystery, the suspense, the comedy mixed (Charlie left ) and emotion in general. Also, some of my favorite characters are gone.
