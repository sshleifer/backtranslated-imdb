This movie is about development. People grow and people fade, people surprise and people disappoint. He has everything and more. There is hope, frustration, injustice, justice, love and hate. It's really a classic drama that has fantastic performances from all the cast, but especially Whoopi Goldberg in his debut role. <br /> <br /> This movie made me feel very human and proud of it, and I suggest that this film should be obligatory every Saturday in all the prisons of the world; this moves his compassion. Rating: 10 out of 10. <br /> <br /> PS: I admit it: I shed a tear of joy during the final scene.
