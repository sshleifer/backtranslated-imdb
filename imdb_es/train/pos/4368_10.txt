This is a very exciting and romantic movie. I have seen it several times and I never get bored. Everything is realistic and it is a good plot. The actors are excellent Liam Neeson, Jessica Lange, Tim Roth and Brian Cox. <br /> <br /> Actually, I prefer this film to Braveheart since Braveheart contains many historical errors. There are many exciting scenes: be careful with Bridge Scen and the last fencing scene. This is a really good and amazing scene. <br /> <br /> The music is lovely ... it really adapts to the movie. The scenery is incredible.
