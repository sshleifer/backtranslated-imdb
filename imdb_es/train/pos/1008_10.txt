I entered this excellent program in season 4 and since then I have seen that all the episodes got all episodes on DVD and continue to improve with the seasons of 9 and 10. Now I may not have Richard Dean Anderson now, but The addition of Ben Browder and Claudie Black has still given the show more strength and originality even after 10 seasons. Unfortunately, now the science fiction channel got rid of this amazing program without relaying hope for a season 11, they are making two direct DVD movies and, hopefully, more. Atlantis is still going strong in its 4th seasons. And there is a third turn in the works in which the Stargate franchise is about to die. This TV show is a must for all sci-fi fans and people of genre, as it has a wide variety of things that appeal to all ages and all kinds of people. 10/10
