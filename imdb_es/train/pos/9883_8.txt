It ran 8 seasons, but it is the first one, at the beginning of 1959, and the last, in the fall of 1965, was shorter than the seasons 2-7. CBS boss William Paley canceled Rawhide's production after watching the first show of season 8 in September 1965, because he did not like the show without Eric Fleming as Gil Favor, who had left after the season 7. The last episode aired in November 1965. The only CBS broadcast of 1966, on January 4, 1966, was a repeat. <br /> <br /> I have often wondered why Rawhide did not change to color filming for last season. Most of the great westerns of the 1960s had gone into coloring in 1965. CBS was broadcasting in color that fall, for many of their comedies, but westerns such as Gunsmoke and Rawhide remained in black and white. Gunsmoke was the last western (and the last network series in prime time to change color) on September 17, 1966, for the episode Snap Decision.
