The US Department of State UU He does not want us to see this movie, because they disagree with the Iranian government. However, it shows us how civilized Iran really is, despite the content of the film, which focuses on women's struggle for equal rights in the simplest terms: the possibility of watching a football match at the stadium , which is strictly limited only to the male audience. The film is hilariously funny, and in itself is a test of freedom of expression and expression in Iran. I enjoyed this movie intensely. Five girls try to penetrate the border of the police at the entrance gates for a football game between Iran and Bahrain. The resulting comedy is too funny to describe, from the bus ride to the stadium, the police intersession and the subsequent detention of the girls, until the resulting end. Do not miss this classic movie. It is a must. One of the best foreign films I've seen in years.
