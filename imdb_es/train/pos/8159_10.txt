Good. This movie is pure pleasure. It has always so violent terror mixed with a little suspense and a lot of black comedy. The dentist really starts to lose his mind and it's nice to see him do it. This movie is for certain people, though. Either you will love it completely or you will hate it totally. A good movie to rent and see when you have nothing else to do. Also recommended: Psycho III
