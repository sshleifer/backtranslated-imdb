I am a big fan of Simon Pegg and I have seen many of his films so far and none of them has stopped making me laugh. Nor how to lose friends and Alienate People. <br /> <br /> This movie is essentially about a good man to annoy people. However, he has an innate set of ethics that prevents him from doing things that could make him famous. But in the end he ends up doing them, the culture of life. <br /> <br /> The movie is well toned with humor, romance, good acting and also a little dance back. It's one of those movies where you can be happy when it ends.
