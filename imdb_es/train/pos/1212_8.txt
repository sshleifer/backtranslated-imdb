['Care Bears Movie 2: A New Generation is not a bad movie at all. In fact, I like it a lot. Yes, I admit that the dialogue is corny and the story is a bit badly told sometimes. But Darkheart, though very, very dark, is a pretty convincing villain who changes shape, and Hadley Kay did an excellent job of expressing it. Speaking of the voice acting, it was great, nothing bad at all. The animation is colorful, and some of the particular images at the beginning were impressive. The songs and the score are lovely, especially Growing Up and Forever Young, the latter has always been my personal favorite of the two. The care bears, which I like, are adorable, and human children are also well made. And the end is a true tearjerker. In general, fun for children harmless. 8/10 Bethany Cox']
