I love this show, but I saw the second episode first. After watching the first episode, I could see why people were off at the beginning. The mood of the first episode is not the best, and they struggle to start the series correctly. However, I still like the light and humorous attitude of the show. The characters develop much more after the episode and become really nice characters. As a first episode, it really does not accurately represent the rest of the program, which is pretty good. The episode is not bad in any way, but as the program progresses, it gets better and better, so watch more episodes before judging the quality of the program.
