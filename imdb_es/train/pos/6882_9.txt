I have not seen the movie yet, but I can not wait to see it! It seems very interesting and inspiring. It was one of the most interesting trailers I've seen: the questions that really raised me stopped me and made me think, the unique approach to the sport of boxing as a metaphor for the "inner battle" ... thank God someone is hitting Another angle with the boxing thing. This movie looks so fresh and smart. And the actor is really hot. I especially enjoyed the short clip with the actor of the Rocky movies, really smart. I thought that the selected theme (overcoming the adversities and traumas of childhood) is timeless, and God knows that many people need it. Go ahead.
