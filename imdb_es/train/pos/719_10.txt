Despite the fact that this movie is the most corny, it is achieved perfectly. This film, without a doubt, has to be considered as a modern classic. Basically, there are two types of movies that I like: movies with depth (girls movies, if necessary, I blame my wife for this) and mindless comedies where I can sit down and relax. This movie is a perfect example of the latter. <br /> <br /> A friend of mine introduced me to this movie shortly after its release. When he considered something superficial, he told me: "You have to see this movie, it's just your kind of movie." Before the insult, I began to look. I know they mentioned the Ramones a million times, but when you actually see them, I said, "Hey, it's the Ramones." My friend replied: "I do not know that they were a real band". I had my moment of glory. <br /> <br /> This film, although now a little outdated, is a must-see for Ramones fans, or anyone else.
