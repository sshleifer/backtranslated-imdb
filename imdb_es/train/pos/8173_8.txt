The brilliance of this movie is that even a competent dentist is quite scary. It is one of the primary fears of man. This movie is the nightmare image that every child has to go through in the waiting room. Corbin Bernsen offers a surprisingly untinted performance as a crazed dentist that I guess tries to kill people but only works on his teeth so it really does not work. In a particularly bloody scene we find actor actor Earl Boen with his teeth completely destroyed with exercises and all that, which I think is the worst thing you can do when you're a killer dentist. It is a typical situation of Brian Yuzna, not well written, but there is gore. The plot is of poor quality and, at times, seems to have recovered on the spot, but hey, it's a killer dentist movie, we've all thought about it but they did it first.
