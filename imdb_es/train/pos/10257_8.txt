What can I say about this movie that has not been said yet? Well, to tell the truth, many of them seem very false, like some of the slaps and kicks. how charlie shines even though this was real, I do not know. I'm sure they would hit her and kick much more if she were. However, the scenes with the pinch and the hot oil seem very real. and the final needle in the scene of the eyes is amazingly made and is probably the only movie that has surprised me.
