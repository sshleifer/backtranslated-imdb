Sometimes affection and, sometimes, middle drama about a completely depressed man who lost his family on 9/11 (Sandler in his best role since "Punch-Drunk Love") who ends up meeting with his old roommate and friend of the university (Cheadle Continuing to do an impressive job with every function to date), a well-endowed dentist who seems to have it all? family, wealth, happiness ?? but he really sees an ally at liberty with the personal life of his friend with problems.
