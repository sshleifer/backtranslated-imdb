10 ARTICLES OR LESS was done in two weeks with little budget from the writer / director Brad Silberling, just a small movie filmed in Carson, California, which seems that the whole story was improvised ... in the best sense of the word. Silberling was lucky to pair the veteran actor Morgan Freeman, in the midst of his big projects, with the Spanish actress Paz Vega, and the result is a dialogue between two people from different positions who manage to improve each other's lives. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman plays himself, but part of the comedy is that he is represented as an actor who has not worked for four years, exploring a place for a small 'filler film' to return to the flow of things. His "role" is to be that of a market manager and he is left in the charity market in Carson, where he is, among others, with a Scarlet, the girl in the disputable 10 items or less in the pay line. Scarlet is not only tired of her static work, but is also generally angry at her husband, Phobby Cannavale, who currently sleeps with Scarlet's lazy collaborator (Anne Dudek), and her lack of ability to get a decent job elsewhere . The two pairs after some shared problems and go on a "road trip" that results in each of the characters grows from the presence and life history of the other. <br /> <br /> It's a simple story, Simply said, but because of the tender union between Freeman and Paz, it works very well. This is one of those little films about human relationships in which being vulnerable to change and exchange is the message. It's worth seeing, and this is a DVD that has moving, informative and comic elements: it's a pleasure to see them. Harp grady
