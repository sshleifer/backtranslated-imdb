After reading some of the other comments here, I expected something really horrible, but I was pleasantly surprised. REALITY VERIFICATION: The original series was not so good. I think some people remember him with more affection than he deserved, but apart from the chases in Daisy Duke's car and legs, the scripts were weak and bad acting. The Duke boys were too smart and smart for the tricks of the wood, the shrunken Boss Hog was too stupid to be bad and Rosco was hyperactive at every moment of the screen. It's amazing that the series will last as long as it did because it ran out of stories during the first series. <br /> <br /> Return to the movie. If you see this movie in its own right, not as a direct comparison with what you remember from the television series, then it's not bad at all. The real star is, of course, General Lee. The chases and acrobatics in the cars are excellent and that's really what he does. is about. Johnny Knoxville is his usual eccentric self and, along with Seann William Scott as Cousin Bo, they make this movie really fun in a fun and silly way as the television series never succeeded. The lovely Jessica Simpson is a natch like Miss Daisy, Burt Reynolds makes a much improved Boss Hog and M.C. Gainey makes a Rosco P. Coltrane credibly unpleasant, as it always should have been. <br /> <br /> If you do not like the slapstick humor and the follies of the cars, you would not be watching this movie anyway because you must know what to expect. Otherwise, if you want an entertaining car action movie with a few good laughs that are not too demanding for the brain, go see this entertaining game with an open mind.
