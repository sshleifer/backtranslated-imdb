The worst movie of all time? Wow, whoa now. You can not be serious. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's about what you expect me to make a movie for you. I live in Oregon, so I enjoyed the beautifully filmed photos of Smith Rocks, familiar but incredibly beautiful, and other areas in Oregon Center (as well as the sweet cameo of our own Ken Kesey and Ken Babbs looking towards down from Sissy baby's crib at the beginning of the movie). Those solos were enough to encourage me to give the movie a better score than the "average". <br /> <br /> Or ... Maybe it's about the expectations you have. After having read the AGES book and only once, and thinking for myself "My God, nobody could make a film of this interesting, peculiar and strange book ... especially 20 years later, when more (MORAYS - I do not know can put on the accent online) have changed ": actually I was quite surprised the first time I saw the movie when it went on sale in 1994, and I even liked it more when I saw it again. <br /> <br /> Sissy was an exquisite cast, and I do not care what everyone says, I was also pleasantly surprised by the performances of Rain Phoenix and John Hurt. I am not a lesbian or bi or trans, but I have met many people who are similar to the people they had to portray, and those "real" people acted in the same way that these actors acted. Something a bit, on stage, always a little "on". Gus Van Sant is a strange native of Oregon, but he did a good job adapting this crazy book, IMHO.
