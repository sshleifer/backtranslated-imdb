A young and apparently promising college graduate (played by Blair Underwood) is sent to jail for the murder of an innocent girl and put on death row. Sean Connery plays the lawyer of "Happy Go Lucky" whom the grandmother of the young man seeks for his retirement and asks him to take charge of the case in the hope of freeing his grandson. Laurence Fishburne plays a police officer who was well involved in the case and is bent on discrediting the theory that Connery could unearth to try to free the child he and the entire police department swear is guilty of the crime. Ed Harris, Kate Capshaw, Ruby Dee and the late Lynne Thigpen are the co-stars of this intense dramatic thriller.
