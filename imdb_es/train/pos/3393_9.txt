The only other film, besides Soylent Green, that has that air of despair is On the Beach. Both films deal with the consequences for the species and the planet of the cataclysms made by man. On the beach with nuclear war and Soylent Green with the environmental poisoning of the planet. <br /> <br /> Perhaps there is cause for some optimism because as of 2007 we have not reached any of the worlds described in those films and they were supposed to be already. The city of New York still has around 8 million people, not the 22 million at the beginning of the millennium, as described in Soylent Green. Environmentalists always consider that this film shows the consequences of global warming. For my part, it also shows the ethics of the right to life. Obviously, there is no family planning in this world either. <br /> <br /> Charlton Heston is a New York police detective who lives with his roommate Edward G. Robinson, who is old enough to remember the Earth before a catastrophe occurred. A murder has been committed, Joseph Cotten, an executive of the Soylent Corporation, a multinational company that has created a food product, a kind of host in many colors to feed the world's population. His latest product is Soylent Green. <br /> <br /> The investigation finds that Charlton Heston is getting his man, but it also leads to some horrible truths about the Soylent Corporation and the future of humanity. When Heston shouts in the end that Soylent Green is made of people, that we have become a race of cannibals, the horrible thing is that there is no alternative. We have exhausted the planet and we have to eat our dead to survive. <br /> <br /> This was the farewell performance of Edward G. Robinson and in his memoirs Heston spoke of Robinson even though they had different political views. . A few weeks after Robinson wrapped up the final scene of his disappearance from the screen by spoiled euthanasia, he died in real life. Not many did, but Heston knew that Robinson was terminal and there was no action involved in the final scene of death between the two. <br /> <br /> Although the calendar was off, it does not mean that the world imagined by Soylent Green can not happen. Let's hope that we not only have the intelligence, but also the sense of shared responsibility to prevent that from happening.
