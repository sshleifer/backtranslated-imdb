Eddie Izzard is a genius with his continuous humor. I could listen all day. His unique approach to life is quite logical. His understanding of discovery (like Heimlich's Maneuver) is creative. Eddie Izzard captures the heart of what we think. I do not know when I laughed so much with someone's mind out of control.
