maybe I need my head examined, but I thought it was a pretty good movie. The CG is not so bad. I've seen it worse. The appearance of the creatures (and by creatures I mean the good and bad snake) was Pretty good. The action scenes that involved the snakes were really good, I thought. Sometimes there are some errors in logic, and history does not always make sense. But for a characteristic of the creature, there is much worse. the other creatures seemed to have risen from other movies, so it's not entirely original. I think the essence of the story is original. There's a bit of similarity with Godzilla (the big-budget American version) that he liked a lot. I really like this movie, but I still say it was pretty good. I also liked the music. In general, I think Dragon Wars is about 7/10.
