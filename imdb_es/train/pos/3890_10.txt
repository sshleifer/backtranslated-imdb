This is an excellent stand-up DVD! Eddie Izzard is the funniest person I've seen in years. Her routine is hilarious and makes it a great conversation with other people who have seen her. I highly recommend this one. The part about the history of Europe is a bit slow, but the final jokes in French are pretty good, because you do not have to speak French to get it (although if you do, it's still very funny). Also, the parts about being a transvestite are pretty good. The first scene (about San Francisco) is not great, but it's funny the first time. Jump on those if you can. It's almost not worth seeing. However, this is really a fun and funny show that everyone should see. "I was dead at that time!"
