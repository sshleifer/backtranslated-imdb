This is the first Michael Vartan movie I've seen, I have not seen Alias, and I was curious to see if the guy can act. Sure you can and it's nice in this movie. Natasha Henstridge is beautiful, of course, but she is usually in more physical and action roles, so I found her very good and kind in this "sweet" role different from a school teacher. Some of the negative comments I read are true, the film is full of clich√©s and the story does not sound at all. In addition, although all the characters in the film comment on how good they look together, I do not think there's chemistry on the screen there. However, I liked this movie. The scenarios are nice, the characters are nice and pleasant and the supporting actors are pretty good. If you expect to see a great romance, this is not the case. But if you want to see a nice and innocent movie with nice characters, it's very good.
