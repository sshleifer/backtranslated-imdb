I must admit that when I read the genre description on Netflix as "Steamy Romance" I was a bit skeptical. "Steamy"? In a 1968 movie? I was prepared for disappointment. And when I realized that it was filmed completely in black and white, I knew that my erotic hopes were frustrated. This film not only has all the elements of a steamy romance: the discovery of first love, the fear of discovering the secret, a sudden unexpected ending, but sometimes this movie was completely erotic. Soon you will forget that it is filmed in black and white. Cinematography deserves all the accolades it has received over the years. And the performances of the two stars (Essy Persson and Anna Gael) are intense and memorable. Granted, they're both in their mid-twenties trying to play girls at school. It's 1968. Do you really expect that the teenagers of the 60s can effectively explore a lesbian love story like this one? Many adult women still tried to confront their sexuality at the time. Whoever is looking for real teenagers here is waiting for too much. <br /> <br /> I think this movie was ahead of its time. The level of eroticism was an unexpected pleasure; However, he still managed to leave much to the imagination, opting instead to give us poetic descriptions to add to what they showed us. <br /> <br /> I have no doubt that lesbians will identify with the characters here. As for you, heterosexual men who love to see lesbians in action: although it will not be all that you expect, I do not think you're too disappointed.
