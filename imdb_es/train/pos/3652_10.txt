I started watching a replay of this TV movie on a Sunday afternoon, thinking it was just another silly movie about the airplane disaster. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> "Pandora's Clock" is an intelligent political thriller that far exceeds the quality of most television movies. It could easily have made its debut on the big screen. <br /> <br /> The cast is excellent, including veteran actors Richard Dean Anderson, Edward Herrmann, Robert Guillaume and Robert Loggia. Daphne Zuniga presents one of her best performances as a medical specialist working for the CIA, and Jane Leeves of Frasier is also very good. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is well written and the story is convincing at all times. In fact, the final hour is so full of plot twists and suspense that you can not leave your seat for a second. If you have the opportunity to watch this movie, invest the time, almost four hours. You will be richly rewarded!
