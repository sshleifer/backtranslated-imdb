Spoilers ..... <br /> <br /> I saw the original on TV a while ago and I remembered that this production was less exciting than most of Beeb's costume drama. I went back to watch on DVD this week and I still have the same impression. At the beginning it is a good story, but it weakens when the heroine becomes so terribly brave and noble, and makes her husband totally vile when he is sick and I became completely irritated with his holiness. I guess this was "right" when the story was written and contributed a lot of anguish, and it was difficult for a woman to be independent of her husband, since the marriage did not do more than his possession, let alone continue scandalously with a lover, since I hope that many of the modern spectators would have liked to see. But today it is difficult to take holiness and especially when this heroine had a strong and courageous admirer ready to defend against each and every one. So re the story as in the film I am equivocal. It is well done according to the novel, but somewhat annoying according to the type of life of today. <br /> <br /> The firm hero Gilbert was certainly a saint to endure the variable and often cryptic behavior of his lady, and persistent and persistent self-denial. be so consistently supportive. So I felt a great shame that when Helen was finally free to be with him, the script did not allow a little more than a minute for them to embrace each other before the titles appeared. This was completely ridiculous when we had been waiting all this time through all that feeling that dripped on the unworthy husband for a bit of decent dialogue and a good hug between hero and heroine. Instead, the ending was as if the filmmakers had run out of time or money or simply could not be bothered. "Here it is: a minute, do what you can in that, then cut it out because the director wants to go home now ..." I felt totally dissatisfied. <br /> <br /> However, very high praises to the performance of Toby Stephens, a perfect and very handsome hero, and Rupert Graves, a very nasty and self-pitying villain. Tara Fitzgerald was successful within the confines of the script that forced her to be a depressing and rather untimely victim most of the time. <br /> <br /> That said, I love these classic dramas and practically all of them are a better look than much of the "modern" drama on television these days. So 7 stars because despite the irritations it is still a good watch.
