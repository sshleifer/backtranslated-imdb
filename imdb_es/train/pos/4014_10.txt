Spoiler for anyone who is lucky enough to see this movie (so it's not really a spoiler after all). I saw this movie when it was released and I can still remember parts of it. Everything is located in a small city in the west or what is left of that city. It is more like a ghost town with few inhabitants. Among them a couple, where the wife is especially evil. She lets her man die at the end of the movie and leaves the city, but has to cross the desert. We never know what will happen next, but just before she leaves, the dying man shoots at her and, deliberately, does not hit her and, instead, the water supply. She is not aware that she will soon be very thirsty. Mark Damon kills a couple of bad guys in a fun mansion, but that's another story, which I do not remember very well. The remaining impression of the film was that it was one of the first times I saw a really evil woman in the movie, who pretends to be anything but evil; can not be compared to the witch of "Snowwhite", which, by comparison, is easy to discover very tight West with few main characters and still absorbing.
