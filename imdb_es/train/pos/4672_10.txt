I saw Brother's Shadow at the Tribeca Film Festival and I loved it! Judd Hirsch and Scott Cohen are great as father and son. The film follows Scott Cohen from his probation in Alaska to his family in Brooklyn. He appears there because his brother has died, and embarks on a journey to slowly repair his separate relationships with his brother's wife and son and his father, who has never forgiven him for being the black sheep of the family. The story takes us deep into the hearts and minds of this family and allows you to understand more deeply the complexity of their lives. In addition, the images of the wood business and the backdrop of Brooklyn set the tone for this rich and revealing family portrait.
