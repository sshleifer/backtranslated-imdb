WWE needed a savior when Wrestlemania 14 came around. The departure of Bret Hart and the subsequent evaporation of the Hart Foundation left the Vile D-Generation X stable in the WWE. His despicable leader Shawn Michaels had stolen the title to Hart thanks to the interference of Vince McMahon and, with the help of his cohorts, Triple H and Chyna had systematically eliminated anyone who challenged his supremacy. But at the Royal Rumble a new contender had emerged. Stone Cold Steve Austin. Hated by McMahonagement, Austin had DX worried. So worried, in fact, that they had requested the help of "The worst man on the planet", Mike Tyson, as a special executor. Austin would have the odds firmly against him in his title match with Shawn Michaels. <br /> <br /> But first, there was a undercard that started with the Legion of Doom winning an unforgettable battle of 15 Royal teams to become NO.1 contenders for the titles on the label. In fact, I had forgotten that this party existed until I saw the PPV again. Not very good and really highlighted the lack of depth in the label division in that period. <br /> <br /> The next game saw the light heavyweight title championed by champion Taka Michonoku against Aguila. The WWE had established the Light Heavyweight Title to compete with the strong Cruiseweight Division in the WCW. It was not successful and this was the only time the title was defended at Wrestlemania. Short match, which lasts about five minutes and, in fact, too short to achieve much. The little they did was exciting and this was a nice little game in which Taka retained his title. <br /> <br /> Well, in our next game, the DX Triple H member defended the European WWE title, which won in Shawn Michaels mocking fashion in RAW in December and had not defended in PPV, against Owen Hart, the only survivor. Triple H had a great entry with the DX band there to interpret their theme. Chyna accompanied Triple H to ringside, but was then handcuffed to WWE Commissioner Sgt Slaughter. Triple H and Owen have a nice little game, before Chyna interfered, which caused a low blow in Hart that leads Triple H to retain the title. Good game, could have been great if it had lasted a little longer. <br /> <br /> But, of course, we would not like to waste time in our next game, in which Marc Mero and Sable defeated Goldust in real life. and Luna Vachon in the first mixed-label match at Wrestlemania in 8 years. And, in all honesty, it was not worth waiting for. While it is not terrible, the game was not memorable either. This was the end of Mero's only career in the WWE and the main purpose was to continue the disintegration of his relationship with Sable. <br /> <br /> Next, we saw Ken Shamrock come back and cost him the Intercontinental Championship. while he destroyed the IC Champion The Rock, but then refused to release his ankle block, prompting the referee to reverse his decision. This was a short match, but decent for what it was. <br /> <br /> Next, the first good match of the night was seen when the WWE Tag Team Champions, the New Age Outlaws lost their titles to Cactus Jack and Chainsaw Charlie in funny garbage container match . The decision was overturned the following night, since Cactus and the chainsaw had thrown to the Outlaws to a dump in the backstage, instead of the one that was used in the combat, but still it was a fun party. <br /> <br /> Now it was time for the first long-awaited meeting between Kane and his brother the Undertaker. Kane had cost Undertaker the WWE Championship at the Royal Rumble and then "killed" him when he helped Shawn Michaels lock Undertaker in a coffin and set fire to him as revenge for the Undertaker that set his parents' house on fire and He left it horribly disfigured years before. This was a decent match and told a beautiful story as Underataker absorbed everything Kane could throw at him and then knocked him down with three tombstones to finish the game. <br /> <br /> This left only the main event that saw the WWE The champion faces Steve Austin with Mike Tyson as guest executor. Michaels had suffered a debilitating back injury in his bout with the Undertaker at the Royal Rumble and was notable in this bout despite his physical limitations. Triple H and Chyna were banished to the back at first after interfering from outside. The game ended with Austin dodging an attempt at Sweet Chin Music and beating Stone Cold Stunner with the referee knocked down. TYson then entered the ring to count all three, celebrating the victory with Austin and then eliminating Michaels after the game. It turned out that Tyson and Austin were together and the cat had been playing with the mouse all the time. <br /> <br /> That was the last PPV game for Shawn Michaels for four and a half years. It helped Austin become the biggest star in the wrestling business, and the general publicity gained by Tyson's presence proved to be a turning point in the WWE battle with WCW. Austin would become the biggest star in WWE history, and along with Rock, Mick Foley, Undertaker and Triple H lead the WWE through the period in which they would get their highest level of cultural relevance. And it all started here at Wrestlemania 14.
