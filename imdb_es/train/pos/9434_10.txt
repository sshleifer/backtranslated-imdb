I remember seeing this movie on TV a few years ago and not having paid all the attention, maybe even the first half was missing, so I came to the conclusion that it was boring and overvalued. I decided to visit him again last night to see if I had missed anything the first time. I certainly did. This is one of the most disturbing and amazing movies of all time and it has clearly had a lot of influence on today's movies and probably will forever. I can not believe I thought this movie was boring! <br /> <br /> A young Jon Voight and Burt Reynolds give the performance of their careers and are supported by Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox. This story will leave you with a feeling of disgust and fear long after you see it, it is really horrible. Oh, and did I mention that the theme song is great too? Well, it is, and this movie should be seen by fans of the movie everywhere. <br /> <br /> Everyone should watch this movie for the experience. Just do not expect a picnic.
