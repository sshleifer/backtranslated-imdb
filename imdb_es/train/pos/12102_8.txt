This begins a bet between Edgar Allen Poe and a journalist ... Poe bets that man can not spend a whole night in a spooky castle. Well, of course you can, but will you be unharmed? It's hard to tell with all these strange people who are not supposed to be hanging around, including the chilly Barbara Steele. This is a very strange movie since the presentation is in French and English, and alternates several times. Is this done because pieces of dialogue were lost? It is also quite dark and claustrophobic, since one does not see much beyond a small circle of light generated by candles, and there is also a sense of fear and imminent death at all times. This version (in Synapse) is also not censored and I wondered what could be censored in a movie from 1964 until I saw the scene in topless, I guess that could be that. In general, this is pretty good and in black and white gloomy. Barbara Steele definitely makes the movie too. 8 out of 10.
