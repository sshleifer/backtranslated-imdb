Take this film for what it is, not a new version, but a completely different approach to the same concept. It's not an epic like the original, it's more like a popcorn thriller. Visually, it's amazing. Everything else was fine. <br /> <br /> For what it is, I think the movie is amazing, but I like everything Burton has done. People need to calm down and stop acting like it's the end of the world b / c of this movie. It was not supposed to be a remake, and it is not. <br /> <br /> The ending was great. . I took it as a parallel universe.
