['I was too young to remember when I saw this movie for the first time. But I saw it a second time about 7 years ago. My sister told me I had to see it. Now my whole family has memorized it. We quote him at least once a day. I absolutely love this movie. I still laugh after all this time. Sure, it&#39;s about a million, very drunk that is irresponsible. The point is that he still has humanity lost in the others we see in the movie. And that is willing to give up everything for love. I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to laugh. Many laughs. It&#39;s great, sweet, and if you&#39;re a movie buff, it will really change your &quot;Funny&quot; idea. Look at it with a group of your friends or your family and I promise you that you will never have anything to talk about with some lines of Authur in your head. It will make you laugh in the next years. <br /><br /> It is very difficult, in my family, to find a movie that everyone likes. But this movie, it seems to me, brought us closer. And I know he will do the same for you !!']
