"Soylent Green" is one of the best and most disturbing sci-fi movies of the 70s and is still very persuasive even by today's standards. Although defective and a little outdated, the apocalyptic touch and the environmental premise (typical of that time) still feel very disturbing and provoke reflection. The level of quality of this film surpasses most of SF's contemporary films due to its strong cast and some intense sequences that I personally consider classic. The New York of 2022 is a depressing place to be alive, with overpopulation, unemployment, an unhealthy climate and the total shortage of all vital food products. The only form of food available is synthetic and distributed by the company Soylent. Charlton Heston (in great form) plays a policeman who investigates the murder of one of the most outstanding executives of Soylent and runs into scandals and dark secrets ... The script is a bit too sentimental at times and the climax does not come. As a big surprise, the atmosphere is still very tense and strange. The sequence of riots is truly exhausting and easily one of the most gruesome moments in the cinema of the 70s. Edward G. Robinson is, ultimately, impressive in his latest role and there is a great supporting (but too modest) role for Joseph Cotton ("Baron Blood", "The Abominable Dr. Phibes"). THIS is science fiction in my book: a nightmare and inevitable disappearance for humanity! There are no fantasy spaceships with furry monsters that attack our planet.
