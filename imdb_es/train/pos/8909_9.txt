This is a well-known one, so I'm not going to go too deep into it. The basic story is about two teenagers who learn of a viscous extraterrestrial spot that reaches the earth through a meteorite. Human contact with this silt ball burns through the flesh like acid. It also absorbs human bodies making it grow bigger. No one believes teenagers (Steeve McQueen and his girlfriend) and when they finally do, it seems that the bubble can not be stopped. It is very well done for its age and, unlike many other movies of the 50, the pace is quite fast. The story is very unique, and should be seen by any fan of the old science fiction movies and monsters. If you can dig the bad blood of the horror of the 80s, be sure to check the '88 remake too.
