For a long time in my life, either I did not like this movie, or I liked this movie but not as much as much else. I saw him recently (in a sleepover, curiously) and I liked it more than I had done since I was less than 6 years old or something like that. Now I appreciate it more, as I do with some other Disney classics I've seen recently (like "Sleeping Beauty" and "Pinnochio" or as it is spelled). <br /> <br /> Now I really appreciate the animation, the ingenious twists of the "Disney" plot, the humor of the mice, the expressed emotions and the plot. The animation is very well done, it often seems that you are wherever the other characters are, looking at them. The animation also shows well the styles of the backgrounds, including the city (shown twice briefly). Disney changes this from the original fairy tale in a surprisingly good way, injecting intelligent twists, like the mice that make the clothes and the key part (I do not usually like Disney movies very much if they are not so similar to the original story ), but this does not bother me too much. I feel like they made the necessary changes to make this a good Disney movie. Often, I do not think Disney has changed the book in a good way in some of his films). <br /> <br /> You already know the story, Cinderella is a girl who works for her horrible stepmother and stepsisters. She goes to the ball with the help of her fairy godmother and loses a glass slipper ... <br /> <br /> This is a movie that can be watched with other people. The immediate family is not good enough. To enjoy this, I recommend that you look with friends (and immediate family, if you like. :-)). <br /> <br /> I recommend this to people who like Disney at least a little, to people who like fairy tales and to people who like mice. Enjoy! :-)
