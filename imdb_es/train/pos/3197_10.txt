If you're a Crispin Glover fan, you should see this. If you are a Sean Penn fan, you should see this. If you are a fan of movies in general, you should see this. If he has no idea who Crispin Glover is and he has no idea who Sean Penn is, it is likely that this film still has a lot of value, but the more work he has previously seen by Crispin or Sean, the better. <Br /> <br /> This movie is very funny, but it is also pure genius. There's nothing I know that looks like this movie. It is your own gender. I doubt that something like that will be done again. I can not say anything else about exactly why I did not spoil it partially, and some of the other reviews here have already done a good job of doing so. <br /> <br /> In response to any of the reviewers here who gave a bad review, I ask you to watch the movie again. Actually, there is no point at which this movie can be called "boring". This is possibly the funniest, entertaining and least boring movie ever made. And it only improves with age and repeated visits. A timeless classic that, unfortunately, very few will be able to say. <br /> <br /> Beaver Trilogy is the brilliant work of director Trent Harris, also responsible for the incredible Rubin and Ed, which Crispin Glover also stars. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the copies of this movie are rare and hard to find. However, I managed to find a VHS version after a diligent search, and there are a couple of ways to find it that I know of. But I really want someone to put this on a DVD.
