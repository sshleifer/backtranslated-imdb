Jack Frost is really a great movie. I mean ... It's funny. It's violent. and very nice Most people say that it is classified B, but that could not be further from the truth. It has great special effects and good acting. The only weird thing is, of course, the snow killer. I think this movie was actually one of the best movies of the late nineties. Most movies these days lack the criteria of a Clive Barker masterpiece. That is, be original and give the viewer what he does not expect. Jack Frost is very cool. 10 of 10. Grade: A +. Ed also recommends The Movie Uncle Sam to Fans of Jack Frost.
