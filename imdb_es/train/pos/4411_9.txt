Easily, 9 out of 10 for a movie per director will continue to grow to admire. But do not watch this movie waiting to be "entertaining". Ang Lee has an objective view of a relatively unexplored aspect of the Civil War. What is beautiful about the film, like all Lee's films, is that he does not "ally" with his characters. Create characters, embody them with life, problems and ambiguity ... and give them a reality that often hits much closer to home than many feel comfortable. This movie has action, but it is not for action lovers, since violence is deeply disturbing and far from gratuitous ... that is, like the characters, it is real. And as one would expect from one of humanity's most horrible wars, violence is horrible. <br /> <br /> But as an exploration of the greatest human ambiguity that surely lived within the Civil War, it is a masterpiece. Was the war on slavery and an abolitionism? Lee seems quite willing to blur that popular line in representations such as Blue and Gray. However, it is not idealism either, as seen in What the Wind Takes. It is about freedom, about the desire to have something that is yours and to fight for it. While observing the characters, he will ask himself "how can they be fighting to preserve slavery?" The fact is that I do not think they really are, and that the film shows the problem of why so many were caught in the vortex of the Civil War. <br /> <br /> The fact seems clear that many of the characters we learn about are fighting for loyalty to the "home", although they may never have examined what the home represents or if they truly defend their values . The scenes of letters are very moving but subtle. Jake and Daniel are other examples of loyalty stretched to the limits. And when the tension finally breaks down, and these characters suddenly find themselves "free" ... we see the birth of new men. <br /> <br /> All this mixed with the beautiful incorporation of Lee to the environment of humanity with breathtaking views and landscapes. Lee frames has a style that is his, somehow European in his "art" (slow motion, no hassles), Asian in his epic and story development, and yet somehow, familiar and easily accessible for many in the North Americans. <Br /> <br /> Relax, put aside your preconceptions about what the Civil War is, what the "western" is as a genre, what should be a war movie ... and let Ang Lee takes you to a world so fragile, so hard, so real that few of us can see it comfortably. <br /> <br /> In this, Lee continues what he did in Ice Storm. Once again, the film is slow and without an apparent "direction" ... a sure sign of Lee's ability to direct without "imposing" himself on the story or the screen. His direction is amplified by what he gets from Jewel (yes, the singer), an actress so far unproven that presents an incredible performance. <br /> <br /> A movie for those who love cinema and are not movie lovers. Standard Hollywood Epic.
