There are not many things that happen in this movie, but many meanings. The woman thought she had everything she could in life, but that was not true, and she found out when she met this person who was doing research for her next job. There really should be more types of movies like this, I'm not as old as considered "mature" (im 13 by the way) and I still have the idea and the point of the movie. The main point is in my opinion: DO NOT THINK YOU CAN NOT HAVE A BETTER LIFE, ONLY BECAUSE YOU HAVE THIS CURRENTLY. <br /> <br /> Although I must admit that I was thinking of watching another movie, but after reading all the reviews and watching the trailer, I decided on this one, even though I knew there would not be much action in the movie. I recommend anyone who watches this movie because it has very good points in the movie and it is a really good ending.
