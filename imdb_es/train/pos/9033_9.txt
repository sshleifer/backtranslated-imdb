I saw this movie without knowing anything about it and it seemed thematically similar to Billy Elliott (2000). Both films are based on a problematic parent / child relationship. In both films, the son does not want to follow his father through the mines and dreams of a better life far away from his hometown. Both children make fun of their classmates and both have a strong female model that teaches them. <br /> <br /> The main difference I found among the films was that October Sky was an infinitely more interesting and moving film. Laura Dern presents a moving performance and Chris Cooper plays the father who disapproves very well as he did in American Beauty (1999). Joe Johnston surprised me with his subtle direction, very different from his other roles as director Jumanji (1995) and Jurassic Park III (2001). <br /> <br />
