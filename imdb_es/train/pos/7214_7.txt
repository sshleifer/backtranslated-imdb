The death tape of Ira Levin is one of those mystery movies in the tradition of Sleuth that would be very easy to spoil if a real examination of the plot of the film is made. Therefore, I will be brief in saying that it is a play, a man who is a famous mysterious playwright, another man who is a promising writer, the dramatist's wife, who is much younger and sexier than he should be. to have been the paper, and a German psychic. for the trip. The director Sidney Lumet, who is no stranger to the film, is pretty good at the most to create the tension that the film needs to move. The dialogue is fast, fresh and witty. Michael Caine excels in roles like these. Christopher Reeve is useful and actually grows in you the more you see him act. Irene Worth stands out as the fun psychic. What about Dyan Cannon? I love how Lumet packed his back in those real tight pants and made him possibly wear the most comfortable blouses, but it's terribly incomprehensible in this role, a role that should have been assigned to an older and less seductive actress. But why object to an obvious attempt to bribe your male spectators when nothing will change it now? Deathtrap is fun, sophisticated, witty and elegant. The mystery has some obvious shortcomings that diminish a bit, and I was not entirely satisfied with the ending, but seeing Caine and Reeve under Lumet's direction with Levin's high verbiage was enough to capture my interest and keep him captive throughout the movie.
