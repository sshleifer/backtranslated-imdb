['As other reviewers have pointed out, this is one of Tarzan&#39;s best films. However, unlike others, I like the beginning of the film, since it feels like a fairly accurate description of what a commercial publication should have been like. In addition, the exhibition is needed to find out why Harry wants to return to the jungle. In addition, the beginning of the film contains one of the most exciting and terrifying chase sequences ever made. This happens when Harry&#39;s safari group has to overcome a tribe of cannibals. The production values of pre-censorship add much realism, and genuinely represent the terrible dangers that awaited Europeans entering the jungle. The film also offers, though perhaps before, an accurate account of how horribly treated native Africans were by their white employers. Besides the sexy Jane, thousands of elephants, some great sets and two chetas! Do not miss an adventure classic.']
