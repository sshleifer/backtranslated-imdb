... Do not read any summary of the plot because, in words, the plot may seem trivial, brainless and meaningless. The film is excellent, the performance of both Denzel and Dakota (she will go very high, trust me) is simply fabulous, and the plot is amazing. Actually, "fabulous" is a small word to use with such talented actors. The movie is only based on real events and some characters are not fictional, a fact that adds to the impact I had during and after the movie. If you like the two actors and the movies a little upset, you have not seen your favorite ... Trust me, in the end you will have a strange and inexplicable feeling. The movie is amazing, see it, rent it, buy it or whatever ... just do not miss it
