When Philo Vance (Edmund Lowe) stands precariously on the edge of a balcony overlooking the city, seemingly hypnotized and almost dying, he immediately reminded me of an almost identical scene in another film made nine years later. "The woman in green" , in which Sherlock Holmes (Basil Rathbone) is also about to launch into space while being hypnotized. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, both Philo Vance and Sherlock Holmes survive these assassination attempts by unscrupulous criminals. Exciting cinematic suspense in both scenes. When will they learn that you can not cloud the minds of the great fiction detectives?
