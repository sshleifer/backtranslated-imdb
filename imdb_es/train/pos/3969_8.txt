Has anyone noticed that James Earl Jones is the waiter who is serving when Hagarty's wife reveals that she is pregnant while they are at the restaurant next to the lake? I saw this movie in a video that I had recorded on television. When I saw this scene, I thought I recognized Jones' voice when the "waiter" laughed at the end. I rewound the tape and then slowly stepped on that part while the camera backed up and showed it to the waiter. Listen carefully as the waiter laughs when Hagarty looks up and tells her they're going to have a baby, then watch carefully or slow down when the camera shows the waiter, though, quickly.
