['I came across this movie when I read a book (written in the 1970s) about Mitchell Leisin&#39;s career. I must admit that over the years I have seen many of his films and I think that his best work is of very high quality. SWING HIGH, SWING LOW was supposed to be one of their best. While I was not bored, I was not as impressed as HOLD BACK THE DAWN, DEATH TAKES A HOLIDAY, KITTY or even GOLDEN EARRINGS. I suspect that now it is too much to be loved. <br /><br /> Working on Paramount Leisin had a problem in those movies that he made that were musical. Most of the scores with which he worked were quite mediocre. It is true that standards twice appeared in his films, but they were really rare cases: &quot;Cocktales for Two&quot; appeared in MURDER AT THE VANITIES, and &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; came out of CAPTAIN CAREY, USA. UU But the rest of the score for MURDER AT THE VANITY was forgettable. &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; was the only song on CAPTAIN CAREY. It should not have been like this: Leisin&#39;s study made Rogers and Hart work for it in the early 1930s. Why could not he have been assigned to a project with them? The score for SWING HIGH, SWING LOW, is nice but forgettable. Unfortunately, the film is centered in the world of entertainment, since Fred Macmurray shows great talents as a trumpeter (he even makes Carole Lombard act in his act when he surrounds her with his arms when he blows the trumpet). The song (sung by Lombard) about how her lover&#39;s lover thrills her is important to the plot. It works in the movie, but it would have been better if the song was more memorable. <br /><br /> The film has a picaresque style: it starts on an ocean liner where Lombard works, as a manicurist. She is constantly being harassed by her boss Franklin Pangborn (the ship&#39;s barber). Then, the ship enters the Panama Canal and we see MacMurray as a soldier, whose enlistment is ending shortly. Their first scene together has a nice touch of Leisin: MacMurray is talking to Lombard, she&#39;s on the boat deck and he&#39;s on the edge of the lock wall. A good way to keep the action going while the dialogue gets a little boring. <br /><br /> The film follows the rise and fall of Skid Johnson (MacMurray) when he meets Lombard, and begins his reputation as a trumpeter, but meets the &quot;other woman&quot; of the film, Dorothy Lamore. The best moments of the film are related to the collapse of the relationship with Lombard and his collapse as a jazz trumpeter (his appearance and need for alcohol is very atypical for a MacMurray character, even his darker figures such as Walter Neff or Sheldrake or The naval officer pushing the Caine Mutiny did not show a dependence on alcohol. <br /><br /> Lombard is good as the woman loved but mistreated by MacMurray. Lamore has little to do really, possibly the film had more scenes with her, but one of the most outstanding is her attempt to get MacMurray back into the car. In its opening part, Pangborn is fine. Rarely noticed in the movies, actor Carl Judels, in a small part, is effective as a fan / friend of MacMurray, who leaves him when he falls (although he gives him a hand). <br /><br /> Charles Butterworth is as trivial in this film as usual, but he has a moment when he shyly looks at his hands on the keyboard of a piano in the rooms he, his girlfriend, MacMurray and Lombard share: his red-faced appearance is to be ashamed of a lie that MacMurray insists is true. It was a pleasant, subtle moment. I wish his subtlety had been in his performance instead of his moments of shy humor.']
