I really love this movie, I saw it again last week after 3 years or so. This movie is perfect, excellent acting, great story, excellent direction / camera work / music. It is a gift to show to someone you love. Too bad, Jaco Van Dormael did not make any more movies after this one. Top 5 of work. Seriously! <br /> <br /> Today, 3 years and 3 days later, the previous comment. It was never published because it did not have more than 10 lines. Anyway, I saw "le huitieme jour" again yesterday. This is, without a doubt, in my top 3. movie along with "Cinema Paradiso", which is also a masterpiece. The soundtrack is also very good. I'm very curious about the new movie "jaco von dormael". I hope you complete my top 3 of the movie. If you see this movie, you can rent it. Or better. Buy it Because you will want to see him again.
