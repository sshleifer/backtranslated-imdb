As a convert to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I try to absorb as much as I can from the history of my new religion. I was invited to attend a screening of this film with my children and the other young men and women, as well as the families of our neighborhood. <br /> <br /> On a beautiful spring afternoon, we went to Kirtland, Ohio, to the historic village of the church located there. We had to have reservations at the Vistor Center to watch this movie. Since the visualization of my film was limited to a few documentaries of the church, I was intrigued. The only "complete film images" of the church I had seen were "Legacy" and "My Best Two Years," both seemed very well written and preformed. <br /> <br /> At the beginning, the missionary interpreter handed out fabrics in which it is said that this film profoundly moved several people. I thought: "It's okay ... but it takes me a lot to cry". Imagine my surprise when I found myself sobbing! It really is a very moving and inspiring testimony for the Prophet Joseph Smith. <br /> <br /> See it and believe in its powerful message!
