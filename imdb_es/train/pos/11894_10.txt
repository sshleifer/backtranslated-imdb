A truly adorable heroine who, in turn, is surprised and terrified by giblets, struggles with mattresses, runs to closed doors ... just some of the moments that shine in my memory of "The naked truth". I LOVED what caught my attention in this program: the fun diagrams and some good supporting characters provided the setting for the show's diamond: Tea Leoni as 'Nora Wilde'; Cute, clown and wonderfully prone to accidents. How comforting to see an actress who can play clowns. No wonder Hollyood does not know how to choose it. But where are the DVD releases? The amount of (bleep) they throw, it's amazing to me that this little gem is still buried. (Someone please correct me if I'm wrong.)
