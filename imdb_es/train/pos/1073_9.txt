It took us a couple of episodes to "enter" Dark Angel as a story and a series, since we were making the transition from The Sopranos, a very different mentality framework. But, once we get to the essence of the series, we get hooked very quickly. It's a shame that the series ended just when it was just beginning to pass to the excellent category: Dark Angel was much more than his average TV series. He kicks and staggers about the action, but the interactions of the characters and the reactions of society to the "mutants" remind us of the constant prejudices we face (and do) every day. That history is established in the future maintains the surreal environment and prevents the anti-discrimination message from being erased in our faces (therefore, it does not ruin the "fun" for those who do not like to be taught during entertainment ), but all events and human / social interaction remains relevant to the present. We all make judgments, we face our own prejudices, but in the end, the question of who you are is: do you sit and close your mind to that, or do you get up and do something about it? For those who have no choice but to fight, for survival or justice, this series gives them power. For those who have never had to face the question, this series "sneaks in" that message under the guise of pure action entertainment. It is much more well done and well written than most television series; I'm very disappointed that it ends before it can really get going.
