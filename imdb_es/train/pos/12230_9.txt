['THE MAN MELTING ... a tragic victim of the space race, MELTING perished ... he had never understood that the race was gone AFTER ...! <br /><br /> A man (Burr DeBenning) burns his hand on the stove in the kitchen. But instead of shouting something that a NORMAL person would scream, shout something that sounds like &quot;AAAAATCH-KAH !!&quot; This movie you&#39;ve appeared in ... it&#39;s not a normal movie. You have just taken your first step towards THE INCREDIBLE MELTING MAN, the famous gore movie of the late 70&#39;s with the wonderful makeup effects of Rick Baker. Baker was about to become a superstar, and he did this at the same time as his famous &quot;alien canteen&quot; in STAR WARS. For some strange reason, STAR WARS became a household name, and the INCREDIBLE MELTING MAN did not. <br /><br /> It may have something to do with the fact that this movie is just horrible. From the opening credits (&quot;Starring Alex Rebar as THE INCREDIBLE MAN MELTING&quot; ... that&#39;s what it says!), Even the chubby nurse running through a glass door, to the head of the fisherman through a waterfall and destroying itself graphically in some Rocks, this film provides many, many moments of absolute incomprehensibility. &quot;Why they ... but how is it ... why are they ...?&quot; After a while, you stop asking yourself why and you see it for what it is: a very entertaining piece of trash. <br /><br /> An astronaut returns to Earth in a fusion and radioactive state; He escapes and, his mind is disintegrating just like his body, begins a mad slaughter that melts. The authorities quickly decide that the melting man should be stopped, but (probably not wanting to &quot;cause a panic&quot;) he wants to be captured as quietly as possible. So they send a guy with a geiger counter behind him. Wow. <br /><br /> In the sense of history, surprisingly little happens during the movie. The boy who melts roams killing people. A doctor looks for him with a geiger counter. Several characters are presented, ask questions and leave. Finally, the doctor catches up with the melted man, but a security guard shoots him for no reason, after he explains he is &quot;Dr. Ted Nelson.&quot; The melting man moves away and finally dissolves into a large puddle of goo. The end. <br /><br /> It is so naive that somehow ends up being very funny, despite a rather negative ending. Supposedly, a wide-screen DVD release is planned. A very special movie']
