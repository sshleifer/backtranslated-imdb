Oh, noir. My favorite genre The follow-up of "Laura" by Otto Preminger is a film noir that takes place in a postwar period in New York, where corruption and violence are unleashed. It stars Dana Andrews as Sergeant Mark Dixon, a detective whose brutal tactics have brought him to the surface with his superiors. <br /> <br /> When he accidentally kills a murder suspect, Dixon tries to blame crime boss Tommy Scalese. Dixon is close to achieving his goal when he becomes involved with the dead man's wife, the beautiful Morgan Taylor. Of course, typically noir, things quickly go downhill. <br /> <br /> While the film does not do anything interesting in terms of camera or narrative, it has a constant tone of fear and sadness. Like most great noirs, it also has a wonderful rhythm, sucking the viewer from the beginning. <br /> <br /> However, like most of Preminger's professional films, it's not something I can see again. He lacks Wilder's verbal wit, Hitchcock's visual extravagance, or Welles's spatial experimentation. Like Lang's later work, "Sidewalk" feels like a "clone" of what a noir should be, rather than something genuinely artistically genuine. <br /> <br /> Thematically the film is nothing special. It is a policeman who is slowly becoming a criminal. In one scene, Dixon explains that his own father was a petty thief, the film flirted with the notion of predestination, but this scene is as far away as Otto, or dares to take his ideas. <br /> <br /> The camera work is also disappointing. There is no intelligence in Otto's camera. No effort is made to assign the camera to anything. It does not play with space or architecture or emphasize the police procedure step by step. It's just a tripod configuration with the occasional entry and exit platform. It does not make sense, although most people do not care about these things. <br /> <br /> However, there is a good shot in which our hero is trapped in a car full of gang members (black cage) who in turn enters a lift vehicle (another cage) and takes the gang leader. den. Like "Blue Velvet" by Lynch, Otto rethologizes the film, constantly compares "up" with hell. This works well, but the design of the set does not reinforce it. <br /> <br /> 7/10 - Otto seems content to follow the Hawaiian mold of what a noir is, instead of playing with the possibilities of where he can go noir. As "Detour", "Night in the city", "Scarlet Street", "In a lonely place", "Act of violence", "Bomberang" and "Johnny Eager", "Where the sidewalk ends" is one of those well They did second level noirs. It is competent and attractive, but lacks that extra special magic.
