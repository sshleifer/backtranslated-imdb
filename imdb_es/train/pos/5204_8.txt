I do not see much porn, but I love porn stars. And I love bloody movies. So when I found out about a gore movie of a porn star, I was really excited. Of course, that was years ago and when I found out about all the problems in making and finishing the film, I never thought I would really see it. But I did it and I'm not ashamed to admit that I loved it, even with all its faults. <br /> <br /> First, the failures. The story takes place in Ireland and is called Samhain, but the story he seems to want to tell is about the Sawney Beane clan of Scotland. So why do not we put it there and skip the third grade report on Samhain / Irish immigrants / Halloween? Also, break your own rules by claiming that you are safe on the trails, but then the cannibal mutants just start running around. It is never clear how many cannibals we are dealing with. There is a large stone castle that is obviously old, but nobody has noticed it before. The references of self-conscious horror films are annoying and so are the characters. The heroine has a flashback montage of all her dead friends that include a character she NEVER GOT TO KNOW. The end does not make sense. <br /> <br /> So, what works? The gore! Of course I would have liked more, but it was refreshing to see such an unpleasant movie that I did not fear being anything other than a bloody film. Two murders are over and Taylor Hayes has a good filthy scene. The two savage murders even receive extended shots on the DVD. I've always kept in mind that Gore can overcome a stupid story and Evil Breed reinforced it.
