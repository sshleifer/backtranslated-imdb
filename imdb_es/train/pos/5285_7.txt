You will think that a bit of tourism awaits you when the premise of the film takes place mainly between two characters, since they travel more or less 3000 miles from France to Saudi Arabia, passing through most of Europe: Italy, Bulgaria, Croatia and Slovenia . , Turkey, before reaching the Middle East. But this is not a tour, and there are no stops to immerse yourself in the views. <br /> <br /> Reda's father is in his twilight and wants to do the Haj. However, since walking and taking the mule is out of the question, he decides to travel to Mecca by car. He can not drive, and therefore requests Reda's help, for his son's protest, to take him there in his broken down vehicle. <br /> <br /> But Reda does not see the point of accompanying him. , when his dad could choose the plane. He resents the idea of ​​having put on hold his personal life for this pilgrimage that he could not understand. And therefore, we embark on this arduous journey with father and son, not being the best of friends. <br /> <br /> The beauty of this film is to witness the development of the father and son couple, the challenges they face. They face, the strange people they meet, who have to face varied weather conditions, and alternate rest stops between motels and sleep in the car. We see an obvious generational gap in them trying to communicate with each other, the father trying to impose himself on his son and the son trying to assert himself as an adult, but circumstances reveal that Reda is a fish out of water. . Through many encounters, they actually come together quite well despite their differences. <br /> <br /> It is likely that this film will be released here last week to coincide with Hari Raya Haji, and have the opportunity to see our protagonists. Join the other pilgrims in their Haj. The final scene in Mecca is truly a sight to behold, and you would also feel the claustrophobia and fear when Reda tries to hunt her father among the thousands of people who congregate. The views of Europe may not have been treated deliberately, in order to increase anticipation and focus on the final destination. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, the idea came to mind of telling and showing your loved ones how much you appreciate. They for who they are. Do not miss this, and yes, book in advance. I was pleasantly surprised that tonight's session was still a complete event.
