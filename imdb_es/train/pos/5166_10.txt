Indian summer! It was very nostalgic for me. I found it fun, comforting, and I loved it! Anyone who went to the camp as a child and sometimes wishes to be able to return to the "good ole days" for a short time really needs to see this one! It begins about 20 years later, a group of old campers returns for a "reunion". I will not comment more on the plot because you have to see it for yourself. The actors were great, and it contains a cast of stars. Everyone in her played a tremendous role. You really felt like you were part of the movie watching it. Alan Arkin was especially good in his role as Uncle Lou. Play the kind of person everyone would want to have in their lives. This is also a good family movie for the most part. I would suggest this to anyone in an instant! Highly recommended!
