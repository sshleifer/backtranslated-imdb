The first time I saw "Breaking Glass" was when it was released in England in 1980. I loved it and, having captured it in August 2005 at a Canadian station, it's still great. The only thing I regret is that I can not find the sound track or the DVD in the stores? ... nobody cares to throw some light or I have to ask an Internet company that has an excessive price. But back to the movie, the music stands the test of time, Hazel / Kate had something to say about the 80's in Britain ... it was actually the same decade that I moved to Canada for some of the same reasons : "Thatcher" and what she was doing to the country at that time. Please, if you have the opportunity to see this movie, you will not regret it!
