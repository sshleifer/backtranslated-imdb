Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) is the host of a cheap horror show. After he learns that his dead aunt has left him some things, he goes to England to pick it up, hoping it is some money. But to her horror, Elvira discovers that everything her aunt has left her is her house, her dog and a cookbook. Elvira decides to settle in the house anyway, but with her striking dark looks and impressive features, she will not be able to live in peace. All the neighbors are now putting the whole city against it, and with the attitude and the indignation of Elvira, everyone should take care of themselves, because Elvira is on fire! I really enjoyed this movie, it's very funny to see how Elvira gets involved in all these adventures, it's great. The whole movie puts you in a Halloween mood, of course, it's silly and the jokes are cheap, but it's a pleasure to see them. I would give Elvira, Mistress Of The Dark 8/10
