['What can I say about a story like this? This magical tale has followed me since my childhood, evoking warm memories in my heart. The characters take you to so many whimsical places that make you want more of each scene. For example, in the market there were so many different flavors of tradition. I loved the exotic dancers that accompanied the steel drums. <br /><br /> The story was wonderful. She wanted so much that Landsbury decided to stay with the precocious children and that she would also stay with Mr. Brown, and find the other half of the spell so that men with less armor could win the war. <br /><br /> I&#39;m still a child inside, and this movie attracts my inner child like no other. This movie is my favorite favorite of all time. I hope that all children can see this classic and be swept away and transported to another era.']
