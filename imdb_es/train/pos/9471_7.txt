['Steve Carell plays Dan Burns, uncle of the agony of the newspaper and single father dedicated to three girls. In a large family, Dan meets his perfect wife, only to discover that he is in a relationship with his brother. <br /><br /> What should a man do? <br /><br /> I really liked &quot;Dan In Real Life&quot;, but I imagine that the success or not of this movie will depend on whether you are willing to accept that Steve Carell plays a relatively direct and moderate role, instead of going through the broad comedy. Movements that have made it so successful. If you can not accept it, do not be afraid, &quot;Get Smart&quot; will arrive later in the year, but for registration, I thought it was very good. <br /><br /> &quot;Dan In Real Life&quot; begins as your typical family drama, incidentally funny, but it becomes more fun as it progresses and Carell&#39;s frustration grows. It is not massively original (but if you only saw films with original ideas, the cinematographic choices would be very scarce, right?), But &quot;Dan In Real Life&quot; is entertaining and a good cast (who would not fall in love). In love at first glance with the luminous Juliette Binoche?) Make the most of a script that is insightful enough that it contains many reflections on the meaning and passion of love. <br /><br /> I hope Steve Carell tries hard and does something so interesting again.']
