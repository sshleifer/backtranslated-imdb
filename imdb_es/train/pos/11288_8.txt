Considered by almost all critics as the best of the films of Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan, I have no argument about it, although there are a couple of others that I found entertaining. One thing: it's the longest of the series I've seen in 105 minutes. I've only seen six of them, but this was longer than I'm used to and, with the end of action prolonged, I thought everything was a bit too long. <br /> <br /> However, it is a good mix of action, suspense and romance. The only thing missing is the color and stereo sound. Primitive special effects do not bother me, since that was all they had in the 1930s. <br /> <br /> Among some, this movie is more remarkable for one thing: skin! "Jane" never used anything so scarce after this movie, since the Hays Code was instituted when the next Tarzan movie was made. His attire showed the great figure that Maureen O'Sullivan possessed. The naked underwater scene, however, was not her, far from it. The woman under water did not have a good figure, whoever she was. <br /> <br /> Here is a lot of action. Until the end, it was not exaggerated either. However, the ending lasted 15 minutes and was so intense that it was almost too much to see. <br /> <br /> Still, this movie offers everything except "Boy" (his adopted son), you would like to see him in a Tarzan movie, even O'Sullivan doing Tarzan's scream a dozen times. With his pair of "lungs", that was not a problem.
