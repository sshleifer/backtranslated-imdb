Congratulations to CÃ©sar Montano for reviving the Cebuano movie! Panaghoy sa Suba is very good: it has the drama, the action, the romance and the scene that will make you laugh. <br /> <br /> While the story is not so original (a love triangle, or a love of four angles, Japanese occupation, rebellion, American as lord), his presentation is great, especially because he uses his Original language: Bisaya for Filipinos, Nippongo for Japanese and English for Americans. <br /> <br /> This film will become one of the best Pinoy films of this year. <br /> <br /> See this!
