If John Thaw had never played "Morse", "Kavanagh", or starred in "The Sweeney" and other productions, he would be remembered for this wonderfully unforgettable performance on "Goodnight Mr Tom". <br /> <br /> Superbly backed by an equally tremendous performance of his co-star (young Nick Robinson in his first role) and a discreet cast, this adaptation of Michelle Magorian's charming novel is an appropriate reminder for his art. <br /> <br /> When I read this story of an elderly widow from Norfolk who had to accommodate a young man from London before and during the Blitz, I found a fairly obvious timeline error, and the credit must go to the creators of this movie to rectify this. error. They should also be applauded for not too much sentimentalizing the story, and avoiding what might have become, quite easily, a soft mess. <br /> <br /> If you keep a CD or a video library, this will make you feel good. Made for the television movie is an absolute inclusion.
