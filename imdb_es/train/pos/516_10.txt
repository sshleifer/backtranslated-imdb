['One of the few best movies of all time. The change from Black and White to Color for the Sequences of Heaven and Earth was the excellence of the Direction. <br /><br /> The Plot is extremely intelligent, the whole movie leaves you overwhelmed by all the human emotions and, although it is a war movie, it does not discriminate. I must have seen this movie more times than any other, and I never tire of it. It is a movie that makes you question your own mortality and beliefs about what happens after our disappearance.']
