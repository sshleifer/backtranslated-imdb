Gandhi, my father is like seeing a book, chapter by chapter, you read it (with your eyes) and learn more about Harilal Gandhi and especially Kasturba Gandhi. Very little is known about both and this movie describes them in a unique way. The title deceives, however, is both a film about Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and his son, and about Harilal and his mother. And Akshaye Khanna and Shefali Chayya do full justice to their respective roles. <br /> <br /> Such films are like leap years. They come alone after so long. <br /> <br /> My father Gandhi, is also about an internal struggle, which is sometimes more difficult than any fight for freedom ever undertaken. <br /> <br /> Look at it, If you like quality cinema.
