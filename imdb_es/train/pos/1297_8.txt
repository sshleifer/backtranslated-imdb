Faithful adaptation of an ingenious and interesting French novel about a cynical and depressed software engineer of middle age (or something like that), which depends to a large extent on the narration in the first person, but nothing worse for that. Weak (in a way small bourgeois), philosophical and black humor, the best way to describe both the film and the novel is that it is something more like a more intellectual Charles Bukowski (without disrespecting CB). Mordantly fun, but also with a grim analysis of social and sexual relationships, the movie's great achievement is that it reflects real life in a manner so recognizable as to make you ask: why are there no other movies like this? One of the rare examples of a good book that makes an equally good movie.
