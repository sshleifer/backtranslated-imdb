This movie was a brilliant concept. It was original, ingeniously written and of great appeal to those of us who are not really "conformist" film collectors. Do not get me wrong, there are some great movies that have great appeal, but when you go to see a movie based on "everyone else is watching it", you know you're a pre-teen or you do not have an opinion. This had a lovely, subtle mood, even though most people probably only looked at the obvious. The actors portrayed their characters with aplomb and I thought there was much more "personal" personality in this movie. It has an appeal for children, as well as adults. Esp. Pleased to find a good movie that is not full of sexual references and drug hints! A great movie, which should not be overlooked in terms of public consumption. This is a must purchase.
