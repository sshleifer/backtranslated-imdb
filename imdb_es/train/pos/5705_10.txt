A wonderful early musical film by Rene Clair, as funny and witty as his silent "The Straw Straw Hat". Using the sound in an expressive way and not only for dialogues and effects, Clair influenced the first musicals of America (the opera scene of A Night at the Opera is strongly influenced by Le Million, for example). It should (but not) be seen by all moviegoers, and the Criterion DVD is exactly as good as you would expect. There are not a lot of extras, but most of the DVDs I've seen are useless and Clair's interview on the record is one I've never seen. Get it while it's still around.
