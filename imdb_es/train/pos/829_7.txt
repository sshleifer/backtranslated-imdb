I admit that I thought this movie was not going to be good, but soon I changed my mind. The movie was to keep you guessing in which direction it is going. Pierce Broson is amazing in his role as hitman, who suddenly burns and asks for help from a man he met in a Mexican bar. Greg Kinnear is an amazing heterosexual man, like his role as an educated man from Denver, who starts an innocent conversation with Pierce in a Mexican bar. The movie will make you laugh while Pierce offers hilarious phrases (mostly about sex). <br /> <br /> The imaginary in this movie is very well done, especially in the bullfight scene and when Pierce sees himself when he tries to finish his last works.
