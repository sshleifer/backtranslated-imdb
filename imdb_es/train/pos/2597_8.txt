['Ulysses as a film should not be compared in any way with the novel, since they are two completely different entities. However, having said that, the film still manages to keep many of the elements that made the book work, but since it is a visual medium, it is more difficult to extract the stream of consciousness. I think this is the best movie they could have done with the material ... and this is from someone who usually criticizes that the films are not like their literary counterparts. I recommend the book, but the movie is still entertaining.']
