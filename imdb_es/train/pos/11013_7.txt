There were many films made by Hollywood during the war years that were designed to gain public support for our troops. Seen today, some might fire them or simply see them as propaganda, what they technically are, but of a positive kind and destined to unify the nation. This film is a very effective and entertaining example of the genre, with a fairly realistic script and good production values. Pat O'Brien plays almost the same character he played in MANY other movies (you know, the tough guy, strong, but "good guy"). Randolph Scott is, as always, competent and entertaining, and the rest of the extras are excellent (look for a young Robert Ryan as one of the bombers in training). While the story reminds many other films about our pilots and crews, the film is elaborate enough to make it interesting and not too far-fetched. That maybe, except for the end, where the film is a bit exaggerated but also VERY satisfactory. The only important negative aspect, and this is mainly for the nitpickers, is that part of the footage is somewhat carelessly integrated into the film and "crazy" like me, who are history masters and aircraft lovers, will probably notice this, probably everyone else will not notice
