Not on the same level as Ring (or Ring 2) but it's still a good Japanese horror movie. I would like American horror producers to take a page from the Japanese horror squad and put more 'spooky' and less expensive shocks on their films. A lot of good examples in this case, scenes in which a white face is a scene looking behind a young actress, the photographs on a wall suddenly glimpse smiling, just for a second, and more. It's worth checking out if you like the genre.
