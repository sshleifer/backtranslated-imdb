Most Stoogephiles consider this to be the best short bar in Stooges, and they are right. Curly is a scream disguised as drag as "Senorita Cucaracha", and Moe and Larry are in full form as "Senor Mucho" and "Senor Gusto", respectively. The beautiful operatic voice of Christine McIntyre is given free rein (she was actually a trained opera singer) and it is wonderful. The great Gino Corrado is hilarious as a pompous Italian singer terrorized by the Stooges at a society party. Some really funny gags, a good direction and a very tight edition make this rise to the top of the prolific production of the Stooges. What is even more surprising is that Curly had serious health problems at that time, and in several of the shorts he made during this period, you can see that he is obviously ill; his time is far away, he speaks very slowly and with difficulty, and he has trouble moving. Fortunately, his health was on the rise when he made this movie, and it shows. Stooge classic comedy, and enjoyed by fans who are not Stooge (had a girlfriend who could not stand the Stooges, but even she laughed at this). You must see it.
