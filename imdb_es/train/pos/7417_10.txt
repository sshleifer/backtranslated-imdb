This beautiful story of an older son who returns home, and learning to love and be a part of all those things that he left home to get away from, is moving and touching. It shows a society that may be strange to us in the Western world, with a sense of family that we have lost. The story is beautiful, sad, and sometimes funny and comical. It has a sense of realism that it seems we no longer see in our western films. <br /> <br /> The acting is unusual, because as the film progresses, it almost gives the impression that it is not like that. Acting, but a documentary of ordinary people. This is a brilliant direction and creation of movies. <br /> <br /> I would love to see more films by this director.
