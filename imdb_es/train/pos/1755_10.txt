['This movie is a revolt. I can not remember the last time I had such a good time at the movies. I have seen some good comedies in my time and they are usually quite funny. But this is great wall-to-wall lines. I think Best in Show is the last movie I laughed so much and a lot. The film was uninterrupted until the end, when they did the 5 minutes of cleaning the sentimental plot. Apart from that, it is a constant barrage of liner and ridiculous situations. I&#39;d like to see him again before he leaves the theater because it&#39;s like in Zucker&#39;s films, in which the first time you do not get all the jokes. You have to see it two or three times to have it all. <br /><br /> As far as the film itself is concerned, I could have used a better edition, sometimes it&#39;s ragged, but we have to forgive for that. All the characters are great. It is not like an Adam Sandler movie in which he tries to be funny and everyone else suffers around him and they are the butt of the joke. I think I will remember all the main characters in the coming years because they are all very nice. There are no victims in this movie. Also, thank God, they got a 45-year-old actress to play her girlfriend. Catherine Keener plays her and she is a girlfriend in this movie. You only wish that women like her really existed. She is not a &quot;10&quot; like some of the other women leaders, but somehow her smile is warmer than that of Julia Roberts exaggerated. <br /><br /> If you watch the trailer of this movie, you may not consider it too much. I assure you that the trailer does not do it justice. They do not give all the good jokes. Only some of the mediocre. <br /><br /> Ah, one more thing. I hope critics put this on their list of the top ten. Many of them complain that the comedies do not receive the recognition they deserve and then, at the end of the year, they do not put it on their list. This means that Ebert!']
