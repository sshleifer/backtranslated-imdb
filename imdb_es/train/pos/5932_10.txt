The best Stephen King movie along with IT, although this is more fun than terrifying. <br /> <br /> This has it all: <br /> <br /> - a great cast with Alice Krige and Brian Krause and a funny cameo by King himself; <br /> <br /> - Well-dosed horror in a funny story; <br /> <br /> - a great use of music, "Sleepwalk" by Santo & Johnny in particular; <br /> <br /> -ligible characters in a typical King environment: middle of town from nowhere; <br /> <br /> -much mood. You really can not have good fears here because it's too funny and exaggerated; <br /> <br /> - The effects of old but really nice makeup as if they no longer occurred! <br /> <br /> A rating of 4.5: I do not really understand it. When was the last time a horror movie was as fun as this one?
