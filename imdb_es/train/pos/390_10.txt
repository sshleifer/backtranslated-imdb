The first thing I thought when I saw these films was: It's not really a movie, at least it's not what we imagine spontaneously when we hear the word "movie". it is entirely symbolic, everything in it has a figurative meaning. So, if you are not used to expressing things in a symbolic way, you will find it strange, if you are not familiar with philosophy, religion, spiritual life, you will think that it is just a fairy tale ... and even a strange one. chaotic For me "The legend of Zu" is perfectly transparent. And I like. He tells us in images the story of the struggle between light and darkness, the struggle that is as old as humanity, and all those who are searching for meaning in this life face it. The movie is obviously made by Buddhists. I'm not a Buddhist My religion and the vision of the world and the human are different. But to the extent that we are all human and have the same human nature, we necessarily have common experiences and can understand each other. It's a really beautiful movie! And I had more movies like this: movies that have a meaning. There are too many empty stories that only serve to make time pass faster.
