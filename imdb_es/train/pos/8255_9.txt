Fido is a beautiful comedy that deserves wider recognition, especially considering the garbage that is supposed to entertain us these days. <br /> <br /> As already noted, this is not a real zombie movie, but rather a sweet satire that employs the undead to point fingers. While there are necessarily some bloody scenes, there is almost no bleeding and the way this film is presented (style of feeling good in the 50s), I can not imagine that Fido and his classmates suffered that someone really be scared or discouraged. <Br /> <br /> Although the cast is generally good, I felt that Moss and Nelson stood out. Humor is not in your face, but rather moderate; There is a lot of attention to detail and I surprised myself by smiling benignly throughout the film. This is certainly not a masterpiece of cinema, but it does not strive to be so. Instead, Currie manages to offer a touching black comedy.
