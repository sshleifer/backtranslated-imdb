This movie is an extremely funny and moving story about an orphanage that is in financial trouble. When the director goes on vacation, his father agrees to intervene temporarily to manage things. <br /> <br /> This is definitely the best job Leslie Nielson has done. His idea in the movie of renting children is immediately innovative, and his sales techniques will definitely make you laugh. <br /> <br /> The girl in this movie is so sweet and charming that I know I will never forget her. Just make sure you do not miss the first five minutes of the movie! <br /> <br /> This great family entertainment is so rare these days. If you like the photos a little cheesy with happy endings, go for this one! I could see this again and again, and I do it often! My only complaint about this movie is that it is so hard to find a copy.
