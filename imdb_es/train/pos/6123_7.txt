['Before commenting on this movie, you should realize that when I saw this movie, I expected typical trash, horror, film B and just wanted to have fun. Jack Frost is one that not only delivers but is one of the best I&#39;ve seen in a long time. Scott McDonald is great as Jack Frost, in fact I think he has a future in being psychopaths in big movies, if he is given the chance. McDonald is a serial killer who turns into a snowman through a stupid accidental combination of ridiculous elements. However, as soon as the snowman starts to move and kill people, it will be hard not to laugh. The lines that are said are completely delayed but very funny. The fact that the rest of the cast acts in an exaggerated way only increases the stupidity of the film, but his stupidity is his genius. The scene in which the snowman meets the teenager is truly classic in the horror movie B, in fashion. I really hope there is a sequel and I will be there to see it on any cable channel that does. Of course, it&#39;s just fun to watch the first few times and it&#39;s not exactly a good job of film technology, but I like to see snowmen kill people. I gave it a 7 out of 10, this is a great movie for dates and couples in the last hours.']
