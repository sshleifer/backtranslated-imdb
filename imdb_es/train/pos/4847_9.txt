This movie is one of those nostalgic things with me and I never REALLY hope that someone else "understands" it, but I am pleased when I recommend it and someone enjoys it. My late father hated Arthur Askey, but this movie was one he really enjoyed and his constant enthusiasm for "The Phantom Train" and "Old Ted 'Olmes" was transferred to me when I was a child. Years later, I see it from time to time, enjoying the familiarity. I always wonder if it will not be the same, but I have never been disappointed. There is a lot to enjoy. The sequence in the train is truly inspired when Askey and Murdoch proceed to annoy the arrogant passenger. So, the whole section in the station is amazing with so many things that you have to keep up to date. Yes, it's dated and full of British accent and plot details in the war time (based on Arnold Ridley's original play by Dad's Army!) But full of wonderful character performances, including Kathleen Harrison as an old maid. The atmosphere is truly as sinister as that of an Arthur Askey vehicle. This is available cheaply as chips in the UK on DVD, so give yourself a treat. It's a perfect Saturday / Sunday morning or any light day of light entertainment. I thank you ... <br /> <br /> THE OLD MOVIES CAN BE GOOD MOVIES!
