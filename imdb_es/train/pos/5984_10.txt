This is a great movie if you see it in the right context. It was meant to be a parody of teenage devil worship movies (and the 1980s saw many of them)! I saw this movie when it first came out, and I instantly liked it. Being a big KISS fan, it was great to see Gene in the movie. And anything with OZZY as a preacher who hates metal can not be so bad! Also, Fastway was already one of my favorites, so it was great to hear them on the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> The original VHS cover (this was pre-DVD) for Trick Or Treat featured an illustration of Sammi kneeling, playing his guitar in a ring of fire with a "demon" watching. It was a special order, and the price of the VHS copy at that time (around 1987) was $ 90. I really wanted the movie, but not at that ridiculous price. The 'OZZY-Gene' cover was only created for the $ 5 re-launch. The company that posted it probably thought that Gene and OZZY were the only people recognizable in the movie, so it's better to put them on the cover! The same happened with the original "Little Shop Of Horrors": Jack Nicholson was there for five minutes, but now they have it on the cover as if it were the main star. <br /> <br /> I have a "Trick Or Treat" website, and it's amazing, how many people think Sammi Curr was a real person! Fastway helped perpetuate that myth by dedicating his soundtrack album to 'Sammi Curr'. <br /> <br /> In general, it was just a good time, a rock and roll movie. You definitely should not take it too seriously, but just enjoy it!
