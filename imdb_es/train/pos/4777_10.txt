Perhaps the most personal of David Lynch's works is the most accessible. This time, instead of the enigmatic thematic structures that may or may not involve a plot or represent something other than vivid nightmares, Lynch provides a reflective and fragile meditation on the universal themes of aging and family and finds reassurance in both. The real and simple story of an Iowa farmer (Richard Farnsworth) who travels on a lawn mower to Wisconsin to visit his distracted and injured brother, there are still a lot of unique and original visual dream landscapes (some rather surprising aerial shots) of the heart, filmed by the veteran director of photography Freddy Francis) to turn it into an undeniable effort and characterizations of Lynch that are some of its most unforgettable. Farnsworth is excellent in a stoic but nice way, allowing the stories she hears on her trip to become a part of her life, and Sissy Spacek presents some of her best work in a smaller role as her observant and mentally challenged daughter ( whose painful The Secret is revealed in a moving way through a gentle twist in the delicate script of John Roach and Mary Sweeney), but the rest of the small cast to one person offers indelible performances, one of the most notable is Barbara Robertson, whose accidental death of a The deer is at the same time troublemaker and sad. But that is the classic Lynch with its ability to compromise and destabilize you at its best. For those who are not familiar with Lynch or only know him for his violent and disturbing reputation, this is an excellent place to start; For those who know their work, this is one of the best in their repertoire.
