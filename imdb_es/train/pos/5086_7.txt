['When I heard that Patrick Swayze was finally returning to his acting career with KING SOLOMON&#39;S MINES, he was very excited. I was expecting a great Indiana Jones-type action adventure. What I got was an epic of 4 hours (with commercials) that was very slow. The second and third hours could have been abandoned altogether and history would not have suffered for it. The ending was good (there are no spoilers here) but I still had to feel like more. Well, all a man can do is take advantage of Swayze&#39;s &quot;RoadHouse 2&quot; so he can go back to the action genre that made him famous. Until then, if you are a fan of King Solomon&#39;s Mines who read the book or watch the 1985 version with Richard Chamberlain and Sharon Stone, that&#39;s not very good either, but it&#39;s one hour and forty minutes of his life instead of 4 hours.']
