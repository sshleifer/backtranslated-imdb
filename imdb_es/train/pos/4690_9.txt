Twenty-five years ago, I showed this movie in some classes of children in Entomology and I can still remember the emotion of the children; They were spellbound! It is not only the termites that have built and live in the "Castles of clay", but also the other animals that use the mounds. There is a fantastic scene in which a cobra fights against a monitor lizard while a colony of mongoose watches. Not only is it good for entomology classes, but also for the teaching of ecology, since there is much about the interactions between termites and other organisms and the complete ecology of all the organisms that live in and around the mounds. <br /> <br /> I would like it to be available on DVD, to be able to see it again and show it to others.
