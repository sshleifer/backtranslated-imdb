Gus Van Sant has made some excellent films. I really am a fan. <br /> <br /> However, I can not help but feel that the cerebral edge of Tom Robbins's book "Even Cowgirls Get the Blues" is lost in the translation to the big screen. Alone, Tom Robbins and Gus Van Sant are incredible visionaries and talented towers. Ultimately, although this simply did not work. <br /> <br /> It was not that the characters were not well developed or that the plot and the content did not come alive. It's just that our imagination is much more powerful when we read a book like this. They take us to a different time and place and, sometimes, we think the worst and / or the best, and this adds to the general roller coaster of the book as it develops in an orderly fashion according to the author's precision. However, movies can leave one with less of the imagination and emotion of the roller coaster to the detriment of the overall experience. This is what I think happened here. <br /> <br /> I suggest reading the book!
