It is a pleasure to see this group of English professionals. The supporting cast could form a series of its own. It is a love triangle seen between the head of surgery, his wife and a new resident of beautiful child surgery. Only the superior acting skills of Francesca Annis, Michael Kitchen and sexy Robson Greene elevate this from the garbage category to a "very nice romp". The only objection is that it is difficult to accept that the hot Francesca Annis falls in love and marries Michael Kitchen, who, like me, is not an international sex symbol, not even a British one. You can easily understand why Robson Green would light his fire, with apologies to the "Doors". The guy who almost steals the show with a great "relaxed" performance is Owen's father, David Bradley. Watch him in "The Way We Live Now", in a completely different performance, to get an idea of ​​his rank. Daniela Nardini, as Kitchen's secretary, sometimes a sex toy, is hard to forget as the despised mistress who makes Kitchen regret having looked at her great body. Conor Mullen, and Julian Rhind-Tutt, as friends of Green's partner's surgery, as I said, could have their own series. They are so good. All this is very fun, and I recommend it with all my heart, and I thank imdbman for letting the paying customers have their opinion in this fascinating place.
