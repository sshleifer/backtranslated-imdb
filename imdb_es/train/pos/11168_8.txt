Removed from the real-life exploits of Chuck Connors and Steve Brodie in the 1890s in New York, "The Bowery" is high-energy and good-natured. <br /> <br /> But be careful: occasional racial epithets flow from the languages ​​of Wallace Beery and little Jackie Cooper. The first shot can be surprising. This is valid for the moment in which it was established and when it was made. And it also talks about the diversity of the population in that neck of the woods. Undoubtedly, it adds to the harsh taste of the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Beery as Connors is the thunder that sprouts in the center of the action, a saloon guardian with his own fire brigade. And he has a weakness for the orphan Cooper. Raft, since Brodie is the Princess of Connors, is a rival with better looks in almost every effort. Brodie could never refuse a daring and beloved attention, leading to a jump from the Brooklyn Bridge (it is still debated whether he really jumped or used a mannequin). <br /> <br /> Beery is as grandiloquent as ever with an Irish-American accent. It is the type of brusque character to draw children, cats and ladies in distress. This is possibly the most boisterous character Raft has ever played, and can even throw a little dance (in addition to a leg show). And again confuses the protagonist (the lovely Fay Wray) with a prostitute. Cooper is as hard as any of them, although he has the opportunity to let go of the tears. <br /> <br /> The highlight is not the jump from the bridge, but a fistfight between Connors and Brodie. that in the foreground it seems a real fight between the directors. It is certain that someone hurt more than an ego.
