Forget the "religious" movies that have monopolized the television / film market ... this movie has a real feeling. While it can be considered as a movie that has cheap emotional attractions, it also has that message of forgiveness and, in general, good morals. However, I did not like the lighting of this movie ... for a film that deals with this subject, it was too bright. I felt that he had moved away from the general appeal of the film, which is almost an unforgivable sin, but the recognizable cast and his performances counteract this neglect. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing ... buy the DVD.
