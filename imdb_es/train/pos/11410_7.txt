EDMUND LOWE (which reminds me of Warren William), leads the good cast of a small interesting mystery that moves at a brisk pace and runs a little over an hour. <br /> <br /> Douglas Walton plays the unfortunate rider Who seems to be focused on his own disappearance (hypnotism, someone?), and the suspects include a good number of support cast: everyone, from Virginia Bruce, Kent Smith, Frieda Inescourt, Gene Lockhart, Jessie Ralph, Benita Hume, Rosalind Ivan and HB Warner. As an added bonus, there is Nat Pendleton as a foolish detective and, in addition, he receives a load of Art Deco decoration from the luxurious interiors of a rich house. It must have been a set that was used in many of the later films. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the mystery is not so complicated that anyone can follow the plot with the reasonable assurance of not being so bewildered. Suddenly, it's clear to Detective Philo Vance, and then he has a final confrontation with the killer who gives the film five ingenious minutes of absolute suspense. <br /> <br /> Well done and hang out in an entertaining way.
