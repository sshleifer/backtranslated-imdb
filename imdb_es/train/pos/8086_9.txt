Recently, I rented the animated version of The Lord of the Rings in a video after watching the live action version FANTASTIC 2001 of the film. The live action trilogy of The Lord of the Rings directed by Peter Jackson will undoubtedly be much better than George Lucas' "Prequel" Star Wars trilogy (Episodes 1-3) will be the true fantasy film series of the XXI century! <Br /> <br /> I remember seeing the animated version as a child, and I did not understand the depth of the film at that moment. Now that I've read the books, I understand what the whole story is about. To be sure, some of the characters are pretty dumb, (Samwise Gangee is particularly annoying, almost as much as Jar Jar Binks in Star Wars Episode One, (AWFUL!)) But, I have to say he follows the book quite closely, and enters part of book two, The Two Towers. The good thing is that the action is something interesting and part of the animation is quite remarkable for its time. The downside is that it ends up in the middle of the two towers without any results from Frodo's quest to destroy the ring, and the animation seems quite outdated compared to current standards. <br /> <br /> In general, not as bad as many say it is. BUT, the live action version of 2001 is the new seal of The Lord of the Rings! At least Ralph Bakshi took the script seriously! Peter Jackson has said that the animated version inspired him to read the books, which in turn led him to create one of the best fantasy series ever filmed, so at least we can thank Ralph Bakshi for that matter! I'll take the animated version of Lord of the Rings on the live version of Harry Potter any day! <br /> <br /> A 7 on a scale of 1-10, much less violent than the live action version of 2001, but now it's so good! For the most hardcore fans of books and film versions of The Lord of the Rings.
