WAR, INC. (2008) ** 1/2 John Cusack, Marisa Tomei, Hilary Duff, Joan Cusack, Ben Kingsley, Dan Aykroyd, Sergej Trifunovic, Lyubomir Neikov, Ned Bellamy, (Voice of: Montel Williams) <br /> <br /> A 21st century "STRANGELOVE" of "hit and miss" <br /> <br /> John Cusack? Who co-wrote the script with Mark Leyner and Jeremy Pikser? he stars a wounded hit man named Brand Hauser who is burned but decides to go ahead in a final task freezing a Middle East oil minister named Omar Sharif (yes, that's not Omar Sharif, but he has the tone here of this error) a laugh) commanded by the former vice president of the USA. UU (Aykroyd, the old cousin of "Grosse Pointe Blank" by Cusack, making a malicious gesture of Dick Cheney here), enlisting Brand to do the writing under the guise of a Trade Show Producer in the mythical Turaqistan (read: Iraq / Afghanistan ) for the American private company Tamerlane (read: Halliburton). <br /> <br /> While being briefed, Brand faces a moment of clarity when he meets the intrepid journalist Natalie Hegalhuzen (Tomei) and finally falls in love with her. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Tamerlane is sponsoring the unlikely union of the East European teen sensation, Yonica Babyyeah (a surprisingly decent Duff who looks like her own celebrity with an open mouth) and the idiot son of the leader from the country. <br /> <br /> What follows is a bold attempt by a black 21st century comedy to "DR STRANGELOVE", but for all intents and purposes there are sadly more failures than successes in this broad attempt at laughter in The middle of a political message (an unjust war being outsourced by US capitalism, check!) <br /> <br /> While Cusack riffs on his Martin Blank of the aforementioned "Pointe", he adds some nice touches to his Man in black (Tabasco sauce takes to take On the edge, the rest of the cast is updated (except for Sister Joan, who is a revolt as Hauser's field assistant and has one of the funniest phrases to laugh at the movie: "My mass communication skills are finally paying") for the most part. <br /> <br /> Cusack visited the Iraq war earlier this year in the different version of "Grace Is Gone 180 degrees and here allows your opinions politics can be seen in his sleeve; While, in general, the pace and rhythms of the film are admirable, no, thanks to first filmmaker Joshua Seftel making his directorial debut here (and it's notable), except perhaps the well-choreographed fight Hauser is involved with the idiots girlfriends of Babyyeah. <br /> <br /> A good attempt but a misguided error; Maybe the next time Cusack does not try so hard and let the idiocy of the war speak for itself instead of doing the heavy lifting on its own.
