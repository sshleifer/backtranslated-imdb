['Richard Widmark is a character spotted in this movie. He is a professional pickpocket. He has been in prison three times, but at the beginning of the film, he tries to reach four. Thelma Ritter is a busy body that sells information to almost everyone. Jean Peters is amazing as the girl flamed by Widmark. <br /><br /> This is a period piece during the McCarthy era in which the Red Fear ruled politics and worked on this plot pretty well. What is unusual in this movie is that Peters and Ritter are victims of violent beatings in an era in which women were rarely more than sex objects in movies. This is what makes this movie black, since women often have different roles in this type of film. <br /><br /> The movie is only 87 minutes long and was obviously made by Fox as the letter below for double roles in the theater. The sets show that it is a limited budget movie. The script angered J Edgar Hoover because little importance is given to patriotism. Hoover wanted me to change. <br /><br /> Instead, it became a B below the image of the card that was a sleeper success in 1953. The script and performance in it are better than other great features of that year.']
