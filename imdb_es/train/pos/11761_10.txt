Kurt Russell is at his best as the man who lives from his past glories, Reno Hightower. Robin Williams is his polar opposite in a rare low profile performance as Jack Dundee. He dropped the Big Pass in more ways than one. <br /> <br /> You will see some of the most cited scenes that have been put in a movie, while Jack whistles at a rat, Reno poses, and the call of the caribou goes off. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this classic that is not afraid to show football in the mud the way it should be played (note to the NFL).
