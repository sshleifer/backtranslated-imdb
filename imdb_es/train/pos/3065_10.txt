<br /> <br /> I really liked this movie. One of those rare movies that Hollywood Really does not do anymore. William H Macy is simply great as the hit man with soul, and Neve Campbell is simply fantastic as the woman who puts her life on the path of redemption. <br /> <br /> If you have a chance, watch this movie. Earn your praise
