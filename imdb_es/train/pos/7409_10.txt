Hoping to see a "cute little movie" from mainland China, I was ill prepared. Family dynamics, community and the inevitability of change have seldom been explored so expertly in film. Each character is solid and I felt completely involved in the story. The organization is much more complex than American audiences will be used to. However, there is no difficulty in following the progression, even while the subtitles are being read. Jiang Wu, like the retarded brother, is a constant bright light. Leave your cynicism in your locker. It will be there when you leave.
