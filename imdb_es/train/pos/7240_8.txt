When I found this movie in my local video store, I expected it to be another corny American vampire movie in the same vein as "The Lost Boys" (1987). To my surprise, "To Die for" is a really good movie. It's a little bit corny at times, but there are still enough stylish sets and surprises to satisfy vampire enthusiasts. This is a perfect mix of romance and horror and, at times, it's surprisingly bloody. Highly recommended
