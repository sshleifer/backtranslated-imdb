I found this movie in a video library, it costs $ 2 to buy. The whole movie sucks very badly! The so-called colonel, who would be the hero here if he could have trusted the cover, must be about eighty years old and barely able to walk. However, he manages to shoot some of the dumbest ninjas in the world. Then, the story leaves the colonel, which makes sense given the inability of the old man to DO something worth mentioning, that now they are two terrifying-looking guys, who seem to have been a kind of story. I got lost hundreds of times, but I did not care, because the movie is so bad it's really fun to watch it. Zero budget garbage with actors who do not deserve that name. Go see it!
