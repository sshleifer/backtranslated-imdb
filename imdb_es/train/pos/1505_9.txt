"The House That Dripped Blood" is one of the best anthology films of the period. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Tracing a missing movie star, Inspector Holloway, (John Bennett) finds that the last sighting reported was in a large mansion in the field. During the tour of the house, you will be told four different stories about former residents of the house. <br /> <br /> The good (s) story (s): method to murder: move to the mysterious mansion to get some peace and quiet while Charles writes his latest masterpiece, the horror novelist Charles Hillyer (Denholm Elliott) and his wife Alice (Joanna Dunham) are delighted with the story, which focuses on a serial choke called Dominic. After a series of strange accidents and experiences in the house, Charles begins to believe that the creation of me has come alive and is pursuing him and his wife. Probably one of the best entries in the movie, is easily the most spooky. The atmosphere here is what sets it apart. The scenes with the fictional character are really creepy, the mystery that surrounds it is really effective and there is always a classic moment of creep-out. The classic moment is murder in the psychiatrist's office, which is an unprecedented time for the chilling. The accumulation, with the creaks, the rapid flashes of a mysterious being and the thunder and lightning in the background, work well for the favor of this person. <br /> <br /> Sweets for the sweet step into a new home, widower John Reid, (Christopher Lee) hires former school teacher Ann Norton, (Nyree Dawn Porter) for his little daughter Jane, (Chloe Franks) while he is away on business. Ann gradually begins to unravel a dark secret of Jane's past, which John denies vehemently. When she discovers the true nature of what has happened, it is much more surprising than what she might have thought possible. With the most terrifying plot and the biggest spin of the stories, this is a pretty nice entry. The mystery of the family unfolds wonderfully, with small amounts of clues accumulated here and there, and the final revelation is downright stressful. That part alone is the main reason why it works, and Lee does not hurt it either. <br /> <br /> The bad story (s): wax work: tortured by the memories of his lost love, Phillip Grayson, (Peter Cushing) and his friend Neville Rogers, (Joss Ackland ) fell in love with a statue of a woman in a Wax Museum, while the statue takes over their lives, discover a shocking secret about the museum that pursues them both. Here is an intelligent premise, and it provides an excuse to spend time in a wax museum, which are always spooky. This is no exception, and it seems strange, which is helped by the fluorescent lighting shown in the sculptures. A sequence of dreams provides a great moment of suspense, but what ultimately kills this is the slow pace. The events take a long time to develop and most of the time is dedicated to the exhibition. It also builds up to a shock end that can be seen from a mile away. Those who really lower this a bit. If the turn had been changed, it would have scored higher, the rest is acceptable. <br /> <br /> Horror movie actor Paul Henderson, masked and veteran, (Jon Pertwee) annoyed by the lack of realism on the set of his new movie, goes out and buys a new vampire cape in a store specialized The cloak soon turns him into a vampire, going crazy on the set with co-star Carla, (Ingrid Pitt) and other vampiric acts at home. Not convinced that the layer is the cause, he does everything he can to show that he is alone in his imagination. This has a pretty decent premise, and there are many opportunities for some decent threats, but what sinks it are several factors. First, he is too stupid for his own good. The twist of the plot at the end is a perfect example, so exaggerated that it is not really a shock, and it is presented simply as nonsense. There are so few scenes of fears or attempts of fear that it is simply a bore to sit down. It is the weakest in the movie. <br /> <br /> The final verdict: A fairly decent omnibus movie, there are some small problems scattered in each of the stories that make this a film less than perfect but still very visible. Highly recommended for those in similar movies at that time or who enjoy British horror movies. <br /> <br /> Classification today-PG-13: Violence
