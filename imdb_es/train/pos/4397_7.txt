An unconventional historical drama, with some good battle scenes. Tobey Maguire offers excellent performance and gets a pretty good backing. The script is literary and quite original, and the film remains fortunately free of heroes. That said, drag a bit, and the last reel is too much like a television miniseries. However, the camera work of Frederick Elmes keeps one interested in boring bits (and from time to time you see a picture that reminds you that he worked for David Lynch). Worth seeing.
