Pecker is a hilariously funny but twisted movie about a small city in Baltimore whose daily and routine routine is broken by Pecker, a young photographer who takes photos of "real things". There are no beautiful models, no beautiful men, only hard life. This wonderful movie makes fun of the plasticity of the urban art chain. There is a particular scene when a homeless woman who buys in the thrift store of Pecker's mom buys the exact same coat as one of Whitney's art addicts for only 25 cents instead of five hundred dollars. This only shows that no matter what kind of money you have, you may not always like it. Once again, John Waters sends you into an endless spiral of laughter and harsh reality. You can have your Hollywood movies with special effects and mountains of celebrities, but give me a "Pecker" or a "Hairspray" (another excellent John Waters movie) about a "Titanic" or a "Godzilla" any day!
