At first, this movie would be the typical western movie. However, it turned out to be very interesting and it kept me fascinated until the end, which was very unusual. Charlton Heston, (Sam Burgade), "Midway", '76, had previous experiences with James Coburn, (Zach Provo), "Deadfall", '93, and Zach never forgave Sam and would stop at nothing to make sure that he will get it with him and give him back the money. Unfortunately, Barbara Hershey, (Susan Burgade), "The Portrait of a Lady", '96, managed to get caught in this situation and found herself among men hungry for sex who never seemed to leave her alone. Sam Burgade had to make very difficult decisions and I was quite surprised at the conclusion. This is a very entertaining film and the performance was outstanding.
