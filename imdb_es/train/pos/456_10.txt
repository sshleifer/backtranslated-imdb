This is a lovely movie, which restores the spirit. From the use of the royal villa that inspired Elizabeth Arngrim to write the novel in the 1920s until the inspired casting, all the choices were perfectly correct! The quiet joy of this film does not fade after repeated viewing. Josie Lawrence, Miranda Richardson, Polly Walker and Joan Plowright seem to have been born to interpret these parts! I would love to see Enchanted April released on DVD in widescreen format.
