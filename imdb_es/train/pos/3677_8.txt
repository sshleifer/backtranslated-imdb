Fortunately I saw this on a plane to Singapore recently (I thought I had missed it at the Cinemalaya Film Festival). Paris, je t'aime is a collection of 20 short films (approximately 5 minutes each) of 20 directors who show love in various pockets of contemporary Paris. <br /> <br /> One of my favorite segments is 'Parc Monceau' by Alfonso Cuarn (Great Expectations, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban), which was made at one time and features Nick Nolte. <br /> <br /> The "Tuileries" of the Coen brothers starring Steve Buscemi as a tourist on the subway was hilarious! Juliette Binoche and Willem Dafoe in 'Place des Victoires' were disturbing. <br /> <br /> For Maggie Gyllenhaal as American actress / drug addict in 'Quartier des Enfants Rouges' for portraying anticipation and anguish in such a short time The time was simply brilliant. <br /> <br /> Elijah Wood as a vampire victim in the "Quartier de la Madeleine" was quite surreal, while Emily Mortimer and Rufus Sewell played a beautiful couple in the "Pre-Lachaise" by Wes Craven. <Br /> <br /> Natalie Portman was beautiful as usual, as the actress girlfriend of a French child with visual impairment in 'Faubourg Saint-Denis'. But despite the many representations of young love, a more mature execution of Gena Rowlands in 'Quartier Latin' was equally inductive. <br /> <br /> This movie is perfect for people with ADHD because each sequence is accurate and careful. thought-out. <br /> <br /> There is also a series of memorable appointments. One in particular is that of an unfaithful husband who eventually leaves his lover to stay with his dying wife in his last days: "By pretending to be a man in love, he became a man in love."
