A surprisingly complex and well-prepared study of the serial killer "The First" in the USSR. Set in the days of perestroika, this intense piece comes alive with the performances of Stephen Reah and Donald Sutherland. <br /> <br /> This examination of the Cicatillo as a killer is complete and alludes to some of its behaviors. While it shows itself to others, there is a subtlety that is convincing without being overtly graphic. However, it is not for the faint of heart, since their subject is often disturbing, but it is necessary for their full development of the main participants in this story based on facts. <br /> <br /> HBO has provided us with an excellent movie in an unusual way. Congratulations to the director and editor of this great piece. It's on my list of the 10 best to see.
