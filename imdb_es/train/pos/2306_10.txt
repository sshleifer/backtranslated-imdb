I had never heard of The Man of the Moon until I saw it last night on THIS HDTV channel. Look, my taste is like any other, eclectic. My favorites range from Blue Velvet to Dr. Strangelove to The Ghost and Mrs. Muir through The Wizard of Oz and The Loved One, Eraserhead, Repo Man and The Spy Within. <br /> <br /> The Man in the Moon is magnificently filmed, it's a good-hearted, happy and tragic film, beautifully filmed, in which the actors really live the moment instead of acting. This sweet story will soon be in our private library. This beautiful story of life in a much more beautiful time in rural Louisiana literally transports you to your pastoral setting. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to remain stoic during the last moments of the film, especially when the young girl is extending her older life. the heart of the sister burns the private pain and forgives everything. <br /> <br /> Instead of spoiling the enjoyment or getting bored to sob with my boring prose, you'll end now with this suggestion from someone who enjoys movies that speak from the heart to ours. . <br /> <br /> If you do not buy another movie, please buy the Man on the Moon. This moving story is one that you will enjoy reliving again and again. It is a joy and a gem, a film too scarce in this world of hardened hearts. <br /> <br /> The simple virtues shown in Man on the Moon are a joy to behold. <br /> <br /> Paul Vincent Zecchino <br /> <br /> Manasota Key, Florida <br /> <br /> April 05, 2009
