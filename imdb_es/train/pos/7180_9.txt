Twisted, strange, charming and hilarious! I could not stop laughing seeing this movie. Darren Stein presents the films he made on the family camcorder that grew up in Southern California in the 80s. It is an interesting look at a budding filmmaker and his motivations and ability to manipulate the camera. Manipulation is a strong word, however, do not we all see movies to manipulate them in one way or another? <br /> <br /> From the beginning, I am amused by the fact that the guys in the movies seemed to be shirtless whenever possible. Later, Darren comments on his budding homosexuality, and you can see it from the clues (big hints!) Of extravagance at a young age. Maybe it was just the warm weather of Southern California, who knows? As a gay man who also grew up in a welcoming environment, it's great to see that his parents supported him and loved him, and that his friends seemed to be fascinated by his emerging talent behind the lens. <br /> <br /> "" Put the camera on me "offers a look at the 80s without being touched by commercialism.You'll remember your hair, music and fashions.I'm the same age as Mr. Stein, for What a trip back to the path of memory was welcome: Your lipstick solo dance number is priceless, enhanced by the Frankie Goes To Hollywood shirt. <br /> <br /> Films cover obscure themes At the moment, child abuse, holocaust, nuclear war, sexual fantasy and social dysfunction, no childhood is completely carefree, and the way Stein deals with these issues is interesting to say the least, and very fun to watch. . <br /> <br /> Look as soon as possible!
