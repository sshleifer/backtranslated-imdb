['The black quality of Foley in this saturated and intense pulp film is apparently &quot;perfectly&quot; combined. Shot by shot, edition by edition, the film unfolds around a disturbed boxer discovering his own purpose (or lack of it). The other comments may indicate a lack of interest in cellulose, but I personally believe that this is a magnificently organized cinematographic piece.']
