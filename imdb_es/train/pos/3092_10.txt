Probably everyone already knows this, but you can see 5 additional episodes that were never aired on ABC.com. I have seen a lot of television over the years and this is possibly my favorite show, sometime. It is a crime that this beautifully written and performed show was canceled. The actors who played Laura, Whit, Carlos, Mae, Damian, Anya and omg, Steven Caseman, are incredible and very natural in those roles. Even the children are great. Wonderful show It's very sad that he's gone. Of course I wonder about the reasons why it was canceled. There's no way I can be led to believe that Mrs. Moynahan's pregnancy had anything to do with it. It was in the perfect time slot in this market. I've seen all the episodes again on ABC.com, I hope they'll be released on DVD sometime. Thank you for reading.
