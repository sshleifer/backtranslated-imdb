The first director Tom Kiesche delivers a winning film in a spirit of court, dark comedy. Made with a very small budget, however, had the flavor of the film Blood Simple of the first Coen brothers ... and add some Monty Python condiments to start! It needs to be seen more than once to appreciate all the elements that lead one scene to the next. Expect more good things from this writer-director-actor.
