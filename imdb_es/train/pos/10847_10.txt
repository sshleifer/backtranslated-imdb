I am 60 years old, I am a guitarist, (leader / rhythm), and for the last forty years, I have been in four bands, everything is there, the fights, the fallacies, the rotten food, the worst accommodation. Always traveling, little or no money, and everyone was drunk or drugged. But, the clubs, the fans and the music made it all worthwhile. Like the strange fruit! I'm too old for that now, and the arthritis in my hands and hips does not mean more swing, but for the duration of the video, everything came back, and everything was there! The birds, the fights and the alcohol! And I was young again! It's like Billy Connolly's voice, God likes those things from the 70s! Rock On Forever!
