This movie is a wonderful movie based on the life of a man named Gray Owl in the 1930s in Canada. I found that he was equally fascinating and sincere like 'Rudy' and 'Awakenings'. He retires at the end of Gray Owl's life and follows him through his most tumultuous and influential period. <br /> <br /> The film is about a Canadian Indian hunter who finds himself promoting the plight of the beaver surpassed. It also predicts the decline of natural lands and the excessive use of Earth's resources. This is an outrageous concept in the 1930s and surprisingly well received. He becomes a well-known speaker and the masses are ready to listen. <br /> <br /> Pierce Brosnan's casting seems pretty strange, but it's not outrageous. Anyone who wants to discuss that point must first see the movie to understand. Brosnan provides a wonderful performance as does Annie Galipeau. Galipeau is a strong actress whose place next to Brosnan is refreshingly natural compared to the forced couples in recent Bond films. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone interested in good drama, beautiful scenery or environmental causes. It is also a movie for families, however, children under 10 years old (depending on the maturity) would have problems to follow the plot.
