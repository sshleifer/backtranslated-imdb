There is a very intelligent humor in this film, which is both a parody and a tribute to the actors. However, after a while, it just seems like an exercise in style (despite the big gags like Balasko, which continues with the role of Dussolier and the good acting of everyone involved) and I wondered why Blier made this movie. Everything is revealed in the end, when Blier, directing Claude Brasseur, receives a call from his father (Bernard Blier) - from heaven, and has the opportunity to say how much he misses him. An effective emotional capper and obviously sincere. But in reality there is not enough dramatic tension or emotional involvement to keep the rest of the film interesting throughout its execution time. However, some really nice scenes and sequences, and anyone who likes these 'sacr√©s' films of French cinema should really enjoy this movie.
