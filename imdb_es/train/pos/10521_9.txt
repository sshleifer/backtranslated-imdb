Well, I think I'm very attached to this film, since it's the first time I went to see more than 10 times in the cinema ... helping me with my master's thesis or, rather, preventing me from working on it! <Br /> <br /> But seeing it again several years (and many movies) later, what a fine little gem it is! I've never seen Gwyneth Paltrow in a more convincing performance, and Jeremy Northam is the perfect Mr. Knightley. Where can you find such a man? << <sigh >> >> The turn of Sophie Thompson as Mrs. Bates is a virtuoso who acts like the best (oh, napkins, I'm sorry!) and the rest of the cast is not a disappointment either; Toni Colette brings much Muriel to her Harriet, and Ewan McGregor is convincingly charming, and Alan Cumming and Juliet Stevenson are the perfect "impossible" couple! <br /> <br /> Of course, the ensembles and the costumes, and the beautiful soundtrack contribute a lot to the feeling, almost like Hobbiton. The atmosphere of the film, although in terms of cinematography and artistic decoration, is almost a case of visual overload. Very, very nice, but a little more austerity could have conveyed a better sense of the period. But the good thing is that the film is not taken too seriously, and there's a lot of fun, and some pretty interesting editions, that keep it from sinking in the Old Old England way of saccharine. <br /> <br /> My Particular favorite is the ball scene: some beautiful performances and direction here, and the final dance sums up the relationship between Emma and Mr. Knightley in a very beautiful way. It's a pity that the scene of the final proposal is prolonged just a little, cut two shots (I can think exactly which ones!) And it would have been much more in keeping with the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> Gosh, I just realized (reading the imdb lists) that I've seen Jeremy Northam in at least three movies without even knowing it was him; it seems that he has much more in his favor, as an actor, than simply being an English gentleman's gentleman! Hmm, I guess I should visit my video store ... <br /> <br /> Lovely movie. My favorite adaptation of Jane Austen so far, although perhaps Ang Lee's Sense and Sensibility is, strictly speaking, the best movie, this is the one closest to my heart - and I've certainly seen it many more times! Look at it if you can, and do not be too hard with your little imperfections. <br /> <br />
