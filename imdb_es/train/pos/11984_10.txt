I've never seen a show as good as Full House. Full House puts to shame all the newest shows, big time! Anyone who has never seen it, who does not see how it is possible, should see it. It is a great show for anyone of any age. Full House will make you laugh, it will make you cry, it will surprise you. It is true that some people feel that there are some "cheesy" aspects in the program, but the positive aspects weigh all the "cheesy" aspects. Full House published its first episode on September 22, 1987, entitled "Our first show", and published its last episode on May 23, 1995, entitled "Michelle Rides Again Part II". <br /> <br /> The plot of the program is very credible. Danny Tanner (Bob Saget) loses his wife, Pam, in an accident involving a drunk driver. Danny has his brother-in-law, Jesse Katsopolis (John Stamos), who is Pam's younger brother, and Danny also brings his best friend Joey Gladstone (Dave Coulier) to help him raise his three daughters. Danny's daughters are called DJ (Candice Cameron-Bure), Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin) and Michelle (Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen). Joey and Jesse plan to move with Danny and his three daughters for a few months just to help AND end up living with them for eight years; what is the number of years the program lasted. <br /> <br /> The following is a brief description of some of the characters and actor / actress who played it: John Stamos (Jesse): John Stamos is a great actor He plays Jesse. Jesse is a rock star waiting for his big break. In Full House, John Stamos does a great job representing his character. He saw and played music like his idol, Elvis Presley. <br /> <br /> Bob Saget (Danny): Bob Saget is also a great actor. Loses his wife in a car accident involving a drunk driver. He has to raise three girls without having the girl's mother. Bob Saget does a great job portraying a single father who works full time and still has time to raise his three daughters. <br /> <br /> Dave Coulier (Joey): A word can describe Dave Coulier, funny. He is great. Playing Joey's character was perfect for him. He does a great job playing the comedian who is waiting for his big break. <br /> <br /> Candice Cameron-Bure (DJ): She is a tremendous actress. She plays the older sister, DJ, which is the abbreviation of Donna Jo. She is one of the best actresses I have seen in my life. His ability to act in Full House was very credible. <br /> <br /> Jodie Sweetin (Stephanie): Two simple words can describe Jodie Sweetin, incredibly amazing! I wish I could say everything I would like to say about Jodie, but I would use the maximum of 1,000 words just for her. He had his start in a children's program called Mother Goose Stories and when he arrived at Full House, he blew up the minds of the audience and the creator. His great appearance and his incredible acting ability helped make the show the success he had. According to Dave Coulier, Jodie was supposed to be the star of the show. It was supposed to be where she was going to have her big break. Jodie, at five years of age when the show was broadcast for the first time, could hit all the lines perfectly. She showed great enthusiasm. Most young children can not do this. As you can probably imagine, Jodie Sweetin (Stephanie) is my favorite character in Full House. <br /> <br /> Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen (Michelle): Great actress. Full House is where they started. They received the part of Michelle because they were the only babies who did not cry in front of a camera. <br /> <br /> There are many more cast members that need to be recognized. These are the original characters from when the program aired for the first time in 1987. <br /> <br /> The only negative thing I can say is that Full House became The Michelle Show towards the end. I think it was to focus on her towards the end. Especially when I think Jodie and Candice were much better at acting. <br /> <br /> Full House is a great show for everyone. It can teach you a lot. One of the most important things that can teach you is that everyone can live a great life, even if a tragedy happens, like losing a family member. Full House continues to attract new fans. With all this said, there are only a couple of things to say; Full House will never die, and, thanks, the Full House cast, for giving everyone a show they can enjoy.
