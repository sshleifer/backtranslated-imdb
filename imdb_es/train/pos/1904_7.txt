['This 1981 comedy still shines thanks to the combined efforts of writer / director Steve Gordon and stars Dudley Moore and John Gielgud. Unfortunately, Gordon, only in his first forty years, died shortly after completing this, his only feature film. It is a particularly unfortunate loss, since it shows a truly skillful hand in the farce driven by the character that makes the whole movie irresistible. It plays almost like an inflation comedy in the style of 1930 renewed for contemporary tastes. The plot centers on Arthur Bach, a small, drunken millionaire playboy who runs the risk of losing his $ 750 million inheritance if he does not marry the bored and bored Susan Johnson, an heiress chosen by his old money father and grandmother grandmother . Of course, he does not love her and, by chance, meets Linda Marolla, a working class waitress (and, of course, aspiring actress) after she steals a Bergdorf Goodman tie for her father. <br /><br /> The standard complications continue, but in a very captivating way, with a lot of slapstick with alcohol executed with the classic Ã©lan of Moore. To make such a pampered character pleasant is not only a credit to his comedic talents, but also to Gielgud&#39;s aggressive and acidic twist as Hobson, Arthur&#39;s devotee, but valet based on reality. It is the kind of role he could play in his dream, but Gielgud makes Hobson a truly memorable character whose destiny in the film brings a welcome injection in the process. Probably, in her most pleasant movie role, Liza Minnelli delivers the image to her castmates, softening her usual dazzling personality and making Linda have a genuine motivation. <br /><br /> Before &quot;LA Law&quot;, Jill Eikenberry plays Susan with the correct passive-aggressive note, while Barney Martin (Jerry&#39;s father in &quot;Seinfeld&quot;) steals all his scenes as Linda&#39;s disheveled father, Ralph. The only fly in the ointment is the veteran actress Geraldine Fitzgerald, who exaggerates the eccentricities of the grandmother. And I have to admit that I still can not stand the very old-fashioned and exaggerated song of Christopher Cross that inevitably won the Oscar for the best song of that year. Unfortunately, the 1997 DVD, which certainly needs remastering, has no extras worth mentioning, except for some photos and production notes.']
