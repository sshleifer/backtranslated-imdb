Wow, how can I discuss this movie without tears coming to my eyes? Surely it was the highlight of my year, no, of my life. As if the raptor's graphics were not surprising enough, the award-winning editors continued to use exactly the same shot throughout the film, even when the background did not match the setting of the scene. Wow, what a genius. And while the movie is full of plot holes (for example, some clips from a t-Rex type animal where a raptor should be and a key moment in which Pappy finds a torture chamber, he screams "Colin is a girl ! "And he runs away) I will never forget the brilliance that is Raptor Planet. Thanks Sci-Fi for another classic.
