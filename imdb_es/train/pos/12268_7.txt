Seven young people go to the forest in search of a bear. Suddenly, all of them are harassed and brutally murdered by a crazy Vietnam veteran. "Infernal Trap" is an entertaining Mexican slasher that reminds me a lot of "The Zero Boys". The movie is In an accelerated rhythm and there are some good death scenes, such as cuts in the throat or ax in the neck. Unfortunately, there is not much blood, so Grand-Guignol fans will be disappointed. . Mexican horror movies are quite dark (I've only seen "Alucarda" and "Do not Panic"), so this should be another reason to see this fun slasher. My rating: 7 out of 10. Highly recommended.
