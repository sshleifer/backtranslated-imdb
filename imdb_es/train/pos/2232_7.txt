I saw this when I was 17 and I have not seen it since. The 'CBS Late Film' used to show it regularly at any given time. I remember how sad and annoying it was, it really made me feel sick to my stomach. The effects then were not what they are today, but despite that, it conveyed the feeling of being alone in the Amazon, after losing both parents and looking for a way out, very well. I remember the insects and worms more, so realistic that they were, eating their flesh. It is a dark film that was a controversial subject at that time, although it was probably edited for television. I wish I had remembered more details, and if I ever have the opportunity to see it again, I can comment more. I've been looking for this for years. I think it may have been shown on CBS under another title. I have no idea if it was ever released on video.
