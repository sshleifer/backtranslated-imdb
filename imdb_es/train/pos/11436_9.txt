This is the kind of image that John Lassiter would be doing today, if it were not for the advances in CGI. And that's just to say that he would also be forgotten, if technology had not made things more attractive since 1983. _Twice ..._ has the same wit, imagination and sense of real emotion that you would find in a Pixar movie, just executed under the restrictions of the environment c. 1983. The innovative animation techniques are combined with a great script and an excellent expression to produce a film that attracts many levels. You should talk about it at the same time as _Spiritited Away_ and _Toy Story_.
