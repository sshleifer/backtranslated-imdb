Trapped: buried alive takes us to a resort that has just opened, and will soon be closed. <br /> <br /> We start with a guy in motion that flies to avoid the possibility of avalanches. In some way, that does not make sense. Anyway, you're about to fly a particularly large one, when you realize that the resort is open. Despite his best efforts, the higher authority tells him that his day is over. <br /> <br /> Soon, as everyone expects, an avalanche arrives. <br /> <br /> Look, I will not reveal more, all I can say is that this was a B movie designed for the family channel (which I just saw, and the fact that it did not have commercial proof that it is a movie B) anyway, it's a pretty decent movie, but it's partially unreal. <br /> <br /> at first hand, when people are buried by ice and snow, they are buried. Not only traced by the dust. or, what about a CD for a screwdriver? it's not possible. and finally, what I can not emphasize enough, is that an explosion can not stop an avalanche, of course. <br /> <br /> Also, it's worth renting it or watching TV, but not owning it. 7/10. <br /> <br /> The movie is classified as PG, but maybe I should have received something a little bit stronger. A child almost loses his foot in an elevator, but his leg is cut around the ankle, a guy is toasted with electricity and diesel, and in the weight room, dead people are lying. <br /> <br /> Enjoy.
