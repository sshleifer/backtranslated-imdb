"My Left Foot" is a rather impressive film that tells the story of Christy Brown, an artist who was paralyzed by cerebral palsy and learned to paint with her left foot, the only limb of her body that she had control over. Daniel Day-Lewis won his first Oscar as Best Actor in this film, which I'm not entirely sure of being deserved, but it's still remarkable. Day-Lewis gives Brown a realistic and occasionally almost humorous touch. Brenda Fricker, as Brown's devoted mother, also won an Oscar for a credible and moving role. My problem with this movie is that sometimes it is too real. When Brown is desperate and should help someone and do everything with his left foot, the movie can be hard to see. This gives a often depressing feeling that can turn off some viewers for a while. However, if you look beyond that, you will see a sense of hope and inspiration for those who have disabilities and other difficulties to overcome. Those of us who are not crippled and who still think we have problems are inspired by this film, because if something with a condition much worse than us can overcome its difficulties, we can certainly do the same. Well done, occasionally nice, but hard to see. It may not be for everyone, but it's not bad at all. <br /> <br /> *** of ****
