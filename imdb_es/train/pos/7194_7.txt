I rate this as the best of the Zorro chapter games. The exciting musical score adds a touch to an exciting work on the screen. There is an excellent support and mystery villain that will keep you guessing until the final chapter. Cedley Hadley does a good job as Don Diego and his alter ego Zorro.Last, but certainly not least, is the great management team of Whitney and English.
