I really liked that movie. I am Mexican and I was offended in the least. In fact, I think this movie should be shown at the police headquarters throughout Mexico. It is a sad truth that our police system is as rotten as a corpse of 3 months. It makes me angry to read on the news how murderers, kidnappers and other muds are released by paying a ridiculous fine or living as kings inside prison cells. We should have someone like Creasy, the character of Denzel Washington. A bodyguard became a vigilant vigilante. Kidnapping is flourishing in industry here (at least in big cities). In fact, I wish that the real life kidnappers suffer the same fate with which Creasy did his excellent work. That would be so wonderful (Sorry, I'm so resentful!). MAN ON FIRE is an exciting movie that you can not miss. It may be difficult for some of you, if you are not used to reading subtitles (Mexicans do that ALL the time while watching American movies) but the effort will be worth it. Some of the editions are a bit blurry ... something like TRAFFIC, remember? (Another brilliant take on how corrupt Mexico is). The film starts a bit slow, but the pace increases frantically in the second half. I swear you'll be cheering while you watch Denzel Washington dispatch the evildoers. His performance is nothing less than excellent. The ending (no spoilers, OK !!!) is a bit sad, but I'm sure you'll like it anyway. MAN ON FIRE is one of the best movies of the year. A "must own" for a DVD collection! 9 out of 10
