This film exhibits artistic cinematographic techniques in which, instead of capturing the attention of the camera in a landscape, it is about small details about how someone looks, how the woman may be wearing a cocktail hat and wrapped in a sheet. How the husband may be wearing a hat, socks and shoes and his underwear, and they both look so comfortable and comfortable. The provocation of the woman is another feature of the picture that the director chooses to let us know that he is a sexually free spirit and aims to obtain the pleasure he seeks without flirting directly or with a particular sensitivity to what the man may be feeling. The relationship between wife and husband is unique. It is an open topic in which he retains nothing, feels no shame for how he has behaved and wants to share these facts with him because his main focus is always on the fact of his marriage. Nothing and no one can interpose between the two. Only the possibilities of fate can intervene: his imprisonment during the war and what follows after his return at last. A very intriguing movie that is totally absorbing.
