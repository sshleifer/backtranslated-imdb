Seven Pounds plays Will Smith as Ben Thomas, an IRS collection agent who has a ulterior motive to meet those who have fallen behind in their tax payments. Thomas caused the death of seven people while driving talking on his phone and the film continues his attempt to atone for his, frankly, unforgivable crime. <br /> <br /> The story is as subtle as a brick. A green house window. What you see is exactly what is happening, even the end of the Titanic was more surprising compared to seven kilos. There is absolutely no turn at all, there is never confusion or doubt about what is happening. <br /> <br /> Normally, I only like Will Smith when he's in Bad Boys mode. The guy is at his best when he uses a gun, drives a Ford GT and says "Aw Hell Nah", because every time he tries to act seriously he only appears as a pathetic attempt to win an Oscar, which is so obvious that He is desperate. for. This is probably the main reason why I was not looking forward to seeing the movie, although here it is very underestimated. There are comedy flashes but they are subtle, in fact, it was Will Smith's most underrated performance I've seen, and just for that reason, it was fantastic and ironically I should be nominated for a big prize. <br /> <br /> The cast was also great: Rosario Dawson seemed pretty close to the death door in the whole movie, and Woody Harrelson and Barry Pepper were fine, as all the other players were biting. <br /> <br /> In general, it's a cry, but it's not throwing away all the usual sentimental cliches and violins so you have no choice but to cry. There were times that even my hardened heart almost broke. It will be hard not to find one of the situations that does not relate to your own life, which makes it seem even more real. <br /> <br /> I would give it 8/10. Will Smith's show moves towards drama without all the desperation of The Pursuit of Happiness and it's much better for him.
