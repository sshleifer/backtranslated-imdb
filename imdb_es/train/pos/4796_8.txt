"A truly beautiful story with a moral about brotherly love" describes this strange David Lynch movie. This was especially "strange" because it was not the kind of movie that Lynch had been publishing in the last 15 to 20 years. Those were dark and shocking movies (Blue Velvet, Wild At Heart, Mulholland Drive) and this is the opposite. I know he disappointed many of his fans. Others were delighted with it. Tell me as one of the last, and I also own the three "dark" movies. <br /> <br /> This was another supposedly real-life story, here's an old man's trip on a mower sitting from western Iowa to Wisconsin to see his sick brother he has not talked to in years but who wants to see before the latter dies. Well, I guess that premise, an old man who drives a lawn mower for 400 miles, still makes this a "weird" movie, so Lynch stays in character with that! <br /> <br /> Richard Farnsworth plays the lead role. He is the kind of person, face to face, voice, discrete personality, that almost everyone likes. The wrinkles on his face tell many stories. It was very sad to hear what happened to him in real life one year after the premiere of this film. <br /> <br /> The first 25 minutes of this movie are not many, and not always pleasant, as they show the main thing The adult and mentally troubled girl (Sissy Spacek) and her tragic past, but once Alvin Straight (Farnsworth) begins his journey, the story continues. I played this for several friends and they thought that the film NEVER came back, but I am more generous with it. I think it's a hidden gem. For them, it was a sleeping pill. <br /> <br /> I found your trip very fascinating, but you must realize in advance that this is NOT going to be a suspenseful Lynch crime story. It's slow and if you like it, you might like this. The charm comes into play in some of the people Alvin meets on the road, like a straying young woman who runs away and some nice people from the city who help the old man when he gets into trouble. (Henry Cada as "Daniel Riordan, is a standout in that regard.) Harry Dean Stanton gets the third bill, but it's a joke: he's only in the last minutes of the movie! <br /> <br /> The stage from Iowa It's nice, I lived there for several years and I can attest to the hills and the rich soil It's a good state with nice people ... like this movie.
