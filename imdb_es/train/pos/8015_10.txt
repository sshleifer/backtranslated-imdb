The first time I saw this movie in the theater was when I was 8 years old and it still breaks me. The Muppets are great and approach the world of entertainment in a refreshing and naive way. My favorite scene is when the rats start a whispering campaign on behalf of Kermit in an elegant restaurant. This is a smart and fun movie for children and parents alike. Long live Kermit, Miss Piggy and the rest of the gang.
