Bedknobs & Broomsticks is another of Disney's masterpieces. It was filmed with animation sequences and the actors and actresses interacting with the animations. (A similar concept was used in Mary Poppins when children and Mary disappear in the art of the sidewalk). I mainly rate this film through the eyes of children because I have not seen it in years. Back then, it was one of my favorite movies. It was magical and mystical, and the last scenes (the conflict that started with the ghostly armor walking in the battle) were my favorites. A lot of stop animation was also used with the spells (that is, people who become rabbits), which can be a bit outdated and silly now. (Also, I think the movie starts slowly.) Through the eyes of a child, this is a fun movie and it's easy for children to locate themselves in the children's places in the movie. It is an imaginative film that unfortunately is largely forgotten today.
