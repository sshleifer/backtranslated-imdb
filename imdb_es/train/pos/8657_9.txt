It's amazing that so many people I know have not seen this little gem. Everyone I have addressed has returned with the same reaction: WHAT A GREAT MOVIE! <br /> <br /> I have never cared much for Brad Pitt (although his turns in 12 monkeys and Fight Club show an improvement) but his performance in this film as a psychopath is disconcerting, dark and accurate. <br /> <br /> Everyone else in the film offers excellent performances and the slow and deliberate pace of the film greatly improves the procedures. The feeling of fear for the characters continues to increase as they realize what is really happening. <br /> <br /> The only thing that keeps this from a 10 in my book, is that compared to what came before, The ending is a little too long and exaggerated. but that is the only flaw I could find in this cult classic. <br /> <br /> If you review this movie, try to get the director cut without classification in the box for the best viewing option. <br /> <br /> rating: 9
