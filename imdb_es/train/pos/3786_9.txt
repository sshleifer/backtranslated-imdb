Ying, a Chinese girl who speaks Czech, invited us to show a Czech film (with English subtitles) in the Department of Visual and Environmental Studies (VES). It was the first time I saw Samotáři (Loners, 2000) and it was quite good. <br /> <br /> As in many other Czech films, the seven central characters seem to have a rather difficult and dirty life; The website indicates that this theme was popular among US films. UU in the early nineties. Their relationships are breaking, combining and recombining. Another typical feature of Czech films is that none of the characters is designed to be universally negative and none of them is a permanent positive character. In addition, you can see how the characters judge the characteristics of others according to the context; That is a very realistic characteristic of the psychological analysis of the film. <br /> <br /> Ondřej is a talented and married young surgeon who has two daughters. However, you discover that he has only studied neurobiology to show how much he loved another woman, Hanka. He is so obsessed that he dresses repeatedly as a plumber to enter the house of Hanka's parents, a house that burns repeatedly. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Hanka has a very mixed relationship with her parents. She simply decides, flipping a coin, break up with Petr who works at a private radio station. Hanka does not see the bourgeois life of her parents as a good example, but she seems not to succeed in creating a better environment. But she is a very flexible figure, in regards to the type of her boyfriends. <br /> <br /> For a while, Hanka seems to have serious plans with Jakub, an innocent drug addict whose memory seems to be quite devastated. for drugs. However, his band's friends inform Jakub that he already has another girlfriend. Hanka is disappointed and returns with her parents. <br /> <br /> When Hanka and Petr separate, it is organized by Robert, a matchmaker who also works for a travel agency where his job is to show the lives of ordinary Czechs. People to Japanese tourists. Robert, who also provides marijuana to Jakub, never takes anything seriously and usually sleeps with many different women; finally, his mother dies in a hospital and he has his own ways of dealing with depression. <br /> <br /> Vesna (a Slavic word meaning "Spring") who came to Prague from Macedonia works as a waitress - and you will not know if she came to the Czech Republic to see her father or the UFOs. She seems quite confused, but sometimes she helps the other characters solve their problems. <br /> <br /> Petr works at the radio station and he is the only one who likes his work, a job that he eventually loses. He announces to his audience that he broke up with Hanka, which is how Ondřej learns about the news that makes him very happy. <br /> <br /> Finally, Ondřej's wife, Lenka, is always willing to forgive him and stabilize his marriage ... Even after Ondřej asks a wizard to make him disappear so that Ondřej can try to capture Hanka again. (The magician pays his debt because he is the brother of a victim of a major car accident: Jakub and Hanka take the victim to the hospital and Ondřej saves his life). Lenka also works for the travel agency, as a translator, and eventually she has to translate some hysterical scenes for about 20 Japanese tourists who are filming their movies during Hanka's parents' dinner. <br /> <br /> The seven characters interact in an interesting and exciting way that would be natural if Prague were smaller. Four orders of magnitude. Given the actual size of the Czech capital, it seems a little unlikely that all these events take place between seven people, but it's fun.
