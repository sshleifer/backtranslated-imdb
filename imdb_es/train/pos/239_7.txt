['I saw this in the movies with my girlfriend at the time and I can say that I did not have the best time, mainly because I did not know about Ned Kelly or his story. <br /><br /> But since this is a biographical film, it is important to know at least what to expect from the character. <br /><br /> I do not know if the way in which events are said is true or if everything is fictitious. But the way Ned Kelly is portrayed as a hero and a fighter for justice really makes me want to believe that everything is true. I do not think they&#39;ve portrayed him as a criminal or a thief, but that&#39;s just my opinion. <br /><br /> This is a solid western type movie for all tastes. Heath Ledger is great as always and sexy Naomi Watts loves the screen. <br /><br /> Give this film a chance if it is transmitted by cable. Otherwise, I do not think I could recommend it.']
