It's amazing that the actress P.J. Soles did not become a big star after playing Riff Randall, number 1 fan of the punk rock group Ramones, in "Rock 'n' Roll High School". Soles is so exuberant, you do not care that she is obviously too old to be in high school (that fact is balanced by making all the kids look 24). The film is a fast-paced party that is not resolved; In the end, everything becomes a good idea, and that is how it should be. Mary Woronov, a strangely perverted and funny presence as the Nazi-style director, receives a large and unique part at the beginning where the frisbees fly dangerously close to her head (how many shots did they use for that, or was it a coincidence?) And Dey Young is very attractive as the best of Suns, Kate Rambeau. The weakest link, ironically, in this gang of "High School" are the Ramones. They can not act, they are not funny, and their concert segment lasts too long. A song by Ramones, "I Want You Around", is treated like a fantasy and is well captured; other incidental songs are good, particularly a rare Paul McCartney ballad that was heard near the beginning ("Did we meet somewhere before?"). Big fun! *** since ****
