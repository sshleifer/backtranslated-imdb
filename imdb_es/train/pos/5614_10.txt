It took me a long time until I could find the title in a special video library in Berlin, and I was lucky to find an English version with Dutch titles. I think it's one of the best horror movies. I find it strange that some people call this film a black comedy. I must admit that I could not laugh when I saw him for the first time (and it was the same with the second time!) On the one hand, Trelkovski seems so nice and even cute in his shy behavior, but on the other hand, he beats this Boy in the playground and there's no explanation for that. But the weirdest thing is, of course, his transformation into Simone Choule and the fact that he does not know who he really is. His hallucinations are the most terrifying of this movie. Of course, everything is in your mind, but is this plane the one that highlights your feminine side or was it also before it moved? I think that's an interesting question. Their shizophrenic behavior is difficult to understand and it is horrible to see their two sides or identities fighting each other. The result is that first you cut your hand and then jump out the window. But this terrible scream, does it mean that everyone will repeat again and again and again ... that their soul is in a cage or something? And these Egyptian hieroglyphics and other Egyptian things? The fact that it looks like a mummy in the hospital is not an incident, but a clue from my point of view.
