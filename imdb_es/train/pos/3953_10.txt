I saw this movie on television when it came out, and I never saw it again. For my life, I could not remember the title and I just stumbled while reviewing the credits of the Roy Thinne movie. Excellent, dark and spooky horror movie for television in the same class as "Crowhaven Farm"; "Do not be afraid of the Dark"; and "The school for girls of Satan", all lost satanic classics. I also think it has many parallels with Clint Eastwood's classic, "High Plains Drifter." Why not launch these fantastic little movies, especially if you consider all the latest junk that fills the discount DVD racks at Wal-Mart? Most of these movies have a cult following, so sales should not be a problem.
