This reminded me of Spinal Tap, on a more serious level. It's the story of a band doing a reunion tour, but things are not harmonious between them. I was especially impressed by Bill Nighy's performance as Ray. You felt sorry for him, but he had some concern about him. It's a great movie to see if you've ever seen your favorite band become wrinkled, old and pathetic. Great, highly recommended.
