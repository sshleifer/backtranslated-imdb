Elegantly directed, photographed in a picturesque way and with a brilliant performance? The interpretation of Crosby seems exactly correct, Hardwicke has his best role, while Bendix is ​​also a delight. This attraction of the Yankees is universal and irresistible. <br /> <br /> One of the main joys of the movie, of course, are the songs. As you might expect, Bing is in a good voice. And although Hardwicke's solo has been cut, we can still hear him sing with enthusiasm as he dances merrily with Crosby and Bendix in his famous novelty number, "Busy Doing Nothing." It is also a pleasure to listen to Rhonda Fleming, who, although she enjoyed an extensive theatrical career and concerts as a singer, rarely had the opportunity to be heard at the cinema. She has a lovely voice that fits her dazzling looks and looks very attractive in her Mary Kay Dodson costumes. <br /> <br /> Director Tay Garnett makes the most of his luxurious budget, using all the resources at his disposal to present each fabulous scene as effectively as possible. (Maybe the eclipse seems a little too artificial, but who is complaining?) <br /> <br /> In short, as the trailer really describes, a delight for entertainment from start to finish.
