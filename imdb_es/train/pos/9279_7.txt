The dramatic comedy "Out of play" by Jafar Panahi portrays some women trying to enter a sports stadium in Tehran where women are banned. The official reason: a lot of bad words, and football players have their legs showing. But of course, it's really a case of sexism. So, most of the film consists of a slight comic relief when women try to ask men serious questions about why women are banned in the stadium, and a woman even has her own plan to challenge men. <br /> <br /> As I understand it, all Jafar Panahi movies (including this one) are banned in Iran. The real tragedy is that the overthrow of the prime minister by the CIA in 1953 and the subsequent backing of the brutal shah gave Ayatollah Khomeini an excuse to use his narrow interpretation of the Koran to establish a chauvinist society, and George's current policy W. Bush towards Iran Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is an excuse to act as a cowboy and reinforce censorship. <br /> <br /> Above all, this is a good view of people who think how to challenge the system. It's not a great movie, but it's worth watching. Considering that all Jafar Panahi movies are banned, I wonder how you can even do them.
