And it's not because since his days in "Clarissa explains it all", I've fallen in love with Melissa Joan Hart, who at the time this program was popular was already more than 20 years old, but was still able to get roles of Teen "Sabrina, the teenage witch" was Hart's next big leap after his "Clarissa" days. Based on the comic strip, Sabrina Spellman is ... you guessed it! - A teenage witch who tries to balance her witchcraft antics with the demands of teenagers' daily lives. She is aided in her efforts by her two aunts and a cunning black cat while going from high school, to college and, finally, to her career in journalism. <br /> <br /> As usual, Hart is the heart and soul "Sabrina, the teenage witch" is quite moving and very funny, and it's a shame that it took me so much to realize how great it was. I just wish there were some newer episodes that we could all enjoy. <br /> <br /> 10/10
