['I loved this show and I am incredibly sad about its cancellation that I thought it also came back, but only two stupid weeks. That&#39;s terrible. I hate that we never find out how everyone ends up. It stinks. Bring it back! ABC has stupid programs like Supernanny and all that, but it does not give time to good guys like Six Degrees. If they complain about the classifications, it was probably because they had a bad slot because this was really a good show, something that I could relate to and anticipate. JJ Abrams complied, he&#39;s amazing, I wish ABC could trust him enough to complete the story. I also loved the entire cast. I could not wait to see how everyone would meet one day at a time. Everyone&#39;s story is now incomplete, now I will never know if Steven and Whitney would meet or Carlos and Mae. I wanted to see what would happen to Laura or Damien and everyone else. This is really a disappointment.']
