Anarchy and anarchy reign in the village of Elk Hills. The elders of the city replace the rugged and cautious Vietnam veteran Aaron (a wonderfully robust and attractive performance by Kris Kristofferson) and several of his fellow veteran colleagues to clean up the place. The plan is bitter when Aaron and his cruel friends decide to seize Elk Hills after getting rid of all the bad elements. It depends on the decent brother of Aaron Ben, Aaron (played kindly by Jan-Michael Vincent), stop him before things get out of control. The writer / director George ("Miami Blues", "Gross Pointe Blank") Armitage creates a charming loving, cynical and perversely subversive paleto. The western contemporary winner: expert creates a harsh tone and no nonsense, keeps the pace. Energetic and tireless everywhere, and staging the abundant action scenes with considerable muscle poise (the explosive climax is especially strong and moving). The first-class cast of familiar faces with B features is constituted as an important asset: Main Victory as Ben's sweet girlfriend, Linda, the fabulous Bernadette Peters as the Little Flaut singer, Brad Dexter as the mayor mayor, David Doyle as a muddy bank president, Andrew Stevens as a friendly service station employee, John Carpenter's regular, Charles Cyphers, as one of Nam's veterans, Anthony Carbone as an elegant casino manager, John Steadman as the owner of a former diner, Paul Gleason as an evil shipowner Shakedown Bully, and Dick Miller as a talentless pianist. Moral: Do not hire other people to do your dirty work. The ingenious photography of William Cronjager, the animated and harmonic score of Gerald Fried of bluebrass, and the abundant gross violence add to the amusement of the garbage of this little drunk unjustly neglected.
