"September 11", presented by Robert DeNiro, presents images of the exterior and interior of the Twin Towers in New York, on September 11, 2001. <br /> <br /> Never too creepy and bloody, but powerful and touching. "9/11" is a real pleasure. Anyone who has not moved through this television program is immune to anything. <br /> <br /> 5/5 stars - <br /> <br />
