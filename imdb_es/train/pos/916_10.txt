['My comments for VIVAH: - It&#39;s a charming and idealistic love story starring Shahid Kapoor and Amrita Rao. The film takes us to small pleasures like the families of the bride and groom who sleep on the floor, play games together, their friendly jokes and mutual respect. Vivah is about the sanctity of marriage and the importance of commitment between two people. Yes, the central romance is displayed naively. But the romantic moments hidden between the couple that is going away to marry and its obstinate resistance to the modern games of courtship cause that it longs for the idealismo. The film concludes predictably with the marriage and the groom, on the wedding night, tells his new girlfriend who suffers from burns: &quot;Come, let me do your bandage.&quot; <br /><br /> VIVAH: it shows many good things: the beauty of arranged marriage, the beauty of Indian culture, the beauty of Indian women, and last but not least, an IDEALISM of the couple who are about to get married in order to get married. .. playing by the rules! Simple but beautiful; A story so simple ... without argument ... there is no villain, as is the case in most of the films of Sooraj Barjatya. Sooraj sir is back to what he does best. He has made the film with COMPLETE CONVICTION. It is a very sweet film, which teaches the current generation many good things about arranged marriage and the union of 2 families. I think that AMRITA RAO looks very good and has done very well. She has most of the good scenes, although I thought that the last half hour was completely for Shahid Kapur, who for a change gives an incredibly moderate performance. I also liked the performance of everyone else eg. the Choti, that is, Amrita Prakash, Alok Nath, Anupam Kher, the brother and sister of Shahid. It almost seemed as real and recognizable as it could be. Sooraj has another good family movie to his credit after Maine Pyar Kiya, HAHK and Hum Saath Saath Hain. The chemistry between Shahid and Amrita is AWESOME. <br /><br /> Things like sanctity in a marriage / relationship, avoiding courtship, mutual respect, care and space, waiting to get married &quot;officially&quot;, pray / sacrifice to Ur Amado: all this and more are SHOWN in Vivah. There is still a good audience that goes and enjoys this movie. Some of the people / audience are already excited after seeing, they are thinking about an Arrangement-Marriage :) That is a success if you ask me. It seems that AMRITA RAO - our Vivah actress {Result for a nice performance} has received the prestigious DADSAHEB PHALKE award for 2006! Congratulations to her for this achievement, Chalo, although Vivah, Shahid or Amrita did not get any of the film&#39;s prizes and other awards; @ At least this is news for CHEER !! Congratulations to AMRITA RAO, for showing us an image of the future Indian bride in her purest form and of course Sooraj Barjatya for portraying her in the best way :) Do not forget Shahid Kapur and all the others that make VIVAH so sweet and legendary as it is today! Imagine, sharing the same pedestal as the legendary Dilip Kumar .......... It is not a significant achievement! Congratulations to Amrita Rao, for taking her career to another level with this award ... Personally, I feel that she should continue making films only with Shahid Kapur. They make a nice couple and their chemistry on the screen reminds me of {SRK-Kajol} or {Aamir Khan and Juhi Chawla} ................. <br /><br /> Some points that I observed, some of the elements: # 1 If you look closely, Amrita Rao looks great because she always wears traditional dresses. She gives every part of the essence of the Indian Woman - in this movie !! Perfect Fit # 2 Shahid Kapur is like most of us, not exactly ready for marriage or early marriage ... but PREM listens attentively to the step-by-step talk given by his FATHER: have full faith in Anupam Kher. Finally, &quot;Honesty&quot; and &quot;Confidence&quot; are the key words she reflects in her first conversation with Amrita. Most people would think that a first meeting with a stranger and a limited time is never enough to judge a person. But according to what I saw in this film, I have the feeling that two people who are made for each other can also connect in a first meeting. It&#39;s possible! # 3 Throughout the film, there are basically 4 or 5 sequences where Shahid and Amrita are together, or shown to be together. It&#39;s different from most other romantic / wedding-based movies where Hero &amp; Heroine always sing / dance or do cheap things nowadays. But the beauty of each of these 5 sequences: - Characterized by moderation, innocence and respect for the other! # 4 I really liked the relationship that is shown between Chacha ALOK NATH and Amrita Rao. These films should highlight the indifference shown to daughters / girls in some parts of India. # 5 The romantic scenes between the main couple are very well taken. There are no cheap scenes, the songs are beautifully illustrated! Words like &quot;Jal&quot;, &quot;praarthana&quot;, etc. they will be buzzwords for all the girls who have liked this movie :) Personally, I love many dialogues in this movie. # 6 Last, but not least: the whole hospital scene where Shahid puts &quot;sindhoor&quot; to Amrita when she is fighting for life, is great. Those dialogues between the couple are so touching and U feels that LOVE / I-cant-do-without-U; It&#39;s a hats sensation! <br /><br /> *** In many ways, VIVAH reminded me of Maine Pyar Kiya, DDLJ, Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak, Hum Dil of Chuke Sanam, for the freshness / chemistry of the LEAD pair screen :) :) *** IF IT IS ASK ME : - Along with films like Rang De Basanti, Lage Raho Munnabhai, DOR, CORPORATE and Kabul Express, VIVAH is among the best films made in 2006. IN REALITY, I think Vivah deserves a better visualization / business than Dhoom2 or Fanaa or Golmaal or all those hobby / fuzzy movies / style / trash!']
