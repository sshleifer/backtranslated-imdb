This movie I've been dying to see. Well, until now the decision was made to rent it. It was completely worth it. This movie made me laugh from beginning to end. Chris Rock is fun, no matter what movie he is in. However, this should be very similar to being your best movie. If you are looking for a family movie, that is, pre-teens and more, then this is one you can not pass up.
