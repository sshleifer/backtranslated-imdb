Seeing "The fox and the child" was an intoxicating experience. The exuberant images, the integrity of the point of view and the absolute beauty of the setting and the characters left me in a fit of pleasure. <br /> <br /> The plot has no complications. Deceptively simple. Within the container of that simplicity unfolds a world that attracts you and leaves you breathless. <br /> <br /> I laughed. I cried. I learned. <br /> <br /> This is a movie you can trust, deliver it to you. I dare say that it is an act of love destined for any innocent heart. It reaches the heart of the spectator, of any age, and reveals the world through new eyes, as if seen from the heart. <br /> <br /> Adi Da Samraj once said that true art attracts the viewer beyond Point of view of ecstatic participation in reality. I feel that I have had the privilege of seeing, no, of participating in this film, a work of true art.
