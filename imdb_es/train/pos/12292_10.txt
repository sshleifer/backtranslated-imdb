['I love this movie, Jouvet, Arletty, Blier, Carné ... almost everything has been said about the film, but there is a detail about which I would like to clarify something: there are no images of the real, still standing, the Hôtel du Nord (is it still? I heard it had to be demolished ...) has been used for the film: the whole scene has been reconstructed on the set, the main reason is that they could not stop the traffic on the St Martin channel for several weeks']
