I have seen this movie many times and I will never tire of it. It is a classic in every sense of the word. The film is hysterically funny and, at the same time, quite moving. For those of you who are not fans of the "subtitles" or the foreign movie in general, open your mind. This is a great movie for "the beginner" because the story is very entertaining. Do not get me wrong, it's 100% Japanese (and that's what makes it work), but everyone will get something (even if it's just a big laugh at one of the main characters called Mr. Aoki - one of the funniest characters I've seen!) <br /> <br /> I can not even think about this movie without smiling !! I love ... and I think most people will too.
