Greetings again from the darkness. How weird it is for a movie to examine the lost soul of men in pain. Adam Sandler plays Charlie, a man who lost his family in the tragedy of September 11, and since then lost his career, his reason for living and, possibly, his sanity. Don Cheadle co-stars as the former roommate of the Sandler Dental School who seems to have the perfect life (which apparently had Sandler before 9/11). <br /> <br /> Of course, the parallels in these men's lives are obvious, but it's actually refreshing to see the feelings of men on display in a movie ... feelings other than lust and revenge, that's. Observing how you really help each other just by being there is painful and sincere. Writer / director Mike Binder ("The Upside of Anger", and Sandler's counter in this movie) really gives the film a different look and feel. Some of the scenes do not work as well as others, but in general they are well written and well directed. <br /> <br /> Sandler and Cheadle are excellent. The character of Sandler remembers a little his excellent performance in "Punch Drunk Love", but here it brings much more depth. Cheadle is always good and does a good job expressing the load that he carries ... just seeing him do a puzzle. <br /> <br /> The support work is excellent on the part of Jada Pinkett Smith (as Cheadle's wife), Liv Tyler (as a very patient psychiatrist), Saffron Burrows (in a strangely attractive role), Donald Sutherland as irritated judge and Melinda Dillon and Robert Klein as Sandler's parents-in-law. <br /> <br /> The film really refers to how the tragic events of that day so deeply affected a man who is basically in ruins. Besides the interesting story and some great pictures of New York, you should love any movie that shows the voices of Chrissy Hynde, Bruce Springsteen and Roger Daltrey ... as well as Eddie Vedder posing as Daltrey. It's not exactly an optimistic movie, but it's a quality movie with an unusual story.
