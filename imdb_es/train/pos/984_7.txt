I ran into "Bait" on the wire one night just as it started and I thought, "Hey, why not?" I'm glad I gave it. <br /> <br /> "Bait" is not perfect. He suffers from an unnecessarily flashy address and occasional nonsense. But in general, this movie worked. All the elements lined up perfectly, and they achieved what might otherwise have been a pretty ugly movie. <br /> <br /> I think most of that is due to Jamie Foxx. I do not know who labeled Foxx for the lead, but whoever he was he did this movie a big favor. Reliable and amazingly friendly, Foxx slides through the film, soft as butter and funnier than hell. It can be said that he is working by instinct, and instinct does not fail him. <br /> <br /> The plot, although unimportant, actually joins quite well, and there is even a character arc through which the Foxx character grows as a person. . Once again, they could have happened without any of this, but it only makes things much better. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised by the low rating of this. Maybe I just captured this movement on the right night, or vice versa, but I would give it a 7/10. Bravo, Mssr. Foxx
