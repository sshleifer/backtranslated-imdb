This is the best of the 43 films made by Rainer Werner Fassbinder; Its most successful at least. He was one of the principal directors in New Germany after the Second World War. <br /> <br /> Hanna Schygulla was magnificent, since the cold and calculating Maria Bruan, who lost her husband in the war, found him after she took away an American soldier. as a lover, he lost it again after he went to prison for her, and found it again at the end. His day and a half of marriage before his disappearance was longer than the time they spent together at the end. <br /> <br /> That's life. Things come and go, and you do the best you can. You can abandon or adjust your way of thinking to survive. Although Maria adjusted her thinking and did what she had to do, she never stopped loving Hermann, which makes the ending a tragedy. <br /> <br /> Excellent drama.
