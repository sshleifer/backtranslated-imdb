Zero Day is a movie that few people have seen, and it's a shame. <br /> <br /> When I saw the end, where the two main characters descend to the room and kill people without mercy, then they commit suicide. , and it made me grab my stomach. I was shaking, that's how strong this movie is. <br /> <br /> The movie is incredible. It's too amazing to not have a perfect ten. It's sad that so few people understand the true beauty of this movie. It's not a budget that makes a movie good, it's the amount of feelings that creators put into it that makes it good. <br /> <br /> It leaves a permanent impression in your mind that you simply can not get out. It makes you realize the real horror of the shooting, especially if you knew that person, and this movie makes you feel like you know these people. <br /> <br /> I recommend Zero Hour to those who feel they are mature. Enough to see it. I am fourteen years old and I feel that this film is too amazing to put into words. It feels like you're seeing something that really happened.
