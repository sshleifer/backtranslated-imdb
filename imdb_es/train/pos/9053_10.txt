1.) This movie was amazing! I saw him while he was in the city next to the one he grew up with! I went and saw the buildings in which the story unfolds. In general, I loved this movie, one of the best of Jake Gyllenhaal! Also, my favorite parts were the science fair and every time with his father. They were so sad, it seemed. Homer wanted to follow his dream and his father did not seem to care one way or another. That line of the label is true. "Sometimes One Dream is bright enough to light up the sky." 2.) The way this film was shot was impeccable, it was so credible that it could have been recorded during the 1950s. The dress was accurate and they also had their jargon. I definitely recommend this movie!
