['I feel that Monarch Cove was one of the best &quot;Drama&quot; series written and performed on any network in a long time. This show had great potential and I could not wait to see it every week. This could be developed into a great primetime soap. People expect this kind of performance since we are being &quot;Reality TV&quot; outdone. I crave the kind of writing and acting that is shown as Dallas, Knots&#39; Landing, Dynasty, MelRose Place, etc. Monarch Cove updated this concept quite well and I anticipated that it would only improve. There is a lot to expand with these characters and they were all very interesting and captivating in their own right. It would be a waste not to explore this and develop these characters after having drawn and hooked into their world. I loved this show because it was mysterious, interesting and sensual without exaggerating or offending. I loved.']
