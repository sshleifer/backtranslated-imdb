How The Grinch Stole Christmas instantly stole my heart and became my favorite movie almost from the first time I saw it. Now, eight times later, it still has the same impact on me as the first time I saw it. <br /> <br /> Screenwriters Jeffery Price and Peter S. Seaman of Who Framed Roger Rabbit, fame, do a fantastic job of adapting The Grinch's story to the screen. The direction of Ron Howard made the story come to life full, and the typical energetic performance of Jim Carrey when The Grinch steals the show. <br /> <br /> Some detractors of the film have claimed that it is not true to the spirit or principles of the original story. Having read the original story, I must say that I can not agree. The film makes the same point about Christmas and its true meaning as the original story. In fact, it improves the impact of history by making it more personal by showing us how and why The Grinch became what it was. <br /> <br /> * MILD SPOILERS * (They probably would not ruin the movie for you ... but if you have not seen it yet and you're one of those who does not want to know ANYTHING about a story until you've seen it, you should skip the next two paragraphs. <br /> <br /> I think almost everyone can relate to The Grinch's terrible experiences at school, I think all of us, at one time or another, were the unpopular ones at school that always They were chosen, I know it was ... and that's why I personally felt so much sympathy for The Grinch and what he went through. <br /> <br /> And for Cindy Lou, who was a naive idealism, believing that Nobody can be so bad, it was the heart. "Rending When everyone else had turned their backs on The Grinch out of fear and ignorance, Cindy Lou was determined to be her friend, if only everyone could have such an attitude. <br /> < br /> In fact, I think the only thing that could have improved the film a little bit would have been dull r even more humor and adult content. I was already quite restricted, but any of this adult humor (like when The Grinch hit the nose for the first time at the neckline of Martha May Whovier) just does not fit into a story like this. <br /> <br /> This is fine. A way to be a Christmas classic, occupying a well-deserved place along with the book and the caricature of Chuck Jones as a must-see in every Christmas season.
