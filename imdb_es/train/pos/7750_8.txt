['Barman directed Any Way the Wind Blows as if he were singing a song by DEUS. Anarchy governs a logical and common tension of thoughts. The story behind this movie is how the wind blows. And that can be really refreshing to see, if you&#39;re prepared and willing to do it. The spectators who say that there is nothing to keep the story lines together are right. Who the hell is that Windman anyway? Still, I really enjoyed this movie. Antwerp is a beautiful and bustling place, and Any Way captures that feeling. It also captures stupidity, racism, bureaucracy, addictions and violence that survives undetected in a seemingly friendly city. The film is entertaining, fun and a little superficial. Barman&#39;s screen debut will not have as much impact as his debut in music. In that sense, some may be disappointed. But, again, &quot;The worst possible scenario&quot; would be a subtle subtitle for Any Way the Wind Blows.']
