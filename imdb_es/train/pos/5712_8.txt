This is a great irresistible movie, cheerful and, technically, greatly made! <br /> <br /> The film presents some of the best-looking scenarios you've ever seen in a 1930s movie, although it's all too obvious that they're sets, rather than real places. Often, if a character would fall or shake a doorpost that is too aggressive, the whole set would obviously move. <br /> <br /> The best moments of the film were the silent and outdated. It shows that the real heart of René Clair was in the making of silent films. Humor in general is really great in this movie. Also, of course, the musical moments were more than great. This is an early French musical, nice and simple, very nice and simple. Although the best moments are the moments of silence, that does not mean that the film is not full of a great comic dialogue, the main actors, who seemed to me theater actors, seemed very good to me. Good for the movie, its general style and its pleasant atmosphere without worries. No wonder this has worked so well, since this film is actually based on a play by Georges Berr. <br /> <br /> It's a really great movie, with a great innovation in the camera work and something really great. Editing, which creates a bit of going fast and enjoyable to watch nice sequences. There's never a dull moment in this movie! <br /> <br /> René Clair was such an intelligent director, who knew how to build and plan comic moments in movies. It is a very creative film, which in spite of its simplicity, feels at all times like a totally original and ingeniously constructed film, which never takes advantage to entertain. <br /> <br /> The last half hour is especially fun and unforgettable, without spoiling. Too much, and it's really one of the best, as well as most of the creative moments in the first comedy movies. <br /> <br /> The movie is full of some really nice characters, who of course are very stereotyped and dumb. and obviously they were thrown out due to their appearance. Everything adds to the pleasant and light comic atmosphere and tenderness of the film. <br /> <br /> One of the nicest movies you've ever seen! <br /> <br /> 8/10
