['It&#39;s time for a tirade, huh: I thought Spirit was a great movie to watch. However, there were some things that prevented me from rating it higher than a 6 or a 7 (I&#39;m being a bit generous with the 7). <br /><br /> Point # 1: Matt Damon makes me worse. I was thinking, &#39;What a delicate voice they have for the main character&#39;, when I first heard it, and then I realized it was Matt Damon. The man bothers me a lot, his performance in &quot;The Departed&quot; was terrible and ruined the movie for me (before the movie had a chance to ruin itself, but that&#39;s another story for another time), as he almost did &quot;Spirit&quot; I was able to overcome this fact due to the little narration that there was in fact ... fortunately. <br /><br /> Point # 2: Brian Adams sucks ... The total score was terrible ... The songs were unoriginal, generic and poorly executed; Not once did I find the music to fit; and the lyrics were terrible. Every time one of the loose songs came out, they turned me off. I almost thought I would start listening to patriotic propaganda in the lyrics of the super-American style of freedom (I could not help remembering those terrible patriotic songs that were constantly heard on the radio after 9/11). In light of the Native American aspects of the film, they should have gone off with the right music using appropriate instruments, not small radio trash, adolescent, 14 year old girl. I thought I was back in high school. I can not believe that it could not have been done better; I refuse to do it. If it had not been for this, I would classify the film more with Disney, who knows something about originality (okay, do not bother saying what I know some of you are probably thinking;). Pity, it&#39;s a pity that they could not hire better musicians. <br /><br /> I liked the art and the animation, except for a few things here and there ... as sometimes the angles appear too sharp on the face and the lines too thick or dark on the body (thick / dark lines mainly near the end). Many times I thought that they worked too hard on emotion and facial expressions and failed to draw any real emotion. But there were also times when the emotion ran thick. Anyway, many scenes were lazy and the layers were obvious. <br /><br /> Well, I&#39;m falling asleep here, so I&#39;ll summarize it before it makes less sense ... <br /><br /> Nice attempt at an epic movie ... although it was mediocre. Matt Damon, you suck!']
