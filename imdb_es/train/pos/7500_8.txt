If you think "Weird Al" Yankovic is funny, you will not be disappointed by THE COMPLEAT AL. This rare simulacrum not only presents many of Yankovic's most memorable videos ("Like A Surgeon" and "I Love Rocky Road" among them), but they are also interspersed with funny vignettes that supposedly highlight the parodist's rise to fame. Yankovic is not for everyone, but his humor is harmless and imaginative enough that even those who are not fanatical have fun at least slightly. Fanatics fans will love it not only for its content, but also for its relatively early appearance in Yankovic's career of almost three decades. Suitable for all ages, children will certainly love the funny pictures.
