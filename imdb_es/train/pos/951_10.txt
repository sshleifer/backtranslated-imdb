I know that many people have a special fondness for Alistair Sim's version of Dickens' story, but for me, this 1984 version is the best. My wife and I have a copy of this movie on VHS, and we see it together every Christmas Eve. I often commented that we could also see it on Halloween, because it is a very spooky ghost story. <br /> <br /> Scott, typecast as Scrooge, is shockingly bad and unpleasant, making his transformation even more miraculous and miraculous. exciting. I think he's up there with his performance in Patton. All spirits are effective, each more frightening than the previous one. Observing the dark, floating and skeletal form of the Christmas Spirit that is yet to come causes me chills every year. And what a support cast! David Warner, in particular, is in top form as Bob Cratchit, as is Susannah York as his wife. <br /> <br /> I seem to remember that this version adheres more to the original story than most of the others, but I may be wrong, since it has been several years since I read it. In any case, this is an excellent Christmas classic.
