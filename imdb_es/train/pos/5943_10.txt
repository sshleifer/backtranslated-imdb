['This movie is really great. Everything seems to have come out of the comic. The sets, the costumes, and the plot is great. Clark Bartram is again our favorite batman. He looked a little better in the dead end, but he still succeeds. Superman is great too. The flight effects are fine. But it&#39;s a movie for fans, so we can not expect them to be the best. The shot with Superman catching the car was VERY believable. it was great. This is a movie that I would definitely see if it were real. It has everything you want in a Batman / Superman movie. However, one exception is that I would throw the wildcard instead of 2 faces ... in general, I give this film a 10 because it is a great movie.']
