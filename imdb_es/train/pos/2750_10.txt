This is the kind of movie that the United States does not do. That's why people rent foreign films. It is a great story about how a person, even if delayed, can make a person find the reason in an empty life. Everyone can learn from Georges. It also shows how people with mental problems suffer in their lives and shows them in a very realistic way (I think). As is classic in foreign films, this movie has a bittersweet ending, but that only makes it a better movie.
