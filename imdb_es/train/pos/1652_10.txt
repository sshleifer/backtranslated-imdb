This series introduced me to the writing of Deighton and the genre when I was younger and I love this presentation of the story. However, I disagree with the previous comment. From what I've read in the past, it's not Holm's performance that leads Deighton to refuse to launch the series, but the carnage that the three books received in translation to the screen. A great example of this is the rewriting of the border crossing that ended with the Samson field race. The scene is not in the book, the character who dies in the minefield was never in any of the books and the crossing in Sinker went from East Germany to West Germany, not to the Polish border. This whole story is made of cloth. Changes in Set similarly damage the integrity of the story. My perspective on Holm's performance was that he excellently portrayed Samson's disorientation during his wife's defection and I think he behaved well in portraying the aging field agent desperately trying to save class division. Samson pays for his father's idealism and suffers because of his influence in his life. As Clevemore says, if he had educated himself, he probably would have run the department. I believe that the true loss of performance is due more than anything to physical appearance. Holm is tiny compared to the Samson of the book, a physically impressive man capable of using his size to impose a presence.
