The movie "Men in White" is definitely one of the funniest comedy movies, if not the funniest, I've seen in my life. (And I watched enough!) These are two bandits, who become "Men in White" and then stop an invasion from space. It is also a parody of many classic movies, such as "Men in Black", "Star Wars" or "Dr. Strangelove". Anyone who says that this movie is horrible has something wrong in its head. There are tons of funny jokes and jokes here, and you may hurt your mouth for laughing too much (it happened to me!). If you can watch this movie on television, watch it now, you will certainly not regret it!
