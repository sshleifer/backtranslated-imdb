I once lived with a roommate who tried to commit suicide, and our apartment was in a building where you could get a fifty dollar noise violation for sneezing after midnight, so, needless to say, I can easily relate to "The tenant" of Polanski. <br /> <br /> But I also enjoy the movie for other reasons. I'm not sure it works, in general, the descent of the character of Polanski to paranoia and madness, which takes about half an hour or so, seems quite jarring and strange. Ebert, for example, was not convinced, and slapped the film with a critique of a star. But I think the scenes and the individual moments work perfectly, so even though I do not understand the whole movie very well, what does Egyptology have to do with that, for example? - I still have a positive overall impression of this. <br /> <br /> I love the hateful friend that Bernard Fresson portrays, for example. God, how many times have I settled for having friends as stupid as those instead of having no friends! I love the movie scene, I would say it's the funniest moment to "kiss" in the history of cinema. And boy, do I love Isabelle Adjani? She is so cunning in this movie, it's almost incredible. And she gives a great performance, as always. <br /> <br /> Polanski is also a good actor; I do not agree with occasional derogatory comments about his performance here. It is assumed that his character is low profile and thoughtful, so his low profile performance fits. I, for one, found him perfectly sympathetic, although he lost me a little when he started to dress in drag clothes without a clearly discernible reason. <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie is dark. And slow. But it captures the alienating qualities of life in an apartment, something I've done too much for, what I like. It's funny that everything you need is a common point of reference, and suddenly a weird movie like this one becomes deeply meaningful! Definitely worth collecting for pocket change on DVD.
