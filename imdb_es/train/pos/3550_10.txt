This is what the musical genre was made of. Humor, talent, romance and action, all in one. <br /> <br /> Frank Sinatra was wonderful. Nothing else needs to be said. Marlon Brando, although not a singer, did a great job earning the hearts of many with his interpretation of Sky Masterson. The fact that he could not sing was added to his character. The ladies in the movie were fine, but the men in the movie definitely stole the show. <br /> <br /> It is a true classic that can be appreciated at any age. It connects with all audiences and makes you smile and laugh. <br /> <br /> Definitely a movie to see and enjoy!
