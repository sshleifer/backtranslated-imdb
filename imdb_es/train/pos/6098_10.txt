['This is a television program based on a horror movie that does it well. On Friday the 13th the series had no connection with the cinema. Poltergeist the legacy: I&#39;m not so sure. It may have been lightly connected to the movies. It feels as if they only released a famous title in a program for fans to see. <br /><br /> It shows Freddy burned by the parents of Elm Street (I think in the first episode) and the number of parents was disappointing. With all the children you targeted in the first 3 movies, you would expect more parents. But, oh, good. <br /><br /> Freddy is basically the narrator of the show. He observes the actions of people in the real world who sometimes get involved in some way. Like other anthology programs, such as Tales from the crypt, there is a supernatural turn or surprise that involves. <br /><br /> The performance is lacking, but believe it or not: the violence sometimes exceeds that of the film. This show lasted a couple of seasons and was performed at the time of the fourth film. I heard it was canceled because of the protesting parents. I saw a lot of R-rated things when I was a kid, so it&#39;s a shame that parents had to ruin it for everyone. 4 more movies came after the series, so it was not a total loss.']
