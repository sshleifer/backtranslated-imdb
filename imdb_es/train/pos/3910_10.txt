['So I&#39;m at home, changing channels one night, and I find this man with heels and makeup, standing in front of a colored background on HBO. Naturally, I made a double shot and decided that I would watch her for a while. I did not change the channel until it was over, it was incredibly fun. The next time I turned it on, I made sure to record it so I could see it again and again, and it has been one of my favorite things to watch. During the first few minutes, you can say that the audience is not sure what to think, but quickly wins with their incredible humor and wit. While many comedians are mixed in my brain, Eddie Izzard stands out as one of the best. His style is incredibly refreshing, and it&#39;s nice to hear jokes about things like history and puberty when most comedians stick to current events. His show stayed with me later. I went to Italy during the summer, and all I could think about while I was there was how &quot;the Italians are always on scooters going &#39;CIAO ...&#39;&quot; 10 out of 10. See it. You will not regret.']
