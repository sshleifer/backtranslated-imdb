I thought it was an extremely intelligent movie. I was very happy with that and I really could not ask for more. Actually I own the film because I did not give it back to anyone ... Which I should do, but I really want to keep it because of how much I enjoyed it. Also, the fact that I do not own too many foreign films and this is the first time. Now, I personally love Finnish things, that definitely added to how much I enjoyed it. But in general, it's worth seeing. However, if you are not quite trying to understand Finnish or read the Subtitles, then this movie is not for you. <br /> <br /> 9/10 sure.
