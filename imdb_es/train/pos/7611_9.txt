"I've looked into the eyes of this island, and what I saw was beautiful," proclaims one of the main characters on the award-winning ABC television show "Lost." The series could be summarized as a dramatic story about a group of plane crash survivors stranded on an unknown island, but that would be detrimental to the series. "Lost" follows a large group of characters that come into conflict with the island, each other, and ultimately, themselves as they struggle with their new way of life and their dependence on each other. The situation becomes more complicated when it becomes clear that this is also not a common island, and that they may not be alone. <br /> <br /> My initial fear after hearing the concept of this series was the lack of new stories that could be told after a certain period, but this turned out to be unfounded. The narrative flows naturally, the dialogue is ingenious, the characters are memorable and the execution is excellent. The island is a character by itself, and to understand this comment, you should see the series by yourself, which only shows its originality and greatness. <br /> <br /> At the time of writing this review, only the first two seasons have aired, and they are full of strong episodes. My only slight criticism is that the second season seems to slow down a bit halfway, but then, fortunately, it comes back in an admirable form for the final episodes. <br /> <br /> If I can recommend a television series, I should follow it correctly. Now, without a doubt it would be this one. If you like excitement, adventure, stories motivated by characters, an extremely strong cast and crew, beautiful places and an island that seems more spiritual than natural, "Lost" is for you. Just make sure you start at the beginning.
