['When I saw this movie for the first time, it was a recorded copy and the title was / is Caged Terror. I still have the tape, and I confess that I have seen it more than once, from beginning to end! The film has an extremely low budget and dialogue is often unintentionally fun! I managed to get some of my friends to see this and we laughed a lot with the terrible script. The film refers to a couple, (remember that this is like in the early 70&#39;s, they are too modern a man!) They go on a weekend camping trip in what I think was supposed to be the state from New York. They have a fun dialogue after catching and eating a fish and the girl regrets the death of the fish and they ate it! The boy returns with something ridiculous about how they ate the fish and now he was part of them, and he leaves; &quot;And that&#39;s a beautiful man!&quot; Heavy man, really heavy! Haha Anyway, along with a couple of Vietnam veterans, one of whom plays the flute, I think. (In any case, they are musical types!) The boys are clearly attracted to the girl and when the couple is hostile, they end up terrorizing them during the night. The boy ends up caged in a chicken coop, and has to watch his girlfriend be raped by the two boys. Actually, at the end of the night, he seems to like it a lot, and when the morning comes, the boys leave and the girl and boy are free to leave. Supposedly the boy learned a lesson on how to treat people, and the girl has a smile on her face! :) Anyway, I would recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for a good laugh. Anyway, never stop having fun! If I could find this on a DVD and replace my old tape copy, I would buy it again, it&#39;s a classic camp! You have to love these things!']
