I really enjoyed it, and although the ending made me angry, I still give it 10 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Four college girls (Baltron, Kelly, Stahl and Cadby) are driving to Florida, on in their way they meet 2 men (Turner, Davis), they really do not add anything to the plot, but at least they are somewhat pleasant. The girls agree to meet with the kids from Florida to have fun, but they have problems with the car and they never make it. One of the girls decides to go to a nearby gas station for help, the other three stay in the car. <br /> <br /> Soon one of the girls has to use the bathroom, since it is in the middle of nowhere. There is no choice but to go to the bushes. Soon, when a man (March) witnesses a woman, terrified, the girl flees from the area, does not get very far, but manages to get lost. <br /> <br /> Your friends who are in the car are going to look for you. for her, they also enter the forest and meet the same man, one of them sees the dead woman, the man responds by shooting the girls, the other girl flees, manages to return to the car where she is also killed. <br /> <br /> Eventually, the two remaining girls meet and, upon entering the gas station, are arrested. That's when I started to get angry, these poor girls are afraid for their lives and the police do not believe them. <br /> <br /> They are mistreated and one of them is left alone for the madman to kill her. In the cell, the remaining friend manages to escape, but not without getting into dangerous situations. <br /> <br /> This movie has nudity, good actresses, a shower scene that imitates Psycho, graphic violence towards women and a solid story. Some women will probably consider it offensive and sensitive people will NOT like the ending, but in general, this is a great little unknown movie.
