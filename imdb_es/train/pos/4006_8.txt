[WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS] <br /> <br /> I have an adult friend for whom the idea that their parents have sex makes her terribly uncomfortable. It came to my mind when I reflected on the reaction of the audience to "The Mother". <br /> <br /> People gasped when May (Anne Reid) writhed passionately in bed with her younger lover, Darren (Daniel Craig) or later saw sexually explicit drawings of May. I doubt that the audience was horrified by the nudity or the content of the drawings as much as by feeling uncomfortable seeing a woman in her 60s enjoying sex with enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> Screenwriter Hanif Kureishi ("My Beautiful Laundrette", "My Son the Fanatic") again demonstrates why he is among the most passionate storytellers on both sides of the Atlantic. His story is not easy to take. This dramatic family drama is not a movie that can say that he liked seeing it because it is raw, complex and often makes us uncomfortable. However, it is powerfully good. <br /> <br /> Kureishi and Roger Michell (who directed "Notting Hill" of all things) create a portrait without sentimental, heartbreaking and excellent performance of an older woman who realizes, after all In these years , she can and should enjoy all the pleasures of life. In a wonderfully epiphanic moment, when her son, Bobby, asks her not to be difficult, May responds: "Why not?" <br /> <br /> Why not, indeed. <br /> <br /> Anne Reid deserves an Oscar nomination for her turn in May. He is subtle, moderate, powerful and sad, often all at the same time. I look at Reid when May watches Darren and Paula (Cathryn Bradshaw) in an apparently passionate clutch in a pub. Or, when she begs Paula to open the front door after a disastrous appointment. Reid's eyes and face reveal all May's anguish and despair. At the most devastating moment in the film, May falls to her knees before Darren, ready to do anything for him, just asking him to be nice. This is a tremendously bold performance by a remarkable actress. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the use of Michell's natural sound, especially when May and Toots first arrive at Bobby's house. He perfectly illustrated the cacophony surrounding May and Toots, the frivolous way in which his own family welcomes them. <br /> <br /> This movie, at times, reminded me of the honesty and rawness of Mike Leigh's work, except "The Mother" clings to a slight feeling of optimism to stay afloat. <br /> <br /> My only objection: Michell's decision to give the love scene of May and Darren an almost corny sensitivity. The lovers remain unfocused while, in the foreground, a white curtain flutters gently in the breeze. And the only sound is May in the midst of passion. <br /> <br /> The problem with Michell's approach is that both Reid and Craig, who completely surround the role of Darren, break into these roles so boldly that it is unfair to hide the almost primitive energy of their characters from the audience. Especially since Michell has no qualms about visceralizing later sex scenes. <br /> <br /> This movie does not have hugely nice characters. We sympathize with May, but she also causes her daughter's suffering. But I doubt Kureishi intended to relate his story to nice people. His point, I think, was to unmask a family that is already breaking down when something emotionally catastrophic happens. He is unwavering in his frankness and, ultimately, unforgettable.
