Usually, I love these 1930 films by Charlie Chan, which are no exception. However, something seems wrong with this movie. A late attempt to move from Moto's brain films centered around plot plots to a salad bar ruined by the relief of comedy is as relief as sore feet. A boxed buffoon appears out of nowhere, pretending to be a clumsy Englishman who plays the detective, and even other characters seem entangled to provide comedy relief. The plot may seem strange or a simple excuse for us today, but at that time the possibility of archaeological discoveries of time was not only real, but a common fact.
