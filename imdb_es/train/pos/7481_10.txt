I could not agree more with the quote "this is one of the best movies that have been made". If you think Vanilla Sky is simply a "renewal", you could not be more wrong. There is tremendous depth in this film: visual, musical and emotionally. <br /> <br /> Visually, because the film is soft and delicate at times (early scenes with Sofia) and other times powerful and intense (Times Square, post-climatic scenes). <br /> <br /> Music and sounds are perfectly related to this movie. Without music, the story is told only half. Nancy Wilson created an emotional, but eclectic score for the film, which could not be more suitable for a dream theme (although it was never published, I was able to get the original note for about $ 60. If you look closely, you may be able to find a copy yourself). Crowe's other musical selections, such as The Beach Boys, Josh Rouse, Spiritualized, Sigur Ros, Monkees, etc., are also perfect for the film (Crowe has an ear for good music). <br /> <br /> More importantly, the emotional themes in this film (ie, love, sadness, regret) are very powerful, and are magnified ten times by visual and musical experience, as well as witty dialogue; I admit that the elevator scene makes me cry over and over again. <br /> <br /> However, the best part of this movie (as if it could be improved) is that it is designed so smartly that everyone Once you see the movie, you will see something new, so look closely and be prepared to think! Of course, a subject becomes obvious after the first or second observation, but there is always more in the story than you think. <br /> <br /> This is easily the best work of Cameron Crowe, and a whole work of brilliance. Much of my cinematographic and musical inspiration comes from this work alone. Honestly has touched my life, as true art has a tendency to do. I am continually surprised that there are many people who can not appreciate this film for what it is (I suppose that understanding true art is an art in itself). <br /> <br /> In a nutshell: Vanilla Sky is in a league of its own.
