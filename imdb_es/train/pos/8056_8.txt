['This image in 1935 took all kinds of Ocars to the Best Director, John Ford, the actor Victor McLaglen and the music of Max Seiner. Victor McLaglen, (Gypo Nolan), &quot;Call Out the Marines&quot;, &#39;42, had an outstanding performance as an Irish rebel who belonged to a harsh and tough crowd that was fighting for a cause and at the same time becoming more and more poor with alot of drink. Gypo Nolan made a serious mistake when he decided to become an informant for his best friend to travel with his girl to America and a new way of life. Preston Foster, (Don Gallagher), &quot;Guadalcanal Diary&quot;, &#39;43, gave a great supporting role as leader of the Irish rebellion and was eager to capture the informant of his group. Gypo Nolan becomes obsessed with his friend&#39;s betrayal and begins to feel like a Judas. Great movie for 1935 and wonderful performance of McLaglen, but quite depressing in all aspects of the film.']
