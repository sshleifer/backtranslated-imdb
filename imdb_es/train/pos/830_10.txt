I did not have high expectations of entering the film, but I thought it was fantastic. Pierce Brosnan is outstanding in a very different role. He has left the polished armani suits for a ridiculous look and it is worth showing that he is an excellent actor. Pierce and Greg Kinnear play very well, and form one of the best pairing of friends in a long time. The humor is dark, the performances of Brosnan, Kinnear and Hope Davis are great, mix that with a moving element in the history of friendship, and you have a great movie. This is probably one of the best comedies of friends in a long time. This is a movie that definitely shows that we can expect great things in the post-Bond era in Brosnan's career.
