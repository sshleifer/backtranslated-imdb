I always like this movie when it appears on television. <br /> <br /> The only scene that always stands out, for me is that of Myrna Loy and the foreman painter, in which she gives a lot of importance. Explicit instructions on colors and as soon as she leaves, he turns to his own and says: "Did you understand that? That's yellow, blue, green and white."
