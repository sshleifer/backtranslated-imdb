A lot of information to summarize, and if you've seen Zizek, you know his rhythm. <br /> <br /> Also if you have not seen most of the movies or at least some other films by the same directors. mentioned in this document, you will be somewhat lost. <br /> <br /> And the list of movies is long. The director includes Hitchcock (Psycho, Vertigo, Birds), Lynch (Lost Highway, Mullholland Falls, Wild at Heart, Blue Velvet), Tarkovsky (Stalker, Solaris) and The Conversation (Coppola). <br /> <br /> There are some segway movies like, Star Wars: Espisode III, Matrix ... but I suspect they are baits. To be sure, Zizek is never boring, but if he does not buy (or if he cares) psychoactive analytics, then he will be upset until the end. <br /> <br /> But it should not be, like the settings, the clips, the way the movie is interspersed with these clips, the Zizek points are never boring.
