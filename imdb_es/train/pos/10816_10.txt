['No, this is not supposed to be a high budget brilliance, but it&#39;s brilliant in its own right. you have to see it for what it is, a low-budget masterpiece that involves a zombie rapist who drives a 12-inch love rod that keeps fluttering calmly. Those who came to give this film a low criticism probably looked for the next cult classic or hidden &quot;gem&quot; as they say and simply did not arrive. I love how they all point out obvious observations like the &quot;5 cents baby sticking to a fish stick&quot; hahaha, well, yes. I do not think a movie with a budget like this can afford &quot;good&quot; actors or effects, so they worked with what they had. The entrails and entrails were actually very convincing. The film was a little choppy going from sequence to sequence, but in general, this is one of the best movies I&#39;ve seen lately that does not follow any trend or predictability. very good to laugh']
