The first was good and original. It was not a bad horror / comedy movie. So I heard that it was a second and I had to see it. <br /> <br /> What really makes this movie work is the character of Judd Nelson and the sometimes intelligent script. A pretty good script for a person who wrote the final Destination films and the address was fine. Sometimes there are scenes in which it seems that it was filmed using a homemade video camera with a grainy appearance. <br /> <br /> Great movie made for television. It was worth the rent and it was probably worth it to buy just to have that weird feeling and see Stanley from Judd Nelson do what he does best. <br /> <br /> I suggest newcomers to see the first one before seeing the sequel, only that they will have an idea of ​​what Stanley is like and get a bit of history.
