I studied Charlotte Bronte's novel in high school, and it left an impressive impression on me. Here was a beautiful novel about a young girl's struggle to find love and acceptance in the dark times of Victorian England. This young woman was Jane Eyre, a poor and simple character with a strong mind and her own will. Her story, which Bronte told through Jane's own eyes, was both sad and inspiring. <br /> <br /> As part of our study, we saw the 1983 adaptation of the story, and I was surprised. The miniseries not only made the effort to stay true to the original text of Bronte and the essence of the story, but the actors who portrayed the characters were great. Both Zelah Clarke (Jane Eyre) and Timothy Dalton (Jane's lover, called Rochester) brilliantly captured the essence of their characters. I can not imagine anyone else in their roles. (Rochester's other presentations in other versions, such as the 2006 version, lack the passion, energy and tenderness to portray Rochester accurately.) I say that Timothy Dalton stands out because he has all these characteristics in his interpretation of Rochester. Zelah Clarke not only looks like Jane Eyre, but captures Jane's calm, firm and passionate nature, keeps her emotions, like the Jane in the book, at the appropriate moments in the story, but allows her fire to come to light Passionate Scenes The chemistry that Clarke and Dalton portray in their scenes is also believable and true to the relationship between Jane and Rochester. <br /> <br /> I recommend this version of Bronte's classic tale if you have not read the book Previously, you can see this production as a faithful introduction to this beautiful story.
