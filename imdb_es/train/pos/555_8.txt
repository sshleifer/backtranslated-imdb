My comment would have been added to the RELEASE DATE section, but I could not find a place for it. I was very surprised to see that this movie premiered in the USA. UU In February of 1955. I saw her in a theater "for the first time" in Washington, DC, in March of 1958. I wonder if it was relaunched or some problem. ? In my opinion, this movie is a very light entertainment, but it has some classic characters. John McIntyre does a great job as a judge / businessman / corrupt thief. Walter Brennan does basically the same role he did in Red River years before. And, in my opinion, James Stewart gives as good a performance as he always did. I've seen this movie half a dozen times or more, and I never tire of seeing parts of it again. The photography and the landscape are splendid, and it offers a lot of entertainment in one hour and thirty six minutes.
