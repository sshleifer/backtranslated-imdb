This movie really woke me up, as if I woke up the main male character of this movie bravely different from his dream of life. <br /> <br /> This guy John (Ben Chaplin) leads his mediocre and secure life as a bank teller. a small city of English provinces, until Nadia (Nicole Kidman), incredibly beautiful, wild, to die, ordered by email from Russia, enters her life to become his beloved wife, according to John's plan. However, a flaw appears: Nadia does not speak a word of John's language. Although he is calm and emotionless on the outside, John is so interested in the beautiful Nadia that, instead of using the full refund policy of the pairing service, he buys a dictionary to start the communication process. <br /> <br /> What will happen from now on? In the plot it really shakes poor John from his dream of a decent employee who feels safe and feels at home in a decent and decent action figure, giving the viewer a subliminal message "you probably would have acted the same". <br /> <br /> Kidman, Cassel and Kassovitz make the Russians act in a great team and are almost indistinguishable from reality, "almost" only because of the slight accent present in their Russian dialogues, although they are mild enough to surprise a native Russian for the hard work done to make the words sound good. Nicole Kidman demonstrates once again his talent by playing a character quite different from the previous roles, at least from the cultural background. <br /> <br /> The pace of the film is fast and captivating, and you're certainly not ready to stop seeing when the final titles appear, you prefer to feel like you're in the middle of the plot and you have the desire to see the sequel as soon as it comes out. <br /> <br /> My advice is to go out and get this movie immediately and see it and enjoy it. In short, it has an unusual plot, a great performance and ideas below the surface. Like the idea of ​​the "rude awakening" of the safe artificial life of a wheel in the machine of a Society, the life that the members of the Fight Club were so willing to leave and the machine that Pink Floyd sings ("Welcome to the machine! "). I bet that in the end, John went rather with Sophia on her way to the unknown than not having known her at all. <br /> <br /> Thanks, writers, for the great story, and all the others for this. great movie! Please make a sequel! And you can place it anywhere and name the location, since the authenticity of the place is irrelevant to the 99.9999 percent of potential viewers, I'm sure.
