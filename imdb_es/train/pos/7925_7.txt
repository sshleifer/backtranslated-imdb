['The silly movie is very, very funny. Yes, it has its dead moments, it can be a bit too obvious, it declines a bit in the second half and the story is an incoherent mess, but it laughs out loud at all times. And it&#39;s worth seeing it just for Ed McMahon as a right hand. This movie belongs to the same class as Elvira, Mistress of the Dark, another incredibly funny and unappreciated movie.']
