To say that this film is simply a demonization of Catholics and a distortion of history is not true. That is not what this movie is. <br /> <br /> What this film is is a commentary on the abuses of the Church (although this could be replaced by any powerful body), the ways in which this abuse affects individuals and families. and the way in which many people choose to simply allow and often participate in the abuse without thinking for themselves. The fact that it is the Catholic Church that is wrong is simply due to the nature of the real story on which the film is based. Labeling this as propaganda against Catholics seems to overlook the truth about what the Catholic Church has done at times; Its history is often not very good and it is something that films like this stand out and that should stand out. Yes, we should comment on the abuses committed by other organizations, but that is not the competence of this film. <br /> <br /> It's an amazing movie that made me cry and it's worth seeing it "if we do not do it." Studying the past, we're forced to repeat it.
