After watching 'Break a Leg' in Vancouver at the premiere party, I thought it was a very nice movie. <br /> <br /> I had a few laughs and some of the cameos (Eric Roberts in particular) were yelling. I have not heard of the actual release date, although I've heard it's close. <br /> <br /> The story is simple but it is mainly a vehicle for the characters and situations. The script is smooth and without problems, the plot develops effortlessly and the performance is comfortable but fresh. This film has won at least one award from EVERY one of the film festivals it has been in, around 10 to 15 or so. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend 'Break a Leg'.
