Personally, I think Sayonara was the best movie he made. He touched all emotions, from anger to romance, to complete the tragedy. And Brando should have won the best actor. Anyway, the movie is amazing, the man is attractive to BOTH MEN AND WOMEN, and now you have no reason not to see it! Do it, and fall in love.
