Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE, is a mostly effective cooler with a fascinating story based on Aboriginal myth. Richard Chamberlain performs well as a defense lawyer, whose life becomes increasingly immobile from reality as he delves into a murder case involving tribal Aboriginal rivalries. David Gulpilil plays one of the suspects, who goes to great lengths to guide Chamberlin through the realm of "Dreamtime," a reality / central alternative timeline for Australia's native history and tribal customs. With an intense atmosphere, deliberately ambiguous in the layout, the film develops to a disquieting end that is somewhat diminished by the negative effects, probably due to budget constraints. However, an intriguing film whose general impression of mystery and fear lurks just below the surface of what we perceive as "reality" will stay with you.
