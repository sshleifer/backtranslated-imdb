The story of the child thief of Baghdad (as it was spelled) has attracted the filmmakers of Raoul Walsh in 1924, who starred Douglas Fairbanks in the first and silent interpretation of "Thief of Baghdad", in less imposing and more recent attempts. The best, however, is still the 1940 version, which for its time was a surprising and magical collection of high quality special effects. Those effects still work with its charm. <br /> <br /> No less than six directors are on the list for the Technicolor film starring Sabu as the thief, Abu, John Justin as the depraved monarch and dreamer in love, Ahmad and June Duprez. as the lovely princess sought by Ahmad and persecuted by the evil vizier, Jaffar, played by a sinister Conrad Veidt. The giant genius is skillfully acted by Rex Ingram. <br /> <br /> Ahmad is deposed by Jaffar and then, arrested by that traitorous serpent, he and the child, Abu, suffer what are clearly incapacitating destinations. Ahmad becomes blind and Abu becomes an adorable dog. His adventures through the cheerful scenery of Hollywood backlots are fun, but special effects make this movie work. <br /> <br /> Two men were responsible for everything from a magic flying carpet to the giant genie that comes out of a bottle with a tornado-like black swirl: Lawrence W. Butler and Tom Howard. (Howard, by the way, made special effects for the 1961 version of this film, both men had a long and distinguished career in technical magic.) <br /> <br /> Duprez is incredibly charming, while little is needed to act seriously. Ahmad de Justin projects a romanticism driven but dreamer without touching by erotic impulses. Sabu is really the central actor in many scenes and is very good. For a film directed to both children and adults, there is a fair amount of violence, but of the type that does not have blood. Still, I do not think anyone under the age of eight should see "Baghdad Thief." <br /> <br /> This film appears periodically on television, but today my teenage son and I saw it in a theater with enough young people present. It was great to see children tormented by the computer in a well-off community respond with cheers and applause to the special effects that should seem primitive. <br /> <br /> "Baghdad Thief" is a Hollywood classic from before the war. at a time when strong production values ​​often resulted in long-lasting and important releases. This is one of the best of its kind. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
