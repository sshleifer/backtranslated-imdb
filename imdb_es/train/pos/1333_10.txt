I love this movie, I saw it again and again. I do not see why anyone would think that this movie was not good. Maybe you've seen it better or whatever, personally I love it. It's one of my favorite movies and I'm not Hindi at all, but I love it. It may be a bit like "Pretty Woman", but I have not seen it and I do not think it's better than this. I do not know why they're tearing it apart, but maybe I have a good reason, but I think I've said it enough, but I love this movie, and for those who say it's not right, I wonder why you saw it and what movies you consider good. As for everyone who saw it, they also enjoyed it, so I'm surprised that many people do not like it. As for Rani Mukherjee (I think that's how her last name is written), she is very beautiful and my favorite actress.
