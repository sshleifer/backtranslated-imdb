A fantastic show and a classic not made. The League of Knights remains one of the best modern comedies of recent times. <br /> <br /> With a dark and strange style of humor that stands on the tired and formulated approach of his inferior, but, unfortunately, much more recognized successor. In Little Britain, The League of Gentlemen was really something special during a fairly quiet time in British comedy. <br /> <br /> Until his arrival on the scene, there had never been anything like The League of Gentlemen before. On the surface, an apparently simplistic sketching show, the show soon unfolds as a vivid, sinister but incredibly hilarious universe, populated with all sorts of bright comic creations. What really differentiates the program from its rivals is its approach to tell us its story. Instead of serving retouched sketches, barely distinguishable from the following, here we see each individual or group of characters reviewing their various journeys and story lines. No visit is the same, and each time they offer us a surprise. <br /> <br /> Gradually, during three series and a Christmas special, the fictional city of Royston Vasey is full of grotesques. hilarious population. And that's probably the main reason why it's so fun to watch the show (and also why the show would easily deserve more series) Unlike other current shows like The Catherine Tate Show or, what's more Important, Little Britain, the League knows when. a character has followed his course and has the opportunity to deal with that. Several of the fans' favorites, which could have been entertained even more, were removed before the series came to an end, giving space to the other characters to grow more, or allowing the introduction of new residents of Royston Vasey. leave your mark <br /> <br /> Another thing that sets this show above others is that the writing team approaches the script process with care and intelligence. As mentioned above, the four members of the League have a sensible mind when it comes to judging the longevity of their creations, and when it is time to stop smoking with respect to certain characters. This awareness has also meant that The League of Knights experiences a bold evolution, which is not usually seen in a show of this nature. The third series guided by the narrative and much darker is a bold step to get away from the first two series based on sketches, and this bold movement of the League is really worth it. With the third series, there is less urgency to please an audience, and like the Christmas special, they pursue individual stories with a clear narrative, unlike the earlier series based on sketches' that (successfully) linked several sets of draws in the arc of the long history of a series. <br /> <br /> The third series is both a refreshing change of style and a real pleasure for fans who have already seen the first two. Despite the polarized opinion on the third series, any true League fan will appreciate what the third series offers, and will really enjoy the more character-based episodes, which only delve into fan favorites, but will they match and are interleaved. Wine characters that may not have crossed previously. <br /> <br /> It may take a bit to try to change the style, but it's definitely worth it, and in my opinion, the third series is the best and it also provides a firm conclusion for the series. <br /> <br /> The show is not without its drawbacks and, very occasionally, certain characters and pieces appear somewhat out of place, but for the most part, the genius of writing, dark nature. The show and the large number of brilliant characters (who are often very close to real life) become a real pleasure and show what comedy is about and they play a large part on the most recent comedy attempts that are very flashy and often desperate. shame
