It is a play, adapted to the screen. 95% of the film takes place in the beautiful home of playwright Sidney Bruhl (Michael Caine). He is the author of a fabulously successful Broadway play, but his last 4 efforts have failed - horribly. <br /> <br /> An aspiring dramatist, Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve), who attended a writing and writing workshop given by Sydney. He has sent him a copy of the work he has written. Sydney tells his wife, Myra (Dyan Cannon) that the work is fabulous, a sure success. But is it good enough to die? Time will tell. <br /> <br /> Intelligent dialogue and numerous twists and turns in the plot keep this movie entertained from start to finish. The entire cast seems to have a good time. It is reminiscent of another fun mystery of Michael Caine: Sleuth. Worth seeing. <br /> <br />
