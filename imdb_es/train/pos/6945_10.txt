['My favorite movie genre is the western, it&#39;s really the only movie genre that is of American origin. And despite Sergio Leone, nobody makes them as Americans. <br /><br /> At the top of my list of ten favorite Westerns is Winchester 73. It was the first couple and the only black and white film of the association of director Anthony Mann and actor James Stewart. It was also a historical film in which Stewart opted for a percentage of the profits instead of a direct salary from Universal. Many of these deals followed the players, making them as rich as the tycoons who used them. <br /><br /> Anthony Mann up to this point had mainly done B-images, black-type things without real budgets. Just before Winchester 73 Mann had done a good western with Robert Taylor, Devil&#39;s Doorway, who never gets enough praise. I&#39;m sure James Stewart should have seen it and decided that Mann was the person he decided to partner with. <br /><br /> In this film, Mann also developed a mini corporation in the way that John Ford was legendary. In addition to Stewart, others in the cast such as Millard Mitchell, Steve Brodie, Dan Duryea, John McIntire, Jay C. Flippen and Rock Hudson would appear in future Mann films. <br /><br /> It&#39;s a simple plot, James Stewart is obsessed with finding a man named Dutch Henry Brown and killing him. Why I will not say it, but up to this point we had never seen a fury as cold as James Stewart&#39;s on the screen. Anthony Mann searched the soul of Jimmy Stewart and dragged some demons we all fear having. <br /><br /> Hatred is aptly demonstrated at a great moment towards the beginning of the film. After that Stewart and his partner Millard Mitchell are disarmed by Wyatt Earp played by Will Geer because the guns are not carried in Earp&#39;s Dodge City. There is a shooting contest for a Winchester rifle in Dodge City and the favorite of the bets is the Dutch Henry Brown, played with the threat of Stephen McNally. Stewart, Mitchell and Geer go to the living room and Stewart and McNally see each other at the same moment and look for weapons that are not there. Look at the close-ups of Stewart and McNally, they say more than 10 pages of dialogue. <br /><br /> Another character with whom Stewart is in the film is Waco Johnny Dean played by Dan Duryea who almost steals the film. This may have been Duryea&#39;s best moment on the screen. He is a psychopathic killer who is deadly like a left-handed draw despite having two six pistols. <br /><br /> Another person with whom Stewart is found is Shelley Winters, whose fianc√© is incited to a confrontation of Duryea and murdered. His best scenes are with Duryea, who has fallen in love with her. She plays for time until I can escape from him safely. Guess who she ends up with? <br /><br /> There are some wonderful performances in some small roles, there is not a bitter note in the cast. John McIntire as a cunning Indian merchant, Jay C. Flippen as the army sergeant and Rock Hudson received his first real notice as a young Indian chief. Even John Alexander, better known as &#39;Theodore Roosevelt&#39; in Arsenic and Old Lace has a brief but impressive role as the owner of a trading post in which both McNally and Stewart stop at different times. <br /><br /> Mann and Stewart made eight films together, five of them westerns, and were ready to make a sixth western, Night Passage when they fought and Mann left the set. The end of a beautiful association that produced some quality films.']
