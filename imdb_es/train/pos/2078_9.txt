This adaptation of the Pearl S. Buck film is definitely a classic. A true Hollywood epic, it has all the things that a great Hollywood movie has: birth, death, happiness, sadness, euphoria, despair, etc. There is only one thing that bothers me. I know it was a sign of the times, but neither of the two main characters are played by Asian actors. Paul Muni was a great actor, and he does an admirable job as Wang Lung, the owner of a farm in China. Luise Rainier plays Olan. It does not even look Chinese! I think she tried to get the part, but they should have put Anna May Wong in the role. I know why they did not, and Miss Rainier is very good in the movie, but they just tried to make it look "real". Stillm is a great movie, especially if you read the book (I did it in high school, decades ago). It is a must see, just look beyond the casting. I think you can.
