I watched the film for the first time on the BBC on July 27, 2005. For me it was a good interpretation of the person Conan Doyle, and I really wonder what the fans of Sherlock think. I also think it's a movie for these fans, whether or not they agree with what is mentioned. You can ask yourself if you were a strong A.C. Doyle or questioned. However, he was the creator of the famous Holmes, but how much of that was a kind of semi-biography? However, I strongly present this adaptation, it is a movie you must see, even if you are not interested in the Sherlock Holmes movies or books, take a look, have fun and have your own opinion about it.
