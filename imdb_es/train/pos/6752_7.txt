A detective (Dana Andrews) with a reputation for violence accidentally kills a suspect in a murder (Craig Stevens) and then tries to cover it up. The film directed by Otto Preminger has a lot of atmosphere, but the story is diluted when the wife of the dead man (Gene Tierney) falls in love with Andrews. I was doing pretty well going in and out of a big hole, but she was too light at the end of the tunnel for a black movie. Gary Merrill is great as Scalese, a criminal boss that Andrews is obsessed with knocking down, and the tension between them gives the movie its energy and momentum, especially a scene in a bathhouse with Merrill, Andrews and Neville Brand, and the Evening appointment outside Bellevue Hospital, which states what the film's conclusion should have been. High ratings for the atmosphere, Andrews, Merrill, etc ... and the general representation of the underworld, although the angle of love and the simple good cop do not help.
