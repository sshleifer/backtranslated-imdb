Actor Paxton made his directorial debut with this chilling, dark and competent thriller about a widowed mechanic (Paxton himself) who chases his two sons to participate in savage ax murders, claiming that the victims are not human beings at all but "demons " , and that have been selected by God to destroy these "demons". All this is told in a flashback by one of the sons, now grown up (Matthew McConaughey) to a skeptical FBI agent (Powers Boothe). <br /> <br /> It is difficult to automatically forget this movie; Better than most serial killer features, it's a twisted and disturbing story told directly with a minimum of cinematic tricks. Paxton, commendably, barely shows blood until near the end. Well performed by everyone, especially the two children actors (Jeremy Sumpter from the recent "Peter Pan" and Matt O'Leary from "Spy Kids 2" and "Domestic Disturbance"). The only reason I deduced any point is because I can understand that some people can find all this difficult to digest. In any case, it's an atypical thriller with a decent script. <br /> <br /> 8/10
