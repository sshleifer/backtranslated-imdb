This magnificent film is based on a variety of talented actors and musicians in their best form: Levant, Crosby, Martin, Rathbone, Manone are completely at ease in the story that was apparently provided by Billy Wilder. One would like to know more about how much it had to do with this, because it is an exceptionally intelligent variation of the sterile master / fertile server tale, almost an allegory of the entertainment industry, run by a large number of players, but converted in a vibrant world of art and game by an exploited subclass of nobodies and not WASPs. Looking at the last six decades of music, television and film in the United States, it is difficult not to see the underlying ideas of this film as prophetic.
