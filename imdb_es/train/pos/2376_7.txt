All the people who are reviewing this movie, and probably many professional film critics, just do not understand it. This film was made with matting sequences and artistic techniques, such as the works of the great Czech filmmaker, Karel Zeman. If you want to know what I'm talking about, I suggest you get some of Zeman's films, such as The Fabled World of Jules Verne, Baron Munchausen, The Journey at the Beginning of Time or On the Comet. If you can not locate a movie, read the reviews in AMG. They will explain the processes used. If one looked at Zeman's work and tried to compare it to any of the other science fiction films of the time, viewers probably would not have seen it either. It is unfair to compare any of the styles of these filmmakers with the standard technologies of the time, because Zemen and Hines "do not compute". They have a style that is unique to them and they should be judged just for their creativity. If you watch this movie from a perspective where you KNOW that you intentionally tried to create a collage of mattes mixed with live action, you could easily come to the conclusion that you did a masterful job. It is not easy to make a lot of computer clippings flow. I thought the creatures were pretty good, too, considering how they were made. Hines took a big risk, and I think that his film will not be judged fairly in the coming years. Someone who promotes the film should have warned the audience about what they would see, instead of letting them go to the theater blindly, waiting for the usual CG work. Regarding the actors, I think Hines also took a page from Zemen's book, since many of the Zemen actors at first had no expression, but they became much more interesting as the movie and the action continued. It's totally refreshing for me to have this movie in my library. I will see it in the next few years, the three great hours of it.
