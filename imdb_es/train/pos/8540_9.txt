It's funny how your life can change in a second ... Attending '' The Waterdance '' for the first time was an unforgettable experience, the way you need to get used to a new way of life can seem terrifying, and to notice that there is Other people who go through a similar situation can help you continue. <br /> <br /> The performances of Eric Stoltz and mainly of Helen Hunt (oh man!, Helen is the purest and gravest woman on earth ...) are wonderful, Wesley Snipes also surprises in one of your last serious roles. A simple and at the same time profound film that does not leave us indifferent to the message that is transmitted: enjoy every moment of your life ... <br /> <br /> Really to a movie like that. time is not served !!! (Sorry, it's a Brazilian expression ...).
