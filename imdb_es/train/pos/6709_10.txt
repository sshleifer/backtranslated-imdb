['What I love about this program is that it follows the lives of modern witches and it is an incredible experience to experience their everyday love, humor and adventure. The literature of magic is so diverse that it portrays the ideas of classical, medieval and modern magic, such as Harry Potter and Sabrina. With Sabrina, the teenage witch, this show is very fun and unique because it allows us to experience much of that modern magic, it&#39;s worth seven seasons! This show has many great qualities and it is a joy to see Sabrina live her daily life in the mortal world and &quot;other&quot;. I would recommend this to any family because the television series is clean, fun and adventurous. Classic!']
