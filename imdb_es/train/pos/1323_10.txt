A widely sold book about honor killings in Jordan is withdrawn by its editors after they claim that history has been invented; associated with other complaints from the past of its author as a scammer. A few years later, it reappears, admitting that it took a certain dramatic license but willing to cooperate with a filmmaker to demonstrate the content of its allegations. What follows is a fascinating insight into a pathological personality, the behavior of someone who has one has no meaning unless what she says is true, but, apparently, she is unable to say something that is not surprisingly dramatic but does not be tested at the best and most often, verifiably. false. It is almost impossible to imagine what Mrs. Khouri hoped to gain by appearing in this film: vindication? celebrity? - all it accomplishes is to project an image of itself as a deeply damaged individual, and even that can not be taken as a nominal value. The director Anna Broinowski appears more and more on camera as her film progresses, and she is increasingly exasperated to start; but finally it is rewarded with an extraordinary story, although terrifying and disturbing, to tell, and one of those films that reminds us in what a strange world we live.
