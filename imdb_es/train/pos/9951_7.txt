If you've ever wondered why they do not do pornography with a plot, look at Dream Quest. On the one hand, he must give Armstrong credit both for making the effort to capitalize on this idea and for using a strong cast of adults to leave behind a power of name. On the other hand, it also quickly becomes apparent why most pornography never have more than 15 or 20 seconds of dialogue connecting sex scenes. These people simply can not act (and, unfortunately, the story is unconvincing). <br /> <br /> Even so, I gave it a 7 because it was a good try and there did not seem to be much. Of an effort to cut corners. Also, I would like to see more attempts like this one. Maybe one day I will see the perfect combination of porn and plot.
