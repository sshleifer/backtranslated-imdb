Anna (Charlotte Burke), who is just on the verge of puberty, begins to have strange dreams that begin to affect her in real life, especially with a boy named Mark (Elliott Spiers) whom he meets in his dreams. <br /> <br /> Very unusual fantasy with some truly frightening moments. Even though she is a teenager and has a PG-13 rating, it is NOT for children. Also, if you hate fantasies stay away. But if you're in the game for something different, this fits perfectly. <br /> <br /> Well run by Bernard Rose with a beautiful musical score and some nice and terrifying shakes. The only thing that prevents this is a really great movie is Burke: she is not a very good actress (it is not surprising that this was her only movie) and it hurts the movie. However, all the others are simply great. <br /> <br /> Spiers is very good like Mark; Glenne Headley (simulating a British accent very well) is also very good as the mother of Anna and Ben Cross is both fearsome and friendly as Anna's father. <br /> <br /> A sleeping blow when it was launched in 1988, has vanished. That is very bad, it is really very good.
