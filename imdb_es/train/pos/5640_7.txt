I really think that this movie is great, personally. But, in every movie there is a disappointment. Now, some of you may not have seen 'Raise your voice' by Hilary Duff, but if you think about it, those two shows are very similar, if you know what I mean. In 'Brave New Girl', Holly wants to enter the Haverty Conservatory. In 'Raise Your Voice', Terri wants to go to a conservatory in L.A. (I do not remember the name of the conservatory there). Both are in the field of music, and both have to sing at the end of the semester. It's very funny how these two movies are the same. Personally, I like "Brave New Girl" more than "Raise Your Voice".
