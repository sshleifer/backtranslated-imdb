Farewell Friend, also known as Adieu L'Ami / Honor Among Thieves, is not perfect, but it's an exciting and entertaining thriller in which you see Franco-Blazers Algerian war veterans, Alain Delon and Charles Bronson trapped in the same vault of the basement. another to clean up the two million salaries that are there during the Christmas weekend. Naturally, things are not so simple even after opening the vault, which leads to some twists and turns ordered. On the debit side, there is a very strange striptease scene in a parking lot, Bronson has a very irritating slogan like Fonzie that he uses at the most inopportune moments, Brigitte Fossey, wearing perhaps the most horribly badly conceived hairstyle of the 60s ( does it look like a bald woman whose wig is blown back from the top of her head by a strong wind), is it a kind of responsibility? "I'll cook spaghetti, I'll learn how to make love well, I'll read Shakespeare!" Is the speech hysterical in all the wrong ways? And it's a shame the horrible last line / photo, but otherwise, it's a surprisingly entertaining and unpretentious number that is worth reviewing if you can find a decent impression. <br /> <br /> The UK Cinema Club DVD only offers English soundtrack, but as Delon Voces and the rest of the cast are pretty well nicknamed, it's not a big problem, especially since the widescreen transfer It is of very good quality.
