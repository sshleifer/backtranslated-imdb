Fast and simple, I love this movie. <br /> <br /> As others have mentioned, I'm not from the south either, I do not care about country music and I've never used a cowboy hat. (I've never driven in a car with a body in my trunk, but I love "Goodfellas"). This is simply a great movie. Filmed in an aspect ratio of 2.35 and beautifully transferred to DVD. (The VHS was 1.33 full screen). And yes, a solid 5.1 mix for your visual pleasure. What can you say about this movie? <br /> <br /> It's just a great love / hate story set in Texas, with excellent performances. Travolta is fantastic. Together with "Pulp Fiction", it is the best thing he has done. He has been in my top 5 for 25 years! It's a 10 !!!!
