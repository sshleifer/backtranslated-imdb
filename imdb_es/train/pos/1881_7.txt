Like the drunken millionaire playboy Arthur Bach, Dudley Moore is perfect as an adult man trapped in childhood. As it turned out, the paper fit perfectly with Moore, who also caught him as an actor. Soon many disappointments followed (including the pale sequel to this film), but that does not diminish the charm or attractiveness of this image, which is intelligently written and directed. Some of Moore's drunken scenes are forced, parts of the film are unstable, but the cast acts with such enthusiasm that it's a hard movie to resist. He has a big heart and gives the Oscar winner, John Gielgud, a crafty and dryly funny role as Arthur's servant, Hobson; Their relationship with Arthur is delicious and they have a miraculous relationship. Liza Minnelli (as a lover of blue-collar interest) is shameless in a low tone and Moore is cheeky, but skillful and lively; He never left Arthur's shadow, but at least we have this document of a high point of the career to appreciate. *** since ****
