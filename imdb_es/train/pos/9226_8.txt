I read about FLAVIA THE HERETIC for many years, but I could only see it at the beginning of last year, when I started a madness about buying movies and, for whatever reason, lately I have it in mind, although it's been a few months since I saw it . <br /> <br /> It's an amazing movie, set in Italy somewhere around the 15th century. Definitely it was from the Middle Ages (although I do not think there is any specific year). This is the age of Christian descent, the time is a time of absolute madness, and the film captures this very well. <br /> <br /> Flavia, our protagonist, is a young woman who meets a Muslim fallen on a battlefield. . He seems a warm and intriguing type, and she is immediately taken with him. His father, a soldier of a family of some kind, comes almost immediately and murders the wounded man before his eyes. But she will continue to see him in her dreams. <br /> <br /> Her father sends her to a convent that looks more like an open-air asylum: the residents, so severely repressed by relentless medieval Christianity. , slowly go crazy. Flavia is under the influence of one of the craziest nuns. But in a crazy world, only the healthy are truly crazy, and this sister sociopath clearly recognizes the madness that surrounds her. His interpretation of the times in which they live is a chord with Flavia, who, being young and apparently protected, is beginning to question everything about this world in which she is trapped. <br /> <br /> The film is unbreakable in its portrait of that world, showing a lot of unpleasant things. We see a gelding, a man rapes one of the women of his lands in a pigsty, the pious torture of a young nun. Throughout all this, Flavia observes and questions, rejecting, eventually, the Christian dogma that creates such a parade of horrors in terms that would gain in the film some criticism over the years to seem anachronistic. I do not agree with that criticism. Flavia's views, although sometimes expressed in ways that vaguely reflect, for example, the contemporary feminist comment of the time (the film was made in 1974), revolve around what are actually quite obvious questions. It is, perhaps, hard to believe that she could be a fish out of water in her own time, but that is the kind of minor point that is not enough to comment on. Flavia is written in such a way as to allow those of our era, or of any era, to match their situation. Getting stuck in such an affair would lose the forest to the trees. <br /> <br /> Flavia feels encouraged when Muslims arrive, invade the countryside, and find, in their leader, a new version of the handsome one. Islamist who still visits his dreams. Beaten with her almost immediately, he allows her to lead virtually her army, becoming a figure of Joan of Arc with all the battle equipment, and directing the invaders to overthrow the Christian society, and taking revenge on all those she has seen committing evil /> <br /> Is she the herald of a new and better world? She may think so, but the Muslims of that time were not great in feminism either, since she soon learns in the most difficult way. As they say, meet the new boss ... <br /> <br /> This is really just a miniature of some of the things that happen in FLAVIA THE HERETIC. The movie is quite dreary, and with a very strong ending, quite depressing. It's not a mass audience movie, to be sure. However, it is quite good and does not belong to the "nunsploitation" stack in which it is often thrown without care. I think there's a lot of value in the final film, and I'm glad I saw it.
