**** Includes Spoilers **** <br /> <br /> I've been a fan of horror movies for decades. Just when I think I've seen all the greats, another appears to surprise me. I had never seen this movie before. It was a pleasure, also out of the ordinary ... not only the road to the ferry from the marsh either. Here was a horror movie made in the 1940s that dared to try something VERY different. The beautiful girl is not afraid to change and saves men, including the man she loves, from the monster! How is that for a turn. This girl was the opposite of most women in the movies of that time, without screaming at her own shadow, not fainting from fear, not tripping over a leaf while running. This girl was not afraid to live alone in an isolated hut, far from the rest of the villagers. Not only that, but the place was in a misty swamp, it was rumored that he was delighted. Hell, he even naps in the open-air swamp grass ... like a regular version of R40 from the 1940s. No snake, crocodile or ghostly strangler would dare bother this girl. Books about early feminist films should include this overlooked work. <br /> <br /> Look at this if you're a fan, like me, about those beautifully atmospheric classic B / W horror movies that they made only in the 30s and 40s. And be sure to use your cast iron turtle neck for protection.
