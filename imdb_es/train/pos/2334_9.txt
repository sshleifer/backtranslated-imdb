['Pushing Daisies is truly a milestone in television as an art form. Everything seems to pay homage to Amelie and Tim Burton, but then, what? In a world where fresh ideas are clearly rare, this show will ensure that you do not worry if it&#39;s new or not. It is simply great. <br /><br /> I have been captivated from the beginning, intelligent writing, direction to the backgrounds and dialogue make this show the most incredible masterpiece since The Shield and The Wire (ok, not exactly good comparisons, but the beauty of Pushing Daisies is that does not have comparisons on television). <br /><br /> Truly addictive and an absolute pleasure. Maybe like one of the Piemakers cakes that are mentioned so temptingly.']
