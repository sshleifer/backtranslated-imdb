When I was a kid, I loved computer animation, although it was extremely limited and the tools were almost nonexistent. This movie, as I sat in amazement and watched the amazing images and the almost hypnotic music, formed the desire in me to create things in motion on the computer. This is a complete package, between music and video, that really has a double hit. If you know any child who wants to get involved in computer animation, this is a MUST HAVE. <br /> <br /> Still, almost 20 years later, I rate this movie as one of my 3 best favorites. Originality, I think, is still unbeatable by most of today's McMovies that Hollywood spits. Currently I want to see if I can do it again on my own; If imitation is the most sincere form of adulation, this film deserves an imitation TON =)
