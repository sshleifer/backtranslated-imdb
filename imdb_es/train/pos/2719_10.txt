I saw this movie after seeing Capote and infamous. It is simply amazing how homosexual relationships between the author and the protagonists are sublimated in the film. The reporter is direct, the protagonists are more beatniks than homosexuals. <br /> <br /> The movie starts slowly, but when we review it a second time, we get all sorts of interesting simile information created by writer / director Brooks. . <br /> <br /> Notice the incredible cut at the beginning where murderers and those about to kill are linked. The cutter on the phone is compared to Perry on the phone. The cutter who washes his face fits Perry who washes his face. Only Perry is looking in the mirror and seeing his erotic male body unleashes the fantasy of playing a guitar in Las Vegas to empty the chairs. This failure / fantasy coincides with the fantasy-failure that Perry tells us about his father, who built a beautiful motel in Alaska only to find it perpetually empty. <br /> <br /> Dick talks about shooting pheasants and the fact that pheasants do not. I do not know that they are going to die. We cut the disorderly. <br /> <br /> Perry talks about his dream about a yellow bird, "Higher than Jesus", that attacks the nuns who have persecuted them. "The nuns asked for clemency," he says, "but the bird killed them anyway." The bird lifted Perry to paradise. Interestingly, Perry says he has an aversion to nuns, to God and to religion. This is echoed later in his last words when he wants to apologize but does not know with whom. <br /> <br /> The director puts all kinds of "what if" and "only if it is". <br /> <br /> Nancy Cutter receives an offer to sleep in a friends house. She is holding a horse. Perry will comment on a picture of herself and the house later. Nancy can not sleep in her friends' house because her boyfriend comes to dinner. The decision seals its destiny. <br /> <br /> Perry talks about Bogart in "Treasure of Sierra Madre". But it's another image of Bogart, "Beat the Devil," which Truman Capote co-wrote, where a fictitious treasure hunt is the McGuffin. But Dick knows that the protagonists of that movie ended up with nothing. Dick wants the cash, the $ 10,000 he thinks are in the Clutter safe (which, ironically, turns out to be as much a fantasy as Perry's Mexican Treasure). <br /> <br /> Cut to Herb Clutter by signing a $ 40,000 life insurance. You are thinking about mortality at this time. Ironically, his mortality is about to end in a few hours. The insurance agent on behalf of the company wishes him a long life, once again ironic when we know what will happen in a few hours. Dick /> <br /> Dick has said they did not want witnesses so no one would remember them. Later, in fact, it is because they eliminated all the witnesses who were remembered. <br /> <br /> "There was a witness," the detective keeps telling Dick later. But was that the witness of the prison friend, Dick, Perry, Truman Capote or God? The viewer becomes the witness after watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Fascinating movie.
