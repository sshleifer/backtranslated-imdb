I just read the comments from TomReynolds2004 and I feel like I should jump here. I understand that he does not like the movie, but his reasons are not obvious. My feeling about this film is that it is not afraid to walk the darkest paths of loneliness, failure, disappointment and pain. Each of these two people, as described, has many reasons to be bitter and angry, but they find tenderness and consolation in each. Only good acting could make this work without becoming an emotional, sentimental and silly quagmire. I really became interested in these people because of their overwhelming humanity that gave them such strong performances. I have every reason not to like Jane Fonda for her Vietnam-era actions, but apart from personal feelings, she is fabulous in this role. Robert DeNiro is excellent as a man whose intelligence and kindness begins to fail him in a world indifferent to his abilities. This is the first time I see DeNiro use tenderness instead of tenacity to sell a character and I really like it. This movie was a big surprise when I saw it for the first time and I hope to see it again.
