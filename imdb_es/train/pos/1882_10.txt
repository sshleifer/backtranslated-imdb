<br /> <br /> What can I say? This is one of the most perfect movies ever made. It is a reminder of the romantic comedies of the 1940s, but with a modern twist. The script explodes with wit, charm, humor and tenderness, the cinematography is impressive (New York never looked so beautiful), and of course there is the cast! Dudley Moore becomes the performance of his career as Loveable, drunk Arthur Bach. It is also melancholic and real. One of the best lines of the film is its poignant "Not all who drink are poets ... some of us drink because we are not poets". The great Sir John Gielgud won a well deserved Oscar for his splendid performance as Hobson, the valet and Arthur's caretaker. Although he considered it "take the money and run," he brings to the character all the talent, experience and courage of a Tragidian expert and a shrewd comedian. The cast is also out of this world, from the brash grandmother of Geraldine Fitzgerald Bach to the grandiloquent Mafioso by Stephen Elliott. <br /> <br /> The score is also extremely memorable and complements the film perfectly. The only real problem with the movie is the desolate sequel that it engendered.
