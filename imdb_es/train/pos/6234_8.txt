This is my favorite movie of all time, Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. The dialogue between the two is so cute and fun and very smart. Not to mention that this film contains some of the best songs recorded by both; As if I were putting all my eggs in a basket and let's be honest with music and dance. If I remember correctly, this was the movie that introduced me to Fred Astaire, so I guess that's why I'll always have a special place in my heart (sorry for the sentimental feeling but I'm a woman, so get over it) All in all this movie get an 8/10 from me The choreography was excellent and the fact that Lucille Ball is in it makes her even more impressive.
