Greetings from this Portuguese guy :) <br /> <br /> I think the Sopranos are one of the best productions in history, they have reality and fiction mixed in such a way that it's hard to see the difference. It has the same quality as the Father of God! James Gandolfini fits in the role as a glove! I would love for the Sopranos to never end. It is perfect! It should be a theme at school :) I saw Sopranos when I was a kid, but I was too young to stay awake until the episode ends, so now I bought all the episodes in DVD format and I'm watching all the episodes at home before. and after dinner and I'm getting addicted, like I did with Prison Break. In my opinion, Prison Break and The Sopranos are the best series made for television. The argument of both is splendid and the actors are perfect. Congratulations for this work. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry for my English. Thank you for reading.
