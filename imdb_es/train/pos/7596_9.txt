The first episode immediately gave a good impression of what to expect from the series! Mysteries waiting to be solved and a lot of good drama! I love the fact that they gradually reveal the stories about the characters! Explaining enough to stay excited! Of course, this show has some flaws! In the first two series there are some characters that for some reason do not appear in the third season. Many of the characters have decent expulsion, but some are simply not there! Like Rose and her husband! Where the hell are they? What happened to them? Maybe they'll come back in later episodes! But it's a bit inconsistent! That said, "Lost" manages to be exciting in every episode (especially in the first two seasons)! That is something very difficult to do! I realize that in the third season the focus is more on character development than on the mysterious aspects of the program! This is not a bad thing! It even prevents some episodes from getting bored! One of the elements that can be considered the strength of this show are the wonderful characters! You will grow to love these characters! Good or bad! But eventually I'll want to see some mysteries to solve and get closure! The danger of "cancellation" cancellation due to declining ratings is near! And that would be devastating!
