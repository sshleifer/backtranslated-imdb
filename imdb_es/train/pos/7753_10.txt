This Belgian film, directed by Tom Barman, singer of the well-known DUS group, will not be favored by all. For the simple reason that there is no clear story or even a plot. This movie only shows the 24 hours in "a city" (here Antwerp) and allows you to see and truly enjoy the dialogues, the direction, the humorist (Dario !, The Osteopath Bruno ...) and the tragic (Windman, Paul ). Garcin, ...) characters. <br /> <br /> There are several memorable scenes: the Windman on the beach, the dance party at the end, the KISS fan, Windman visits the osteopath, ... <br /> <br /> Clearly, others viewers did not understand what is so beautiful and interesting in this movie. They complain that this movie has no history, etc. But it is the atmosphere that keeps you looking and will drag you to it. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen her yet, make sure you listen carefully. music. The soundtrack is extraordinary just like Tom Barman and his group DEUS. <br /> <br /> And "ssst, mondje dicht h√©". (do not tell anybody)
