After seeing "You've received mail" and feeling disappointed, I decided to watch the original movie that inspired this one, The Shop Around the Corner. I was surprised by this movie. It is a real gem and from this moment one of my favorite movies of all time. The performance is so perfect, the story is so beautiful, that if you have not seen it, I urge you to see it today. I'm not against repetitions and sometimes I like the new version more than the original, but this time I have to admit that You Have Got Mail is a bad adaptation of this classic. Do not miss out, go to your video store and rent The Shop Around the Corner today!
