A prison cell. Four prisoners: Carrere, a young director of the company accused of fraud, transsexual of 35 years in the process of transformation, Daisy, a 20-year-old girl with mental disability and Lassalle, a 60-year-old intellectual who murdered his wife. Behind a stone slab in the cell, mysteriously released, they discovered a book: the diary of a former prisoner, Danvers, who occupied the cell at the beginning of the century. The diary contains magic formulas that supposedly allow the prisoners "Malefique" is one of the creepiest and most intelligent horror films I've seen this year. The film has a dark and somber feeling influenced by the works of HP Lovecraft, which creates a very spooky and disturbing atmosphere. There is a good amount of blood involved with some imaginative and brutal death scenes and the characters of four prisoners are surprisingly well developed. It's a shame that Eric Valette has done a really horrible remake of "One Missed Call" after his amazing debut.9 out of 10.
