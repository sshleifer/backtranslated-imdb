Corny! I love! Corny - just like the television show was about 40 years ago! Adam and Burt rekindle the same chemistry on the screen that it seems like it's never gone! Relive old memories, in addition the actors who interpret them since the 1960s show some things behind the scenes that are very interesting to know. The television of the 1960s was an escapism for many of us back then, and this DVD is no exception, if you are familiar with the original television show. The scene of the fight with the Boofs and Bams written or whatever is fantastic! The movie scene shows clips of the villains who died. In the end, Frank Gorshin appears. He passed away not long after this DVD was made, I think, so it's a great recognition that he re-played a villain for Adam and Burt again, just as he did with Batman and Robin many years ago. He did not lose his touch! Thanks to Julie Newmar for going back to playing a villain role, too. In conclusion, I think this DVD is for great memories, and I want to thank Adam and Burt for coming back and recreating these memories for those of us who remember the original - !!! Thanks guys!!!
