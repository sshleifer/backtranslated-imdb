When our local television station was launched for the first time, it filled much of its programming with the old British programming. "Lock up your daughters!" It was duly broadcast, and I, shaken by the first few seconds of the movie, appeared on a blank tape. The best thing I've done. <br /> <br /> The actors are very well adapted to their characters and lead them to a charming life, complete with the appropriate accents (Christopher Plummer's Foppington will leave you at one point, just like Hoyden and his family). Double senses abound, the lines of the plot inside the wheels mix and match with the characters, the hilarious looks are hidden in each scene and the comments of laughter are made regularly. Years ago, they called the piece "a lost treasure", both for the cast and for the story. To this day I can laugh just thinking about the dialogue. If this gem ever finds its way to a DVD release, I'll be in front of the line.
