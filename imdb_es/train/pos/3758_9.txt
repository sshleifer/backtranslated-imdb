['This movie is incredible. If you take it too seriously, of course you will hate it; however, the amount of &quot;types&quot; and &quot;suitable complements&quot; brings laughs and memories of about 15 years ago. I like his ability to make me laugh simply with obvious jokes and nonsense, and his ability to make me want to see his predecessor, &quot;The Excellent Adventure of Bill and Ted&quot; (1989). If you are looking for a movie full of multi-faceted jokes and totally mature humor, do not see it; However, if you want a movie that is funny and fun, that is intelligent and attractive, you will enjoy it. In fact, I want more of this type of image to appear in today&#39;s theaters. And hey, it&#39;s Keanu Reeves acting the way everyone parodies him acting ... right ... there&#39;s nothing better than that :)']
