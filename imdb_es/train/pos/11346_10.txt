I grew up with H.R. Pufnstuff and the witty Jack Wild, and now my daughters love the Jack Wild fans too. This movie is exactly what movies should be: fun and entertaining. This movie is not limited to children either. Much of the dialogue is aimed at adults and the performance of Witchiepoo is something that should not be missed. The music in this movie adapted very well to Jack Wild and Mama Cass. And as a Jack Wild fan, I would never miss the opportunity to see him dance or hear him sing. Knowing the hard life that Jack had now makes this film even more wonderful, especially when he sings the opening song "If I Could". It makes me dwell on their loving adoration to give me wonderful memories of childhood that I am now transmitting to my children. Let's all go to the Living Island where there is friendship and fun! And keep Jack Wild's memory alive by passing Pufnstuff to others.
