['The first image of the film shows a mountain range in the mist of early autumn morning, and my thought was: &quot;This is almost too beautiful.&quot; And it goes on like this: images of landscapes and animals that look like a series of romantic paintings, each of them perfect in every detail. Even the girl&#39;s room, her father&#39;s car, everything is nostalgic, romantic, beautiful. This may seem antiquated and escapist, but fits a story that, in itself, is a silent beauty, which occurs on the border between life and the fairy tale, between Dian Fossey and Le Petit Prince. I enjoyed every minute of this. The extreme parsimony of the film, which has a simple and slow story, just an actor and almost no special effect, exerts a powerful magic. Therefore, I find it deplorable that this parsimony is waived in the last minutes, when two additional actors suddenly appear (the girl as an adult woman and her son). Another deficiency is music, which is often intrusive, similar to Hollywood and, sometimes, inappropriate: I could not connect an English pop song with the glory of the French mountain. I went to the movie along with my two little daughters, but I also recommend it to adults, as they appreciate this type of movie. Obviously, not everyone does it.']
