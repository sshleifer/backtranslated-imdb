I enjoyed this movie so much that I saw it twice and that's something to say about a documentary. The musical score, cinematography and sound are absolutely impressive, as one would expect from an Imax production. Even though it's filmed for those huge Imax theaters, it looks and sounds wonderful in my home system. In fact, this would make a perfect DVD to demonstrate your system. <br /> <br /> The theme is also so fascinating. It's about Mario Andretti and his son Michael. He was already a Mario fan because he is the best racing driver in history, as he is the only one who won the CART Championship, the F1 Championship, the Daytona 500 and the Indianapolis 500. The script follows the path of two very important cars for the father and the son. The first car is in a chicken coop and turns out to be the first roadster Mario handled and we followed the restoration to perfection. The other car is Michael's new racing car and we follow it from cutting the mold to the racing season. Imax lends the right magic to make car construction entertaining and fascinating. <br /> <br /> Paul Newman, who was the owner of Michael Amoretti's team at the time this movie was made, narrates the film. His anecdotes and ingenuity, inspired in many years as owner and driver, lend a lot to production. <br /> <br /> The main feature is the career scene. Upload the volume here! There is something about traveling at more than 200 miles per hour and the musical score that takes you completely to the screen for an experience you will not forget. Wow! <br /> <br /> The final magical element is the humanity of the Andretti family. This god of the racing world, Mario Andretti, is a loving father who proudly takes care of his son's career. They work together so well that every parent and child should see this. It can be said that they are a close family. I wish we could all have that experience.
