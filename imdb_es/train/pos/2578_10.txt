Superman and the Moles are possibly the most difficult Superman adventures. <br /> <br /> Lois Lane and Clark Kent are sent to Silsby, home of the deepest oil well in the world. While they are there, some men of radioactive mass go up the oil well and explore the city. Jeff Corey and many other villagers try to get rid of the invading Mole men. Can Superman change the ways of the people in time to save the mole men? Can Superman warn people in time about the radioactive danger that mole men bring? <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Superman and the Mole Men is a very smart, well written and well-acting movie. Although we can only see Superman flying once briefly, it's still a great Superman adventure. A must for all. <br /> <br /> 10/10 stars
