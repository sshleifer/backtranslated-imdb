A prequel to the re-imagined Battlestar Galactica series, from the same creative team Ronald D. Moore and David Eick, as well as the new co-creator of the Remi Aubuchon series. Caprica is established in the twelve colonies some 58 years before the events of Battlestar Galactica. The new series, in addition to its human drama, also describes the key steps in the development of what would become Cylon's career. <br /> <br /> The pilot and the series will follow two families; the Graystone, which includes Daniel (Eric Stoltz) a computer genius and corporate tycoon, and his equally brilliant but rebellious daughter, Zoe (Alessandra Toreson), while the Adamas include Jos√© (Esai Morales) a lawyer and his son Guillermo, the future Admiral of Battlestar Galactica. <br /> <br /> Like Battlestar Galactica, the series includes some great experienced actors in Eric Stoltz, Esai Morales and Polly Walker, as well as some relatively new and talented actors, including Alessandra Toreson and Magda Apanowicz. <br /> <br /> For fans of Battlestar Gallactica there are similarities and continuities with that series, but it is also very different. In the pilot, at least the elements of science fiction are definitely present, but they are a smaller part of this series. The scenes in Caprica at the same time that reflect a more technologically advanced society also have a retro touch, this is achieved through part of the architecture, the costumes and the way it was filmed. <br /> <br /> While the appearance of the two series have some substantial differences. Some of the topics will seem very familiar, religion is again very important here, while the racial issue that is rarely mentioned in BG is much more important. We also address terrorism, the existence of a soul and whether a machine can have it or not, as well as problems related to crime and government. <br /> <br /> The pilot has been released directly to DVD in an extensive and extensive. unrated version before being broadcast on TV, the series is scheduled to start in 2010. <br /> <br /> Like Battlestar Galactica, this series was filmed in Vancouver
