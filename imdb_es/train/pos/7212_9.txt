I would not hesitate to put this adaptation of 'Death Trap' on a list of the 5 best adaptations from stage to film in history, Caine and Reeves (an underrated actor who never had the chance to do more than soaked romances and "Superman"). ) they play very well here, and even Dyan Cannon, whom I do not normally care about, has a perfect role that exploits her nuisance as an actress. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure that the "Deathtrap" comparisons with "Sleuth" - another brilliant stage-to-screen adaptation with Michael Caine - whether valid, or even fair, yes, the two stories have a lot in common, but "Sleuth" is the same about class war as the battle of the wits , and the house in "Sleuth" is established is at least as much a character in the film as the two actors: the house does not really have an equivalent in "Deathtrap." And "Deathtrap" is not so much a battle of wit as a vignette pointy about how people do not They are as good (and never as smart as they think they are) and deserve everything they get. I will only say that both films are excellent examples of the genre and that they are worth their time and money. This is America, after all. You do not have to choose! <br /> <br /> I will not give away the twists and turns of the plot, but I do not think it matters anyway. I have seen the DVD eight or nine times in a dozen years, and I still enjoy the chemistry, the moment and the spooky moments when things go "pear-shaped". Everything is so well done that the trip becomes more important than the real destination. <br /> <br /> Anyone who likes comedy and suspense in the Hitchcock style of filmmaking will probably enjoy "Deathtrap" immensely.
