The movie is designed to affect the audience and this movie left me speechless. Magnificently photographed and with good dialogue with poetry, the film involves lust, hatred, murder, rape, theft and deception. It weaves an intense web that prevented me from looking away from the screen until the final credits. History is sweeping. It takes the public from the atrocities of the Spanish Civil War to the human remains left behind. Roger Casamajor and Bruno Bertanzoni are two young actors who dominate the screen. The secondary players are excellently launched and give a true sense of authenticity. The scenarios, the lighting, the landscape and the cinematography are wonderful. I love photography.
