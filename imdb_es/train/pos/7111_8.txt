It was during the Battle of the Ilu River that Al almost single-handedly stopped a massive Japanese attack by Banzai that contained, with its machine gun, wave after wave of suicide attacks by certain Japanese until finally help or reinforcements arrived. It was during the bloody fight that Al was hit in the face by a Japanese grenade that ended up blinding him. <br /> <br /> Now, back in the convalescent states in a naval hospital, Al is facing something much more difficult to overcome. then fighting an attack the size of a battalion of Japanese or German soldiers. He faces a future in which he will never see again and will have to depend on others to take care of him, or for him. <br /> <br /> We can see it in the movie "Pride of the Marines" The battle itself was much more difficult than the Japanese troops in Guadalcanal to reach an agreement with his disability.

The battle of Al with his personal demons was much more difficult than that of the Japanese he fought with because they were part of him and, therefore, they had to fight to defeat them and defeat them. Despite the help he got from both Nurse Virginia and his girlfriend Ruth, as well as his Navy doctor, who bears a striking resemblance to actor Gregory Peck, everything depended on Al to overcome the fears he faced. The fears that he and he alone had to fight and win, as everyone in the film told him, all by himself.
