1ยบ seen 8/29/2009 - 7 of 10 (Dir-Sidney Franklin): well-told story of farmers in China and their rise to prominence and struggles with what Mother Nature offers them. This film is based on an award-winning novel and tells a family that begins with the arranged marriage of the son with a slave. The film does a good job of maintaining your interest despite a somewhat trite performance by the leader played by Paul Muni. Chronicle, Wong Long (the character played by Muni) and how the land works, buys more land, eventually becomes very rich, but then returns to the land where it originally started. The relationship between him and his wife, played by Luise Rainer, is the thread of the story (in addition to the land itself) and, despite the obvious non-Chinese actors, does a good job of showing the country and its people. It's obvious that MGM used their money to create a really good epic with this in an era where they could probably afford it. The scene with the lobsters is very well done and the rest of the movie looks really good, guaranteeing the Best Cinematography award at the Oscars that year. The definitive definition of an epic is what this story is and has been achieved quite well.
