An entertaining musical in which Nathan Detroit needs $ 1,000.00 to get a game of floating junk, so it attracts Sky Masterson to try to get the salvation of the army, played by Jean Simmons, to go with Masterson to Havana. <br /> <br /> 5 years later Simmons would be back in the missionary in the fabulous "Elmer Gantry". There was Sister Sharon and here is Sister Sarah. Same temperament, different story. <br /> <br /> Frank Sinatra is the diabolical Nathan Detroit. He has been engaged to Vivian Blaine for 14 years and she hates his habit of playing. <br /> <br /> In a true change of pace, Sky Masterson was played by Marlon Brando, who actually made his own singing here! <Br /> <br /> The film is saved by superlative choreography. Those dance routines and singing are fabulous. Stubby Kaye performed them especially as Nicely Nicely (Johnson). <br /> <br /> In general, it is a very good production.
