I agree with Cal-37, it's a great movie, especially for the family, Kelly Linch is beautiful, the girl is really talented and pretty, of course Jim Belushi has earned his strips! But what I really liked was the piano song, if you're a musician or you do not see this movie just for that, you'll know what it is. <br /> <br /> "You're nobody until someone loves you" Written by Russ Morgan, Larry Stock and James Cavanaugh <br /> <br /> So have fun watching <br /> <br /> See you , <br /> <br /> Nelson
