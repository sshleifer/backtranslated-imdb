The creators of this excellent movie did an excellent job of getting involved with the characters, since they suffered this terrible experience. The horrible scene in the forest was made so magnificently that you forget that these men were just actors, playing parts. I've never been so immersed in a movie like the one I have. Burt Reynolds and Jon Voight were never better on the screen, as well as the good performances of Ned Beatty, Ronny Cox, Bill McKinney, and although he appeared briefly, James Dickey, The Man who was the author of the book on which the film is based , like the sheriff of Aintry. It is somewhat disturbing, and children, of course, should be protected from it, but this is a great dramatic cinema.
