The Write Word <br /> <br /> What you see is what you get. Not really! What makes the "page 3" of Madhur Bhandarkar brave and brilliant is to destroy the myth attached to the glamor and brightness that color the pages of our newspapers and whose lives (read party habits) we follow with such maniacal fervor that only our intrinsic voyeuristic vein can explain. <br /> <br /> The phenomenon on page 3 is as deplorable as it is enigmatic. How exactly did you get this control over the printed word and when did it start to invade the main page? It is subject to another debate. Bhandarkar cleverly avoids that. He is only interested in the mechanisms of this grotesque existence. And in doing so, he brings together the various elements of this way of life. Like Robert Altman (although I am not comparing Bhandarkar with Altman's genius), Bhandarkar uses thousands of characters to promote his motivation. Whether it is an NRI on page 3, those who knock on the door, the new rich, a next model, a socialist politician or an author of erotic novels; all the characters are presented with a goal and each of them has a separate character sketch, even if its parts can be lowercase. And there lies the appeal of the film. <br /> <br /> Konkona Sen Sharma plays Madhavi Sharma, a young and talented journalist who covers page 3 of Nation Today. Initially, content with his work, he soon begins to see the ugliness of this vertigo that is covered by his fake and cosmetic waste. But Bhandarkar resists the temptation to turn this theme into a moral surveillance film and avoids focusing on just one character. Therefore, the film is not only about Madhavi, but also about Deepak Suri (Boman Irani), Madhavi's editor who passively accepts his role as a piece of a larger machinery, Anjali Thapar (Soni Razdan), a social partner suffocated by social pollution. Abhijeet (Engineer Rehan) - a homosexual makeup artist and roommates of Madhavi Pearl (Sandhya Mridul) - the sassy stewardess and Gayatri (Tara Sharma) - an aspiring actress. It seems an impossible task to assimilate so many characters (and more) in a story, but all the credit to Nina Arora and Manoj Tyagi for writing a tight script. The dialogues of Sanjeev Datta and Bhandarkar have been written with great attention to detail. <br /> <br /> Any narrative, no matter how good it may be, can fail with the lack of genuine performances. Fortunately, 'Page 3' is full of actors and not stars. Konkona reviews his paper backed by the author with ease and without effort. Idem Boman. Sandhya Mridul gets the best written part, but almost exceeds it. Atul Kulkarni is wasted with a subscribed character. Sometimes, the director seems too interested in incorporating as much as possible (pedophilia, homosexuality, etc.). But the contexts in which they are used do not make them seem rushed. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, Bhandarkar's attempt is to satiate our voyeurism, but he goes a step further. It takes us inside the photographs and exposes us to the appalling realities of this sect of humanity that, strangely enough, seems to be living in a different and remote world. These are the same people who took pleasure in the New Year's party while a few hundred kilometers away their compatriots had been devastated by the ferocity of nature! Intelligent writing, cleverly incorporated songs, skilful performances and a genuine feeling of sincerity are what make this film worthy despite its lack of finesse and its low production values. 'Page 3' is an optimal way to enter a new year of cinema. <br /> <br /> - Abhishek Bandekar <br /> <br /> Rating- **** <br /> <br /> * Poor ** Average *** Good **** Very good ** *** Excellent <br /> <br /> January 29, 2005
