The opening sequence alone is worth the cost of admission, since Cheech and Chong drag that big garbage can through the parking lot, full of gasoline. "Do not spill it, man!", Hilarious things. And then, as 'the plot' progresses, an incredible journey awaits you. I saw this movie recently and it is still very funny in every visualization. Check it out.
