I admit that it created great expectations before looking because some friends mentioned it (and they are not perverts!) As a must. And it is a must! Just do not wait to see something that springs up. <br /> <br /> Freudian psychoanalysis is interesting in many parts of the film, but there is too much perversion and it does not stay at the end. <br /> <br /> Some of the good things are the Kieslowski's Blue analyzes, most of David Lynch's, some of Hitchcock and maybe a couple more that I missed (I just remembered ... Dogville), and usually I do not lose things unless they are too obvious or are loose in the air. <br /> <br /> In addition to being repetitive, which makes it too long, the documentary is pleasant in the sense of noticing some perversions fed by our unconscious, hence the commercial success of Most thrillers studied and used as a basis for this theory. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the energetic tone of the narrative and Mr. Zizek's effort to revive the theory of Freud, who has been numb for too long, especially in North America. Again, it's way over the top and I think it's not a complete waste of time, since I believe that most humans appreciate death and blood.
