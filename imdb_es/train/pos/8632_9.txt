This is a moral comedy, so occasionally there is a soft touch of bitterness, but a softness softens all the sarcasm and irony flows until suddenly a moment will stop your heart and change everything. <br /> <br /> This film, wonderfully written and directed, is a gem that shines perfectly, with a beautiful performance of all. Jean-Louis Trintignant is exquisite as always, and Romy Schneider is a pearl, perfect and brilliant, that should not be missed. A really wonderful movie!
