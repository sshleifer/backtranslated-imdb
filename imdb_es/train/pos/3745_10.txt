Many mystery stories follow the usual path of whodunit: killing most of the time, gathering clues, herd of possible perpetrators, splashing false leads and inevitable confrontation between the clever evil and even more cunning crime solver. <br /> <br /> "Forgotten" leaves the well trodden and gives us complex characters who may or may not have committed terrible acts. The fact that at the end of the three episodes we do not have easy answers or a well-tied package could frustrate some, but for me it was the indication of a cleverly elaborated story that investigates, disturbs and torments with the question: What does this mean? Does he look like an evil person? <br /> <br /> Excellent performance and production combine to make a mystery not easy ... forgotten.
