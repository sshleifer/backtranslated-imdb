Well, not really. Although this movie is very entertaining. I went and I saw him with the girlfriend last night and I had to use the routine "I think there might be something in my eye". The movie is a great combination of comedy and typical romance. Jim Carey is excellent as a disillusioned reporter who receives the power to change himself and the city in which he resides. In fact all the characters are great. The movie is not too funny or funny, good movie to go see with the wife. <br /> <br /> All in all 8/10 ... note * I am not an easy student. That's all about BigV again and again!
