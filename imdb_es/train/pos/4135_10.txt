This is an absolutely charming movie, one of my favorite romantic comedies. It is extremely funny and the cast is wonderful. Although Laurence Olivier is primarily associated with his Shakespeare work that he shows in this film, he is by no means limited to playing only classical theater. He manages the transition from the cynical divorce lawyer, who tries to avoid women and their betrayals, to the puppy in love with Lady X played by Merle Oberon effortlessly. The dialogue is wonderfully witty and refreshing and the atmosphere charming. Ralph Richardson was a pleasure to see him too. I highly recommend it.
