['Shirley MacLaine in another custom paper. Like the aunt of a single mother in a working class neighborhood of 1962, the veteran actress has another exercise as a brave woman who does not let any setback defeat her spirit of success. The children, a pre-teen boy and girl, are attracted to their lively Aunt Zoe, although the many magic tricks and practical jokes learned from her, and they applied themselves to all the wrong opportunities that will eventually drive them out of school. <br /><br /> The plot is intelligently involved in the crisis of the Cuban missiles, with all the social implications. Men building bomb shelters, people watching news shows on what appeared to be the only television, in a restaurant, and a general haze of uneasiness and fear in the air. When an &quot;inoffensive&quot; miracle is made to fly in proportions, the climactic conclusion makes the spectator feel good. Yes, Virginia, the sun will rise tomorrow! Clearly a budget production, this is still a small and sweet film, full of the magic of the Sunday Matinees. With some &quot;Oldies&quot; options thrown in an effective sound track, the whole family will enjoy this. ****']
