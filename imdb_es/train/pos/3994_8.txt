I went to this movie only because I was dragged there and I would have left again immediately because the audience was mainly composed of older people and I felt out of place. However, the film was absolutely fascinating and far from being directed at older people. The characters were all very real and believable and I found myself discussing the film, the characters and the story for hours afterwards. There are some very fascinating scenes but they are necessary and they help you to understand the situation much better. In general, this is an excellent and valuable film, something out of the ordinary, but that does not mean that people who prefer the main thing can not enjoy this movie. It is an exciting and interesting cinematic experience.
