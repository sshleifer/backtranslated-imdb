I realize that this review will surprise me with the expert film critics who patrol this site, but I will defend this film. <br /> <br /> The dentist is really a good movie. The performance is not always top-notch, but the emotion is good and the story is good. You also see Linda Hoffman's boobies. It's not that I'm an expert in this field, but the direction seems good and the plot makes sense. Corbin makes a great creepy dentist. He does to the dentists what Jaws does to the sharks ... ish. Obviously, I had a fairly limited budget, but they did well with what they could and developed the characters well (the ones that count). <br /> <br /> In the end.
