"Bend It Like Beckham" may not mean much to us Americans who know very little about other soccer (soccer), but for fans of English sports, it's equivalent to "Hit it Like Bonds" or "Dunk it Like Jordan" " Any young soccer player dreams of folding a soccer ball around a player and entering the net to score a goal, like the star player David Beckham, like the young Indian girl, Jess (Parminder Nagra), in the movie Bend It Like Beckham. Jess loves to play soccer games, the kind forbidden by her traditionalist mother. However, while playing one day, a passing friend named Jules (Keira Knightley) watches her play and invites her to try for a traveling women's soccer team. After meeting coach Joe (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers), she forms the team, something she knows her mother would not approve. The film is not about disobeying the parents, but about a girl doing what she wants to do, even if that goes against the culture, not just the parents. There is humor throughout the film, especially when Jules's mother thinks she is a lesbian. The film resorts to a clich√© moment, since the big football game is the same day of Jess's sister's wedding, but it's not a cheesy subject, but fun and light. The action of football looks good, so sports fans will enjoy it, and a story about girls growing up in a child's world, the world of football will inspire some in the audience. Bend It Like Beckham is not just about football, it's about a girl who tries to meet and please her parents at the same time, which is quite difficult.
