If I had been familiar with the theatrical production of Guys and Dolls before watching the movie, maybe I would not like it as much as I did. Although to be fair, I would probably still like filmmaking more because of my general adoration of Brando (for his performance) and Sinatra (for his voice, although he is also an actor, see The Manchurian Candidate or From Here to Eternity.) < br /> <br /> Regarding the statements of other critics about the songs, I have the Broadway soundtrack and although the voice of Isabel Bingley eclipses that of Jean Simmons, it is not more pleasant. I think it has a rather strident quality. The voice of Jean Simmons is much more realistic, although it must be admitted that it is not always a big concern in musicals. Also the only time I noticed Marlon Brando's particularly weak vocal record was during his performance of "Luck Be A Lady" and only there because he was familiar with Sinatra's version. I also find that Vivian Blaine's voice is much nicer in the movie than on Broadway. And only Sinatra's voice would be able to redeem the faults of all the others, if they really needed a redemption. (They were not) It's infinitely better than Sam Levene's, particularly in my favorite song, 'Sue Me'. <br /> <br /> In addition, the complaint that many songs of the film were omitted for inferior songs, I allow myself to dissent. "A Bushel and a Peck" is not a jewel and the song that replaced it, "Pet Me Poppa" and its accompanying performance is more Hot Box material. Personally, I'm not interested in "Marry the Man Today" at all and I'm glad that it was not included in the movie. I love 'I have never been in love before', and although it was not sung in the film, the instrumental version can be heard when Nathan is in Adelaide's dressing room. The song 'A Woman In Love' expresses the same feeling equally well and probably in a range that both stars could reach. And the movie would not be the same without the song 'Adelaide', not included in Broadway. In fact, if the soundtrack of the film was available for sale, I would recommend buying it instead of Broadway. <br /> <br /> Although I have not seen the original production, I can not imagine that the performance was superior to that of the film. actors. <br /> <br /> The important fact is that the story is as charming as always and the acting and the son. The gs do not do it less.
