This film documents a transformative experience for a group of young men, and the experience of seeing it is in itself transforming for the viewer. Few films even aspire to this level of transcendence, and I can not think of any other film, documentary or drama, that achieves it. There is not another film in which I laughed so much and cried so much. Yes, it is DMD and accessible travel; only in those subjects, is a company that is worth it, but it is more. It's about friendship. It's about life itself, about living every day you're alive. And it is a great, funny, adventurous narrative. That's why God created the cinema! Watch this movie !!!
