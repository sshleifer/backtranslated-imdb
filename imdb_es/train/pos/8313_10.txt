First of all, I think the comment below is unworthy for a site like this. Obviously you do not like and do not respect the taste of others. Not to give you a history lesson, but I think you have to do it. Black actors are successful like others, if not more so. If you are not part of the "Black" career, you can not understand the quality, creativity and vibrancy of old movies like "Sparkle" and "Mahogany" and "Cooley High". As unfortunately you are not black, you do not have the pleasure of feeling what we feel when we see these classics, therefore, you must keep your damn mouth closed and follow the race of not dancing. Thank you.
