I recently bought this movie with a lot of other eBay LaserDisc. In general, I like war movies and action movies, but occasionally I enjoy romantic comedies. <br /> <br /> If you are bored by today's special FX movies and high-shine romantic comedies, you should visit Shop Around the Corner on a quiet night. . What I like about the movie is that the characters have a lot of decency. There is nothing false or pretentious about them. Take Mr. Matuschek, for example: when he discovers that his wife is cheating on him with one of his own employees, he tries to shoot himself. Not only because of the humiliation, but because it has been unfair to Stewart's character. (OK, simple example.) <br /> <br /> Yes, the focus of the film is limited and the plot is predictable. However, even so, I liked it a lot. If you like Notting Hill, then you'll like to shop around the corner. In fact, Hugh Grant reminds me a lot of Jimmy Stewart.
