You can survive by surviving Christmas. I thought that the television version was a bit edited. I like Ben Afleck. He plays Drew Johnson, an adult with no family, who is willing to pay strangers. The Valcos starring James Gandolfini and Catherine O'Hara as the parents and Christina Applegate as Lisa Valco, the daughter. Drew is alone during the holidays because he does not have a family of his own, so he rents a family in the suburbs of Chicago for a quarter of a million dollars. Bill Macy, whom I remember best for playing Maude's husband, Arthur, is hired to play Duda, the grandfather. When the whole situation collapses, the truth can be painful. The Valcos family is falling apart from Drew's situation. Drew's rich girlfriend and her parents make an amazing visit. You can not buy what you want! The acting and the writing are mediocre, but the cast of first level takes it to the final scene.
