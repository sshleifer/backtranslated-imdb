We had never seen this movie, based on the entertaining novel by Nicholas Katzenbach, and considering the cast first class assembly for the production, we decided to take a look. "Just Cause", although not a horrible movie, takes too many liberties with the original material that Jeb Stuart did not succeed in his treatment. Arne Glimcher directed. <br /> <br /> The first thing we think about when a young black man is transferred to the local precinct for interrogation is police brutality. After all, sheriff Tanny Brown and police officer Wilcox show no mercy in beating Bobby Earl, who is accused of killing a young white woman. We are appalled by what the officers do to the prisoner. <br /> <br /> Then, the scene changes. Evangeline, Bobby Earl's grandmother, is sent north to ask a distinguished Harvard professor, a retired lawyer, that the young man wants Paul Armstrong to defend him. She is convincing enough for Armstrong to take a look at the case. He is also convinced of the young man's innocence. <br /> <br /> Things are not exactly what we thought they were. When Blair Sullivan, a man serving a sentence on the same premises as Bobby Earl, realizes how it is connected to the murder of the girl and changes the dynamics of the case. The way it is reproduced in the film serves to confuse the viewer and distract Armstrong from reaching the truth. <br /> <br /> Sean Connery, who plays Armstrong, makes you enjoy this thriller. Laurence Fishburne, an intense actor, leaves a good impression to the sheriff who, as far as we can see, is guilty of abusing his prisoner. Ed Harris has a wonderful opportunity to show why he is one of our best actors. Blair Underwood, Kate Capshaw, Ruby Dee and the young Scarlett Johansson are seen in supporting roles. <br /> <br /> The movie, even with its faults, will not disappoint.
