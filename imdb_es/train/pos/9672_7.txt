I know, I know: it's childish. But I love this kind of movie. A bird that suffered many "setbacks" and has not yet lost its faith in humanity and its sense of humor. What is special about this film is the fact that the main character is Paulie, the parrot, and it is not used as a stimulus for any human actor. Also, I like the plot: Paulie tells his life to a cleaner by the time he hit rock bottom. (By the way: Jay Mohr's voice almost sounds like Joe Pesci's!). And Cheech Marin, of course, man is humor to me. Since I saw "Up in Smoke" I have appreciated his naive way of acting, making a simple situation hilarious ... I can not help it.
