As an amateur historian of WW2 / Nazi Germany, I could not wait for this to come out on DVD. I missed it when it was the first time in 2003. I do not want to repeat what has already been said in the previous 8 pages of comments on historical inaccuracies. You could have done a better job representing the "charming" Hitler. I also had a small problem with some of the casting options, not so much for their performance, but for their appearances. Peter Stormare does not look much like Rohm, why did not they make Babson like Hess wear a wig? And my biggest complaint ... there's always been a lot of Hitler's flashy blue eyes, why did not they make Carlyle wear blue glasses? On the positive side, I thought the actors who played Goring and Drexler looked pretty good. Again, as long as the people who see this understand that this is supposed to be entertainment first, history, second, I do not think much harm is done.
