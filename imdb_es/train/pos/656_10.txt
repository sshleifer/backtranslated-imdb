Of all the reviews I have read, most people have been extremely hard on Alexandre. Neither Marie nor Veronika seemed never to be particularly desperate to keep Alexandre, since he is only a little intelligent, though not entirely intellectual, as most of us are, difficult as it may be to be admitted by anyone. Alexandre is getting away with life to perfection, is fully cared for, receiving and giving what he wants. Girls allow it, veronika loves sex, Marie is her boss. Is there something wrong with this? Is there someone in love? Really? I do not think so. Although the French cinema New Wave is prone to pretension, etc., it is wonderful simply because it does not need an argument to create emotion. Ease is perfectly charming and anyone in Alexandre's position, in an urban area, can ask for it. I'm looking for a pattern, someone interested?
