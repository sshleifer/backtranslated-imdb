I really think that I should present my case and that all movie fans (horror or cult) go and see this movie ... <br /> <br /> I did it! <br /> <br /> It's-is -excellent: very atmospheric, disturbing and terrifying ... <br /> <br /> incredible how they could make a movie jewel with the very low one (read- "no"! ) - budget they had ... <br /> <br /> Synopsis taken from the website: "One morning, an old man walks through the woods in search of his fugitive cat, instead he finds a child without parents and a murder without a corpse ..." < br /> <br /> On this website (IMDb) there is no trailer, but I will leave a link here to the site of the film where there is a pretty disturbing trailer, so please go and check it out. .. <br /> <br /> www.softfordigging.com
