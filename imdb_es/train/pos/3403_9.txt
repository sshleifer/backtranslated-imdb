The magnificent production of Techicolor tells the unusual story of the romance between a woman of strong religious faith and a Trappist monk who has left his monastery, breaking his vows. The film begins in a convent in Europe, where an ex-student prays: a solitary black beauty named Domini (Marlene Dietrich). The Mother Superior advises her to go to the desert and "find herself", and lose the pain for the father who has just died. In the train car on the way to the Sahara, she sits in front of a very, very worried man (Charles Boyer), our former monk. He soon finds himself in a hotel near an oasis of palm trees, where he returns to see our mysterious man with problems while being perplexed about what to do when confronted by a very seductive dancer. Domini befriends him, although he knows nothing of his past: soon there will be a romance. <br /> <br /> This film is sentimental, melodramatic and different (in a way, almost surreal and even a bit corny). I found it quite fun and entertaining. The photograph is really interesting: it is full of extreme facial approaches and beautiful color shots of caravans of horses crossing the desert, figures silhouetted against a sunset sky. Marlene Dietrich offers a well-done performance, although moderate, and looks beautiful. Charles Boyer, who is not usually one of my favorites, is really very good at this, I think the part looks good on him and he looks pretty young and handsome too. Basil Rathbone is fine here, except he is given very little to do. Another great orchestral score by Max Steiner helps the drama continue, in short, a very nice movie.
