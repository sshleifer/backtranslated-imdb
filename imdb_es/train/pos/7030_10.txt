We recorded this when it aired on television in 1995 and we waited all these years for its release, as it quickly became a favorite of our family. Children are now teenagers and must have seen it a billion times, yet they still see it religiously with friends. Its timeless appeal reaches all age groups, similar to "Grease". <br /> <br /> Vanessa Williams is spectacular. Jason Alexander, charming and wonderfully light on his feet. I have noticed that other commentators on this site are quite hard on him, but our family gives him the best grades. (We loved his 'Giant Step' number). Marc Kudisch (as Conrad) gives us comic relief and wonderful musical numbers. And Brigitta Dau (as Ursula) simply steals the show. Probably our favorite character in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> The only disappointment was Kim's performance by Chynna Philip. Part of that has to do with writing. Kim's role is completely one-dimensional. To complicate that, Philip's delivery is flat, unimaginative, unbelievable and simply awful. The director should have seen that and corrected. Or, to begin with, never throw it. <br /> <br /> However, in general, the image is lovely and I recommend it for families of all ages.
