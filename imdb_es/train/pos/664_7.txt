['Crypt Stories: And throughout the house begins Christmas Eve when Elizabeth (Mary Ellen Trainor) kills her husband Joseph (Marshall Bell), drags her body outside to throw it into a well, but in doing so loses an important news. bulletin on the radio that says a homicidal maniac (Larry Drake) dressed as Santa Claus has escaped from a local mental asylum and has already killed several women with Elizabeth on his list, but she has other ideas and tries to change the situation apparently dangerous. your advantage ... <br /><br /> This story from Tales from the Crypt was episode 2 of season 1, directed by one of the program&#39;s regular executive producers, Robert Zemeckis. And All Through the House is a pretty decent watch. Fred Dekker&#39;s script was based on a story that appeared in the comic &#39;The Vault of Horror&#39; and was originally adapted to film as an episode of the horror anthology film Britsih Tales from the Crypt (1972), starring Joan Collins as the murderer. The character of the wife here played by Ellen Trainor. This particular version is good enough, but it does not do anything different or special and is a bit too linear and predictable to be considered a classic. With only 25 minutes of duration, it certainly advances at a good pace, the story is macabre enough and in general offers decent entertainment and I quite liked the ending. This time there are segments of Crypt Keeper (John Kassir) of Christmas theme that are completed with the usual word games. <br /><br /> The director Zemeckis does a good job and there is also a nice winter atmosphere with a touch of Christmas influence. There is not much blood here, someone has a poker stuck in the head, someone&#39;s face is cut with an icicle, someone&#39;s arm is cut with an ax and there is some blood spattered, but in general it is not that graphic. The performance of a small cast is pretty good. <br /><br /> And All Through the House is not the best story in the crypt, but it&#39;s decent anyway, it&#39;s worth seeing, but after the comic book story and the original version of the 1972 movie, do we really need or want this?']
