The father of Daniell Steel, what a refreshing story. This film glorified the importance of the family and the importance of parents in the lives of their children. How strange is that? In these times of "Heather has two moms" (or whatever, fill in the blanks) it's easy to see why this topic is not for everyone. With the roles of the father being prominent, I expected this to be another saga of Daniell Steel. How disappointing to have it in the end. Each character was important and did a fabulous job in playing his role. I would have loved to see each character develop over the years. I loved this movie, it's one that I'll see challenging every time it's on. Good story, good acting, and I hope this is not a spoiler, but I do not have sex or annoying language. Yes, it touched my heart. Warning, prepare the Kleenex. What saddens me is that this side of family life is rarely shown today in our entertainment, whether on television or. Films. Daniell if you listen, You Go Girl, give us more.
