This is not the best Bigfoot that has ever been made, but by the recent standards of Nature go off torry movies, which is shown mainly on the Science Fiction channel, this is something of quality. It has some action, some humor, decent F / X and Bigfoot. CG is used, but so are some practical F / Xs, which I like. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie is worth watching if you're a fan of B horror / sci-fi and you need a solution. It's better than the Sasquatch movie and not a sequel, so do not be fooled. <br /> <br /> The acting is better than you can expect in a movie like this and the direction is more than adequate. Wait a bit once the characters are "developed", but know that things will improve. If you are watching a DVD, you can skip one or two chapters.
