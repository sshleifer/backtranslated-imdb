Surprised to see the pretty low score for this movie. I just watched this movie for the first time in 10 years, and I was reminded why I like it. <br /> <br /> Come back with me, kids, to a time when Michael Keaton was a comedy guy, and you might find some joy in this movie. It's a smooth comedy, the kind that Ron Howard specializes in, but if that's your thing, you should check this out. The low-key charm of Keaton is the right one for this project. <br /> <br /> "Gung Ho" is a bit old-fashioned, because it takes place in the last stage of the pre-global economy world, when it still mattered what a business it was based on. That said, it offers laughter and also a lesson about how people can learn from each other, for a great benefit. <br /> <br /> You can watch this movie and enjoy it without remembering one. The particular scene that you really liked, but that's because the whole movie provides a slow but steady flow of laughter. It's like an I.V. drip. And I say it in a good way.
