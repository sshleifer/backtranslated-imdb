['&quot;Cry Freedom&quot; is not just a movie. It is a historical story, a heroic story and a vision of the cultural background of an important event in history. Denzel Washington not only does an excellent job of impersonating a motivating and determined hero, Steve Biko, but also conveys a message to the public about the horrors of apartheid in South Africa. The story of Biko, an influential leader, and his main &quot;influence&quot;, Donald Woods, is heartbreaking. But, the ultimate success of his life can go beyond the atrocities committed in South Africa. &quot;Cry Freedom&quot; manages to communicate to its audience the optimistic aspect of the seemingly disturbing plot. It is because of great films like this that the public can be educated about the terrible events of history, the great leaders who tried to end them and how we can never allow them to happen in the future. Because of this importance, &quot;Cry Freedom&quot; is an incredible movie that everyone should see.']
