['Fabulous actors, beautiful landscapes, raw reality. I will not give more details about all the comments of the other reviewers because you get the image! However, the movie is not for the squeamish. The reality is to sacrifice pigs and other animals to survive. I also have the house book by Elinore Randall Stewart. I read it several years ago, I have to reread it, since I just watched the newly released and remastered DVD of the movie. <br /><br /> I tried to buy the video for several years and finally I bought it in a video store that closed. But Yippee! The DVD is already on sale, I bought it at amazon.com. It&#39;s not cheap, but it&#39;s worth it for me. This is a movie that I will be watching until the end of my days!']
