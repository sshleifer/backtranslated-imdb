The father of pride is a pleasant surprise: he is funny, witty and presents a great voice acting. The program is about the family of a Lion who acts as the attraction of the shows of Siegfried & Roy. In fact, they are all stereotypes, but that's what makes them so fun. FOTP is not a caricature for children, but includes a bit of adult humor, but in a very gentle way. It is full of references to popular culture and famous people, and most of them are very well executed. I would say that I will give the program a 7 out of ten because it is pretty well executed but it is not very original, I have seen most of these stereotypes many times, even in that particular order!
