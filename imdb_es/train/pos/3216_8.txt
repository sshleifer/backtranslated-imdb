The stoic and laconic soldier, Sergeant Todd (an excellent and credible performance of the always reliable Kurt Russell) is abandoned on a remote, desolate planet after being considered obsolete by the ruthless and arrogant Colonel Mekum (played deliciously to Jason Isaacs' slimy hilt) ), who has Todd and his fellow soldiers were replaced by a new advanced breed of genetically engineered fighters. Todd joins a peaceful community of independent wage earners and has to defend this community when the new soldiers arrive for a field drill. Director Paul W.S. Anderson, working from an intelligent and provocative script by David Webb Peoples, describes a chilling vision of a gloomy, cold and hard future, while maintaining an agile rhythm and a harsh and harsh tone. In addition, Anderson handles the touching moments of humanity well (Todd's struggle to get in touch with his previously repressed feelings is truly moving) and presents the moving action scenes with great enthusiasm. Russell gives a strong and impressive portrait of Todd about pantomime; He transmits a lot of emotion without saying much and instead does most of his acting through the movements of his body and facial expressions. The changes of support from Jason Scott Lee as the brutal soldier Caine 607, Connie Nielson as the compassionate Sandra, Sean Pertwee as the gentle Mace, Jared and Taylor Thorne as the little boy Nathan, Gary Busey as the veteran veteran of Captain Church, Michael Chiklis as the merry Johnny Pig and Brenda Wehle as the sensible mayor Hawkins. Even better, this film makes a profound and meaningful statement about the spiritual cost of being a ruthless soldier and the importance of intellectual power over physical power. The polished cinematography of David Tattersall, Joel McNeely's incomparable orchestral score and the first-rate special effects further enhance the quality of this excellent hybrid sci-fi / action adventure.
