['Although this was not without flaws, this drama was appropriate to be shown around Easter time. It reminded us of our spiritual being and showed that behind our facades, we often hide our deepest sufferings and experiences. There was a lot to enjoy in the drama, among them the rapper teenagers who provided a better musical accompaniment to the drama than the bad background sound rating. The performance was excellent and Timothy Spall was once again excellent. The climax was very satisfactory, although somewhat simplistic. Timothy Spall&#39;s &quot;abandonment&quot; of the suicide of his deceased wife was credible and reflected well the feelings of despair that were present in the self-harming adolescent. The resolution between the child of graffiti and the Muslim was gratifying but less credible. A wonderful drama that left me and my husband feeling that the night had been well taken advantage of. Congratulations!']
