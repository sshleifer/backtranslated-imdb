This is the best movie I've found in a long time. Not only is this the best movie of its kind (filming at school). The way Ben Coccio (the director) decided to film her was magnificent. He filmed it with teenage actors who were still attending high school. He filmed it in the actors' rooms and used the real parents of the actors like their parents in the movie. In addition, the actors also filmed using camcorders, which seems much more like a video diary. It is almost ingenious. (If it's a word) However, there are some errors, for example, when Cal calls Brads (?) Land Rover a Range Rover (or vice versa, it's been a while since I've seen it).
