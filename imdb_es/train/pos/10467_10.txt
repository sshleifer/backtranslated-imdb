But unfortunately, due to rights issues, that will almost never happen. The transcripts of Joe Bob's comments about the sub B movies he screened are available on the Internet, but do not fully capture his inflected delivery, which was a real problem. Today, Joe Bob (real name: John Bloom) is limited to doing the complementary functions of classics like "I Spit On Your Grave" (with what some fanatics of the exploitation call the best gang rape in a movie of all the times), and Jason X, one of the most repeated sequels on Friday the 13th of all time (the series was never the same once it left Paramount). All I could think about when they canceled it was, "Damn it, where else am I going to fill myself with flesh, blonde jokes and trivia of terror every Saturday night? Does this mean I have to get a life now?" Unfortunately, it does. But there will always be a place in my heart hungry for horror for "Monstervision". Live the Drive-In!
