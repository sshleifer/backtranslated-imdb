This production by Oliver is masterful in showing layers of evil in the human soul. What makes history remarkable is a brilliant invisible character, who traverses this darkness while guiding an innocent child through the most serious dangers to the hands of his own relative. Yes, although Oliver walks through the valley of the shadow of death, he does not fear evil. A rod and a cane are there to comfort him. In the end, he is saved from the feces of mankind. In the lower part is Fagin, the most evil of the lot. Fagin contemplates the repentance of his ways not once, but twice, but declines because he is not willing to pay the price. Fagin is worse than Bill Sikes, because he raises little pickpockets who become murderers. In the middle is Oliver. His innocence is immaculate, but also proven. The best is Nancy. Lacking judgment, he ignores the violent nature of Bill Sikes because of his deep need for love. However, unlike Fagin, at the probable cost of her own life, she repents of her sins by saving Oliver from Bill. Things are not what they look like. In my opinion, this quality is what makes art worthwhile: unpredictability. I would give this movie a "10", but its 70 soundtracks and ambience made for television distracted. In general, a good parable and a story completely appropriate for all audiences.
