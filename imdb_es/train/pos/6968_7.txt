Just as the new BSG was not what fans of the original series expected, Caprica can not deliver what fans of the new BSG expected (for the most part). It is a very interesting show, if not something self-involved, or at least the pilot is. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for the great CGI emotions of the (new) BSG, you will be very disappointed. If you liked the drama, you are likely to find something that you like and even identify with it. <br /> <br /> The story analyzes how the Cylons developed, why Adama hates them and the origins of a monotheistic society. . The writers also manage to approach humans "playing with the (the) God (is)" and the creation or recreation of the "human" life. It will be interesting to see how this develops. <br /> <br /> I found it sometimes in some places and I also preached in others, but in general it was promising. A small part of me wants (or expects) that there may be some minor signs of BSG (apart from the previous story I mentioned), but that would probably shake the plot too much. Like BSG, I'll have to wait and see if Caprica grows in me, but it's too early to know. <br /> <br /> It would be very easy to write it down as a failure if you compare it with the previous Series, but I am willing to give it a try. In general, I thought it was interesting enough to make me see how the real series is before 'throwing in the towel' (proverbial).
