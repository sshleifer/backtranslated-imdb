Ride With The Devil directed by Ang Lee (Crouching Tiger) is another gem of this excellent cap of directors. For those who are not familiar with the history of the border wars between Kansas and Missouri during the American Civil War. Watch this movie and you will visit a sad piece of Americana. In addition to some great action scenes (quite bloody at times). This is a story of love and devotion between men and a lady in particular. It's starring Toby Maguire, Skeet Ulrich Jeffrey Wright and as the young lady Jewel, I've never seen or seen her, I want to see more of her). The performance is excellent, excellent production values, very well written (adapted from a novel) <br /> <br /> This is a long movie of 128 minutes, but it is worth seeing. <br /> <br /> My rating is **** <br /> <br /> respectively, presented <br /> <br /> Jay Harris <br /> <br />
