Peter Falk is a diverse and accomplished actor. The movie is well written and the acting seems real life. For all Columbo lovers this is a superior job. Because it shows what talent is Peter Falk. He does not play a detective, he plays a retired carpet salesman. By the time the credits start playing a role, you'll want to see it again. The interesting part of the movie is that the message will be applied to every person who sees it; The depth of its relevance will be the only thing that varies. It's a shame that Hollywood liberals only promote disdain and skin because this is the kind of movie that business people should be proud of. This would be a great movie to turn it into a live play.
