While I do not consider myself a big fan of fairytale movies, Stardust intrigued me when I saw Michelle Pfeiffer in the trailers as a villain (especially because I was about to see her as the bossy Velma Von Tussle in Hairspray). Boy, she's as convincingly evil here as a witch, especially with her ugly makeup at the beginning and the end! Robert De Niro is also great as the pirate captain who has been forced to hide "in the closet" to protect his "reputation"! Almost all actors like Claire Danes, Rupert Everett, Ricky Gervais, Peter O'Toole and many others do a good job here. While the Danes and Pfeiffer are classic beauties, there are also impressive faces of Sienna Miller, Olivia Grant (as Girl Bernard) and Kate Magowan, especially when we know her. The newcomer Charlie Cox is fine as the leader of Tristan and he looked a lot like his father Dunstan when he was a young man who I thought was him in the first scenes with Magowan (actually, Ben Barnes). Many comments have compared this with The Princess Bride and although I can see some similarities, the main difference was that with PB, always knew that it was just an imaginary story told by an old man to his grandson. Stardust makes you believe, for the most part, that what you are seeing and hearing could have happened, even with all the hilarity that goes on throughout. So on that note, I highly recommend Stardust.
