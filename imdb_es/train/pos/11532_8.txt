['Well, this was one of those movies I took by chance, and it was good enough for me to record it when it appeared next time ... If, like me, you enjoy a lot of horror movies from the 80s that branched out a bit the norm (that is, it&#39;s not just another excess of generic sequels) so I think you can enjoy this. When the bad guy finally shows up in person, it definitely was not what I expected to see! All in all, I would not go out of your way for this, but if you like the genre, then look at it if it comes up and you have an hour and a half to kill, I suppose. I would give it 6.5 out of 10.']
