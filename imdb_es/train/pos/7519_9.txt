THE PAGE OF BETTIE OF NOTORIO (2006) *** 1/2 Gretchen Mol, Lilli Taylor, Chris Bauer, Jared Harris, Sarah Paulson, David Strathairn, Austin Pendleton, Norman Reedus, Dallas Roberts. <br /> <br /> Mol shines like the legendary pin-up queen Bettie Page in an excellent biopic. <br /> <br /> Gretchen Mol is probably best known for being considered The Next-It-Girl for some years ago, when no one knew who she was despite an infamous cover story of Vanity Fair among other dubings of media, but despite some co-protagonist roles here and there, his predicted stardom seemed to shine with less brilliance until now. Here, like the famous queen of Bettie Page, Gretchen Mol is in fact a bright rising star. <br /> <br /> Bettie Page was born in Tennessee, grew up as an appropriate God-fearing and family-oriented girl who seemed to find herself the unjustified object of lust and affection, as she grew up. A gang rape that is retaken in flash is not graphically represented, nor is it the subtle demonstration that his own father has less than decent designs for his own family, which is important to understand how Page managed to escape from possible nightmarish life for a career as an actress headed to New York City in the 1950s, when in fact that was the time and place to capture the light in a bottle. What Page did not realize is that, in fact, it would be when it arrived. <br /> <br /> A beautiful black-haired bride with a divine figure, Page is seen on Coney Island one summer day by a black policeman. Asking to take her photograph that takes her to pose in her basement and, finally, to the studios of Irving Klaw (Bauer) and her sister Paula (Taylor) who tend their kitsch, but consider the pornographic images to a unique clientele: the fetishes. <br /> <br /> Although Page is quite naive, she is undeniably intelligent and knows that her body is not a sin and can see the forest through the trees in the sense that she is in control, or at least remains in what he is offered as he is not indecent and is enjoying himself in his less and less dressed portraits, until a witch hunt in Congress looks for some scapegoats to make pornographic images a crime. <br /> <br /> Talented filmmaker Mary Harron and fellow screenwriter Guinevere Turner ("An American Psycho" and "I Shot Andy Warhol") simplify biopic traps rather neatly and maybe a little hasty to get to who really was Bettie Page, although they do justice by representing a time of rigidity at its zenith. Many thanks to the talented director of photography Mott Hopfel for his languidly beautiful images in black and white and also for the splashed color segments that remind Douglas Sirk films of the time for their melodramatic amulets. Part of the feminist treatise and part of the American dream fulfilled the story with excellent performances of their ensemble, including the comedian Bauer and Taylor as brothers in smut and Harris who had a field day as a study partner with a taste for wine and talk . It's fun to see Strathairn in a bit of gimmick as a senator in a campaign for justice after portraying news bulldog Edward R. Murrow in his latest presentation, "Good evening, and good luck" as an opposite role to the table. <Br /> <br /> But he sympathizes with Mol's truly fine talents, such as the uninhibited but profound morality and, most importantly, Bettie Page smart, who lets his childish innocence shine through his daring nakedness and now considered "domesticated and picturesque". The borderline-kitschy postures that attracted male fantasy for decades and remain a marker of human sexuality in this country and perhaps in the world in general. Mol is perfect and incredibly resembles the theme of his portrait to his smile of mockery and knowledge. The real page of Bettie was not involved in the project, but apparently gave her blessing and continues to live a somewhat isolated life that is alluded to in the final moments as having found Jesus and eluding his "notorious" image of a once for all. A pity, since this film strangely embraces the resounding decency imbued within its theme, radiating for all to see in its naked splendor.
