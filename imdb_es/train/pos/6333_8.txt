I just used this video and I was watching it last night. The performance started extremely badly (hey ------ hey ------ twister) but he got very well shortly after the halls. The tornadoes seemed extremely fake, and many of the effects of CGI were very unreliable, but the scene with the house cracking and the content being blown and sucked was extremely well made and almost on par with films like Twister. The scenes of devastation were also extremely well done. The story was very well written, and it's refreshing to see a movie like this one removed from the same old "disaster formulas" that movies of this genre seem to have been stagnant for 30 years. <br /> <br /> Although this movie had a very strange mix of effects and acting quality, this deserves an A in my book.
