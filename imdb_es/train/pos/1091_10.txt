I really liked that movie. I saw it for the first time when I was 20 years old (it was only four years ago) and I enjoyed it so much, that I brought my own copy the next day. The comedy is well interpreted by all involved. I always have to rewind and go back to the scene where Mr. Tsanders explains why he found water 6 feet in one area and 227 feet in another area. Also look for the father of Jason Robards who plays Mr. Retch. The talent ran in that family.
