['Let me get to the end point here: I have 3 children, from 5 to 10 years old. I consider a trip to the theater a success when there are no talking animals. I have seen most of the videos for children in our collection at least 72 times. I can tell you when the film is reversed in The Wizard of Oz, the sexual joke of those over 18 in El Dorado and the tragic flaw in the end of Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer. I could probably make a storyboard of Nemo by heart only. <br /><br /> What makes me support my only son (varies) that suggests this title for the family movie of one night? In a word: Showerman. <br /><br /> Moment of silence ... <br /><br /> *sigh*']
