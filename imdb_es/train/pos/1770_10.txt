In the previews, "The 40-year-old Virgin" holds the image of another immature sex game about a 40-year-old Solitary Man who suddenly feels the need to do the writing simply because he has not done it. Too many bad past experiences have weakened his enthusiasm to the point that he avoids women altogether. And then the unexpected happens: he falls in love. In addition, there is a film about it, and it is called "The Virgin of 40 years". <br /> <br /> The title virgin is Andy Stitzer (Steve Carell), who in fact is 40 years old, works as an employee of an electronics store and collects vintage action figures, which are displayed throughout of all its nice notepad for all to see. It has a charming home theater system and looks at "Survivor" with its two kind elderly neighbors. It's a pretty picturesque definition of the lonely boy who needs to get out more and talk to more women. <br /> <br /> Now here is the real novelty with this image: it makes the task impossible to really treat your subject. In a beautiful way, mature. This is a film that could easily have turned out very differently in the hands of a more transparent team of filmmakers. It could have descended to endless jokes and sexual jokes but, fortunately, this image never stops so low. Of course there are jokes of sex here and there and even some hits are aimed at the gay community (which, in no way, should be taken as an attack on homosexuals), since two of the characters exchange insults among themselves while playing videogames ( "Mortal Kombat: Deception", nothing less than the best fighting game directed by testosterone for men). <br /> <br /> As someone who is quickly approaching 20, he collects McFarlane Toys action figures and has never done the same. In fact, I found this movie funny and touching in a way that a similar movie could never have been. I was able to relate to the character of Andy Stitzer more than anyone in the theater because I was the only teenager present in this presentation; everyone else seemed to be over 40 years old. A little arrogant, I know, but you ("you" are in italics) could still relate if you were the only teenager present at an afternoon screening of "The 40 Year Old Virgin"? <br /> <br /> Of course, Andy has never had sex and wakes up every day with "dawn" (do not ask), and his friends press him to try extravagant methods to get friends' attention. opposite sex When it is discovered for the first time, Andy is a virgin, at the age of 40, his three friends and colleagues from electronics store David (Paul Rudd), Jay (Romany Malco) and Cal (Seth Rogen) all assume he is gay because he has never been with a woman. , that could not be further from the truth. The truth is that Andy loves women, but past traumatic experiences (revealed hilariously one after another in a flashback sequence) have left him aside forever. <br /> <br /> David, Jay and Cal embark on a mission to kick Andy out, so help them all. But you know that such adventures will only end in disaster, as evidenced by a date with Nicky (Leslie Mann), who puts Andy in the worst drunk driving experience. I think anyone would not want to go through it and have a pretty spooky encounter. with Beth (Elizabeth Banks), the pretty girl who works at the bookstore and finally reveals herself to be a sex demon. <br /> <br /> Things light up for Andy when he meets Trish (Catherine Keener), friends. Woman who works in a store across the street that sells things on eBay for people. Hmmm And with that attractive collection of action figures, you can imagine that in the end you expect a great financial reward, that is, if you can ever "do the writing". <br /> <br /> Finally, this is the sexual romp we've been waiting for. It is a very real problem that many loners go through, not that there is anything wrong with being a virgin, but let's see the big picture: how many of us "loners" want to be a lonely man forever? The important thing that is taught in this image is that Lonely Guy must be himself. I do not think I have to go through body waxing like Andy does (which is a lateral separation to be honest, and according to this website and several other news articles, it was actually real, and so was the blood in Carell's shirt later). <br /> <br /> "The 40-year-old Virgin" was directed by Judd Apatow and co-written by him and Carell, which originated as a sketch starring Carell. Carell is sweet and human, since his character is not a layman who approaches this with his eyes closed. This is probably one of the smartest games I've seen and it's not offensive (a lot) because its characters are treated with dignity and respect. Even Carell's friends, who pass a bad tip to cover up their own insecurities in the relationship, can relate at a fundamental level. <br /> <br /> The way in which "The 40-year-old Virgin" manifests is certainly fun. The end, but I will leave it to you, the spectator, to observe it. Surely, if someone can go over the things that Andy does and still have the strength to attract a sexy woman like Catherine Keener, then it's true: it's never too late! <br /> <br /> 10/10
