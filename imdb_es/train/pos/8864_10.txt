['What an extraordinary crime thriller! My wife and I saw this at the Toronto International Film Festival last week and it was the best film at an exceptionally strong festival. It is already my second favorite movie of all time after DR. STRANGELOVE and I was definitely in an emotional state when I walked home and discussed the movie with my wife. <br /><br /> I do not want to ruin the plot because thrillers of this caliber are better enjoyed without preconceived ideas. One synopsis that I would like to share is that two brothers, played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke, plan to steal a jewelry store in Westchester, New York. The movie bounces back in about two weeks (before, during and after the theft), and a key scene is repeated at least three times. In general, that could interrupt the momentum of a movie, but that never happens during this masterpiece. The emotion, tension and even the quality of the performance only seemed to improve as the film progressed. In the end, I was on the edge of my seat, out of breath, waiting to see how it would all end. I know I used some clich√©s in this post, but I was literally on the edge of my seat. I should mention that the non-linear plot is fairly easy to follow. This is not the kind of movie where you will hear the members of the audience asking their friend to explain the story during the movie. <br /><br /> The acting is absolutely brilliant, and I doubt he has the same admiration for the film if the casting had not been so perfect. A small complaint is that Hoffman and Hawke do not look like brothers, but that is a small objection that I can ignore. Hoffman was at his best and some of his scenes with Hawke were positively electric. Marisa Tomei (as Hoffman&#39;s wife) and Albert Finney (as the father of Hoffman &amp; Hawke) are also very good at supporting roles. Even some cameo performances were so impressive that I can still remember every comment, gesture and facial expression of Brian O&#39;Byrne and Michael Shannon: absolute perfection. The scene of the robbery felt more authentic than any other scene of movie theft I&#39;ve seen, and I had the same sense of authenticity in most scenes, especially Hoffman&#39;s. The music helped increase the tension throughout the film, often the same notes played very effectively. I had the music in my head the next day, even while I was sitting in other movies. In addition to my minor complaint at the beginning of this paragraph, there was a plot twist that felt a little unbelievable (big spoiler, so I can not describe the scene). Otherwise, this movie is pretty close to perfect. <br /><br /> There were about a dozen great films at the festival that I would like to see for the second time, but BEFORE THE DEVIL IS THAT YOU ARE DEAD is in a league of its own. As a side note, director Sidney Lumet spoke before the film and introduced Marisa Tomei and Ethan Hawke to the stage. Tomei did not speak and was a little shy, so Lumet asked, &quot;Can you believe that someone so beautiful can be so shy with the camera?&quot; That comment is quite ironic considering the graphic opening scene !!']
