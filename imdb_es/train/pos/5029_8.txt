I entered this movie, maybe a little tired by the hacking movies and cut out on the screen these days. Boy, I was surprised. This little treasure was full of a dark and dark atmosphere. Even more surprising was the very limited amount of blood actually demonstrated. As with most good movies, this leaves something to the imagination, and Bill Paxton did an excellent job in directing. The scenes were filmed inside the car as they are well done and, after watching the episode of "Anatomy of a Scene" at the end of the video, it was good to see that some of the subtle but wonderful things that I had noticed were intentional and not just one type of address "Oh, that looks good, keep it." This is a bad mood movie, full of sadness. Still, for the dark subject, a considerable part of it is filmed in daylight, including some of the most disturbing scenes. The acting is exceptional (well, I've always been a Powers Booth fan), and it's never overlooked. Au Contraire, it is very dim and works very well for this type of film. If there is any area where this film is missing, it is in the end, which seems a little too artificial, but still works on a simpler level without destroying the mood or message of the film. Which is the message? It is something that each individual decides for himself. In general, on a scale of 1 to 10, this film gets an 8 for those who like the Southern Gothic genre (ie, "Body Heat" or "Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil"), and a 5 for those who do not. 't
