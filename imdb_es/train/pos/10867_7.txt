I saw in the movie list guide for the Santa Barbara Film Festival, where I went when I was in Hollywood, that this movie was in screening. Basically there is an election for the new president of the Hong Kong Triads Wo Sing Society, so you can imagine how much violence will occur during this. The fight is between the "candidates" Lam Lok (Simon Yam) and Big D (Tony Leung Ka Fai) for control of the oldest and most powerful parts of the Triad of society. Also starring Louis Koo as Jimmy Lee, Nick Cheung as Jet, Cheung Siu Fai as Mr. So, Lam Suet as Big Head and Lam Ka Tung as Kun. There are some good themes and moments of realistic corruption, almost enough action, aside from maybe when the cops get involved, but it follows a sequel, making it a worthwhile criminal drama thriller. Very well!
