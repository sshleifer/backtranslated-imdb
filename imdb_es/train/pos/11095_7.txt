['I have always liked this film by John Frankenheimer. Good script by Elmore Leonard and the main reason why this was not just another thriller is due to Frankenheimer. His tense direction and attention to small details make a difference, he even hired porn star Ron Jeremy as a consultant! You can make a case that is the last good movie that Roy Scheider did. I have always said that Robert Trebor had an excellent performance. Clarence Williams III received all the publicity with his terrifying performance and it is also excellent, but I really thought that Trebor stood out. Frankenheimer may not be as proud of this film as others, but it is an effective thriller full of blackmail, murder, sex, drugs and real porn actors that appear in sordid parts. What can you say about a movie in which Ann Margaret has been murdered with drugs and raped? A guilty pleasure to say the least. Vanity has a real role of poor quality and a very young Kelly Preston makes an early appearance. A classic exploiting thriller that should not be forgotten.']
