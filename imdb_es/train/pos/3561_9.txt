At least something good came out of Damon Runyon's mistaken attempt to sentimentalize the mafia. "Guys and Dolls," the seemingly indestructible music scene, was recorded in a movie in 1955 by Joseph L. Mankiewicz ("All About Eve") in a colorful and enjoyable film that featured a cast of stars including Vivian Blaine ( original The Broadway show), Jean Simmons (whose character has a strange resemblance to Audrey Hepburn in "Roman Holiday") and two of the great leaders of all time, Frank Sinatra and Marlon Brando, who recently won an Oscar for Best Actor Cast ("From Here To Eternity") and Best Actor ("On the Waterfront") and they were at the top of their game. Listening to Brando singing "Luck Be to Lady Tonight", there is a lot of talk about where Dylan got his voice. Stubby Kaye steals the show as Nicely Nicely Johnson, who knocks down the house with "Sit, you're rocking the boat". The ubiquitous Sheldon Leonard adds one more page to his gang's gang of gangsters. The film has a bright and caricature look, anticipating the pop art of the early sixties. The characters speak in a stylized patois, apparently based on Yiddish idioms. Although the social attitudes and gender roles of the film are outdated, everything is very funny, and even the soft joke of the Salvation Army is harmless and does not reflect a real animosity toward organized religion. Seeing Sinatra and Brando in the same movie is reason enough to see this movie, but it has many other attractions to offer during its 149 minutes.
