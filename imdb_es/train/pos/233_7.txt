In fact, I found this movie 'interesting'; Finally it's worth my time to see and rent. It's true ... some scenes were exaggerated about emotion, shouting, etc., but what movie does not emphasize his agenda, genre or 'ax to grind'? Almost none! What surprised me is that I read a review elsewhere made by a critic of S.Fran in another review site, but I found his negative criticism instead of a more accurate description of his "own" review of the film; Not of the movie at all. Anyone who watches this movie will realize that it is great to recommend it to family and friends; No car chases, yes! Being "in" an Italian family, I can relate completely to the environment represented on the screen. The movie also has its heartbreaking parts. It is what real life can be in such an environment. Good movie.
