In Mexico City, the former CIA assassin and now decadent alcoholic John Creasy (Denzel Washington) is hired by industrialist Samuel Ramos (Marc Anthony), with the recommendation of his old friend Rayburn (Christopher Walken), to be the bodyguards of his young daughter Pita (Dakota Fanning) and his wife Lisa (Radha Mitchell). Pita changes the behavior of the cold Creasy, making him live and smile again, and feels a great affection for her. When the girl is kidnapped and Creasy is informed that she was murdered by the criminals, he swears to kill each one of those responsible for the kidnapping. <br /> <br /> "Man on Fire" is almost a masterpiece, and it will certainly become a classic in the future. The story is excellent, never cheesy and, although it has 146 minutes of execution time, the viewer does not feel that time passes. The cast is composed of excellent actors and actresses, their performances are exceptional, highlighting Denzel Washington, Dakota Fanning and Radha Mitchell. The cinematography has wonderful moments, and the script has impressive lines. Personally I loved it when the character of Christopher Walken explains to Manzano (Giancarlo Giannini) that Creasey's specialty is death, and he is preparing his masterpiece. I agree with the user who commented that "Man on Fire" is one of the best, if not the best, movie of the year in this genre. My vote is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Chamas da Vingan√ßa" ("Flames of revenge")
