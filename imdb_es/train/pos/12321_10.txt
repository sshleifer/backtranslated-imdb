['I saw this movie in my childhood. And after 10 years I did not remember anything about this movie, but I discovered that I also do not know how I could discover this movie. It&#39;s my life. My favorite movie of all time. My words will not reach the true meaning of what I have inside for this movie. I follow this movie It is a brilliant mix of fantasy, comedy, romance, horror, erotic, fear and martial arts. The story about the power of love is very moving and warm. It is a masterpiece of Hong Kong cinema. <br /><br /> Sinnui Yauman, is undoubtedly one of the best ghost stories ever filmed. Written by Songling Pu and directed by Siu-Tung Ching, A Chinese Ghost Story has it all. Ling Choi Sin, played by Leslie Cheung, is a young man with bad luck who goes in search of a monastery where to stay, deep in the forest, a place where the villagers seem to be very afraid to approach. The trip is only dangerous with the wolves, and a crazy Taoist monk lives in the temple. <br /><br /> Ling Choi Sin knows Tsing, a beautiful and mysterious young woman who also lives nearby in a desert temple. She is forced to seduce men by her evil lover, but when she meets the innocent Ling Choi Sin, they fall in love. <br /><br /> Ling Choi Sin is a clumsy fool but his heart is in the right place, while Tsing tries to protect him from the other forest spirits, he tries to protect her from the monk who is trying to kill the forest spirits. . There are great martial arts, even a monk who bursts into a drunken song while performing ritual Taoist sword forms. The film does a lot of traditional martial arts acrobatics, with magic and flying through the air, jumping from tree to tree, with elegant long dresses and scarves, but the film really flows, and everything is effective. <br /><br /> Tsing must be married to a monster of the evil tree, which can not be good, and we feel her situation in her house where we find her sisters and her stepmother who is not really nice. <br /><br /> In the end, they must fight against a tree witch with a deadly tongue, and go with Yin to the heart of hell to fight the evil of a thousand years to save their souls, and bring Ling&#39;s ashes to their home for a proper burial so that She may have an opportunity for reincarnation. <br /><br /> A beautiful story that really pays attention to details. This movie moves you in many ways, you will laugh, you will cry and you will only have fun with the great martial arts and cinematography. And although in the end, Yin and Ling Choi Sin ride into the morning sun under a lovely rainbow, we never know if Tsing was given a reincarnation, but we know it.']
