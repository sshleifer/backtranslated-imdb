It is a real shame that this split television series inspired by the superior images made for television "The Night Stalker" and "The Night Strangler" only lasted one season and twenty episodes, because in its best version this program offered a winning combination and highly entertaining of acute cynical humor (the energetic verbal combats of Carl Kolchak with the perpetually irascible and long-standing editor, Tony Vincenzo were always a delight to watch and listen to), witty writings, witty supernatural threats (you have to love extravagant creatures and originals). in "The Spanish Moss Murders", "The Sentry" and "Horror in the Heights", plus you can not go wrong with horror favorites like zombies, vampires, werewolves and witches, colorful characters, animated action of a lot of guest stars (the legendary icon of the movie of the biker William Smith had a rare opportunity to face a heroic advantage in "The Energy Eater", while other episodes included great veteran actors like Keenan Wynn, John Fiedler, John Dehner, Severn Darden and William Daniels in juicy roles), the actual moments of genuine suspense (the sewer climax of "The Spanish Moss Murders" in particular was really harrowing), and, best of all, the only Darren McGavin at his best as the Reckless, aggressive and excitable, but basically decent, brave and honest from Chicago, reporter for the Illinois newspaper Carl Kolchak. <br /> <br /> Kolchak was the protagonist of all the 70 years par excellence, a clever and ingenious guy with a strong nose for a tasty spoonful and an unfortunate ability to get into all sorts of problems. Besides, the awkward Kolchak was not superhuman; he usually stumbled or tripped while fleeing from a mortal threat, but he possessed a certain inner strength and courage that allowed him to save the human race again and again from all kinds of lethal enemies from another world. Kolchak was surrounded by a handful of funny secondary characters: Simon Oakland was perfect as Carl's bad-tempered boss, Tony Vincenzo, Jack Grinnage as the elegant Ron Updyke made for an ideal comic movie, Ruth McDevitt was simply charming as the sweet Miss Emily Cowles , and Carol Ann Susi was also very funny as the eager castor rookie Monique Marmelstein (who, unfortunately, disappeared after appearing in only three episodes). Of course, the program suffered from lackluster makeup and special effects (the titular lycanthrope in "The Werewolf" looks like a Yorkshire terrier!) And the last episodes featured some ridiculously silly monsters (the headless motorcyclist in "Chopper" , Cathy Lee Crosby as Helen of Troy in "The Youth Killer"), but even the second-rate shows are redeemed by the perversely wily sardonic wit of the show and the boundless vitality of McGavin and his captivatingly harsh presence.
