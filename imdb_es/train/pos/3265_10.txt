I've always been a big fan of Cybill Shepperd, since I saw his series a few years ago! This movie undoubtedly shows at its best! The movie was beautifully released and played !! Occasionally small funny lines fall, just to make this movie one of the best I've seen in my life! Everyone really does it themselves! Especially Robert Downey Jr and Cybill Shepperd, they really made the movie come true! I also loved how little Mavis loses her wig and almost dies when she falls to the ground! This is the best movie !!
