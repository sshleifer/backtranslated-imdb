Deanna Durbin really saved Universal from bankruptcy and allowed it to remain a great study. In the mid-1930s, most of the great directors who had been at Universal, for example, Milestone, Browning and Wyler, were gone. Only James Whale remained, but his prestigious horror films were behind him. Deanna and Judy Garland appeared in a short "Every Sunday" and it was initially suggested to Garland for the role of Penny in "Three Smart Girls". When Garland was not available, Universal changed to Durbin. Initially, she had been a supporting player, but her potential was so vivid that the script was rewritten to make her the star. Directed by Henry Koster, the film had a European touch. <br /> <br /> The film starts with a beautiful panorama of a lake in "Switzerland". The "three smart girls" of the title: three sisters, Joan (Nan Gray), Kay (Barbara Read) and Penny (Deanna Durbin) are sailing with Penny giving her glorious voice to "My Heart is Singing". Not everything is too good on the home front: his father is planning to remarry a younger woman (Binnie Barnes), so the three girls with the help of their trusted nurse (Lucille Watson) decide to go to New York and meet with his mother. . Lucille Watson is best remembered for her role as Robert Taylor's stern mother in "Waterloo Bridge" (1941). <br /> <br /> Donna is a gold seeker who, along with her sparse mother (Alice Brady), is determined to marry Judson Craig (Charles Winninger). For someone with no experience in the movies, Deanna is wonderful as Penny, a typical annoying and enthusiastic sister, and she is as pretty as a photo. When she tells her father "Someone who cares about me", you will melt, what a glorious voice she had. She also has one of the funniest lines in the movie. When her father comforts her with "Tomorrow I'll take you to the zoo," she replies "Oh, I can see enough monkeys around here!" <br /> <br /> With the help of Bill Evans (John King) they decide to hire an "Earl" (Mischa Auer) for romance Donna. They organize to meet in a nightclub, but due to confusion, Lord Michael Stuart (Ray Milland) gets confused with the count and Donna falls in love with him (she thinks he owns half of Australia!). The plan fails. Kay and Donna want to speed up their marriage with Judson. <br /> <br /> Penny decides to take the matter into her own hands and runs away. They take her to the local police station where she delights the police with her interpretation of "Il Bacio" (she is trying to convince them that she is a young opera singer). Everything ends happily with his mother (Nella Walker) sailing towards the patch. everything goes well with his dad and, meanwhile, Donna meets the false condeo (Mischa Auer) and sails to Australia with him. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
