The history of the Chinese ghost of Ching Siu Tung and Tsui Hark, besides being one of the best wuxia pian movies ever made, is a beautiful and romantic love story, as well as an impressive choreographed martial arts film that must belong to the collection of all movie lovers. Hong Kong's puzzled superstar, Leslie Cheung, plays a tax collector who spends the night in an enchanted temple. While staying in the temple, meet a colorful cast of characters that include the swordsmen Yin (Wu Ma) and Hsiao Hou, the devil of the tree and the beautiful ghost Lit Sin Seen, played by the charming Joey Wong. <br /> <br /> To free her from the clutches of the evil Tree Demon, she must reincarnate her body and travel to the underworld to defeat an even more powerful demon. <br /> <br /> You can not say enough about this movie. The rhythm is perfect, with a great combination of romance, action, fantasy and humor, and the feverish end must leave you with little chance of breathing. The chemistry between the wonderfully tragic Joey Wong and Leslie Cheung (whose legendary career ended too soon) really allows the viewer to feel for both. In fact, acting in general is so lively and full of life, I would say that this is one of the funniest observation experiences I've had. Much of the credit goes to Wu Ma in his interpretation of the mysterious Swordsman Yin. His exaggerated character of a disillusioned swordsman bent on conquering evil leads to some great moments of humor and traditional Hong Kong drama. A wonderful score, an exuberant cinematography with bold colors and frenetic action pieces, courtesy of Ching Siu Tung, complete this wonderful film. Find a copy anywhere you can. 10/10
