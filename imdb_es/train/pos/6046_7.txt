I was pleasantly surprised by the movie. Let's be honest; The premise does not sound particularly attractive when you have to deliver money for a movie of the night, but it has a quiet nature that beats one. There were no moments that I found disturbed, and I doubt I would remember them the next day, but this does not fail as a pleasant diversion. What I found fun was seeing him here in Beijing with my Chinese girlfriend who never understands what I like. I told him there was a plot: three guys have to bring some grass to London. Just satisfactory for her. There is no robbery here for the camera I expected after reading several of the comments. However, I make an exception to the comparisons with Withnail and myself; Not in the same league, and I doubt he had the intention to do so. www.imperialflags.blogspot.com
