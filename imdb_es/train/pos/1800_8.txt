All Dogs Go to Heaven is on par with Watership Down for horror movies for children. Both were dark and quite sinister, but at the same time the most fascinating experience a child can have. This was one of my favorite movies when I was a kid. I was in love with Charlie and at the tender age of five or six, I admit ... I was in love with a cartoon dog. All Dogs tells the dark story of adorable Charlie and his partner in crime Itchy. The story begins when Charlie escapes death row and goes to the nearest club to bet. Of course, as a child, I did not understand the concept of this movie. I loved the songs and the animation, but as I get older, I start to wonder why this movie did not bother me when I was young. It's about adult themes: gambling, murder, hell and prison, but in a world of Disney movies, it's something every kid should see once. <br /> <br /> Yes, there is a kind of crazy transvestite crocodile scene and the scenes of hell scare me more now than when I was little, but it conveys a message so moving that parents should not ignore!
