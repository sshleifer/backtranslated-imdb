"Who did it?" It contains many safe laughs and gags. It's not just one of Stooges best films with Shemp, it's one of the best short comedies produced by Columbia. Director Bernds originally wrote the script in 1946 for the Stooges, but when Curly Howard suffered a stroke, he was designed for the Columbia comedy team of Schilling and Lane (his version was released as "Pardon My Terror"). it was too good for the Stooges to let it pass, and it was finally filmed by the Stooges in late 1947. <br /> <br /> Old Goodrich calls the detectives as Shemp, Larry and Moe for fear he will Being killed When they arrive at his house, Goodrich has disappeared, and his niece and several thugs try to get rid of the Stooges. Will they find Goodrich and take the niece and the thugs to justice? <br /> <br /> Shemp is particularly funny in this movie. His reactions after Christine McIntyre gave him a hickey are excellent; gives its characteristic sound (eeeb-eeeb-eeeb) and Miss McIntyre is trying not to laugh remarkably. Other funny scenes: the close-up of the mug of Moe looking through the lens of the camera; and the fight in the dark with all the cast members involved. <br /> <br /> Nikko the goon (played by Duke York) is one of the most unusual-looking characters ever portrayed in a Stooges movie. With his hair twisted, he could almost go through a Stooge, if he did not rise above all the others! "Who did it?" It is a jewel among the films of Stooges with Shemp. Even Curly fans will enjoy this one! A true classic of the Stooge. 9 out of 10.
