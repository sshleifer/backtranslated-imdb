FORGET CREDIBILITY <br /> <br /> You should not expect credibility with the action movies where the superhero has to perform an infinite series of incredible feats, be stepped on in the process but recover at lightning speed and transform innocuous gadgets into weapons lethal ... especially when Renny Harlin is directing. <br /> <br /> "CLIFFHANGER" is not an exception. But the film has many resources: an impressive landscape, magnificently photographed, impressive special and visual effects (the first five minutes are exciting and give the tone of the film), excellent music, good attempts at lightness to relieve some of the tension and a solid Cast: two heroes (Stallone, star and story writer, has most of the images, but the excellent Michael Rooker stands firm), a charming heroine (Janine Turner) and one of the most intrepid bandits in history . (the invaluable John Lithgow and the deceptive woman Caroline Goodall, but also Rex Linn, in a longer part than usual and who makes the most of it, Leon, Craig Fairbrass) Well, solid entertainment then, if there is no credibility. As Roger Ebert wrote (about another film) "It's the kind of movie you can sit back and enjoy while not making the mistake of thinking too much." <br /> <br />
