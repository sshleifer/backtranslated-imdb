*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Launched in 1956, and considered quite daring at that time, the caramel melodrama of Douglas Sirk is still something wonderful. The plot refers to the events in an oil-rich dysfunctional Texas family that includes big brother Kyle, who is insecure, weak, hurt and very alcoholic, played by Robert Stack in a very touching and vulnerable performance and his fucking sister Marylee played at one extreme by Dorothy Malone. Mrs. Malone's performance is telegraphed through her eyes, which she uses to show us her emotions, which mostly consist of lust (by Rock Hudson) and jealousy (by Lauren Bacall). Malone is the only actress I've seen in movies that enters a room for the first time. Now, do not get me wrong, his performance to say the least is an absolute cry, and it is one of the supreme works in the field of the fifties. But it is also terrible, because despite being as nice and attractive as Malone, she is not a good actress and is not capable of being subtle or shady. His performance is one note. She manages to do an evil Mambo, and in a great montage, like a little amorous dad played by the always good Robert Keith dies when climbing a ladder, Sirk mixes him with an almost crazy Malone doing an orgasmic dance while undressing. Stack, (who should have won an Oscar) and Malone, (who won the prize, but should not) are the true stars of the movie, the ones who put all the hysteria, both sexual and otherwise in movement, while the "Real stars" from the movie, Hudson & Bacall fade to gray and brown, which are the colors in which they dress mainly. Hudson, who was a better actor, gave him credit for Stack's childhood plays and best friend, and the harassed Malone's love interest that moans and moans for Rock for most of the movie. But Hudson does not want to be part of it, and instead is in love with Bacall, who is married to Stack. Nobody is very happy and nobody is happy for a long time. The Stack-Bacall couple collapses in a big way after a year, and Stack practically forgets forgetting because he thinks he's sterile, and he can not give Bacall a baby to prove he's a man. Sirk, who was a very intelligent man and had a long and fascinating career in both film and theater in Germany, ended his career in Hollywood at Universal in the mid-1950s with a series of "female films" or intense melodramas vivid colors. Although they were adapted mainly from material of mediocre origin or garbage, in the hands of Sirk they became masterpieces of the genre. Sirk had a wonderful sense of color and the design he brought to play in these films that filled his wide-screen spaces with characters that played their emotional lives between strange combinations of colors and lighting, created shadows and reflected many reflections. In "Escrito" the characters always look out the windows, listen at the doors or hide. So in the end, after much violence, an accidental murder, a miscarriage and more, Sirk ends the film with a final and surprising scene of a "reborn" and reformed Malone with a tailored suit, sitting at a desk and hanging a miniature oil well. .
