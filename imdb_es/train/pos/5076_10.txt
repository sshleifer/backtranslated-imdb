It's been almost 5 years since the release of this action movie with style. I have seen this movie almost 10 times and it is a great effort on the part of Gautham. From my perspective, I feel that this movie is virtually impeccable. Surya as ACP Anbuchelvan - no doubt..clase.Jyothika played her role of Maya very well.The character adapts very well to her.The character that caught the attention of the attendees was Pandia.Jeevan played the role of Pandia very well. Brutal and fearsome. Jaevan deservedly received the Best Villain award at the ITFA 2004. The supporting cast of Daniel Balaji, Devadharshini and others performed well. <br /> <br /> Spicy script, perfectly synchronized dialogues and brilliant Gautham narration. Harris Jeyaraj's soundtrack lives up to the charts while BGM adapts very well to the film. The cinematography of RD Rajasekhar is rich. Peter Hein choreographed the acrobatics well. Anthony's edition is accurate. Above all, Kaakha Kaakha is a perfect police film full of correct doses. action and romance <br /> <br /> Even some Hollywood movies can not compete with Kaakha Kaakha ... no doubt.
