['If television were a baseball league, this program would have a perfect record! With an excellent cast and a perfect plot, this program offered 8 incredible seasons and great joy for television after dinner. With the constant change of relationships and discover who is the real father of Hyde, this show was a success when it began in August 98, although it was established in 1976. And going out in the Foremans basement was always what had to be done in that so. and it is still today, together with the circles. This show gave great laughs at the premieres, and still does during the repetitions. If you watch some episodes of this program, you will get everything and want to get more. Now only this show is one of the best that has been created, it is smart and fun.']
