For a long time, 'The Menagerie' was my favorite episode of 'Star Trek', although in recent years it has been eclipsed by 'City on the Edge of Forever'. What I used to prefer about 'Menagerie' was that it was Star Trek harder with this fascinating background story of Trek's current story. I still think it's pretty clever how Gene Roddenberry incorporated the original pilot into a two-part episode. Although the "new" part of the story is very much an excuse for Kirk and some others (and us) to see the pilot, the idea that Spock is judged by a court martial is intelligent. You can make holes in the plot if you want. For example, given the mental control abilities of the Talosians and the condition of Captain Pike, why is it even necessary to physically bring Pike back to his planet? And there are other confusing questions about Pike and Commodore Mendez ... better not to think too much about the details and enjoy the unique ST couple.
