He glorified himself as a great supporting actor in 'Glory', showed that he was not a 'malcolm in the middle' mediocre actor in 'Malcolm X', he showed his brotherly love for acting in 'Philadelphia', he threw himself into a slam dunk "He got the game", he did not throw punches and he shook us like a hurricane in "The Hurricane", he gave us an effective theatrical education in the "Training Day", and now he has shown that he can also direct! Denzel Washington's directorial debut, "Antwone Fisher," is the most moving film of the year. The story of the tearjerker 'fish'er' is not related to the debacle that happened to the Miami Dolphins in the fourth quarter against the New England Patriots in the last game of the 2002 season. Unlike the tragedy of the Dolphins , 'Antwone Fisher' has an emotional and joyful conclusion. The film is based on a true story about a young naval officer who has an anger management problem due to the abhorrence he suffered when he was a foster child. Denzel plays the naval psychologist who helps Antwone overcome his anger and convinces him to find his natural mother. The debut of Derek Luke as Antwone is the best admirable performance I've seen by a rookie actor for some time. In fact, I saw some of the eccentricities detailed in Luke's performance, as I have seen in previous performances in Washington. It was as if Washington was saying to Luke: "La la la Luke, I am your interim father". In agreement! I will leave the jokes of Star Wars before my readers send me to a galaxy far away. Speaking of the great Denzel, his work as a psychologist was masterful. But what can be expected from the acting 'Master D' himself? 'Antwone Fisher' was written by Antwone Fisher himself. The emotional pathos that he inserted into the script of his life of the story was the material of "king fisherman". I call the boss' Mr. Washington 'on catching the correct bait on' Antwone Fisher '. ***** Excellent
