I was quite surprised to read some of the comments on this work, honestly. Some people were looking for a plot ??? Okay, when this video came out more than a decade ago, I saw it for what it was: a collection of music videos. It's not a movie It does not have a plot, nor a central plot. It is a quite artistic anthology of mostly long-format videos, all of them done intelligently or creatively. Michael Jackson may be considered a phenomenon these days, but, after all, this was the man who gave us Thriller (considered by many to be the best music video of all time) and set trends with Billie Jean and Beat It. With Moonwalker , he and the filmmakers and artists who collaborated with him once again took their music and dance moves to create vividly entertaining things, incorporating claymation, special effects, live performance sequences and even self-parody (the "Badder" sequence). And for those who wonder what Joe Pesci was doing there, this video came out a bit before becoming a household name, and it was one of his most memorable appearances in the film. And, IMHO, I think the sequence of Smooth Criminal (the choreographed section) surpasses anything else that Michael Jackson did up to that point.
