A small and small potboiler whose duration of 65 minutes does not seem to be too brief. My name is Julia Ross, it goes back to an English tradition that things are not what they seem: The Lady Vanishes by Hitchcock is an example. Julia Ross (Nina Foch), unemployed, finds a dream job in a new employment agency in London, whose sinister representative seems very anxious to determine if she has living relatives or a boyfriend. After fulfilling his duty, he wakes up (after being drugged) in a vast pile similar to Manderley on the Cornish coast, supposedly as the wife of George Macready, who has an alarming interest in knives and spikes. ice. . Her loving and empowering mother is the irresistible Dame May Whitty (this time a model of boisterous efficiency on the other side of good against the evil she occupied in The Lady Vanishes). The nightmarish vision of this story develops claustrophobically; We know what is happening but we are unable to tell poor Julia. This film, curiously, regularly receives a place of honor as one of the first films (and very few British). I think it is closer to the Gothic tradition of dark houses than the American one of wet cobbles and urban corruption; However, it does show a more modern psychoanalytic mentality. Whatever you call it, it's still a very satisfying thriller.
