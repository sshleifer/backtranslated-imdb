I liked! The plot was strange, Drew Barrymore and DC got complicated for both. Drews' performance was doubtful in some places, but this could be due to his life at that time. Dennis Christopher as the psychiatrist was very good, and as he always does what he can, I'm a big fan of Dennis anyway, that's why I bought the DVD. <br /> <br /> I did not get the end! That strange animatronic thing about the red skeleton looked like it was out of film school, which is fine, I suppose, but it could have been more. <br /> <br /> ... and everything with the knife, if it was so uncomfortable, why did not they get rid of it? <br /> <br /> It was very confusing to know when it was the weird Doppelganger thing or when it was DC, or was it Dennis all the time? Because the Doppelganger did with Dennis and Patrick. In the scenes with Patrick, if it was Dennis the Doppelganger, I think Patrick would notice. <br /> <br /> The music was fine, but intrusive in some places, the whole orchestral score seemed to be revolving around a theme, but this theme was exaggerated. <br /> <br /> A great mix of lots of blood and free takes of Drew nude. <br /> <br /> In general, a bit of a guilty pleasure movie by GPM. Do not read much in it, do not look for secret messages and a fantastic script because you will not find it. There are some moments of diamonds and nonsense in abundance. Look at it and you just have a little fun with it!
