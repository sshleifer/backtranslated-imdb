Albuquerque is a film that has all the elements of a Western A class, except one: the story, which really belongs to a class B or C. That was acceptable at the time the movie was made, when people were so excited To see a movie. Of western color, but nowadays it seems very primitive. However, for people who enjoy old westerns, it is entertaining, the original color and sound are saved very well on the DVD that came out recently. Gabby Hayes is a good companion, Lon Chaney is bad as always, and Randolph Scott is a little more cheerful than usual. In a movie called Albuquerque you would expect to see something that reminded you of the city, but the city shown here could be anywhere.
