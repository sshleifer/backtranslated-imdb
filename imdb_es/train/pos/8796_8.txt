['<br /><br /> Everything is relative seems to be the main theme from the beginning for this set of eleven pieces of eleven directors. That is, what could be the number one priority for people like Bush, Blair and Company, may not be for many other people, ordinary people. From the initial scene in which an Iranian teacher is trying to impress her young students, the most important thing that has happened, with the result, the children are not impressed, since the death of a neighbor and things like that obviously affect them a lot. closer. beyond what may have happened in New York, EE. UU., Wherever it is, this series of pieces of almost documentary style establishes that not all things are as equal for all men as some world leaders will try to prophesy. <br /><br /> While, obviously, the attack on the WTC was an unpleasant event for any yardstick, one has the impression that both politicians and television cameramen tend to blow things out of all proportion, wonderfully manifested in one of these pieces. Would the same reaction have occurred internationally if the attack had been in Lagos, say, or Djakarta, say, or even in Rio de Janeiro, shall we say? I prefer to think no. The news seems to suffer distortion depending on where things happen: much more television time is given to an earthquake in Italy, for example, than ten times more destructive in Outer Mongolia, for example. The greater distances seem to diminish the magnitude of the disaster. <br /><br /> This series of eleven pieces helps to put things in a better perspective, or, perhaps I should say, some of the pieces, since each director with total freedom has invented his own story, his own perspective translated, so that it is not possible . judge all the merits, but individually for each segment of eleven minutes. <br /><br /> In no way should be deduced that this is an anti-American film: it would be a too simple reading of the various messages expressed through the segments. However, it is not pro-American either. The eleven segments adopt varied attitudes and the common bond, if it exists, is that the disaster of the WTC attack must be seen in perspective from different points of view. Only then will people like George Bush begin to understand the planet he is living on. <br /><br /> Clearly, in a segment it is a belief of mine that I have been harboring for two years: the United States has not learned the lesson. And the lesson is that EE. UU You have to share this planet with the rest of humanity, not dominate it with relentless economic persuasion or simply with force. Instead of knowing that the United States can not continue to stamp around the world and everywhere, its political leaders, aided and abetted by Blair (and even Aznar) have become even more arrogant and even more intolerant, which is not doing any good to anyone in Afghanistan. or Iraq today, and much less in other places. The mentality of the White House is totally rejectable: the EE. UU And the United Kingdom invaded Iraq and caused all the chaos, so they should clarify the mess they caused, not insist that the UN and other nations deepen with a helping hand and thus find an easy solution. Get out of agitation. <br /><br /> The radical positions adopted by the USA. UU (Or even Israel) will only be confronted by the radical positions of the Islamists, who for years have been preparing a fanatical fundamentalism, if only to cover up their own machista futility, that is, to stone women. or simply wrapping them from the top of their heads to the dusty ground. <br /><br /> The world is in a terrible disaster, fueled by the greed of a few rich countries that seem intent on not seeing or understanding anything from more multilateral perspectives. This film in eleven separate pieces accurately portrays this sad and silly posture.']
