['Prior to this, the defective &quot;Slaughterhouse Five&quot; was the best. But this screen adaptation of &quot;Mother&#39;s Night&quot; is very faithful to the book and maintains the intention of comedy, mystery and tragedy. Fortunately, she was not Hollywood or an idiot to the &quot;Breakfast of the Champions&quot; movie. Another good thing about this movie is that you do not have to be familiar with the book to follow it (as I think you do for Slaughterhouse Five). That probably also applies to Breakfast of Champions, but they did such a bad job that you&#39;d better read the book and not watch the movie. Nick Nolte did an excellent job in this movie.']
