I enjoyed every moment of this beautiful film and I was intrigued by this painter that I had never heard before. So I started to explore his life and work afterwards. As expected, I discovered that the movie was not exactly historically accurate. However, I was a bit surprised by the very negative comments about the film due to this inaccuracy. Come on, guys, a movie is not and should not be a biography (or a novel!). Any historical film distorts reality, because it should be a work of art in its own right. A film director has the full right to use elements of reality and history to create his own world. Artemisia is a wonderful movie and I think it attracted many people (including some who now make negative comments) to explore the life and work of this fascinating artist.
