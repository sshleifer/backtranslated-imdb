A beautiful film, especially if you like horses, World War II movies and the austere Hungarian plateau. A story of courage, compassion and loyalty that transcends generations. The horsemanship is spectacular, as well as the horse of the main characters in their own training. <br /> <br /> I will buy this movie and see it again. This is a family movie and I highly recommend it. A good movie "Family Nite". Although there are some violent scenes, it was the Nazi occupation of Hungary. The natives were very interesting in the way they stood firm even in the face of the death of a Nazi officer who had his own personal reasons to persecute Brady. A disturbingly beautiful film.
