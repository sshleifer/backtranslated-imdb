This is a silent movie better than the average and it's still worth watching if you're a fan of silent ones. However, if you are not yet a fan of the genre, I suggest you try some other movies before seeing this one. That's because the plot seems quite outdated and hard to believe in spots. But, despite this, it's still a good movie and it kept my interest. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, a good lady got hooked on the wrong man and fled to marry him. The movie begins five years later, after she has realized that he is really a brutal thief. Despite this, try to get the most out of it and not insist on how good life had been before this imbecile entered his life. However, the rent is due and there is no money, so the woman is forced to look for work. She becomes a personal seamstress for a wealthy lady whose husband is trying to reach a commercial agreement. Unfortunately, the lady with whom they were trying to gather a potential client for a dinner can not attend and the seamstress is paid generously for the man's appointment. Well, like Cinderella, she cleans up pretty well and the man is in love with her. What to do now, given that she is actually married and the new man wants to marry her? Well, look at the movie to see how everything is resolved. I DID NOT LIKE how they handled the husband, as he seemed terribly predictable and clich√©d. However, once he was out of the way, I admire that the film also did not give up on a numbers finale and left the movie with some loose ends. <br /> <br /> In general, a very good movie that is worth watching, but it's certainly not great.
