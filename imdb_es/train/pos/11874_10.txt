['Probably the best role of Al Pacino. He plays Tony Montana. A little hood of Cuba became a rich and powerful lord of crime in Miami, and he does it with the only two things he has in this world, his balls and his word, and it does not break. &quot;Em for nobody. Doing jobs for a great Cuban merchant, Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia) and quickly climb the ladder of the organization along with his old friend Manny (Steven Bauer) .You will soon have an eye for the sexy wife of the boss, Elvira (Michelle Pfeiffer). After Frank sees a threat from Tony to his position, he tries to kill Tony but with no luck, Tony is upset and nothing can stop him now.The film has a great deal of support among them, F. Murray Abraham as a nervous gangster, Another well-known face is Harris Yulin as a crooked cop trying to knock down Tony, Marry Elizabeth Mastrantonio as Tony&#39;s younger sister, credits to Oliver Stone&#39;s Ecxellent script.This movie is one of Brian DePalma&#39;s brightest points in his long career of ups and downs, you can see that this guy is very talented. The movie looks magnificent. He also pays attention to two memorable scenes: The one in the luxury restaurant (&quot;Good night to the bad boy&quot;). the other is the final shooting where Tony shows that he still knows how to kick his ass and kills about 20 murderers who invaded his house. This is without a doubt one of the most impressive endings of a movie I&#39;ve seen. For fans of Al Pacino and crime movies is a must. For the rest of you it is highly recommended. 10/10']
