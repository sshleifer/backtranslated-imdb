This Italian-French remake of 1986 from the 1946 film of the same name increases the early heat, and does not allow us to take air. The story is about a high school student (Federico Pitzalis) who can not look away from the mysterious and beautiful young woman (played by the Dutch phenomenon Maruschka Detmers) who lives next to the school. One day, he follows her, and his persistence pays off. There is only one problem: she is engaged to a vague character (Riccardo De Torrebruna) who may or may not have committed a heinous crime, and if he repents, they will probably leave him with a pat on the wrist. In addition, the girl is a little "funny in the head", and this is corroborated when we discover that she has been seeing the father of the child, who is a psychiatrist. Giulia's emotional instability is matched only by her prodigious sexual desires. Hot, hot, hot, from the first moment, with attractive drivers and a performance by Detmers, who plays us as a yo-yo (as he does with the boy) from scene to scene, with enough suspense to keep us guessing. Until the end, and even later. Available in R and X (!) Rated versions.
