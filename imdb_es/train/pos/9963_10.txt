I saw this movie when I was a girl. And I have enjoyed it every time. Of course the graphics are a bit corny, compared to now, but in the 70s it was great. I saw it only in the original Spanish version and I thought it was wonderful. That's how I remember that my Christmas was with my family - magic. Santa Claus was amazing and I could not wait for him to return every year. <br /> <br /> If you have a child and you speak Spanish, create them by watching this old version of "Santa Claus". . It's a different version than we're used to today, but who says there's a way? <br /> <br /> It's a fun movie to watch. Teach good children against bad ones. I do not know how is the version subtitled in English or if there is one in English, but Spanish is the best. Enjoy and happy holidays! Merry Christmas!
