This is one of the few movies that I can watch over and over again. If you've never seen it, give it a try. Richard Dreyfus and Raoul Julia are wonderful together and, although the movie really amuses me, it reminds me of Julia's untimely death. It is a good opportunity to sit down and laugh at the international intrigue that is too much for us in these moments of terror and fear.
