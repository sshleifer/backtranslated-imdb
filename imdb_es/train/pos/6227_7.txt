Definitely one of the minor musicals of Astaire / Rogers. It's just very badly drawn and rhythm. Just run a few minutes more than Swing Time, for example, but it feels a lot longer. This is partly due to the secondary romance between Randolph Scott and Harriet Hilliard. Scott is rarely interesting. I like Hilliard. She is sweet, and I love at least one of her songs, "But where are you?" ("Get Thee Behind Me Satan", his other number, is a weak remnant of Top Hat, fortunately cut from that masterpiece). Follow the Fleet would really be a bad movie if it were not for at least three brilliant dance sequences between Astaire and Rogers. The dance competition competes for the first place of any of its numbers. The dance is simply fantastic. "I'm putting all my eggs in a basket" presents the two rehearsing a dance they have not yet perfected. Its imperfections make it even more perfect. And "Let's Face the Music and Dance" is easily one of the best songs of Irving Berlin. So the movie is worth watching for its great moments.
