Dragon Hunters has to be the most attractive animated film I've ever seen. It was amazing. The film is about a couple of rogues looking for some money, their strange furry blue dog that pecks fire, and a girl who dreams of becoming a gentleman, and sends them on a quest to go to the confines of the land to kill the World Swallower, an incredibly immense dragon. But honestly, it does not even matter what the movie is about. Because, it's amazingly beautiful. Gravity in this fantasy world is different, so architectural blocks and earth spheres float between cathedrals and castles and villages alike, and there are forests of floating lilies. The world is so creative, so uniquely beautiful, with a kind of silent storybook. The world looks like a set of beautiful paintings. The monsters are also visually impressive, like a fire dragon made up of a swarm of evil red bats. Part of the plot is not too original, like the main protagonists who want their farm at the same time, from Mice and Men and who never seem to be able to do it in the world; but the magnificent graphics, some really sinister scenes and the dialogue that evokes emotions make this film spectacular.
