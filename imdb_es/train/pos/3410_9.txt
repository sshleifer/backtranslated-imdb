['I discovered this movie after reading the book that inspired it. It is not a strictly biographical film; is &quot;freely based&quot; on the facts. But I found it a fascinating and mysterious exploration of evil and madness, and Michel Serrault offers an unforgettable performance like Dr. Petiot. <br /><br /> There are many memorable images in this movie; Petiot travels through the night like a vampire, his black cloak billowing behind him, is almost iconic. There are also several touches of expressionism: the crooked silhouette of Petiot climbing the stairs that lead from the basement where the remains of his massacred victims await cremation, reminds me of some scenes of &#39;Nosferatu&#39;. <br /><br /> But I found that the main attraction of this film is auditory. The soundtrack is full of sinister sounds, beginning with the music of the initial credits, accompanied by a lament without words. Petiot lives and runs his medical practice in a complex with many small stores, and there is a lingering background noise of knives that are sharpened somewhere, as well as a peddler who plays mysterious melodies in a mountain range. There are also animal noises: the concierge keeps a goat, howling the cats secretly, and later, in the movie, we see a miserable cattle passing through an underpass. The whole environment is disturbing, with nuances of violence and massacre. <br /><br /> Not only are animals often heard, but also human voices: the cries of the victims of the Gestapo, the Petiot patients in their waiting room, monitored by a listening device, just as the suspected collaborators after the war are monitored in their cells. Even the action of the film is often organized so that we can hear the voices of the participants without seeing them. When Petiot goes to see Mrs. Kern, we hear her sing while she works, her voice echoes in the theater, before we see her. . And even when she appears, she is often filmed from behind, her voice calls her husband, whose voice calls her in a conversation. Discarnate voices echo in the large corridors, and when you see their owners, they are photographed at a distance, so we can not see them talking. This is a ghost story, and these are the voices of the ghosts, many of them the future victims of Petiot. <br /><br /> However, Petiot himself is often just a voice; His terrifying laugh echoes when he leaves the camera, throwing comments behind him or in the air to anyone. In a way, it&#39;s a ghost as much as it kills. He is always frantically busy, running from one appointment to another, never resting. But its activity is that of a machine, lifeless and imperturbable. It is interesting that among all the horror and danger of occupied Paris, only Petiot does not fear; He is funny, enthusiastic, angry, irritated, derogatory, but never afraid, unlike those real people he cheats at his death. It is not surprising that he boasts of his mechanical inventions, including a perpetual motion machine (a true detail of the book: he claimed to have invented many machines); He himself is a kind of perpetual motion machine. And the mechanical images are everywhere in the film, from the giant opening wheel in the movie theater, to Petiot&#39;s bicycle (with its squeaky wheels that resonate in the sound of sharpening knives), to the Victrola that keep shooting to play music before killing. . Even his routine with his victims is mechanical: write a note to his wife, let me disguise it before he leaves, he needs a vaccine, Barcelona, Casablanca, Dakar, like a well-oiled machine, the routine is always the same, just like the registration is always the same. <br /><br /> Maeder, the author, says that it was the perfection of the clock of his crimes that weighed so much against Petiot at his trial. His system was as smooth and efficient as a Nazi concentration camp, and this may be the reason why the film invents a secondary argument for Petiot&#39;s involvement with the French Gestapo and the occupying Nazis. Unfortunately, it does not work at all as part of the story, because it is very difficult to understand what Petiot is doing for the collaborators, or what happens when it ends at its headquarters in the middle of the night. Disposition of bodies? Hiding stolen goods? It&#39;s hard to say, and harder to believe; the state is not likely to turn to an independent professional like Petiot. <br /><br /> But it reminds us of the duality of evil people; Petiot is a thief and a murderer, but he is also a devoted father and husband. Just as we learned that Hitler loved dogs and that Nazis guilty of the worst war crimes could also be fathers and loving men, we must also recognize that Petiot could commit unspeakable horrors and still function normally. His madness is easily camouflaged by the madness and horror of the war situation in Paris; when killings, robberies and disappearances occur, nobody pays attention while Petiot throws more corpses into the pile.']
