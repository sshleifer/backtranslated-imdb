['I have seen this movie on several different occasions. I think one of the funniest things is to observe the reactions of the different types of people who are going to see it. <br /><br /> Type 1: OLD PEOPLE. Many old Japanese men and women go to this movie because they believe it will be an honest samurai movie with many games of medieval Japanese swords and dialogues. As soon as the two protagonists begin to debate the horror movies while inserting expletives almost randomly throughout their sentences, the elders leave, generally displeased. <br /><br /> Type 2: FILM SNOBS. These people think that just because a film bears the label of &quot;Independent&quot; is automatically a load of garbage too difficult to follow that may or may not be in English. However, they see it anyway just to sing praises about that later, so that people think they&#39;re smart and cultured. They are really surprised when they see this movie. As soon as the blood begins to splash exaggeratedly from the battles of swords inspired by the anime or the villain exaggeratedly, a dog with its crossbow will nail during a telephone conversation, these people will feel so dismayed that they will leave. Some will be left alone to see &quot;how bad it will be&quot; and then they will comment on the horrible movie that was for their friends. <br /><br /> Type 3: PEOPLE WHO EXPECT TO SEE SPECIAL MATRIX EFFECTS AS LIVE ACTION. I&#39;m sorry, the martial arts are pretty solid in the movie, but director Yamasato does not really have the budget for that kind of thing. <br /><br /> Type 4: PEOPLE WITHOUT EXPECTATIONS. These are the people who really enjoy the movie. Whether you&#39;ve only heard of Blood of the Samurai, chosen it at random or stumbled upon the wrong theater in an alcoholic haze, these are the people who will laugh at all the jokes and appreciate the movie for what it is last instance: ENTERTAINMENT. This movie was not made to enlighten or to provoke a deep spiritual thought, it was made (if I can borrow a line of dialogue from the movie) to &quot;really kick some butts&quot;. And that&#39;s what he does. <br /><br /> Then, depending on what kind of person you are, you may or may not enjoy this movie; however, if you appreciate the movie for what it is and can enjoy an excess of blood and acting, go see this movie and make sure you bring your friends.']
