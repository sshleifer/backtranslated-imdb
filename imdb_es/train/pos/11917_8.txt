Yes, the archetype of a simple but inspiring film. The end, when the whole crowd in the stadium gets up and people raise their hands, it gives me a chill every time I see it. That is simply brilliant. Joseph is wonderful as the lonely and sad child who has so far been disappointed by someone and by anything in his life. The way he interacts with Danny Glover and tries to make him believe in magic and angels is fun and stimulating. A very good family movie with - I grant - a happy ending pretty corny. But hey, it does not really matter, the film retains its basic quality thanks to good acting and inspiring themes.
