Many of the Americans would say ... What? to my opening comment. Yes, I know that my comparison is undoubtedly an insult to the fans of Master Akira Kurosawa, but if you analyze this movie, my comment is correct. We have the peasant who goes to the town in search of help against a band of grasshoppers that wants to steal the harvest of the town. The big difference is the way the story is worn. Our samurai, a band of circus artists as in the original, are a very complex mix of personalities, but in the end they are what the people need, HEROES. Go back to see this amazing movie (the Seven Samurai, obviously) and find another movie that has stolen the story and tried to get the same magical effect as Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece. One tip is The 13th Warrior with Antonio Banderas, Michael Crichton copied the story to write his bestseller, but he did not find the third foot of the cat.
