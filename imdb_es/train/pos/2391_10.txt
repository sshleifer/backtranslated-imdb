My husband and I enjoyed The DoodleBops as much as our 8 month old baby. We buy DVDs and CDs so we can watch and listen to them ourselves. They are fun, energetic, and very entertaining. They encourage children to be active, share and care. They always have a positive message along with fun entertainment. Every time our son listens to the main song, he quickly turns his head towards the television and starts jumping out of emotion. Dee Dee is a wonderful singer, she has a great voice. Moe is a great dancer. I would recommend The DoodleBops to anyone with children. Our favorite song is The Bird Song. You just can not help but smile and want to dance when you hear it.
