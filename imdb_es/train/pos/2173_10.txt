Often, only after the years pass, we can look back and see those stars that really are stars. While that French film critic, whose name escapes me, said: "There is no Garbo, there is no Dietrich, there is only Louise Brooks"; and there, thanks to the heavens! Louise Brooks! This is the third of his European masterpieces. But it is also an exceptional film for being one, if not the first French speaker, for following a script written by the famous Ren√© Clair, for having been completed (the address) by Georg Pabst, and for incorporating the voice of Edith Piaf before that was known! So much talent working in and in a movie, how could it not become a masterpiece ?! And that's what this movie is. It's a shame that Louise Brooks was left with a black ball in Hollywood when she returned to the United States, so much talent so arrogantly thrown down the road! In the film, in addition to seeing Louise Brooks in action, it's great to see photos of Paris ca. 1930 and to listen to the young voice of Piaf. I never get tired of this movie!
