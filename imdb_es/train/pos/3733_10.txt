I had an uncle who committed suicide after serving in Vietnam due to mental problems he experienced after returning. So when I saw part of this movie one night on a pay-per-view channel, it intrigued me. I wanted to know what happened to my uncle and he felt when he prepared for Vietnam. I went out and rented this movie and I must say that it is the most heartbreaking movie I've seen. I bought the DVD immediately after renting it. The way he emotionally attracts you in so many different directions is something that I've never experienced with any other movie. As for the films from Vietnam, I think it's the best, although Platoon comes in second. Besides all that, I think it's also the best performance of Colin Farrell as an actor. I like it in most of his films, but this one was incredible. I gave this a rating of 10 because it's one of my five favorite movies.
