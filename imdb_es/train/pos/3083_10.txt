This deserves a 12 out of 10. An absolutely refreshing show with real characters and real stories. This program needs to come back, I have seen all the episodes and this is of true quality. <br /> <br /> The program focuses on a couple of New Yorkers, playing with the concept of the six degrees of separation and intelligently. interlace their lives. Bridget Moynahan and Jay Hernandez are awesome and so is the adorable Caseman. The landscape is amazing and the cabinets are exquisite. <br /> <br /> We need more programs like this that make viewers feel like smart people and not like senseless drones. <br /> <br /> If he never returns, six grades will be lost.
