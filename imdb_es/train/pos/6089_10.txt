Okay, I overestimated it a little to make up for at least one of those bad-tempered reviews. But I enjoyed it. I did not laugh out loud, but he kept my interest and dragged me without letting me fall at any time. The built history. Yes, you knew it would have a happy ending, this genre always has it. Meanwhile, it was peculiar with visual gags that you could lose, so pay attention when you look. Stiller and Black delivered expertly once again. Good team. They should work together more. I do not know what a cult classic will be, but it was definitely a fun ride. It is not as good as WHAT ABOUT BOB or SCOUNDREL ROTTENCIADO DIRTY but what is it? It is still worth going out of your way to see this movie.
