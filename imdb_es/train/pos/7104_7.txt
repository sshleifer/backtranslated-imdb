Los Debutantes is the story of two orphaned brothers who have moved to Santiago from the south after their mother dies. The confident and street Silvio, the older brother, gets a job for the poor owner of a strip club after bringing the naive Victor to his 17th birthday. <br /> <br /> While Silvio flowers under the tutelage of his boss, both brothers involved with the owner's sexy and manipulative lover, Grace. As the film develops, the characters are redefined as we begin to see the subtle and open ways in which each manipulates the next. <br /> <br /> The film is well made, with good photography and fast pace. It is also quite sexy, with a lot of nudity and some pretty explicit sex scenes. It uses the now popular technique of stratifying different scenes from different points of view, outside of chronological sequence. Many people hate movies like this because they do not understand what's going on: Memento, Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs and many other good movies use this device. The plot itself is not really anything new, there are elements of Body Heat, Pulp Fiction and many other good film noir. <br /> <br /> As the different layers are revealed, our understanding of the characters and their motivations evolve. While the plot may be a little clich√©d, it is also smart and entertaining. <br /> <br /> I would call it a nice movie, it's worth seeing, but nothing memorable. I have not seen many movies from Chile, and it's always interesting to see films from other countries. Apart from that, rent it if it is available, but do not lose sleep if it is not.
