Well, was Morgan Freeman more unusual like God than George Burns? This movie was surely better than the bored one, "Oh, God." I was totally absorbed and LMAO in everything. Carrey was perfect as the imbecile aspiring presenter, and Aniston took his part as the frustrated bride in his usual well-performed performance. I, for my part, do not consider it ugly or without talent. I think my favorite scene was when Carrey opened the file cabinet thinking that he could never contain his life story. Look to see if you can see the file in the cabinet where the humor events of your bathroom are kept: I was reviewing this. Well written and even better interpreted, this comedy will become one of the best of this comedian.
