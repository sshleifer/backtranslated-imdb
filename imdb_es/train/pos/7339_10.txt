Since I heard of Ralph Bakshi's version of "The Lord of the Rings", I was wondering: What the hell is the 'rotoscope' animation? Well ... I finally found out ... Three years ago I saw this movie without having any idea who Ralph Bakshi is ... And I liked it ... a lot ... Very good story ... it even has a little development of characters, which is great for a caricature ... Look at it if you get bored with contemporary animation ... Do not get me wrong ... I'm not saying it's a pretty caricature ... It's a pretty good movie too ...
