This is a great movie that everyone should see. It works like a book by Dean Koontz. <br /> <br /> Bill Paxton's performance was excellent, as it really seems that he believes in what he is saying and doing. <br /> <br /> I do not know. Why do viewers have to read some kind of defense of religious murder in the movie? It's fiction The ending is surprising, but fictional. And that? I think that's what makes this movie so good. SPOILER DOES NOT READ MORE IF YOU HAVE SEEN THE MOVIE. Throughout the film, the viewer is continually surprised by the illness of Paxton's character, the impact on children and the way children handle this outrageous behavior. And then in the end, it turns out to be true. God has set him on a mission to rid the world of demons. Paxton is not clairvoyant as other viewers suggest. Of course, he is given information that he could not have known otherwise, but the film goes further to show how God is "protecting" Adam through the convenient problem of video quality and the total lack of memory of the second agent. of the FBI. The film does not defend Christian murder, it is simply taking the viewer on a very unexpected journey.
