Another exquisite flavor of what should be a superhero movie after Batman: Dead End that simply helps stimulate our taste buds and leaves us wanting more! This is how a true superhero movie should look and feel! Even hard this is a kind of fan movie. The attention to detail, character and action is undeniably real. Although it is a production of limited resources, it puts to shame the big productions "other" related to superheroes, with stellar budget and with stars of stars. Here the main and secondary characters act and appear to be real life people. Finally, a Superman that actually looks "super" and looks like the real thing! Batman the way it should be, without the flashy broken body armor and rubber case to hide squalid bodies for the actors who pay too much and who do not turn themselves in. I only wish that some sensible Warner Bros. executive approve the complete adaptation of this jewel. I do not care if you go to the movies or directly to a DVD, I would never tire of seeing it. Only the plot itself is worth my mass earned for this. I hope that the "big shots" in the Marvel & DC productions take a look and see what a well-produced superhero movie should look like. No more "Batman and Robin" fiasco, or Hulk, Daredevil, etc. Learn from these little directors and learn that there should be no reason to "reinvent" the hero of the movie, only to be "bombarded" in theaters Mr. Collora ... We need more directors like you!
