Having been a fan of 'Columbo', I was deeply disappointed 'Corky Romano'. Although it is certainly a funny movie, the character of the Falk Mafia boss was very far from the adorable lieutenant who has played for so many years, especially with the offensive language he used. After 'Corky Romano', I was genuinely surprised and aggravated by Mr. Peter Falk. HOWEVER, after having seen 'Finding John Christmas' and his predecessor, 'A People without Christmas', for the first time in a week, I have to say that 'Max', the charming character of Peter's Falk in both films, is Surely as memorable and friendly as 'Columbo'. While some parts of the film are quite predictable, such scenes in no way detract from the pleasure of seeing the story depicted. I would also like to have recorded these two moving Christmas movies, and I highly recommend them if you are a Falk fan, a Christmas fan or just someone who enjoys the occasional feel-good movie of the week. This movie may end up lost among the multitude of Christmas movies made for television, so be sure to find "Looking for John Christmas" before it's too late.
