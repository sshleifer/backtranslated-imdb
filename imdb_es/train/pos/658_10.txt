It is not an easy movie to watch: it lasts more than three and a half hours and is composed entirely of conversations. However, it is so incredibly convincing and ruthlessly observational of the human character, which is, in my humble opinion, one of the best movies of all time. <br /> <br /> The film is depressing, cynical and cruel. (If you want something stimulating, see the fantastic Céline by Jacques Rivette and Julie Go Boating, which was done almost at the same time). It shows that the idealism of the late 1960s is no different from the society that was trying to change. <br /> <br /> It is a ménage-à-trois supposedly released between Alexandre (played by Jean-Pierre Leaud), Marie (Bernadette Lafont) and Veronika (Francoise Lebrun). However, it is shown that Alexandre is as chauvinistic and jealous as any other man. Women are exposed as voluntarily served and define their femininity through the male gaze. <br /> <br /> The film is an extremely chilled ending for the highly revolutionary French New Wave. This movement was one of the most significant movements in the history of cinema and had a profound effect on cinema as we know it. Jean-Pierre Leaud was one of the key players in the New Wave, having starred (among other films) in the influential Les Quatres Cent Coups (1959) of Francois Truffaut as a rebellious teenager. The director Jean Eustache is not as well known as other directors of New Wave, but it should be. <br /> <br /> There is no improvisation (unlike the similar films of John Cassavetes made in the United States) and the dialogue comes from Real Life Conversations. The film is resonant with Eustache's personal experiences. For example, Francoise Lebrun was an old lover of Eustache. Eustache himself committed suicide in 1981 and the real-life person on whom Marie's character was based also did it. The anger and bitterness culminate in Veronika's heart-rending monologue delivered directly to the audience, breaking the coldly objective nature of the rest of the film. This fascinating, personal and honest film statement remains one of the most revealing films of human nature.
