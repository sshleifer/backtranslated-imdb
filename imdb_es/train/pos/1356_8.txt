I started watching The Apprentice about 4 years ago (maybe 5) and I really liked it. The first thing that catches your attention is the refreshing format, which, although it is similar to many other reality shows in its essence, is still very entertaining. Donald Trump is wonderful as host and also the main judge of the program. The distribution blow is also appreciated with smart people who have good looks being chosen as contestants. But the best part of the show is the city of New York. Mark Burnett may have made many mistakes in his time, but his handling of cinematography is excellent, since it makes NYC look like a character in itself. The jazz melodies, along with a great camera work, make New York look spectacular. <br /> <br /> The Apprentice will easily always make my three best reality shows of all time (The Amazing Race is number 1, however). But just like in the incredible race, this show always looks better in moderation. If you continue to watch it for a while, the originality of the program will disappear quickly (the same case as with TAR). Star World, the station of this country, did a great job in presenting the program. The first three seasons were shown in a row, then, after 2 years, the next two seasons were shown, which kept the concept fresh. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, you will love this show, especially the first 2 seasons. However, if you continue to watch the program continuously, its charm will disappear and FAST.
