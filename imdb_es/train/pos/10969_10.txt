I knew, but I had never seen Gray Gardens, before seeing the Broadway musical of the same name. The friends warned me that if I had not seen the movie, the musical would not make sense. He did, but he also pushed me to rent the movie. At first, I thought it was a train crash, full of strange and garish characters, and it was extremely difficult to see. But the fact of being able to stop it, digest it and return to it made me realize why Gray Gardens is considered a memorable documentary. <br /> <br /> Both Big Edie and Little Edie are unforgettable and it is worthwhile to witness their total lack of self-awareness. Both remain beautiful despite their age of invasion. They have a relationship that will relax any woman (and certainly some men) and make you reexamine your own dealings with your mother. In an era in which the reality is that television and movies are common, it is fascinating to see the work of the Mayles three decades ago and realize the impact that the film must have had. : How were they allowed to slip into such misery by their family? But beyond that, how could two people living in the 1970s be able to escape reality in such a complete way? Or were they simply considered too crazy to be helped? I would highly recommend seeing this with the comment track, which gave me an additional insight into the movie.
