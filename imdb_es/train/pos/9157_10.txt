Jane Eyre has always been my favorite novel! When I came across this version of the movie in the late 1990s, I was ecstatic! This is the best and most complete version of the book on film! This version is a little long to sit in a single session but it's worth it. Timothy Dalton is amazing like Rochester. I was glad that they chose a normal-looking actress (Zelah Clark) as Jane and not as a glamorous person. I love the sets and the location. For anyone who is a true fan of Jane Eyre, this is the version to watch! For those of you who are interested, I just found this version on DVD. I have seen my copy of VHS almost ready to break, so I was thrilled to find it on DVD.
