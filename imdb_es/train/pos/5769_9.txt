All of you, please fire Todd Sheets!?! Let's give you $ 30,000 to make a movie and see what happens to you! The guy got 735 zombies and a regular cast to work for FREE! Of course, the performance is laughable at times. Yes, makeup is not the best you'll ever see. But it's not the worst either, if you want to see that, go see Zombie Nation with your raccoon zombies. <br /> <br /> This is pure, good and old Guerrilla movie! Todd is an accomplished professional and a nice guy. There are holes in the plot, yes. The plot seems implausible. But what the heck, I still love this movie. I wish Todd Sheets would come out of hiding and do the new version of what he was going to do. If someone has ever tried to make a film, they know that finishing it is an achievement in itself.
