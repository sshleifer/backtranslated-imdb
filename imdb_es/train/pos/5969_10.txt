This movie is a kind of Carrie and Heavy Metal. It is a high school boy who is chosen a lot and takes his revenge with the help of a Heavy Metal ghost. Its a classic. The soundtrack is A ++++. You have living metal legends in it. And Marc Price was great in this movie. This is a must for metal fans.
