* !! - SPOILERS - !! * <br /> <br /> Before starting this, let me say that I had the benefit of seeing this movie on the big screen and having seen the "Authorized Version" of this film, remade by Stephen King, in 1997. <br /> <br /> Both advantages made me appreciate this version of "The Shining", even more. <br /> <br /> Also, let me say I've read Mr. King's book, "The Shining" on many occasions over the years, and although I love the book and I'm a big fan of his work Stanley Kubrick's narrative of this story is much more convincing ... and SCARY. <br /> <br /> Kubrick really knows how to transmit the terror of the psyche directly to the cinema. In the direction of the film And the writing of the script, he himself acquired the title "Wizard" beyond all doubt. Kubrick's genius is like magic. The world of cinema lost a great director when he died in 1999. Among his other outstanding credits are: Eyes Wide Shut, 1999; Full Metal Jacket, 1987; Barry Lyndon, 1975; The mechanical orange, 1971; 2001: A Space Odyssey, 1968; Spartacus, 1960 and many more. <br /> <br /> The Torrence (Jack, Wendy, his wife and Danny, his son) live in the Overlook Hotel during the winter; Jack has been hired as the caregiver. His job is to supervise the maintenance of the hotel during the several months of hard snow, until spring, when the Overlook reopens its doors. It seems that there are many wealthy and tired tourists who flock to the mountains of Colorado for a summer getaway full of snow. <br /> <br /> The hotel was an impressive piece of architecture and staging. It lent itself to the atmosphere, having a dark atmosphere and, at the same time, "welcoming", in itself. The furniture and furniture were all of the period (late 70's and early 80's), and the filmography of the landscape approaching the hotel in the opening scene is brilliant. Not only does it allow you to enjoy the Overlook approach, but it also takes into account how deserted and isolated the Hotel is from the rest of the world. <br /> <br /> The introduction of the characters of Wendy and Danny was a stroke of genius. You get the whole story of his past, Danny's "imaginary friend", Tony, and Jack's alcoholism story, all in this beautiful introductory scene. There was no need to extend the past history during two hours of the film; obviously, Kubrick saw it from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Closing day. Once again, the panoramic walk through the mountains to the hotel (this time, with the family on its back), the interaction between Jack and Danny was very funny while presenting a very disturbing exchange. <br /> <br /> The initial trip through the The view is quite impressive, even when the "staff" is moving things, you have the opportunity to see the majestic chimneys, the high ceilings of the cathedrals and the expensive furniture , the latent and the crown moldings in the architecture. "They did a good job, pink and gold are my favorite colors." (Wendy Torrence) Even the "staff wing" is well designed and beautifully constructed. <br /> <br /> The labyrinth was a magnificent touch, reminiscent of the Labyrinth in which the Minotaur of Crete was the Guardian. When Jack Nicholson stands on the scale model of the labyrinth and looks downtown, seeing Wendy and Danny entering, it's a magical moment; One that tells you immediately, there are heavy energies in that house; There is something seriously wrong, already starting. "I would not like to go there unless I had at least an hour to find my way out." (The hotel manager) <br /> <br /> Scatman Cruthers, like Dick Halloran, was genuine and open in his performance. His smiles were natural and his performance was wonderful. You can really believe that you were there at the hotel, taking a tour of the kitchen with Wendy and "Doc". His explanation of "what shone" to Danny was very good, as was his conversation with the boy about Tony and the hotel. He was credible and sincere. <br /> <br /> The trimming and the panoramic view of the hotel itself, with the mountains looming behind, the cold air spinning around, the fog coming from the warm roof of the snowy hotel, adds a lot to the atmosphere of the movie. It also marks the point "halfway to hell", so to speak; The turning point in the movie. <br /> <br /> The representation of Shelley Duvall by Wendy Torrence was masterly. (WHAT IF she also played with Olive Oyl?) She just shows her wonderful diversity!) Honestly, before watching the movie on the big screen in 1980, I said: "What? Olive Oyl? * Lol * (Popeye it was also released in 1980.) But I recovered it as soon as the movie started, it's brilliant, in Fiend's opinion, this is his best performance, to date (although he loved it in Steve Martin's "Roxanne", 1987) Once Kubrick has established the pearly information that you, the viewer, must be in possession of: Torrence's past, Danny's broken arm, Tony, the hotel's story itself; the fact that Danny is not "mental", but rather clairvoyant, and the overall design of the hotel, all of which is obtained in the first 3 sequences, the film never ceases to scare you. <br /> <br /> two slaughtered daughters of the previous caretaker, Delbert Grady (the girls had appeared several times to Danny, first through Tony at The apartment before the family left for the hotel) were icons with which Danny could identify, and which he feared at the same time. They were harassed (and tormented), themselves and they showed Danny how and where they were killed, in a very graphic and material way. <br /> <br /> Kubrick's Tony was written as an accompanying spirit, as a spiritual guide that he acquired as a result of his arm was almost torn from his body by his own father. It was ... "the little boy who lives in my mouth". It would manifest at the end of Danny's finger and physically spoke through Danny to talk to Danny. I do not like it in the book, I realize, where Stephen King pretended that Tony was Danny's projection as an older child, trying to save his father. Kubrick put aside that little twist and, somehow, made it more terrifying when Tony "took ... Danny ... more". The idea that Danny's older self is projected onto his youngest self is not ... frightening. <br /> <br /> The scene "Woman in the Shower", performed by Lia Beldan (about which I can not find other credits) for having done something before, or since then, since the younger woman and Billie Gibson (who ALSO seems to suffer from the lack of credits for previous or subsequent work), was seductive unpleasant and completely disgusting. It was dramatic, and scary. Abhorrent and terrifying. When Nicholson looks in the mirror and sees his decomposing flesh under his hands; the expression of sheer terror on his face was so complete and REAL. <br /> <br /> Jack quickly embarks on his journey from the alcoholic "jonesing" to a certifiable insane person. The degradation of his character's mental state is carefully documented by Kubrick. Jack's instant friendship with Lloyd the bartender (as only alcoholics, potential mental patients, and drug addicts do) portrays his urgent need for the atmosphere to which Lloyd takes advantage; Namely, alcohol ... "dog hair that bit me". (Jack Torrence) In Jack's case, it's bourbon on the rocks, at no charge to Jack. "Orders of the house". (Lloyd the Bartender) Good word game. <br /> <br /> When the "script" of Wendy find's Jack is nothing but page after page of the same line written over and over again, albeit in 8 or 9 different creative styles. ..when he asks from the shadows, "How do you like it?" and Wendy turns and screams with the baseball bat in her hand ... it's so moving. It's the point where he realizes how messy the situation is ... how disheveled Jack is. It is very scary, dramatic and offers a strong presence. That, along with the visions of Danny from the hotel lobby filled with blood, imposed on the scene between Jack and Wendy, and the end of confrontation of this scene, make this the strongest possible scene of the film. <br /> <br /> Scene "REDRUM". Wow. What do I say? What mother would not be totally scared by the awakening to find her young son and worried about them with a huge knife, talking to that strange little voice, exclaiming "REDRUM" over and over again? Even if it had no meaning, it would still be as scary as the seventh level of HELL. It was something that everyone could (and have) remember (ed). Speaking of memorable scenes ... <br /> <br /> Nicholson's final assault on his family with an ax was perhaps one of the most terrifying scenes in film history. Your line of ads, "Johnny de Heeeeere!" It was a stroke of brilliance and is one of the most memorable scenes in the history of horror. It also goes down in the history of the horror movie. <br /> <br /> The end ...? The end of Kubrick was perfection. I felt that it ended very well. There is nothing to complain about, there are no overwhelming complaints, there is no tearful ending to this movie. Just perfection personified. That's all I'll say on the subject of the end. <br /> <br /> Who cares what was taken out? Look what Kubrick put on. Rent it, look at it, buy it. It's a classic in the horror genre, and for good reason. RAWKS !! <br /> <br /> * Me being me * ... Take this movie and place it in your Stephen King collection, and take the "Authorized" version of 1997 made by King and put it in the children's section. That's where it belongs. .: This movie qualifies a 9.98 of the Devil :.
