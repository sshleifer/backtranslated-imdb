I am writing this after watching The Perfect Son at the Mardi Gras Gay and Lesbian Film Festival in Sydney, Australia. 2002. <br /> <br /> When his father dies, two separated brothers meet at the funeral and after discovering him. They are dying of AIDS, they are entering a journey of reconciliation that heats the heart. The two drivers do a magnificent job of creating the gradual warmth and respect that builds up between them as the film progresses. However, I have a doubt about the film: although the brother who is dying acts sick, it does not seem so. A person of 0 T4 cells would look pretty bad, not even an actor was hired to make the actor look sick. A small complaint, but one that makes it a little less realistic. Despite that small complaint, The Perfect Son is a wonderful movie and if you have the opportunity to see it, do it. I look forward to a DVD release in the near future!
