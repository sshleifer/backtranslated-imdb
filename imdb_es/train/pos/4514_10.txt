I recently saw this movie, on a lazy Sunday afternoon, with a friend of mine, and we had a lot of fun! This movie is a garbage masterpiece. Try to see it for this purpose! It had not been expected, of course, but the performance provided by the actors (and Alberto Tomba is absolutely the best), the weak script and the low-cost budget had created an incredible mix of silly things. Tomba has just retired from the alpine skiing races, where he was a dominant technical skier in the late 80s and 90s. Tomba won three Olympic gold medals, two world championships and nine World Cup season titles. Seriously about the director: nobody knows why Damiano Damiani signed this movie. All the other Damiani addresses are considerable.
