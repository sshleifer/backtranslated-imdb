This is a splendidly made simplistic film that explores a theme and gives each viewer something different that they take away. The premise is simple: a famous actor without a name (Morgan Freeman) decides to look for a next role by visiting a store and observing people. He is especially interested in the cashier in the lane "10 Items or less" (Paz Vega), whom he finds a kind, strong and curious presence. <br /> <br /> Both actors shine with each other brilliantly and bring solid dimension to the characters in what is a character study. It is not a conventional study; each one represents entire worlds. The life of the cashier is immersed in a hard and frustrating "real world," while the actor is so entangled in his fantasy existence that he can not do simple tasks like remembering phone numbers. He readily admits that he is putting on a face when talking to people, and the whole objective of investigating real people shows that he is not one of them. <br /> <br /> But not only the actor is inspired by real people for their work; We also see the reverse process. Several characters recognize "Him" and refer to how he has inspired them with their roles in the film. <br /> <br /> The favorite song of the cashier "Al Pasar la Barca", about how a girl refuses to hide behind beauty and beauty. instead of that, he prefers to pay (that is, to do honest work) for the passage by boat, he could not have been better chosen. It is parallel to the character of Vega, the only employee of the store with intelligence or ambition, who is willing to work hard to succeed. (That is a great aspiration for someone who looks like Paz Vega). It's a strange little movie, probably made with few resources. If you do not mind the slow pace and a "talky" approach, this movie will entertain. The characters are perfectly contrasted, and effective acting makes them attractive. A good watch.
