First, this movie was a wild trip all the way. The history of the formation of the soldiers, fighting with their superiors and, in the end, they are grouped. <br /> <br /> From the beginning to the end. This is a war drama that is worth seeing if you face constant discussion (sometimes beyond reason) and the horrors of what training camps are. <br /> <br /> The dynamics of how the actors interacted were quite surprising at times, and sometimes humorous. How Bozz (Colin Farrel) deals with Paxton (Matthew Davis) throughout history, from the camp to Tigerland, and even in the end helping him. <br /> <br /> The innovative hands-free filming added a certain flavor or flavor to the film. Constant movement, constant action, and constant confusion. Sometimes, it was a help. Others, not so much. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, it was increasingly realistic. Some points of the film (the sex scenes in particular) seemed to be a bit too realistic, although they added an effect to the film that would not have been there without them. It was a very rough movie, from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is one of Colin Farrel's best films (if not his maximum performance). The performance for each character was excellent. 9/10 -sysnuk3r
