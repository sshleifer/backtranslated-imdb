I was surprised that '' The Secret Fury '' was a nice good movie ... Probably because I had no expectations for this movie ... However, the film has its holes. I would say that you could not guess who was behind the whole scheme, until the end of the movie. At first, I thought, it was Robert Ryan, using the same method. like '' Gaslight '', where the husband tries to drive his wife crazy, but I was wrong ... The main problem with the movie is that they drive in a totally different direction, which did not give clues at first. ..... I thought, Robert Ryan and Claudette Colbert took their parts well ... In addition, Vivian Vance, an actress of great character, who steals scenes in this ...... Those who like movies That keeps you guessing, you'll like this ...
