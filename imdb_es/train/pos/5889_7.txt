Alright, I must admit that I've never seen "Rhoda" and only one or two episodes of "The Mary Tyler Moore Show." Even though I do not know anything about this comedic talent duo, I still like this movie a lot. <br /> <br /> Mary goes back to work. Rose tries his luck at being a comedian. Rhoda struggles with a photography career. And Meredith ... what is she doing again? These three stories that we follow for two hours are fun and entertaining in their own way. When the two longtime friends meet, it only improves the movie. <br /> <br /> I was surprised at how good the writing was. The little jokes released by Mary and Rhoda were fun. The script itself was very well prepared. <br /> <br /> I had seen Moore and Harper in other films in recent years and I thought they were very good. But I had no idea that they worked as well as a team. While both actresses do their part to fulfill the title of this film, it seems that they never disappoint me. (During the execution of this movie.) Joie Lenz and Marisa Ryan interpret their roles well, but nothing great. The rest of the cast as Jonah, Cecile and ... everyone else also works well together. <br /> <br /> Being that this is a meeting, one would expect a fan of any of the shows to enjoy this. From a non-fanatic I still enjoyed this little meeting. A good story for each character and the two main characters is what makes this movie very good. (The most recent version of the MTM theme does not hurt either).
