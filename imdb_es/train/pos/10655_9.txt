It seems to be a perfect day to swim. A normal family wants to take advantage of it and take a trip to the beach. Unfortunately, it happens that the father is trapped under a pier and neither his wife nor the young son can help him out of this, while the tide is rising. The woman (Barbara Stanwyck) takes the car and seeks help. <br /> <br /> The short film by John Sturges (69 minutes) is powerful due to unanswered questions. Stanwyck finds a guy who could help, but there is a price that she has to pay for this. There is a double question posed by the film. How far would you go to help the man you love and, on the other hand, observe Stanwyck's behavior towards the stranger, do you really love your husband? Like a good short story, this film leaves the viewer himself with questions that can only answer himself.
