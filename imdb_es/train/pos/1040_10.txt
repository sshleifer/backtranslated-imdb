['Outstanding film of 1943 with Paul Lukas giving a presentation calibrated by the Oscar as the head of his family who returned them to the United States from Europe as the Nazi threat deepened. <br /><br /> The excellent Bette Davis maintains her reputation here and, for a change, was not nominated for best actress for this or any 1943 film. <br /><br /> Finding the treachery around him, Lukas successfully addresses the situation. He knows that he must return to Europe on a clandestine mission and return. <br /><br /> Davis again pulls out all the stops with an outpouring of tears like Katharine Hepburn&#39;s when they must separate. Resolved, she knows that her eldest son should follow him on his path to freedom. <br /><br /> A wonderful movie that highlights positive American propaganda against an evil enemy.']
