I also saw this in a screening last night. I was totally impressed by how much better this movie was than I expected. There are not many films that can combine dark comedy and the drama of current events and that do not collapse in the conclusion. <br /> <br /> I will not bother repeating the plot too much because I think the less you know about this movie. in him he does much better. But I will say that Adam Sandler's performance was really refreshing and real. It was fun and much more fun than most of his most recent comedies. Don Cheadle was believable as always. <br /> <br /> This movie is not funny like Borat or Billy Madison, but it has a good rhythm about it. I would say that 90% of the audience laughed for most of the movie. Halfway through the movie, the speed slows down to address the dramatic end of things and does a good job of putting everything together. <br /> <br /> I also thought it was really cool how, instead of playing with all the black friend / white friend that they chose to just ignore it and focus on the relationships themselves.
