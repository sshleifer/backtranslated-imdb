Listen, I do not care what others say, since Cypher is nothing less than a 5 star movie. Cypher is not, I repeat not, a film B Cypher is an absolute masterpiece. Suffice to say that I am a great connoisseur of the best spy movies in the world and this movie is nothing more than the highest category. I can not emphasize how phenomenal this movie is. Cypher is one of the best spy movies ever conceived and made. The technology in this movie is on the horizon of spacetime. In fact, I must admit that Cypher completely surprised me. In fact, I have recommended this film to my colleagues more than to any other film. Other critics, some of whom played down the film, have no idea what the hell they are talking about. Do not listen to those who hate. And in reality, for the most part, Cypher's reviews have been largely positive. And it should be noted that Cyher is not only a good movie, it is also a fantastic movie. Cypher is the kind of film that is so advanced and so superbly designed that it is out of the minds of most critics and all cynics. There is nothing wrong or cheap about Cypher at all. Once again, the cinematography, the backdrops, technology, history and acting are all 100% first class. Naturally, I will not give anything away. This is not a spoiler. And although it is an opinion of some critics that Cypher should have been in movie theaters, I think quite the opposite. Cypher is a film that seems to have been suitable only for the DVD release and not in a bad way. Cypher has to be the best clandestine spy movie to reach the shelves. Blade Runner, 1984, Brave New World, Total Recall, Logan's Run, Jason Bourne and Impostor and Deja Vu ... beware! Cypher also earns the distinction of being placed in the AONN Multimedia Research, 5 Star Eternal Spy Movie Hall of Fame. Cypher is the counterintelligence in its absolute maximum expression. Hands down and hats outside. Nothing is what it seems and the truth is stranger than fiction. The future is now.
