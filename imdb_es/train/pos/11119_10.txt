There are many reasons why I rate the sopranos so high, one of their greatest triumphs is the cast and character formation. Each character develops more and more each series. In addition, each series has a series of "small time characters" different, as well as the main one. A good example of a character (who was only in three episodes) for which you can feel is David, the compulsive player played brilliantly by Robert Patrick. Every little detail builds the perfect television series. The program revolves around mob boss Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini) who tries to balance his life of crime with his role as father of two. The show is not afraid to be bold and powerful with its dialogue and images, and this is what makes it so believable. While Tony runs things with the capos Paulie (Tony Sirico) and Silvio (Steve Van Zant), his nephew Christopher (Michael imperioli) looks for a promotion. Each episode also introduces Tony's other family in some way, which includes his children and his wife Carmela Soprano (Edie Falco). In addition to these problems, his uncle soprano Junior (Dominic Chianese) is trying to get what he can out of Tony's business despite being under house arrest. All the acting is powerful and the characters are complex, but the two that stand out are: James Gandolfini who is Tony Soprano. Also Michael Imperioli who plays Christopher, representing the younger generation (20-30) in crime. If David Chase had not created this masterpiece, there might not be modern television dramas of such caliber, such as The Wire and Dexter. So the Sopranos are definitely the fiction of the Godfather, Goodfellas and Pulp of TV.
