The best part of An American In Paris is the long ballet sequence at the end, where Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron are the living embodiment of several important painters. Kelly had previously established himself as a pavement artist in Paris, so the sequence is the logical end of a musical full of life and energy, the melodies of Gershwin and cast members such as Georges Guetary and Oscar Levant. Kelly was at her best here: she's a little different from Singin 'in the Rain, and the effect of the whole movie as one of them with the ballet gives her a definite wow factor. No wonder the sequence ended with 'That's Entertainment' after all the other MGM musical highlights had passed!
