I found this movie very good in all areas. The performance was brilliant of all the characters, especially Ms. Stone and Morissey. The character of Tramell becomes more intelligent and psychologically twisted by the minute. Although the plot is interesting, this film is more for the mind that plays between the main characters and how Catherine continues her writing with new forms and twists for her novels. The stage was also fabulous and the whole atmosphere of the film was that mysterious thriller as a masterpiece. Go see this movie now, it deserves something better than what it received from the audience, which was fooled by some terrible erroneous reviews about the movie (even before it started) ... You will not regret it, if you are going to see that .. .
