['Wrapped in beautiful English countryside backgrounds, Emma is a delicious confection to savor in dreamy escapades. <br /><br /> Emma (Gwyneth Paltrow) is an elegant and intelligent young woman who has just married her governess, and confidante, with a marriage of which Emma takes credit in the match. Wanting to use her talent to organize things for the people around her, she decides to match the vicar, Mr. Elton (Alan Cummings) with his rather young friend, Harriet (Toni Collette). <br /><br /> The result is a series of mixed signals and misinterpretations that end up classifying, and Emma realizes that she did not have as much control over the events as she thought. <br /><br /> The film is full of the ingenious and ironic characterizations of Jane Austen. Gwyneth Paltrow is at her best, portraying this maid of a moderate and educated society with ingenuity and ease. His growing romance with the incomparable Mr. Knightley (Jeremy Northam) is the heart of this film. Mr. Knightley is one of the best romantic characters in the movies. He is incredibly handsome, in a modest and relaxed way that is irresistible. It is certainly well paired with Gwyneth Paltrow. Her charming friendship that began when he was 16 and she was a girl, has blossomed as he, a friend of the family, confronts his wit with an older brother form that becomes something more. With an ironic look or a discreet touch to Emma, Knightley from Northam is a pleasure to watch. <br /><br /> Other wonderful characterizations include the comic Juliet Stevenson, Greta Scacchi, Ewan McGregor, Polly Walker and the talkative bachelor Miss Bates, who is very funny. <br /><br /> Apparently shorter and more fluid than most adaptations of Jane Austin, Emma has a comic rhythm that promises true enjoyment.']
