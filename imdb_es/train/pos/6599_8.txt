['On the outskirts of São Paulo, the dysfunctional and hypocritical middle class of Teodoro (Giulio Lopes), Cláudia (Leona Cavalli) and the teenage Soninha (Sílvia Lourenço) have deep secrets. The religious Theodore is in fact a hired killer, hired to kill people in the neighborhood with his friend Waldomiro (Ailton Graça). He has a lover, the very devout woman Terezinha (Martha Meola), and he wants to regenerate, going to the country with her. Cláudia has a young lover, Júlio (Ismael de Araújo), who delivers meats for his father&#39;s butcher shop. Soninha is a common teenager from the periphery of sixteen, who has an active sex life, smoking grass and loving heavy metal. When Júlio is murdered and castrated in his neighborhood, the lives of family members change. <br /><br /> &quot;Contra Todos&quot; is a great Brazilian low-budget film that shows life on the outskirts of a large Brazilian city. The story is very real, it uses the usual elements of the poor area of the big Brazilian cities (drug traffickers, assassins, evangelical religious fanatics, desperate teenagers, etc.), has many plot points and a surprising ending, and the characters have excellent performances , acting very natural and making the story totally believable. The camera follows the characters, giving a great dynamics to the film. In the Extras of the DVD, the director Roberto Moreira explains that his script had no lines, only the description of the situations, and was partially revealed only a week before the start of the shootings. The actors trained in workshops and used a lot of improvisation, being the reason for such a natural performance. My vote is eight. <br /><br /> Title (Brazil): &quot;Against All&quot; (&quot;Against all&quot;)']
