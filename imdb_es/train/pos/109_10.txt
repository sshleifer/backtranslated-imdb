This is the movie for those who believe that cinema is the seventh art, not an entertainment business. Lars von Trier creates a noble atmosphere in post-war Germany that is absolutely captivating. You absorb yourself in the dream and let yourself go alone in the final credits. The plot necessarily comes in second place, but it is still an exciting story with difficult problems that arise. Simply wonderful.
