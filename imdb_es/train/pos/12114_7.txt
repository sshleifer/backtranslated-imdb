This film is obviously low budget and filmed in British Columbia, Canada. The obstacles that had to be overcome for this film to be convincing (set in California and the late 60s and 80s) were well conceived. I think this is the best and most accurate version of the zodiac murders that ravaged the city of Vallejo and the Bay Area from 1968-19? (They never caught him). Edward James Olmos (Det. Dave Toschi) and George Dzundza (Zodiac, at the time he is believed to be Arthur Leigh Allen, as he was approved by DNA and fingerprints) play a crime game of reincorporating cats and mice scenes together, each trying to unleash the other in an emotional revelation.Olmos is dying of some kind of terminal illness and knowing that Dzundza did it, still totally obsessed to the point of losing his family and becoming an alcoholic in the path. Dzundza totally foreign and self-absorbed (like all serial killers) to the carnage that he left behind. The only disappointment was the "exaggerated" ending, otherwise quite accurate. If you get tired of the typical Hollywood fluff or you're interested in the Zodiac case, take a look.
