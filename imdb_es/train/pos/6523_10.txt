Of course, the story in this film was "hollywoodized," but it is far from being the only part of history rewritten for the masses. Lafitte sided with the Americans because he considered himself a Frenchman and, therefore, hated the British, not because of the sense of patriotism of a nation that had taken over New Orleans a short time ago; he broke his agreement and returned to smuggling, which caused his navigation to Galveston; he was more of a mean criminal and a scoundrel than a hero or a braggart. But who cares? This is a movie that is pure fun and, ultimately, we all wanted Jean to go find the wench instead of the prudent daughter of the governor. Brynner, once again, gets up on mediocre writing to give fascinating performance.
