It's a great movie, and it's a shame that it receives little attention outside of circles and students who stay up until two in the morning to watch it on Channel Four. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple but works very effectively, the blurring between childish fantasy and blunt nightmare is very blurry. The budget seems quite low, but for the credit of those involved it is not shown too often. It also has not had much date. <br /> <br /> I was lucky enough to record this on TV a few years ago, and has endured half a dozen visits. It is one of those films that will not attract everyone; Although as usual, those who have a more reflective approach to cinema would benefit a lot from this. <br /> <br /> Charlotte Buerke presents a good performance like Anna, the spoiled brat and it's a shame she seems to have left the acting scene. Cross is also very good, with the stature of his character very well within the context of the image. <br /> <br /> There are some really disturbing moments (and I do not say it lightly) in this movie, both Shocks of half a second and longer tensions. Look at it with the lights off! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended. <br /> <br /> 9/10 <br /> <br />
