Call me stupid, but I loved the 2001 horror movie, Valentine. It was so well done, well written, well acted, well directed, etc.! Everything was wonderful! There were parts that were relatively routine (Lily's death), very funny (www.Bleed-Me-Dry.com), completely creepy and spooky (Paige's death), and just heartbreaking (the first scene). I think the whole cast did a great job, especially the three protagonists: David Boreanaz, Denise Richards (whom I met, and got autographs during the filming of this movie, VERY good people!), And Marley Shelton. br /> <br /> I'm really sick of people calling this movie "another Scream clone". This movie is, by no means, a clone of Scream. In fact, this movie runs rings around Scream. It really makes sense! Scream was not the only movie that featured a masked assassin either. Excuse me, but it seems that Scream was also a clone (ahem ..., Friday the 13th, Halloween, and many other horror movies also featured masked assassins). I also believe that the novelty of Cupid's masked assassin is brilliant. It is so strange to see a sweet face of Cupid doing all these horrible things. Another novelty (nosebleed) opens the way to a fantastic ending! The end gives me chills every time I see it !!!!! So, even if you did not like it the first time, look at Valentine again and give him another chance! <br /> <br /> PS: Stay tuned for my new website (WWW.LOVE-HURTS.ORG)! Soon...
