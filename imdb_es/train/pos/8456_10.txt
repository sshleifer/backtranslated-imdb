I have seen almost all the Gundam / Mech anime that was shown in the USA. UU And this, by far, has the best story. The way in which its plot rotates and rotates has been riveted. Gundam Wing is a series that focuses mainly on politics and war. The series follows a group of five 15-year-old children who have been trained to pilot cutting-edge mobile suits known as Gundams. The Gundam pilots were trained to fight a powerful insurgency known as Oz. As things start to heat up between OZ and the Gundam pilots, new political groups will be formed and the old ones will dissipate. The old conflicts will end and new ones will arise. To obtain peace, the Gundam pilots must face the events that take place in their world and put an end to all the combats. But, how far are people willing to go to achieve their goal? I recommend this anime to anyone who is looking for a program that has a deep plot.
