I really enjoyed the details that were included in the script. <br /> <br /> Jonathan Rhys Myers (poorly written) and Jewel were outstanding in their support roles. Like Jeffery Wright. Toby McGuire did the finest actor job described, when he had to amputate his best friend's arm, knowing that he would die without the procedure. <br /> <br /> Attention to detail, with a good dialectal training to catch the southern accent incredibly well. <br /> <br /> Why this movie was swept under the carpet by Hollywood promoters that I can only imagine. I have strong suspicions. What makes it even more attractive to me. I have delivered a dozen DVD copies for gifts. <br /> <br /> Movie completely overlooked. Rent it or buy it and give it your full attention for a couple of hours, then judge.
