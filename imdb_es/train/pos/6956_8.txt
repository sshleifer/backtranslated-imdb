I have to say that Uma Thurman is the sexiest woman on the planet. This movie was super cute and I mean super cute. It had all the "sex" content that most of Ivan Reitman's comedies have, but with something a little more, CHEMISTRY. Both Uma and Luke have this strange but believable chemistry that seems to transcend each scene. Both seem to create this strange, twisted and interesting relationship with a powerful "sexual" tension that makes you laugh until you can no longer feel your face. Anna Farris and the rest of the supporting cast seem to interpret the roles of others perfectly, and even the rather small role of Wanda Sykes will make you laugh. Although these types of comedies are not for everyone, I have to say that I went with a person who does not usually enjoy these films and who was laughing like a crazy person. This movie is certainly not for everyone. especially younger children, since some moments are too small ... well let's say ADULTS for younger viewers. In general, I was pleasantly surprised by this movie, but the ending I found was a bit weak compared to the rest of the movie. (3 1/2 * of 5 *)
