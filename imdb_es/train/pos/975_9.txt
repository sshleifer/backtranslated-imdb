Also known as the war of the great ghost. The Great Yokai War is Miike's attempt to make a family movie and he also does it very well. The problem is that I can not imagine many parents who want to submit their children to this movie. The best movies for children are those that are scary or have slightly disturbing images, Neverending Story and Return to Oz come to mind, but in the case of the Great Yokai War, Miike probably takes things too far. In fact, in the screening in which the film was presented, the two families reiterated that it was probably not very adequate. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the young hero of the piece introducing himself and explaining his current family problems. This brief moment of worldliness breaks abruptly when a cow gives birth to a calf with the face of a human that screams that something horrible is coming before dying as the abomination that it is (it is very possible that the absolute evil of the creature is some strange homages of Quato). <br /> <br /> Following an incredible introduction to the evil Kato and his henchwoman Agi (a surprisingly attractive Chiaki Kuriyami), through an apocalyptic army. The story returns to normal for a while, but it is not long before all the logic goes down the drain and the young man meets a group of Miyazaki who refuse to take out the evil sorcerer. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film is quite basic and, sometimes, surprisingly trite, all the chosen one seems completely out of place in a film that regularly breaks the clichés, but is assisted by an amazing and simple vision of a magical world. This is actually a Miyazaki movie turned into a live action movie, although it's a much more sordid and vicious Miyazaki movie than usual. <br /> <br /> The movie is simply a joy to watch the designs of the Yokai is colorful, and largely practical, while the monstrous evil robots, although they do not show the best CGI in the world, have a practicality and a threat to them, which gives them a much more palpable threat than you imagine. <br /> <br /> The cast is Uniformly excellent, they only make their characters look perfectly natural, which is advisable if you consider that most of them are in full body makeup or latex suits. Even Agi loaded with a ridiculous hive is presented as sensual and deadly thanks to the amazingly excellent performance of Kuriyami. <br /> <br /> Although the film has many elements that place it firmly in the territory of family films; cute creatures, minor heroes, a completely evil villain, a sense of mischief and adventure, and a lack of obvious violence. There are elements that make you question if Miike should have directed a movie of this type. <br /> <br /> The army of robots is a genuinely terrifying threat. Everyday items became monstrous beasts that look like T-101 without skin and with extra chain saws. . These beasts break the characters into pieces; suck the creatures in their bloodstained mouths and kidnap the children from their homes with a blow just under the nose of their parents before indulging in a small patricide. <br /> <br /> Creation of the creature is equally arduous for young minds. The Yokai, essentially the heroes, feed in a giant furnace filled with a form of liquidated hatred that corrodes Yokai's flesh and forces their angry souls to possess pieces of metal. If the children thought that burning ardently, Anakin was wrong, wait until they see a hedgehog the size of a man burning in a bowl of molten hate for a minute before turning into an abomination of a motorcycle. There is also a cut of limbs, in one case a cut hand contracts in front of the camera that drips blood, a good amount of sexual energy (Agi wears a dress designed specifically for fan service and it seems that she only has to sleep with Kato as a motivation, while the Princess of the Rivers carries almost nothing and the young hero furtively caresses her in various scenes, and humor in general is on the heads of those for whom this technicolor marvel was apparently designed. <br /> <br /> Spoilers An example of this is that the Yokai are only interested in the final battle when they think it's a big party, the later battle more of a festival than anything else, complete with beer, crowd surfing and moshing. In addition, a scene in which Agi overcomes the tar of a cute furry creature, is designed to attract the masses tired by the excess of Pokémon. <br /> <br /> End of the Spoilers At the end of the day, the Great War Yokai is ready to begin. The strongest recent films of Miike. While it lacks part of the perverse charm of Gozu or Ichi, it is simply pushing the public down a path of general madness. In fact, this is easily the most deranged movie of Miike, since it embraces the pure magic of the subject with so much enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing only because of the occasional flash of Gogo's ass.
