Do not give yourself any illusions, this is a story of morality. Granger is the former buffalo hunter with problems, tempted back to the plains once more by Taylor crazed. Granger can see that the end is near, and he deeply feels the cost of the hunt: in the herds, the Indians and the land itself. Taylor, on the other hand, admits that killing buffaloes or Indians is "being with a woman." While Granger's role as tortured hunter is excellent, it is Taylor who steals the show, as the immoral and demented 'common man' for quick money and good times. There is not much bang-bang here, but the story goes fast, and Nolan gives us an excellent interpretation of the character. The theme of this story is so moving today, as in the relationship of man of the nineteenth century with the earth and what is in it, and racism. Considering when this was done, the censors must have been twisting their handkerchiefs during the scenes in the 'children's house', Taylor's relationship with the gravel and much of the dialogue. Although it is weak, this is truly a great image of the west.
