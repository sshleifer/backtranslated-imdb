My permanent love for the Italian actress Lucianna Paluzzi, who helped boost my puberty with her performance in "Thunderball" in 1965, has taken me to some rather unusual places. For example, this British curiosity of 1959, "Carlton-Browne of the F.O.", which presents Lucianna in one of his previous roles. She plays a princess in this, although the image is actually a showcase for the talents of Terry-Thomas and Peter Sellers, both stars whose stars were certainly on the rise at this point. In this beautiful film, often very funny, we learn about the nation of Gaillardia, like Madeira, which had been a British colony until 1916 and was later universally forgotten. Forty-three years later, however, it becomes the center of world attention and international espionage when valuable cobalt deposits are discovered there, and His Majesty sends the clumsy Carlton-Browne of the Foreign Office to be take charge. Terry-Thomas underestimates this part very well, as does Sellers in his role as Prime Minister Amphibulos of the small country. (This was Sellers' second film in 1959 about a small country that combines ingenuity with the world, the other is "The mouse that roared," of course). Ian Bannen almost steals the show here as the gentle King of Gaillardia, and my girl Lucianna is as attractive as she can be in her minor role. The film exhibits a lot of dry humor, although there is some laughter (the reception at the Gaillardian airport, for example, and especially the Gaillardian force parade in the style of May Day). And Sellers' sordid prime minister, with his cracked patches of sweat in English and seemingly perpetual, is another memorable character in the pantheon of this great actor. In spite of the occasional case or two of inconsistencies, British gibberish of rigid upper lip, I found this image as a surprisingly modest entertainment, and well presented in this crisp-looking Anchor Bay DVD.
