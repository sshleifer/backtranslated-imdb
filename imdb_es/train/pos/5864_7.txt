I did not like the now pretentious and overrated apocalypse. Probably my favorite film of the Vietnam War is The Deer Hunter. The Deer Hunter focused on one part of the war and then focused on the lives before the war. This movie is essentially Deer Hunter 2. The script is too loose compared to Deer Hunter. The story has never been developed to the extent that the audience can really understand and feel the characters as the deer hunter did. The flashbacks of Vietnam are not as exciting and involved as those of the deer hunter. That's why I can only give this movie 7 out of 10. <br /> <br /> However, I think the performance was exceptional. DeNiro and Harris are really amazing actors. They immersed themselves totally in their characters and expressed the great anguish of two former friends who lost their best friend Bobby in combat. The character of Harris is a half-dead alcoholic, who hides the guilt he has on Bobby for losing his life trying to save him. <br /> <br /> I also like the cast cast. Everyone in the city is part of the movie. The city obviously can not handle veterans of Vietnam very well. Like many small cities, it's about being calm, humble and taking care of your affairs. The character of Harris, however, can not be any of these things. It is interesting how wars affect people. Some people recover quickly, while others never really recover.
