Quite possibly one of the funniest movies in the world. Oscar material Trey Parker and Matt Stone are very funny and before you see this, I suggest you see "South Park", one of the funniest cartoons created. Buy it, you'll laugh every time you see it. Pure blow of genius. If you do not think it's funny, then you have no soul or sense of humor. 10 out of 10
