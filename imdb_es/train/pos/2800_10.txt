David Beckham is a British soccer star and the husband of Victoria Beckham ("Posh Spice" of the Spice Girls). Your trademark is a goal shot that curves through the field and into the net. The football equivalent of an unsustainable curveball in baseball. "Doubling it like Beckham" means making that kind of spectacular shot. Apart from that, and a small sanctuary for him in the main character's bedroom and a fake cameo at the end, the movie has nothing to do with him. <br /> <br /> The movie is full of little football. - jokes, like the present that one of the parents of the characters gave him a shirt with the number 9 (owned by the great Mia Hamm, to those who know), references to "Posh 'n' Becks" the video tribute to the WUSA, one of the characters plays for an unbelieving friend ("They * have * that ??"), lesbian gags, sports bra gags, etc. <br /> <br /> The story is about a teenager in England who idolizes Beckham and wants to be a football star. She has a real gift, but the two seemingly insurmountable obstacles she must overcome are the absence of a professional women's league in the United Kingdom (hence her fascination with our WUSA), and her parents, who are highly established Indian immigrants. old-fashioned that do not allow daughters, among other things, to participate in contact sports. The family of the girls is presented as figures of ironic fun, but with much affection, think of My great Greek Greek wedding. The girl loves them and respects them enough to go through the hell of the comedies and hide the growing stardom of football.
