['At first, I thought that the ring would be a movie more than normal with its normal plot. How surprised I was! Of course, the plot is simple: a girl is in love with two men, but Hitchcock brings it to us on a silver platter, with laughter and fear, with compassion and anguish. The way she represents the popular crowd at the fair, the strength of the girl&#39;s attraction to both men, the tragic elements that join the techniques that open the mind to most of her best films (North by Northwest, The Rope, etc..). The teacher made it great even before he was thirty!']
