No wonder that this film has won 4 prices, it is a film that persists to anyone, it is not surprising why Paul Reiser took 20 years to finally surrender and talk to Peter Falk about his idea. I can understand every part of this, this is a movie that will make you cry just a tear, or thousands. <br /> <br /> Story: 10/10 When Sam Kleinman receives a letter from his wife about his departure. to find something else, he and his son go on a road trip to find her, and as they do so, they find something lost, friendship, family and affection for each other. At first, you know what is going to happen, but anyway, the story is not so easy to understand from beginning to end, it is a journey between a father and his son, and a husband and wife. No wonder that Paul Reiser took 20 years to write this beautiful comedy / romance. <br /> <br /> Actors: 10/10 Well, you can not say anything more than what I'm going to say, hey, it's with Peter Falk in him, he's a legend: everything he does in the movies is magical When you use Peter Falk in a romantic comedy, what do you think you get? A perfect result, it is not surprising that this film is perfect and has won so many prices. As the son Paul Reiser does an excellent job, although he is not always a great actor, that does not mean that this has not worked. Peter Falk and Paul Reiser play the perfect Father and Son, the rest of the cast is good. It's enough, but you do not see them that much, so you just say they do what they must to make this shine even more. <br /> <br /> Music: 10/10 It does not always work when music is used, sometimes it just does not fit, but it's not what you see in this movie, the music is perfect in tune, it makes the movie still more convincing This part of the movie will look as good as the other parts, a great soundtrack for a romantic comedy, that's for sure. <br /> <br /> In general: 10/10 There are so many romantic movies / comedies going on Cintas, DVDs, Blu-ray and what not, but this movie is one of the specials. it does not happen every day that you can create a story like this, you've been thinking about this for years and the fact is that actually what it took to make it, a great piece that should be bought and preserved in the human soul, see it as you get older and what You see with your father in old age, I think that then this film will shine like no other.
