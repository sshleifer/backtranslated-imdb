JUST CAUSE is a defective but decent film held together by solid performances and some creative writing (although highly predictable). Sean Connery is a crusader against the death penalty that is carried out to save a seemingly innocent black youth (Blair Underwood) from maximum punishment. To fix things, Connery ventures to the scene of the crime, where he must deal not only with the passage of time, but with a meddling sheriff (Laurence Fishbourne). The twists and turns and changes of roles abound, some are surprising, others not, as the old crusader tries to unravel the mystery. The climactic end is a bit ridiculous, but it's worth taking a look on a slow night.
