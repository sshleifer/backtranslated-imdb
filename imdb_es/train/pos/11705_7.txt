Obviously, there was not a big budget for this movie, which definitely hindered production. But the story and the ending were so brutal that they compensated a lot. I mean brutal at the level of Ju Dou and other (great) Chinese films. I saw it for the first time when I was 14, I ran home and begged God to forgive me for everything ...
