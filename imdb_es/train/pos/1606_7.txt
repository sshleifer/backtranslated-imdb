The "adult-directed movie" is a rare thing these days, but Moonstruck does it well, and it's still a better than average movie, which is aging very well. Although the comic moments point lower than the rest, the film has a marvelous specificity (Italians in Brooklyn) that is not accustomed to exchanging characters or spectators. (That is, mobsters never appear in an application, it never becomes grotesque like My Great Greek Wedding). The secondary lines are economically counted with short scenes that allow a break of the main thread. These are the scenes that are now missing in contemporary films where their immediate value can not be impressed in the producers and the big shots. I miss these scenes. It also wonderfully involves older characters. The film takes its own light and silent path to reach a conclusion. There is not a badly written scene included anywhere to make some executives relax from the sphincter. Cage and Cher do a very good job. <br /> <br /> Moonstruck invokes the old school, the ethnicity, the work of New York, very similar to 'Marty', except that Moonstruck is much less dangerous.
