I have not read this book, but throughout the film I was amazed with just one thought in my head: This is so Vonnegut. I have never seen an author, all the intelligence and life behind the workings of a novel, translated so well into cinema. This film had the same complexities found in Vonnegut's novels: jokes were often meaningful and symbolic, and dramatic events and symbols were often jokes too. <br /> <br /> Campbell was also a very Vonnegut character, perfectly represented by Nick Nolte. It had all the characteristics of a "hero" of Vonnegut: the lack of concern for political limits, the dark and ironic humor that gives way to stupid inactivity in response to stress, and the unwillingness to push his version of reality to those around him. <Br /> <br /> In general, I was constantly surprised and impressed while watching this movie. It was the same feeling I had when I read "Cat's Cradle," my first Vonnegut novel, as if it were the strangest thing that could happen, he thought about THAT, and he made it real and important. Yes, he has nothing but army surplus "White Christmas" albums. So go!
