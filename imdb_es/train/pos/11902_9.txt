This film tells the life and times of William Castle. He made a series of low budget horror films in the 1950-1960s that he sold with tricks. In "13 Ghosts" you need the viewers to see the ghosts (they were in color, the movie was in b & w). "The Tingler" had seats in the theater equipped with a bell that shook the audience when a monster escapes to a movie theater. "Marabre" issued a life insurance policy for all members in case they were scared to death! The movies themselves were pretty bad, but the tricks had people running to watch them. In this document there are interviews with directors inspired by Castle, actors of his films and his daughter. He also gets into his family life and the kind of man he was (by all accounts, he was a great guy). The documentary is affectionate, very funny and absolutely fascinating. It is very short (less than 90 minutes) and there is never a dull moment. A must for fans of the castle and fans of horror movies. My only complaint: very few sequences are shown in your photos. That aside, this is just great.
