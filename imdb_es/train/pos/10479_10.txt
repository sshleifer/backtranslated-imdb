This is a movie recommended by my dentist, and I'm glad he did it! The mixture of British humor (should I say, humor?) And the reality of a lost and middle-aged widow trying to maintain her lifestyle were a real problem. Add to that mix the reality of what it takes to grow a pot (those plants under the bushes would NOT do it without the TLC they received), and it's a truly hilarious, but moving film. I laugh every time I evoke the vision of all the bar patrons sitting in their garden chairs with sunglasses while they count the lights! Maybe it's just the blood of my Mendocino county, but the British definitely understood it well !! 10/10
