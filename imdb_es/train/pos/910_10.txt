It is nice to see Suraj Barjatya again in what is best. A story woven around a marriage. It feels good to have a movie in which there is not a single scene that you would avoid seeing with your family. Although the story is simple and does not contain any new elements, you still like the movie, due to the presentation, the presentations and, actually, the general treatment. Congratulations to Suraj. The film is about the fact that commitment leads to love. The description of the changes in the way of thinking, behave once you commit yourself is excellent. The director has definitely thought about it a lot and the actors have done it perfectly. Although the movie is slow, you do not care, because you get so involved in the story that you just want to continue seeing the joy of this new committed couple. As a typical material of RajShree, it has many sentimental scenes that make the spectator break to mourn (especially the ladies). But when you leave the movie theater you are very satisfied and you feel that the ticket was worth :-).
