This was one of the funniest and most informative shows I've seen. This is a must for anyone over 16 years old. This show made me and my two kids laugh out loud from the beginning. I do not know if everything in the program was true, but the way it was presented left little doubt that Mr. Wuhl was not only very knowledgeable, but also had fun presenting this information to the lucky college students who attended. If Mr. Wuhl ever decides to redo this format, he will have to rent a building the size of the Georgia Dome to house all the people who want to see it. I agree with the idea of ​​making this a series of HBO. I would have an incredible follow-up.
