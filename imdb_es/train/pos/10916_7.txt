['The comic joke between William Powell and Jean Arthur is the highlight of this murder mystery, which has one of the strangest and most unlikely plots in history. Powell is probably the smoothest detective of the 30s, and Arthur has a unique voice that often sounds like a succession of tinkly little bells. They are very fun to watch, so take the brazenness of the plot with a grain of salt and just enjoy watching how it develops. Eric Blore also has some comic twists like Powell&#39;s butler. <br /><br /> Powell&#39;s contract with MGM included a clause that allowed him to refuse the loan to another studio, but he wanted to work with Arthur again and he liked the script, so he accepted the task with enthusiasm. They had worked together on two Paramount films from 1929, The Canary Murder Case and The Greene Murder Case, both in the Philo Vance series.']
