The Ladies Man laughs with laughter, with a very diverse cast, in addition to having some very stupid but excellent scenes (including the funniest love song ever written). <br /> <br /> Ferrell is his usual quality in a brilliant supporting role. <br /> <br /> Tim Meadows plays an idiot surprisingly well and has written some of the funniest lines you'll find in any comedy out there. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth it A purchase like seeing it every 6 months or so will keep you laughing as hard as you did the first time. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to think that, at the time of this writing, this has a minimum level of 4.7. / 10 and I urge you to vote! <br /> <br /> And remember the children: "There is more movement in the ocean"
