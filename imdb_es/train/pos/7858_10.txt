TESS OF THE STORM COUNTRY is possibly the best movie of all Mary Pickford films. At two hours, it was quite long for a silent film of 1922, but still maintains its interest some 80 years after it was filmed. Mary offers one of her best performances at times. The role seems a "big hits" performance with fragments of Mary the innocent, Mary the little demon, Mary the little mother, Mary the spit, Mary the romantic heroine, etc. features that were often used throughout a single movie in the past. The film is surprisingly frank about the illegitimate son of a secondary character for 1922 and, at one point, our little Mary is the single mother in question! If the Academy Awards had existed in 1922, undoubtedly the Oscar for Best Actress of the year would have been Mary's.
