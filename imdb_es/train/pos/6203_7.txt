A wonderfully peculiar movie with enough twists for a sack of cookies. Parker Posey plays Fay Grim as a sexy, vulnerable and loving mother who may or may not be what she seems. The story is very ironic, and the dialogue skillfully underestimated. Suggestions of humor and intrigue, none of which surpasses the characterization that Posey achieves. The supporting cast is stellar. The low? This movie needs your full attention, almost to the point of stopping the movie and taking notes. Posey has more sex appeal when raising an eyebrow than most actresses throughout her body. She is worth your time, even if you do not understand the outcome.
