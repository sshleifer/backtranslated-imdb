First things first, this movie is incredibly beautiful. A person who works in CG movies in 3D as a lighter / composer, the images shocked me. Every second I was surprised what was on screen As for the story, well, it's fine. It's not going to set the world on fire, but if you like the futuristic tales of Blade Runner-esquire (and who does not?), Then you'll be fine. <br /> <br /> I have to say that he felt the voice acting was particularly bland and detracted from the film as a whole. I saw it at the movies in English, but I hope there is a French version somewhere. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing.
