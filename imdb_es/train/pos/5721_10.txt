I'm not sure I understand what these enthusiastic people are talking about against rancor, maybe some people like to rant about things. <br /> <br /> The film was certainly imperfect (irregular performance, others may have had difficulties with the time changes, the actors are very willing to go to places that I would really prefer not to go, etc.) but In my humble opinion there were some things that made up for the imperfections. <br /> <br /> First of all, I LOVED the 'breaking the rules' bit. Normally, when you leave the haunted house, the bad guys leave you alone, giving you time to regroup, get friends and find the mysterious paranormal type of token. NORMALLY (semi-spoiler alert) when you hide under the blankets, they can only go through that small opening that you can see. NORMALLY, in the end, the ghosts have somehow become less creepy because you have discovered that they have simply been misinterpreted, or have been liberated, or whatever. <br /> <br /> Second, the production was exceptional. Although the film was not loaded with special effects, the supernatural fragments were brief, but very well done. <br /> <br /> It's probably not the best kind of movie for those who think that Freddy and Jason are the last kind of horror (nothing against them, they have their place), but excellent for those who have started to Take conventions for granted and have no problems with time distortions.
