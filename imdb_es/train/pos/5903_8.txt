I liked this kind of movie that reminded me of my marriage. It is very clean you can see it as a family. Very well done. The songs are good too. I think the writer's director is great. The film shows how marriages progress through time. They have couples in different stages of life and relationships in their life. The film beautifully describes several stages in parallel in the same story. Some of the dialogues are pretty good. The film shows complex human emotions very well, not with excessive dramatization. It is also perfect, after all it is not so perfect. It shows very well the dynamics of marriage arranged when it is new. The movie is very well written and directed.
