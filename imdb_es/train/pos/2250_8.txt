This is a wonderful movie about the struggle of the Mormons and their final settlement in Salt Lake, Utah. The beginning and the end are especially powerful, and the message is one that we all must remember: God does not speak, but he communicates, if only we listen. As I write this in the midst of the horrors that are happening in New Orleans and the surrounding area due to Katrina, the Mormons especially moved me to have to leave everything behind and move on after Joseph Smith was killed. People came to this country to escape religious persecution and, however, could not. The struggle of the Mormons to cross the country, the cost in their lives, the difficulties they suffered was really impressive, demonstrating their tremendous strength. In regard to the real beliefs of Mormons, this is not very widespread, and polygamy is mentioned, but it is not a centerpiece of the film. <br /> <br /> The cast is top-notch, although others have commented on more about the real characters and can talk about how true the portraits were. But as actors, Dean Jagger, Mary Astor, Brian Donlevy, John Carradine, and Jane Darwell do it excellently with the script they were given. <br /> <br /> Although the film could have stood on its own (and certainly does) today) Tyrone Power and Linda Darnell were added to the cast to draw the crowd to theaters and see a movie about Mormons. The power is magnificently handsome as a young Mormon, and Darnell, like Zina, is not a Mormon, but stays with the family after they kill their father. The power does not have much to do until the end of the film, when it has a great scene, and Darnell (still a teenager at the time of filming) has even less, although they form a lovely couple. His fate is not clear with respect to his conversion, and one wonders about polygamy in his case. However, you can not beat either of the two for the candies.
