['Without compromises is one of the best performances of Carlos Mencia to date. Mencia is known for annoying and making fun of racial problems. However, he does more than that in this presentation, which took place in San Francisco. In general, Mencia&#39;s material not only makes you laugh, it also makes you think about what is really wrong with today&#39;s society. <br /><br /> In this one-hour performance, Mencia talks about things like illegal immigration, what women really mean when they ask for equality in the workplace, terrorism, their opinion about Mel Gibson&#39;s Passion of Christ and an argument what he had with a woman in relation to whether he is affected or not by Jesus, and how society should treat those who have physical or mental disabilities. Mencia even discusses whether one should have the right to speak and tell a joke. <br /><br /> Carlos Mencia is not afraid to offend, which often causes him problems with his critics. For example, he goes a little far (and admits it) with a joke about Pope John Paul II and what he is probably doing in heaven right now. <br /><br /> The main message of Mencia in all her performances is that we all have a voice and that we must use that voice to speak what we feel and not be afraid of offending. It reminds us that we have the right to freedom of expression and that we should use this right as Americans. <br /><br /> If you enjoy this presentation, I definitely recommend watching Mind of Mencia, your program on Comedy Central.']
