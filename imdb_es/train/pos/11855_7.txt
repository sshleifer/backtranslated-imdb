Wow. Something of surprise. Although with faults, it is much better than I expected. <br /> <br /> The new Arcturus space with some 3,000 passengers is in the final days of its sixteen-day trip to Jupiter. Without warning, the Cerebral of the ship (central computer) sounds a disaster alarm and orders everyone to evacuate. <br /> <br /> Soon, there are only a few people left, including one of the ship's astrogators (Penny), the captain (Cary) and the shipping line manager (Kenyon). <br /> <br /> It turns out that the alarm was false and that the main Cerebral is acting <br /> <br /> erratically. The remaining passengers and crew must escape the ship and <br /> <br /> avoid personal conflicts to survive. <br /> <br /> The movie starts very well. The opening announcement is a very nice touch. There are obvious parallels with regard to 2001: a space odyssey and the historic sinking of the Titanic. The film slows down at times and has rhythm problems <br /> <br />, but in general it is well made and well acted.
