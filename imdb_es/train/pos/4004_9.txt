"The mother" is that extraordinary piece of the movie: it makes you think, it does not hit you, and ultimately it leaves you thinking. Very open as to the fate of the main character. Anne Reid (who I only knew briefly about her appearances on some projects directed by Victoria Wood and I thought she was a good comedian) is really excellent here. It was not the stupid widow housewife who was perfect in marriage and motherhood at all. And not all that free and adventurous spirit at the beginning. She plays her character only with the right note that sounds true (well, it seemed to me). Powerful cast Great screenplay Renaissance of European cinema in effect;)
