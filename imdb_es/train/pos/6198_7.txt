I'm one of those people who would crawl a mile through broken glass to watch a Hal Hartley movie. From TRUST and IRIS to HENRY FOOL and (my favorite from Hartley) WITHOUT SUCH THING, Hal's unique brand of films is an acquired taste. Infuse equally mystery / espionage with tenuous comedy seems to be your forte. Comedy is not necessarily in your face, and it often runs through a whole scene before it comes to fruition. And that is the case of FAY GRIM, the sequel to Henry Fool. <br /> <br /> Parker Posey plays Fay Grim, abandoned wife of Henry Fool and mother of Henry's only son, Ned. Fay lives a quiet life until one day she arrives home to find a CIA agent in her kitchen. His name is Fulbright (Jeff Goldblum, MAN OF THE YEAR) and he wants Henry's notebooks. There are many notebooks by Henry Fool and previously it was believed that they contained nothing but crazy bums. Apparently there is much more for them. Secrets of investigating weapons or roads to terrorists? Who knows but Henry. Agent Fulbright tells Fay that her husband is dead, but this is quickly assumed to be a trick to get Fay out of his house and look for Henry (and it works ... but not as they think). <br /> <br /> Fay fights multiple rings of spies to gather Henry's notebooks and look for him. He also makes a deal with the CIA to get his brother Simon (James Urbaniak) out of prison (he helped Henry escape the country in Henry Fool's original film). Several events overlap in rapid succession: the rings of spies shoot each other to death, it is discovered that Henry is held in "security" by a jihadist, Fay frees his brother but, unknowingly, risked the life of his son , and the CIA gets its due for putting Fay in danger. <br /> <br /> Obviously, Hal Hartley loves to play with themes. And he does it to the extreme here. Even the names of the characters (Grim, Fool, Fulbright, Fogg) have implicit meanings of their own that are quite funny. Ol 'over-the-top spy movies also have a lot of screen time, since the weapons shine in stop-motion sequences, they never hit our heroine even though she is right in the line of fire. <br /> <br /> Now that I have praised this creation, I will say that Parker Posey's excessive representation of Fay Grim is not the best part of the film, which is a shame, considering the time it is in screen. I realize that this was probably what Mr. Hartley wanted: a gutsy woman with hand gestures on the Italian end. But it was still painful to see him sometimes. <br /> <br /> Even so, fans will probably devour Fay Grim and beg for more. Although this was not my favorite Hal Hartley movie, I know I'm ready.
