First we saw this film as part of a festival of new Argentine films in 2000 at the Walter Reade. Although we liked it, we did not find it extraordinary. When we see him for the second time, we find a different meaning in this vision of life in Buenos Aires. <br /> <br /> The film takes place on one of the darkest days in Argentina, as the DeLaRua government was ending. The country was in crisis after the economy, which had flourished in the early 1990s, under the artificial climate created by President Menen. It was a time when bank accounts in dollars froze and people became a nightmare. <br /> <br /> The story begins just as Santamarina, a bank employee, is fired due to the collapse of the economy. Instead of receiving sympathy from his wife, she leaves him outside the apartment and he, for all practical purposes, becomes a homeless man. Go out to the street to make ends meet. <br /> <br /> The other story introduces us to Ariel, a young Jewish man, interviewing for a job at a Spanish company. It's almost a miracle that I get the job. His father, Simon, owns a small restaurant in the Jewish neighborhood of "El Once" in the center of the city. Things go from bad to worse, when Ariel's mother dies suddenly. Only Estela, the young woman who is in love with Ariel, comes to help father and son. <br /> <br /> Santamarina, who is a clean man, has to resort to showers where he can. He chooses a ladies' bath in one of the subway stations. When the assistant, Elsa, finds him naked, she becomes furious, but regains consciousness when she realizes the unhappy circumstances of this man who has seen better times. They get romantically involved, and Santamarina on one of her trips through the trash of the street, finds a baby. Elsa, although surprised, wants to do the right thing. But Santamarina convinces her that the meaning of an innocent life in their lives will cement their love. <br /> <br /> Ariel, who has met the beautiful Laura at work, begins a turbulent and heavy sexual relationship with her beautiful partner. The worker, who is unknown to him, is involved in a lesbian affair. Ariel, who is free to photograph weddings and other occasions, feels passion for Laura, but realizes what Estela has sacrificed to help her father and still loves him. <br /> <br /> Daniel Burman, whose "The Embrace Party" we thought was excellent, did wonders with this movie. Things are put in their proper perspective after a second visit recently and we must apologize for not having noticed it the first time. In any case, this second time, the nuances of the screen work that Burman and Emiliano Torres wrote, make more sense because they reflect the agitation of what the country lived during those dark days. <br /> <br /> Daniel Hendler, who plays Ariel, has collaborated with Mr. Burman before getting surprising results. He is not a "pretty movie star", however, he is handsome. This actor projects a tremendous sincerity in his work. Enrique Pineyro is another magnificent surprise. Your santamarina is disarming. Despite all the bad things that have fallen on him, he maintains an optimistic attitude towards everyone he meets. Stefania Sandrelli, the interesting Italian actress, makes a great contribution to the film with her Elsa. Héctor Alterio, one of the best Argentine actors, plays the small part of Simón. The beautiful Chiara Coselli is seen as Laura and Melina Petrielli appears as the noble Estela. <br /> <br /> "Waiting for the Messiah" shows that Daniel Burman is a voice to be considered in Argentine cinema.
