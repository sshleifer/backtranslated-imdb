It is true that you always remember what you were doing at a time of disaster or tragedy. And nothing more than September 11, 2001, a date that changed the entire world landscape in its fight against terrorism. <br /> <br /> No, this documentary was not meant to be a dwelling in the events that led to 9/11. Rather, the filmmakers, the brothers Gédéon and Jules Naudet, set out to make a documentary about the tests and tribulations of a rookie firefighter from New York. They had gone to the academy and had done some training shots, and had carefully chosen their "proby" (parole firefighter) to join them at a New York fire station, home to the Escalera 1 and the Motor 7. But his production had to be developed and contained in that place. It was believed to be the only photo of the first plane to crash into the World Trace Center. <br /> <br /> I was traveling with a friend on a LAN game night train and I received a call at approximately 850 p.m. local time of my dad, who informed me of the above. A few minutes later, he told me there was another, and that the WTC was under attack. When I got home, the upper floors of the twin towers were on fire and smoke, and to my horror, they collapsed, in less than an hour. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers had two cameras running that day, one who had followed a team on a routine call, and who immediately ran to the WTC when listening and watching the plane crash into him. We follow what is possible: the only sequence of events filmed in the lobby of WTC1 where the first responders of firefighters, paramedics and police had to make sense of what happened and quickly develop an action plan. The other camera, supported by the other brother, went to the WTC to look for his brother, and during the trip, he captured the many expressions of New Yorkers, as well as the sense of chaos in and around Manhatten. <Br /> <br /> Throughout the documentary there are numerous interviews with the men of Ladder 1 and Engine 7, who, miraculously, did not suffer any loss. But being survivors also caused their own psychological confusion, as they struggle to reach an agreement with the event. Through the events that take place, we learn from the strong camaraderie among these men who risk their lives every day in their jobs, to save lives. <br /> <br /> We started with what was supposed to be the documentary, before the events of the day were totally abated and became the center of attention, until the rescue phase, where the men who work around the clock of the day to make sense of the collapsed steel structures kept alive the hope of finding survivors under the rubble. It's not a fabricated movie, and what you see here can not be recreated in any other documentary (and heaven, no sound stages for Hollywood blockbusters). It is the closest you can get to that day, witnessing the event from security. <br /> <br /> The Code 1 DVD contains an additional hour separated from 4 sets of interviews with Ladder 1 and Engine 7 men.
