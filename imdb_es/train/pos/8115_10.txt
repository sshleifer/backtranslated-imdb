The first 2 parts seek to reduce to the absurd the increase of useless wars and the government of the nationalist barbarians. The third part speculates that progress and exploration towards the Moon and beyond is the key to ensuring meaningful use of talents and human resources. He has speeches that some spectators dismiss as naive or grandiloquent, but which make others shudder with emotion. It represents a space weapon / launcher and a helicopter, along with inventive mass communication devices, elevators, flat panel displays and wireless intercoms. It's probably wrong about buildings with no windows in the future. But it represents a child's vision of unlimited scientific / technological research. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, it is a film about a group of rational-minded thinkers guided by a morality similar to that of Spinozean in his quest to immortalize themselves and live ethically through scientific advancement and a government unified world The characters that promote progress (like the two Cabales) believe that humanity could "live forever" by preserving our experiments and progress for future generations, always leaning on our humanity as if it were on the shoulders of giants. <br /> <br /> Arthur C. Clarke (author of 2001: A Space Odyssey) suggested this film to Stanley Kubrick as an example of an excellent SF movie. Kubrick hated it and said he would never see another film based on Clarke's suggestions (source: Clarke's special introduction to his 2001 novel). Although the late Clarke kept suggesting it at the top of his list every time someone asked him about the best SF movies. It has a beautiful Menzies artistic design, but mediocre special effects (especially toy tanks). <br /> <br /> Personally, I loved it and I think it captures the spirit of modernity in an excellent way. He is a little naive about the plausibility of creating a society without crime for a prolonged period of time. It also seems implausible about the inevitability of progress. It seems to me that we could easily go back to the dark ages or at least be so stuck in the science that we are killed by overpopulation or our inability to escape the next great natural disaster. But it portrays very well the importance of taking risks against the public and nanny's outrage at the potential threats of accidents and space deaths. It challenges us to choose the side of progress over the petty desires of safety, comfort or happiness: <br /> <br /> CABAL: "Too much {rest} and too soon, and we call it death, but for MAN there is no rest. and there is no end, it must continue - conquer beyond conquest, this little planet and its winds and roads, and all the laws of mind and matter that slow it down, then the planets that surround it, and finally extend through immensity to the stars, and when I have conquered all the depths of space and all the mysteries of time, it will still be beginning. " <br /> <br /> CABAL: "If we are nothing more than animals, we must catch our little remnants of happiness and live and suffer and pass, no matter what, as all other animals do, or have done." {Point to the stars.} "Is that, or this, the whole universe, or nothing ..." (quotes from the script). <br /> <br /> If this sounds like a rationalization for devoting the entire society to progress, then the members of the (world government) council will look like technocrats. But in reality these "technocrats" allow their citizens to become artisans or pursue other passions freely, and they would have to be repressed by government prohibitions, laws against science and experiments, and other restrictive mandates and uses of power that would turn to its critics in tyrants. . <br /> <br /> In fact, a large group of rebels in the plot feels underestimated by all the council's science and technology developments, so they try to stop the progress and the end of the council's freedom of experimentation . However, the progress-oriented council will not suppress the freedom of expression of the rebels, it will only prepare its 'gas of peace' in times of emergency and simply wishing that freedom and space pursue its progress. <br /> <br /> So, it's also a story about the freedom to do science, as well as about the wonders of progress. Many people in our society would really agree with some of these basic premises, except in cases of social bias (many want to ban cloning, for example) or naturalism (some do not want us to move forward freely, and we would prefer that we become extinct to its due time while we are enslaved on earth) or fear / reason (some believe that we are not ready for advanced science / technology since we can destroy ourselves). But Cabal (the president of the council) has an answer to the problem of danger: "Our (scientific) revolution did not abolish death or danger, it just made death and danger worthwhile" (script).
