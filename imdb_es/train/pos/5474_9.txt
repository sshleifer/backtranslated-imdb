On July 10, 2005, the National Gallery of Art showed the original uncut version of this long-lost film. Restores vital scenes cut by the censors at their launch. The character of the shoemaker, an individual of moral goodness in the original censored version of 1933, is presented here as a follower of the philosopher Nietsze and urges her to use men to make her way to the top. In addition, the cheesy ending of the original that I assume is in the current versions of VHS is deleted and the ending is restored to its original form. A wonderful movie of seduction and power. With luck, there will be a reissue of this film on DVD so that everyone will appreciate its great qualities. Search it.
