If you have trouble dreaming, you can give this movie a low rating. But you just have to realize that this movie was not made to please everyone, <br /> <br /> only people with a sense of humor. <br /> <br /> For those people the movie is great! It is reproduced in old science fiction movies and radio shows that no longer exist, most sorcerers classified themselves. In the line of Spaceballs and Airplane 2, you may have to stretch your imagination a bit to get the jokes, but it's worth it.
