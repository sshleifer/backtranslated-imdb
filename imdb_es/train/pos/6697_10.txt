I remember seeing Sabrina for the first time when she came to TV in the UK on ITV1 when she was 13/14. Now I am 24 years old and I still love it as much as I did when I first saw it. Some of my friends hit me a bit to keep watching a "children's program" but I do not care! lol Caroline Rhea, since "Hilda" is my personal favorite character and, later, Morgan also became another of my favorite characters. I remember spending a lot of time watching several special events in honor of Sabrina at the Nickeleoden UK television station. I love Mellissa Joan-Hart, she was great in "Clarrissa Explains All" but much better in this. I was speechless when they decided to finish it! I hope it will soon be released on DVD here in the UK. I'll be the first in line! lol x
