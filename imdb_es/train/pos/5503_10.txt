The material in this documentary is so powerful that it made me cry. Yes, I tell you tears. This popular struggle of a traditionally exploited population should inspire us all to defend our rights, to assert the greatest good of the community and to stop inventing cowardly excuses so as not to question the establishment. Chavez represents the weak and unfortunate in the same way that Bush is the face of dirty corporations and capitalism went crazy. In fact, Latin America is being remodeled and the marginalized majority will finally have a voice in more than five centuries. Although, in the case of Mexico, the election was clearly stolen by Calder칩n. Chavez is not perfect, far from it. He is trying to change the constitution to allow him to govern indefinitely. That can not be tolerated. Enough with politics and back to the movie; The rhythm is impressive in some moments and deeply philosophical in others. He represents Ch치vez as a popular hero without fear of challenging the hegemony and domination of the world's resources in the United States. If you think that the author is predisposed in favor of Ch치vez, nothing prevents you from doing your homework. One of the crucial messages of the film is the questioning of sources of information, as clearly demonstrated by the fact that the victims of the kidnappers are shamefully guilty of Ch치vez supporters. Venezuela shames the supposed American democracy. Until the revolution always!
