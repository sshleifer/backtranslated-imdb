Deathtrap is executed as a work within a film about who did what to whom, since it is developed mainly in a set. The premise is that an accomplished playwright, whose star is falling, receives a magnificent manuscript from a former student and, therefore, plans to part with his protégé and appropriate his game, to the (noisy) protests of his wife. Or so you think, for the first half of the movie. Beyond half the brand, Deathtrap begins to throw in twists and surprises that turn your premise over your head, then back, and then in a crazy turn, all the while keeping your title appropriate. It's an excellent mystery film steeped in wit. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine, as a playwright, plays himself in this film, a slightly crazy and very dramatic Briton. There are no surprises here, he does his usual good job. Get the best Deathtrap line, which runs perfectly: "What is your definition of success, being beaten in gangs in a state penitentiary?" <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Christopher Reeve combines comedy and drama in a surprisingly strong performance playing the ambitious dramatic young (and psychopathic). He can also show off his very toned body, which he must have kept coming out of the Superman movies. <br /> <br /> Caine and Reeve have collaborated on another film that is one of my favorite comedies: Noises Off. In a similar way, it also revolves around a play, although this time Caine is the director and Reeve is an actor. They are joined by veteran comedians Carol Burnett, John Ritter, Marilu Henner (Taxi) and Mark Linn-Baker (Perfect Strangers). Together, they demonstrate the calamities that survive the cast and crew of a play. On the surface, the film seems to be mostly slapstick, but upon seeing it, there are many subtle jokes that require more than one vision to capture them. I wish this underestimated movie was available on DVD.
