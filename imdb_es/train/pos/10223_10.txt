* some spoilers * <br /> <br /> I was pleasantly surprised to find that the harsh criticism (acting, antiquated dialogue, unclear plot) lacked foundation. Belafonte is great as a brandoesco spirit, threatening and swearing that he must win his wings, but he is very ill equipped of his past life to do so. He learns too late how empty his materialistic life was and hurried without love. Mostel is equally great as an anguished man with his dying wife Fanny. Despite his prayers for a miracle, his bitterness prevents him from accepting (or believing) in one. The two social worlds that the characters represent alternately collide and complement each other, the result is hilarious and movingly sad. <br /> <br /> The disconcerting ending is actually quite consistent with the rest of the movie. After looking in Belafonte everywhere, Mostel looks up to see a feather falling and frantically reaches it as if finally willing to believe in angels and miracles. But Belafonte was not allowed to complete his miracle (either to restore the health of Fanny or Mostel), so he never got his wings. The feather floats mockingly out of Mostel's reach, a metaphor for the lives of both men: it's too late and you do not have a second chance. As "It's a wonderful life", this movie is magical, wonderful, fun, but terribly tragic.
