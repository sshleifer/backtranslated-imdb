['This movie never received the attention it deserved, although this is one of the best pieces of acting together, and one of the most realistic stories I&#39;ve seen on the screen. Clearly filmed with a small budget at a true Virginia Hospital, the center of the story is Joel, very well played by Eric Stoltz. Joel has been paralyzed in a motorcycle accident and goes to the hospital to a room with other men who have spinal injuries. Joel is in love with Anna, his married lover, played by Helen Hunt, who shows early signs of his later work winning the Academy Award. <br /><br /> Although the Joel-Anna relationship is the basic approach, there are many other well-developed characters in the neighborhood. Wesley Snipes does a tremendous job as the angry Raymond. Even more impressive is William Forsythe as the bitter and racist Bloss. I think Forsythe&#39;s two best scenes are when he gets frustrated and angry with the square dancers, and later, when he feels empathy for a young Korean man who was shot in a liquor store. My favorite scene with Snipes is the round table about sexual options after an injury. <br /><br /> The chemistry between Stoltz and Hunt is very strong, and they have two very intimate sex scenes, but not gratuitous ones. The orgasm in the room is sexy and fun. There is also another memorable scene in which Joel and Bloss and the Korean boy take the specially equipped pickup truck to the strip bar. It is really a comedy of errors, as they make their weak attempts to get the van to see the &quot;naked ladies&quot;. <br /><br /> The story is made even more poignant by the fact that the director, Neal Jim√©nez, is paralyzed in real life. This is basically your story. This movie is real, not bright or flashy. It&#39;s amazing to have the amount of talent in a movie with such a small budget. I recommend this movie to everyone I see, because it is one of those films that even improves at a second glance. It is a pity that such a good job is overlooked, but through the video, maybe I can get the attention it deserves.']
