I consider that this film is the best one on Mike Hammer, with the interpretation of Biff Elliott as Mike Hammer definitive. The script of Harry Essex is excellent and contains many improvements in the novel by Mickey Spillane. His direction is strong and imaginative, and makes good use of light and shadow. John Alton's camera work is top-notch, as is the Franz Waxman score. The cast includes many veteran players, as well as Peggie Castle in her memorable performance as Charlotte Manning. All in all, this is one of the best private eye films ever made. Biff Elliott and Haary Essex should have received more opportunities. I have always treasured this movie.
