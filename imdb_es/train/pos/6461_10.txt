First, the initial lyricism of the film took me by surprise and then I was totally delighted with the story that was unfolding and absorbed in the brilliant direction. The characters were fully developed, no more than life, but like the people with whom we live anywhere in the world, in Sweden, in Turkey or in America, all fully credible human beings with weaknesses and nobility. Hollywood could learn a lot from this beautiful movie. It shows that there is no need to go into every little detail behind each action to highlight the whole subject in a clear and bright way, and that shows the brilliance of the director! Thank you very much to Kay Pollak and the wonderful cast of this magnificent gift!
