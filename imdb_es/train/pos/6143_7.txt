I never saw this 1971 film and it entertained me a lot with this great production created by the Walt Disney Studios and the great animation creations. Angela Lansbury, (Eglantine Price) played a prominent role as a woman who had taken a course in witchcraft and was an apprentice who started flying on a broom and had some difficulty getting off the ground. Eglantine discovered many tricks and could make a trip in bed to different parts of the world. However, Eglantine lost her final exams to become a consummate witch. Mr. Emerlius Browne, (David Tomlinson) was the person who sold Eglantine this course in witchcraft and tries to help her in all possible ways to find her solution. Eglantine has a purpose for his madness and is to prevent the Nazis from evading England. Great family entertainment and we need more movies like this today.
