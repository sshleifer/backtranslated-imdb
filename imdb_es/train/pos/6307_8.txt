I had never heard of this movie despite the connection with George Clooney (whose company he produced and he appears in a very funny supporting bit) and his Ocean's 11 director Steven Soderbergh. Worse still, we picked it up in a discount container for $ 4.99 (Canadian dollars!) What a great and pleasant surprise! But then I am of the opinion that if William H. Macy is in it, you can not be disappointed. This reminded me a lot of the Ealing comedies of England in the fifties. OK, with more blasphemy. This is a strange movie and, sometimes, very funny. The real robbery made me laugh so much I was crying. Perhaps the most fun use of underpants in the history of cinema. Maybe it was the low expectations I had when entering, but I watched with a group of people and had a great time. The best $ 5 that I have spent in years.
