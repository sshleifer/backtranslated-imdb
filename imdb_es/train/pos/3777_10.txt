Anyone who does not think that Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey is one of the best movies of all time needs to have their heads checked. Somehow, he manages to be completely insane and obvious, but at the same time frightening, intelligent and intelligent at the same time. One of those rare movies that really improve its predecessor, Bogus Journey can be enjoyed again and again. Notable highlights include the duel with death and the end, which is highly "emotional". Keanu wants to forget all the Matrix junk and get to do what he does best, Ted Theodore Logan in Bill and Ted: The Return.
