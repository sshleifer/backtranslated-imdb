> Contrary to most of the reviews I have read, I did not feel that this followed any of the other rock movies ("Spinal Tap", etc.). The story was more unique, although I think most people wanted it see the "sex, drugs and rock and roll" vices to which the band continued alluding. <br /> <br />> As an American, I knew some of the actors: Spall, Connelly and Rea. Surprised to discover that "Brian" / Bruce Robinson was in the Romeo and Juliet classic of Zifferedi (<sp?). I guess I'll have to rent that next. <br /> <br />> "THE FLAME STILL BURNS" - My wife, who is originally from Mexico, did not follow the English / British language very well, missed some of the Jokes (which I explained diligently) but she shouted her eyes in the concert scene. Now he loves the song. <br /> <br /> It's funny that Amazon.com has the soundtrack for $ 30 + usd when I bought the DVD in the Wal-Mart bin for $ 5.50usd. Despite the price, I saw it for the first time on the nightly cable and I have been dying to find it since then.
