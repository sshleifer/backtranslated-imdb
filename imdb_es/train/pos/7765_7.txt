Douglas Sirk directs this exaggerated drama about the unhappy rich. Kyle Hadley (Robert Stack) and Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson) are childhood friends with different aspects of life. Kyle is the womanizing son of an oil tycoon; Mitch works for the Hadley Oil Company. Both fall in love with the same woman, Lucy Moore; But it's Kyle who has the means to make her skin her and marry her. Sister Marylee (Dorothy Malone) seems to be the nymphomaniac of the city and carries a torch for Mitch, who always seems to be the one who cleans up Hadley's mess. Ambitious with pretension; A bit above, but the stars make it a movie to watch. I was very impressed by Malone. Rounding out the cast: Robert Keith, Edward Platt, John Lurch and Robert J. Wilke.
