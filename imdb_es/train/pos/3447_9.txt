There is no director that I like more than Mamoru Oshii. But, unfortunately, even though he directed several films that attracted a lot of international attention, there are still some of his films that have escaped. Tachiguishi is one of them, and although I loved it, it's not hard to see why distributors in the West are a bit reluctant to release it. <br /> <br /> Among his great and serious films, Oshii is known for making some smaller and more extravagant projects. While Tachiguishi definitely falls into this category, Oshii really surpassed himself with this one, creating something that is very difficult to classify, even as a freaky Japanese movie. Go figure. <br /> <br /> At its core is a documentary not unlike Otaku no Video. But instead of ridiculing an existing subculture, Oshii invents his own and delves into the lives of culinary heroes, sneaking free food and defending the Japanese culinary level. Oshii's approach to the issue has close ties to Dai-Nipponjin, since the subject is handled with a lethal sense of gravity, while the images on the screen seem as ridiculous as they can be. Deadpan's humor taken to the extreme. <br /> <br /> But that's not all, instead of simply shooting at his fake documentary Oshii decided to do it using a new visual technique called superlivemation. A strange mix of live action, photography, digital animation and puppets on a stick. Performed and acted (or positioned, if desired) by the majors of the Japanese animation industry, since it was assumed that the project would have the lowest possible budget. <br /> <br /> And if you think so. Almost covers it, know that the film is extremely dialogical, which makes it a good piece of accompaniment for Innocence. The influence of the grifters is analyzed from all kinds of cultural, political and even philosophical angles, fired at the audience through a continuous flow of monologues and dialogues. And to make matters worse, the whole movie is completely based on the history and customs of Japan, which makes it even more difficult for a foreigner to take over the material. It goes without saying that it is recommended to make multiple visualizations to take full advantage of all the details hidden within the film. <br /> <br /> That said, at the conceptual level, the movie is easy to follow and it's already quite fun. Several grifters are presented as if they were the most influential historical figures of postwar Japan. The film is presented as if a serious documentary of any other important figure to be developed was expected, but somehow the large and crudely animated cut-out photographic extremities of which the figures are assembled do not make it so serious. The range of characters presented is sublime, Shinji Higuchi takes the cake as a cow creature using a nose ring while facing the fast food chains with his gang of bulls / people. <br /> <br /> Regular Kenji Kawai from Oshii provides, in addition to a fairly comical performance, a score that ranges from atmospheric and dark to extravagant, strange and comical. You have to have a lot of fun with the exaggerated noises and effects, which complement the animation and totally contradict the tone of the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Visually, the film is very atmospheric, although it must be said that the animation is quite sparse and, while effective, remains subdued, only to explode into hyperactive oddities from time to time. Which is not exactly a bad thing, since Tachiguishi is so heavy in the dialogue. In spite of that, the film is still a visual masterpiece, as each frame looks absolutely exuberant and is designed to adapt and enhance the general atmosphere of the film. <br /> <br /> However, be careful, as Tachiguishi demands a lot from the viewer. . If you do not speak Japanese, there is a lot of reading to do and many cultural references that require some attention. On top of that, the monologues in the movie area are quite extensive and can be difficult to follow. The film still lacks subtitles in English and although my French was enough to understand what it was about, I'm sure I missed many of the most important points of the film. <br /> <br /> Tachiguishi is not an easy task. The film to enter, but halfway reaches its maximum power and does not loose from there. I still hope to see this again with English or Dutch subs. A dubbing would be really better for a movie like this one (very similar to Container), although I think a quality anime dub is too much to ask. <br /> <br /> All this being said, I can only congratulate Oshii for another wonderful movie. It is rare to find a film that combines and mixes so many styles and influences to create something that is so unique and still works. The film is intelligent, it looks and sounds great and is full of creativity. It's immensely fun, even if you can not capture all the details at the first sight. But be sure to at least get this with decent subscribers, since the automatic translation in English that is floating around has no value and does not do justice to the movie. <br /> <br /> Tachiguishi addresses a very specific audience and I am not surprised that the French got their release, while the rest of Europe (and the rest of the Western world) still await a signal from this film. But for those who like Oshii, they appreciate the dry and expressionless humor and crave creative spirits, it is a film that can not be lost, even though it could also fail. 4.5 * / 5.0 *
