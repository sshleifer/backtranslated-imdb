This film is difficult to see in our accelerated culture of the 21st century, but it is worth it for the messages it transmits, mainly the consequences and ramifications of technology in society, specifically when that technology is used for war. /> <br /> This film presents a complete cycle of dehumanization and rehumanization influenced by the advent of technology and the subsequent deconstruction of civilization and, therefore, serves as a warning against the misuse of technology, but as that the circle is complete, familiar themes and feelings appear again to present selfish rather than self-destructive forms for humanity to use technology. <br /> <br /> Brilliant for its moment, the quality of image and sound may represent a challenge for some, but as a milestone in the history, development and evolution of the science fiction genre, it is a necessity. In the end, free will and free choice are once again posed to humanity as a means to control our own destiny, instead of someone else having served us or, in fact, the state of society itself, such as configured by world events. <br /> <br /> Those who are oppressed by what life tends to them sometimes tend to remain so, but nevertheless, there is always a glimmer of hope and continuity that remains, as this film postulates. <br /> <br /> As far as qualifying as science fiction, one of the greatest common devils of that genre is its speculative nature. It asks us the questions, what would happen if these events happened in this way and what effect would it have on society or the individuals within it? How would we react? <br /> <br /> In terms of influence, this film projects those speculative sciences that make science fiction as unique as it is and keeps us asking those important questions.
