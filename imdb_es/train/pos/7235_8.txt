"A Girl's Folly" is a kind of half comedy, half documentary imitation of the film business of the mid-1910s. We glimpsed life in one of the first film studios, where we experienced assembling a set, going through a scene, driving fans of worship movies and even having lunch at the police station. We also have knowledge of little-known film facts, for example, did you know that "often, the actors" of films "do not know the plot of the image they are working on"? <br /> <br /> The plot of this movie in essence is the discovery and romance of film star Kenneth Driscoll of a young budding star who discovers while filming in a place in the country. I think the 30-minute version that I saw was summarized, included in the same tape with Cecil B. De Mille's "The Cheat." It's a very credible movie, an easy watch with a great cast of extras. As an added benefit, it includes some of the best illustrated titles I've seen accompanying a silent movie.
