I'm so upset that ABC is giving up on another program that has the chance to be a real winner. This program is so good, the writing and the story were great, a real original idea for a program instead of another boring reality program. The casting was spectacular! Not only were the characters and actors, but they are a set of very talented actors. The concept and the idea are really a new and great idea for a television program, many of us share this idea of ​​"connections". I really love the characters of Steven, Laura, Whitney and Damien. But to be honest, there is not a person connected to this program that I did not like, not even those who only had a few episodes (for example, Sheri Appleby). The acting and the characters are so easy to like and so talented !! I wish ABC would have given this program more opportunity, and not interrupt the program halfway. Also, it was not advertised enough. Truly unfair! to all!!. This show showed great promise. For my part, I will let ABC know what I feel and I will continue to send emails to keep this program alive. Please join me, I know we can do it. It worked for Jerico. (By the way, where is episode 13? I want that last show!). Please support this program and send emails to ABC, we can do it! This show is well worth it !!! ONLINE REQUEST TO KEEP SIX DEGREES: http://www.PetitionOnline.com/gh1215/petition.html WE CAN DO IT! SIGN THIS PETITION ASAP !!!
