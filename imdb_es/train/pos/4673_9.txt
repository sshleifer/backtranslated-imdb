One of the things that most interested me in this movie is the way in which the characters and their associated stories are developed on the fly. I suppose the writers wanted us to gain interest in the characters by not forcing their characters to feed. The premise of using art and craft design and furniture construction was a unique theme and / or an analogy so families / siblings go through life. The complexity of having a twin as a surrogate father and even husband added a great tension to make this film emotionally interesting. In addition, although the story was not one with which the masses could relate directly (ie, the Jews / twins / family businesses), the themes are quite universal, since each family has a black sheep. That made him very attractive.
