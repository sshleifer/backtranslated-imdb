**Warning! Slight Spoilers ahead! ** <br /> <br /> (Yes, I realize that it is difficult to spoil a historical documentary, but I do reveal some of the background and methods.) <br /> <br /> This is an exceptional Documentary, not only because of the extraordinary images, but also because of the history behind them. Because the Naudets did not set out to tell the story of 9/11, but the story of a novice firefighter, the emotions of men and the viewer's connection to them are more real and powerful than they would be in a standard retrospective. <br /> <br /> In a cinematic sense, "9/11" is a textbook. If the events were a real script, they would be excellent, since the characters are established, then a curve is thrown at which they must react. This is even more surprising if one takes into account the pain and emotion of the raw images that the directors had to analyze to compose this story. <br /> <br /> The first part of the film offers a vision of life inside a fire station; specifically, how a rookie assimilates himself into a team of veterans. That part alone is pretty good, and if the documentary had been allowed to follow its intended course, it probably would have been solid. The brothers seem to portray realistically the process of becoming a New York firefighter. <br /> <br /> Then, of course, all hell breaks loose. The chaos that follows the attacks of the WTC is clearly seen, since several characters that we have come to know are involved in terrifying situations. Seeing not only the attacks, but also the first-hand reactions is a very moving image of extreme human emotion. <br /> <br /> The consequences, in which it is discovered that firefighters are lost and found, is the human drama in its heyday. Life and death are in balance. Unlike many movies, the viewer not only does not know who will live and die, but really cares about them. <br /> <br /> The only negative thing I have to say about this is that Robert DeNiro's ads (whom I like) were uninformative, unnecessary and did not advance the story at all. They were probably added only to attract more viewers. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: the best documentary I've seen in my life. Unparalleled portrayals of raw human emotion and drama. 9.5 out of 10
