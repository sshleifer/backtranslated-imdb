April enchanted is a poem of tone, an impressionist painting, a masterpiece of transmitting a message with few words. It has been one of my 10 favorite movies since it came out. I am still waiting, although with less patience, for the film to be released in DVD format. Apparently, I'm not alone. <br /> <br /> If the Amazon listings of the parent company are correct, there are many people who want this title in DVD format. Many people want to go to Italy with this cast and script. Many people want to keep a permanent copy of this movie in their libraries. The cast is spectacular, the cinematography and the direction impeccable. The film is a definitive caregiver. Many have already asked. Please add our names to the list.
