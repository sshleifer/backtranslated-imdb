I saw him last night on television, and he was quite delighted. <br /> <br /> It's a kind of movie that makes you feel nice and warm with your heart, and believes that there is still some kindness in the world (all the neighbors pretended not to see what grace did to help them and protect it, the old cop is my favorite), although they know that this story is not completely realistic. <br /> <br /> I loved acting (everyone seemed to be ordinary people, living in a quaint little English seaside town) but the best thing about the film was the wit and humor it has. Just remember the scene in the store with two older ladies after they have taken their "tea". <br /> <br /> Maybe the ending was a bit confusing, but it did not stop me from really enjoying the whole story
