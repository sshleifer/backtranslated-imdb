This movie was not only better than the entire H: LOTS final season. But it was better than any movie made for television I've seen! <br /> <br /> Looking at the "Top 250" I see that only a small screen movie has done it: how the Grinch stole Christmas. I think it's time to increase that group to 2. <br /> <br /> I admit that the original series had several programs that were better than this, but I did not care. I LOVED to be able to re-enter the world of the Baltimore Homicide Squad!
