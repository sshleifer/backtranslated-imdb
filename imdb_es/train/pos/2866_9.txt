['I grew up in this classic western series, and as a child I always considered it a delight to stay up late on Sunday nights to see her. Bonanza can still be seen infinitely in re races. <br /><br /> The series tells the adventures of the Cartwright family, who lives on a ranch near Virginia City, Nevada, around the Civil War era. His ranch (called Ponderosa) is administered and defended by the widowed father, Ben, and his three unmarried sons, Adam, Hoss and Little Joe. These three brothers have different mothers, all of whom have died years before. <br /><br /> The Cartwrights are a hardworking, prosperous and honorable family, well respected in those parts. The Ponderosa is large, so reaching its ends requires a lot of horseback riding. In addition, trips are often necessary to buy or sell livestock, etc. Needless to say, few of these excursions go smoothly. Although hospitable, much of the Cartwrights&#39; energy must be spent defending their ranch from intruders, or protecting themselves from the townspeople who are jealous of their prosperity and stellar reputation. The Cartwrights do a bit of firing their weapons in the air, but they only shoot to kill when it is considered absolutely necessary. They are involved in various matters of the city, including the political life of the territory of Nevada. <br /><br /> One of the main assets of the series is the underlying heat that is always present (despite the occasional disagreements) between Ben and his three children, and (despite frequent disagreements) between the three brothers. Now, one brother may hit another from time to time, but generally he has a good reason for that at that moment and his anger never lasts long. The characters are very well drawn. Ben is represented as a successful and noble man of great integrity. The oldest son, Adam, the most rational and kind of the brothers, went to the middle of the series. The middle brother, Hoss, is a gentle giant of a teddy bear, who has an insatiable appetite for food and is a bit shy with the ladies. The youngest, Little Joe, is a charming and handsome sorcerer who, on the contrary, has enough experience with women. This trio of brothers enjoy several romances, but their love interests often disappear at the end of the episode or marriage is impossible, for whatever reason. <br /><br /> The actors are all stellar in their roles, including Pernell Roberts (Adam), Dan Blocker (Hoss), Michael Landon (Little Joe) and, of course, Lorne Greene as the patriarch of the family of principles, Ben. I also love the ranch chef, Hop Sing, played by Victor Sen Yung. <br /><br /> This is a wonderful action-packed western with great values. The Cartwrights are always the noble heroes and most of the bad guys are pretty evil. If only there were more shows like this vintage western on TV these days!']
