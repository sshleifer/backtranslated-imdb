<br /> <br /> I must admit that I expected something very different from the first time I saw 'Cut' last night, although I was delighted with the unexpected gem of Australian horror. I am a true fan of horror because of how real it is, and I discovered that 'Cut' is not only the best of the genre that Australia has produced, but one of the great parody and comedy movies of recent times. <br /> <br /> My only concern is that the general public may not catch many of the comic elements: the film was not too smart in its application, but it made me laugh at every moment trying to fit EVERY possible clich√© of the horror genre that could. I'm sure this was thought of as humor ... with the hope that it was humor. <br /> <br /> And, of course, there was the gore. <br /> <br /> The use of 'personalization' The garden scissors were brilliant, in addition to the stabs and cuts expected. In short, there was a great deal of variety and creativity in the many violent deaths, enough to please even the skeptics who were worth it. <br /> <br /> The appearance of both Kylie Minogue (less than their appearance). and Molly Ringwald was just another reason to watch the film: both performances were fantastic, as was Simon Bossell ('The Castle') in a brilliant role as a jokey technician. <br /> <br /> In short, I think this movie is one of the best horror products of the last couple or the last years, as well as a beautiful satire / parody, toungue-to-cheek until the end. <br /> <br /> I loved it. Go see it!
