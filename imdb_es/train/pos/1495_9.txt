This is an amazing anthology of terror of Amicus, with 3 great stories and fantastic performances. Only the last story disappoints. All the characters are awesome, and the movie is quite chilling and suspenseful, plus Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee are simply amazing in this. It is very underestimated and my favorite story has to be the third "Sweets To The Sweet", plus all the characters are very nice. Some of them are predictable, and the last story was incredibly disappointing and rather insipid. However, the ending was really great. This is an impressive anthology of terror of Amicus, with 3 great stories and fantastic performances, only the last story disappoints! I say you have to see it! <br /> <br /> 1st Story ("Method to murder"). This is an incredible story, with a lot of suspense, and the murderer Dominic is really creepy, and he's very well acted too! This was the perfect way to start with a story, and for the most part it is unpredictable, plus the double-turn ending is shocking, and quite spooky. Grade A <br /> <br /> 2nd story. ("Wax Museum"). This is a solid story, with wonderful performances; however, the ending is quite predictable, but it is still spooky and quite suspenseful. Peter Cushing did an incredible job, and I could not believe how young Joss Ackland was. I really enjoyed this story! Grade B <br /> <br /> Third story ("Sweet to the sweet"). This is the best story here, as it is extremely spooky and unpredictable at all, it also has a nice touch too. Christopher Lee did an amazing job, and Chloe Franks did a wonderful job as the young daughter, and the ending is quite shocking. I do not want to spoil it for you, but it's one of the best horror stories I've seen! Grade A + <br /> <br /> Fourth story ("The Cloak"). This is a terrible story that really is weak and unpleasant. Jon Pertwee bothered me. However, the end surprised me a little, and Ingrid Pitt was great as always, however, it is boring, and has been done many times, in addition to where the creativity was. ?? Grade D <br /> <br /> Management is great! Peter Duffell does a great job here, with incredible camera work, great angles, adding a bit of chilling atmosphere and keeping the film at a very fast pace. <br /> <br /> The performance is incredible! John Bryans is great here, as a storyteller, he had some great lines, he just wanted to have more time on the screen. John Bennett is very good as the Det., And he was quite intense, he was especially good at the end! I loved it. Denholm Elliott is excellent as Charles, he was vulnerable, he showed fear, he was very nice and I loved his facial expressions, he rocked! Joanna Dunham is incredibly beautiful, and she performed very well with what she had to do as a wife, she also had great chemistry with Denholm Elliott! Tom Adams is incredibly creepy as Dominic, he had a spooky look and he did the job extremely well! Peter Cushing is amazing as always, and he's amazing here, he's nice, focused, charming, and as always, he's had a lot of class! (Cushing rules!). Joss Ackland is fantastic as always, and he looked very young here, I barely recognized him, his accent was not so strong and he played a different role, I loved it! (Ackland Rules). Wolfe Morris is creepy here, and he did what he had to do well. Cristopher Lee is amazing as always and is amazing here, he is incredibly intense, very focused, and as he always had that great intense look on his face, it was especially amazing at the end! (Read the rules!). Chloe Franks is adorable as a daughter, it's kind of creepy and she gave one of the best children's shows I've ever seen. I loved her. Nyree Dawn Porter is beautiful and was excellent as a nanny, I really liked it! Jon Pertwee bothered me here and it was quite insipid, and completely funny, I did not have chemistry with Ingrid Pitt either! Ingrid Pitt is beautiful, and she does her usual vampire thing and she does it well. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is fine. In general, you have to see! **** of 5
