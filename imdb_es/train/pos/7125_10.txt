Good evening, Mr. Tom is very well filmed and beautifully made. He is not completely faithful to the book, but does he have to be? Not at all. John Thaw is fascinating like Tom Oakley. Her transformation from brusque to fond was done so well, making her more believable than Scrooge in Christmas Carol. After Inspector Morse, this is Thaw's best time. It was paired with seriousness by a young Nick Robinson, who gave a convincing portrait of an evacuee traumatized by the abusive relationship with his mother. The script and the music were worth it, and you also see Thaw play the organ. Amazing! The most moving scene was when Willie heard about Zak's death, and then Tom told him about his deceased family who died of scarlet fever. Buy this, you will love it! 10/10 Bethany Cox
