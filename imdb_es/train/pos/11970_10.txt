Full House approached me when I was 9 years old. I remember seeing replays of the funniest Home Videos in the United States with Bob Saget, and one day my mother told me that he was also in a program called Full House. One day, I was lucky to capture an episode while visiting my family. It did not seem very interesting at first, but as I looked more and more, every night at 9:00, I would love it. <br /> <br /> This show really makes you want to be there. to yourself, spend time with the girls, go to places with them and maybe even join their little family "canteos". <br /> <br /> What I like most about Full House is that it is a great show for children and adults of all ages. There will be some parts that are more for adults, and then parts that are intended for children, so that the whole family can enjoy it. No matter how corny it may be, it's still a great show, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone. <br /> <br /> 10/10
