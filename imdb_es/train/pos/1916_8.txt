"8 SIMPLE RULES ... TO GET MY ADOLESCENT SON," is my opinion, it is an absolute classic of ABC! I'm not sure I have not seen all the episodes, but I still enjoyed it. It's hard to say which episode was my favorite. However, I think it was always fun when a mishap occurred. I always laughed at that. Even though James Garner and David Spade were good, I liked the show better when John Ritter was the protagonist. If you ask me, his sudden death was very tragic. They all always gave a good performance, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well designed and the writing was always very strong. In conclusion, I hope that some network will put it on the air for fans of the program to see.
