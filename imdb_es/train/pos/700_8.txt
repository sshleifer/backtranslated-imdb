['An Insomniac&#39;s Nightmare was an incredibly interesting and well-made movie. I loved the way it simply throws you into the main character&#39;s subconscious without spoiling the viewer ... the performance was top-notch. Honestly, I would see Dominic Monaghan read the phone book! - But all the others, especially the young one, were also great. I was also very impressed by the look of the movie. In general, &quot;independent films&quot; have a grainy appearance of I-shot-this-on-my-camcorder, but this director knows what she is doing. Lighting, cinematography ... Work of quality. I&#39;m looking forward to a job by Tess Nanavati!']
