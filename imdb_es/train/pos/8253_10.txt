This is the first movie I should see in the last year! It's incredibly funny, incredibly original, incredibly great (they opted for this super cool Technicolor widescreen look that is awesome to admire) and actually has a deep character and what it says about society. Really intelligent satire is what holds everything from National Security to race problems, while at the same time it leaves you laughing and you realize how much the world lives in fear. Carrie Anne Moss becomes a comedic performance that I never imagined would come from her. She is sweet, funny and sexy! Billy Connolly is great as Fido can only grunt and moan! And Dylan Baker as dad has no price. In fact, the entire cast is perfect. Henry Czerny as the bad boy, Tim Blake Nelson as the neighbor with the sexy and sexy zombie girlfriend (do you understand the idea now?) Fun, provocative and amazing! Go see this movie! It's like nothing you've seen before.
