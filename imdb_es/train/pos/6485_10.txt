The world at war is one of the best documentaries about World War 2. <br /> <br /> The 24 episodes cover the war and how it was in the countries involved in it. The first episode tells us how Hitler came to power and how he could build one of the strongest armies in the world. They also worry about the military actions taken during the war and the holocaust. One of the strongest and best documentaries ever made. You all must see this. Perfection! 10/10 <br /> <br />
