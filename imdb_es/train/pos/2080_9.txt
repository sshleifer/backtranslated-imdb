The quote that I used for my summary appears halfway through THE GOOD LAND, when a captain of a Chinese revolutionary army (played by Philip Ahn) apologizes to a mob for not having time to shoot MORE of the looters in between them, as your unit has done. He has just been called back to the front lines. Of course, the next looter about to be discovered and filmed is the main character in the film, the former kitchen slave O-Lan (by whose representation Luise Rainer, now 99 years old, won her second consecutive best actress, Oscar). <br /> <br /> The next scene finds O-Lan diligently delivering his bag of looted jewelry to his despicable husband, farmer Wang Lung (Paul Muni), setting in motion that classic dichotomy of the rising economy of a man. Mobility is the direct inverse of its moral decadence. <br /> <br /> For a film that deals with issues such as slavery, false accusations, misogyny, starvation, invasion of homes, eating family pets, mental retardation, infanticide, exploited refugees, Riots, civil war, mass street executions, bigamy, child abuse, adultery, incest and insect plagues of biblical proportions, THE GOOD EARTH is a surprisingly moving film. <br /> <br /> My farewell thought is in the form of another classic quote, from O-Lan herself (while she puts the precious soup bone her son has just admitted to stealing from an old woman and returned to the cooking pot after her husband Wang Lung threw him angrily at the dirt floor on the other side of the hut): "Meat is meat."
