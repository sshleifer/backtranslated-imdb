I noticed that A NEW HOPE and THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK are in the TOP 10, but that this is not even in the TOP 100. <br /> <br /> This movie has a bad reputation because of the Ewoks, but there are So many reasons to love this movie: <br /> <br /> -Habba's Han Solo Rescue: This official summarizes the sub-plot of Han Solo's debt that was established when we met the character for the first time in A NEW HOPE. <br /> <br /> -The Emperor was finally revealed: Well, well, this might not work so well now that the prequels are gone, but this was the first time we saw the Emperor as a child. <br /> <br /> - The Speeder Bike Chase: Okay, this was a special effects moment. But it was definitely one of the most memorable and exciting moments of all the movies! <br /> <br /> -The Climax of 3 parts: 1) The Battle of Endor (directed by Han and Leia) 2) Luke confronts his father & The Fall of the Emperor 3) The Destruction of the Second Star of the Death (Moment of Lando) <br /> <br /> -The Final Celebration with Our Heroes: As I said, this movie gets really bad thanks to the Ewoks but I think it's great that while the whole galaxy celebrates the FALL OF THE EMPIRE, our heroes are having their own private party in the woods between them. <br /> <br /> In summary, this was a great ending. Chapter for our heroes and an appropriate ending to the story of STAR WARS.
