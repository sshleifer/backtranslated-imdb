Personally, this is one of my favorites of all time! No, I'm not 10. I'm 30! I own an old and original VHS that I bought at a rental store. I've seen it countless times ... <br /> <br /> While it's a fun movie for kids, it's an interesting movie for adults. I saw this movie once when I was ... not sober. My eyes were open to things I had never noticed before. I saw that morality was strongly encouraged, both overtly and subliminally. I wish I could remember all the things I noticed in particular, but it's been a long time since then. Rest assured that there are TONS of things alluded to throughout the film. if you have the opportunity to see it ... not sober ... do it, you will not be disappointed ... in fact, you will probably feel happy and warm. <br /> <br /> unique and wonderful!
