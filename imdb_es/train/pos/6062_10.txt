['Only the chosen ones will appreciate the quality of the story and the character design of this film. Ancient superiors who inhabit the lands of tradition far beyond the comprehension of any average human creature. This film takes the genre of adventure to a unique magical centrifugal force of fantasy for you, the mystical chalice crystals. Stories come and go, but the idea of a good story is to think positive thoughts, not negative ones. To create a good battle against evil like never before. Embracing an uncatably bright process that keeps the imagination shining in one dimension and out of the other. Hitting a quick flash of energy that transports a human to another world.']
