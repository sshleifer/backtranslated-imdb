Animation always seems to be marginal. In Japan, this might not be the case, but in Europe and much more in the US. UU The animation has a large and thick label "CHILDREN". France is probably one of the most comical-liberal countries, home to classics such as Tin-Tin, Asterix, Lucky Luke, Valereon, etc. (If you've never read this, it's not too late, there's no upper age limit on them and they do not carry the nerd stigma of DC or Marvel) It looks like a movie like this that appears in France. It adapts to my prejudiced image of the French as art-loving, anti-USA and talented filmmakers. Fortunately, there is also "A dark scanner" to suppress that view: it seems that the art is quite international. <br /> <br /> Anyway, as you may have seen, the Renaissance is artistic and French. If you are a normal person you will be scared by this. There is no need for that though! Under its fresh and elegant appearance, there is a good thriller and a good movie in general. <br /> <br /> That was one of my fears for this movie. It is very easy to turn the spectacular animation into a trick, like Sony and C: or they are doing it with their Pixar scams. I expected a confusing movie, sometimes boring and not very attractive, but luckily I was wrong. <br /> <br /> I would have enjoyed it anyway for the neo-noir things, but it was good that it was worth it. that level too. NOTE: I have seen the French dubbing that was fine as far as I could see. English could be more interesting than with Craig and all. <br /> <br /> One last word of praise to the animation. It was incredible Futuristic, well designed, good work with the camera, smart solutions (for example, the eyes looked very good, which is difficult to do) and visually impressive. I felt like exploding "This is so awesome!" On the other hand, I really like the animation and I appreciate the effort of the study, so my verdict is a little skewed. <br /> <br /> Good movie anyway, it definitely lives beyond its "trick".
