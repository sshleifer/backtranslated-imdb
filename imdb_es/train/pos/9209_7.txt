STAR CLASSIFICATION: ***** The Works **** Just lose the mark *** Little Little In Between ** Lagging behind * The Pits <br /> <br /> Mike Atherton (Dudikoff) is peacefully making his own in the Wild West when he sees a group of men mistreating a lady. Being a gentleman, he naturally intervenes and puts an end to this and, in doing so, kills the son of an unpleasant executor. This is just the beginning of a fiery battle to the end, of which there will only be one winner. <br /> <br /> M Dudikoff is an action star who has never managed to take off with me. Maybe I discovered it too late and after the other movie I saw with him last Monday, The Human Shield, it was just another Dud (ha ha) added to the list. But I like westerns, since they are films that transport me to a different time and place and provide real escapist entertainment, and with this Dudikoff has chosen one of his best scripts, since his films are anyway. <br /> <br /> The movie hits some low points in the form of an evil central villain, which sounds like a blank Marlon Brando and some in general act in a box-like fashion on the part of the cast, along with the mandatory sets of Cheap aspect. But if, for some strange reason, your life ever depended on watching a Dudikoff movie, this would be one of your best choices. ***
