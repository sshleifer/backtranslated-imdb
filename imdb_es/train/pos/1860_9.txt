['I went to see Antone Fisher without knowing what to expect and I was pleasantly surprised. Derek Luke&#39;s acting work was outstanding and the story line was excellent. Of course, Denzel Washington did his excellent regular job of acting, as well as directing. It makes you realize that people with mental problems CAN be helped and this movie is a perfect example of this. Do not miss it.']
