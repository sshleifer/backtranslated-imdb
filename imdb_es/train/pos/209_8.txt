Walter Matthau and George Burns work together very well. The acidity of Willy with the puzzled amnesiac Al is a mixture made in heaven. The scene when they meet again in Willy's apartment is a jewel and the final scene completes the film perfectly. Walter Matthau offers an excellent performance as the irascible semi-retired comedian that only he can, the intonation in the voice and the dramatic exaggerated dramas, together with his general misunderstanding of what is happening, form a great characterization. George Burns' time is legendary and nowhere better than in this movie, his quiet poise with dry desert responses are memorable. Watch the scene near the end when Al and his daughter ask the Spanish caretaker for something, and Al's reaction is priceless.
