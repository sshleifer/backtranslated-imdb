Before starting, I must point out that I know the editor of this movie. We've never met, but we belong to the same fanzine (those things that came before the forums), and we've talked on the phone, so I have a bias here. Anyway ... <br /> <br /> Somehow, it's ironic that while the "Rat Pack" culture of the late 50s and early 60s came back in the mid-90s, this movie, One of the original Rat Pack's son, which was made in a similar way, was a failure. Not only that, it was a critical failure; I think that Peter Travers, from Rolling Stone, was the only one who did not save him (as I remember), he revised it in a mixed way. And although I do not think this is the best movie in the world, and I'm not a Rat Pack fan, or "cocktail", culture, I do think it's worth seeing. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, this looks elegant, and move on. On the other hand, the basic performances are all good. Richard Dreyfus is surprisingly restrained here as the main gangster who returns from a sanitarium, and has a touch of grace for him. Jeff Goldblum goes back to the silent ironic performances he did in his days before the box office hit, such as THE BIG CHILL. And while Ellen Barkin should only participate in this film, she does it in an entertaining way. It is true that it is not a great movie; Dialogue is mainly composed of word games, and many of them do not work (like the whole "Zen of Ben" discourse). And Gabriel Byrne and Kyle MacLachlan are horrible here. Still, I entertained myself and if you like gangster movies, you could be too.
