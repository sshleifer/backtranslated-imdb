A smart romp, undoubtedly entertaining, starring Peter Ustinov as an embezzler of the race with his sights set on an American conglomerate in London. He is incited by the foxy (and deceptively strong) Maggie Smith and threatened with exposure by the jealous company man Bob Newhart. This is a robbery movie with many brains. Ustinov is exceptional just like Smith and Newhart is quite funny. The real surprise is Karl Malden, since the pill appears as "executive vice president". Malden has rarely been so loose. Cesar Romero and Robert Morley appear in some funny cameos. The excellent musical score is by Laurie Johnson. The direction of Eric Till is fast and the script of Ustinov and Ira Wallach is first class and very intelligent. A good swing moment!
