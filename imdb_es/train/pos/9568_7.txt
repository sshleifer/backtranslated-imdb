Some comments here on IMDb have compared Dog Bite Dog to the classic Cat III movies of the 90s, but although it is undoubtedly brutal, violent and very sad, this Pou-Soi Cheang movie is not really sordid enough, sensible or sensationalist to win that comparison However, still has a punch that makes it worth seeing, especially if yours is hard and tough action. <br /> <br /> Edison Chen plays Pang, a Cambodian hit man who travels to Hong Kong to murder a judge's wife; Sam Lee is Wai, the ruthless cop who is determined to locate him, no matter what the cost. With Wai approaching his target, Pang will stop at nothing to ensure his escape until he meets Yue, a rather illegal immigrant who needs your help to escape his life of abuse. <br /> <br /> A relentlessly harsh drama with a great cinematography, an incredible sound design, an unforgettable score and solid performances by Chen and Lee (as well as the newcomer Pei Pei as the love interest of Pang), Dog Bite Dog is one of the fans of blunt Asian hyperviolence (think along the lines of the Vengeance trilogy of Chan-wook Park). Stabbings, shootings, ruthless beatings: they all happen regularly in this film and director Cheang catches them. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is the kind of story that is destined to have an unhappy ending for everyone involved, and of course, almost everyone in this film dies (quite unpleasant deaths). Unfortunately, there is a thin line between tragedy and comedy (unintentional), and in its final moments, Dog Bite Dog crosses it: in an incredibly dramatic final scene, Pang and Wai are caught in the battle while pregnant Yue watches. Finally, after the three suffered severe stab wounds during the failures, an injured Pang performs a Ceasarean DIY in (Yue now dead), delivering his baby moments before he himself dies. <br /> <br /> Although this movie could not be a 'classic' slice of excess Hong Kong, with its delirious OTT action and stylish visuals, it's still worth looking for.
