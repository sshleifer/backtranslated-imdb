This is a film that improves every time I see it. There are so many nuanced performances in this. William Tracey, like Pepi, is a delight, which provides great comic relief. Joseph Schildkraut as Vadas, is the only "villain" in the movie, and his oily charms are used well here. Frank Morgan is charming as the owner of the title store, Mr. Matuschek, and his familiar way is used well here. I especially liked the performance of Felix Bressart, like Pirovitch. Very credible in every facet of his role. <br /> <br /> The two protagonists have the same performance, with Margaret Sullivan doing an outstanding job portraying a slightly desperate, neurotic but charming and attractive woman. <br /> <Although this movie belongs to Jimmy Stewart. The film is presented from his point of view, with the action spinning around him. Mr. Stewart is more than ready to take the film, with incredible performance that uses a wide range of emotions. Just watch Stewart, when he's fired from his job, because of a misunderstanding. He is able to convey the shock, anger, fear and shame that such a traumatic event causes, so perfectly. In my opinion, James Stewart is, without a doubt, the best film actor in the history of the medium. There is no one else that has been captured in a film that is capable of transmitting so completely what he is feeling to an audience. At the time he made this film, he still had most of his career ahead, but he is completely master of his craft. This is one of the best Jimmy Stewarts movies, and also one of the sweetest and funniest romantic comedies you'll find. I recommend this movie, especially for those who appreciate Stewart's work.
