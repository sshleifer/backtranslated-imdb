It's a pretty good movie, but too Americanized in its predictability. Change the Kung Fu for football and the Turkish Family for a Pakistani, and you can see Bend It Like Beckham (2002) almost scene by scene. A good feature that serves as the backbone of the film is the progression of the fights with the mysterious ninja under the road, starting with miserable losses and moving slowly until the last fight is a victory against oneself, as emphasized by several times the Kung Fu teacher. On a different level, Danish life is very different from the image that outsiders have: non-indigenous immigrants who make up a large proportion (in fact, the majority) of Danish citizenship, graffiti in the suburbs of Copenhagen, teasing The immigrant girl in the begging of the movie. They all portray a different image than one has in mind when you hear the word Denmark.
