I have been a fan of this movie for years and years. Because Teri Hatchers moved to the forefront, I had to take the film off the shelf and watch it. Why did not people in 1991 see how wonderful this movie was beyond me? Sally Field and Kevin Kline are more than fabulous. Although I have never seen soap operas, this movie kills me every time I see it. The acting is unsurpassed for a comedy and the writing is very intelligent. I recommend you see this if you have not already done so. You can see Elizabeth Shue, Whoopi Goldberg, Teri Hatcher and Carrie Fisher ... to name a few ... they all give splendid performances.
