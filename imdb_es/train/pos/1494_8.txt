A classy offer from Amicus, producer Milton Subotsky and director Peter Duffell ('The Far Pavillions', etc.) become a smart and elegant 'quadruple' with a strong cast (Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, Jon Pertwee, Ingrid Pitt, etc.) All provide performances with style, despite a low budget that results in a few 'non-special effects'. However, the most outstanding contribution is the one of Chloe Franks, of 7 years, who realizes of its part, that causes that the blood cools down. Only spoiled by the timid title desired in the film by its distributors, this underrated release, a cut above the shocking 'blood' n 'guts' shocker movie, is for those who appreciate a little thought with their horror. .
