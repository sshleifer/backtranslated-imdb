This one minute movie is possibly the first movie ever made. Other inventors had filmed actions before, such as Edison's movement photograph of a sneeze, but the Lumiere brothers developed a team that made the medium advance enormously. At that moment, of course, his "cinematographer" must have baffled his peers, including his subjects. In this first instance, the brothers record the employees who leave their factory, some of whom understandably struggle to hide their conscience from the camera. The Lumieres try to make the film more entertaining by introducing animals and a bicycle, but 'La Sortie Des Usines Lumiere' does not compare with the ingenuity of their latest films. The most interesting aspect of this short film is the selection of the brothers of a family ritual of the working class as its theme. Your choice is the initial evidence of your curiosity for all the people of the world, a quality that makes seeing your experiments immensely rewarding and fascinating today. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8
