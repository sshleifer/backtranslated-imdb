The first collaboration between Schoedsack and Cooper is a compelling documentary about the migration of the Bakhtiari tribe of Persia. Twice a year, more than 50,000 people and half a million animals cross rivers and mountains to graze. You will feel like a pampered wimp after watching these people herd their animals through icy water and walking barefoot through the snow to cross the mountains as they try to get their animals to walk on steep, narrow mountain roads.
