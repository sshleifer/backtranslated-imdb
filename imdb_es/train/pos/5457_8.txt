This film is one of the most risky black and white films of this era in the early 1930s, before the Hoyts Code was applied. It is the story of a beautiful young woman who moves to New York and heads to the top of the business using her body as a tool to get there. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwyck plays the beautiful young Lily Powers who does a pretty good job with her performance. Lily moves to New York and heads to the place of business sleeping with all the men. Stanwyck has an outstanding performance, since she is a strong woman who uses the men as once distributed, almost no emotion towards them playing as if they were pawns. Lily Powers is a woman who does not have love in her mind only power and money. <br /> <br /> I thought this movie was a little different from other movies I've seen because there's almost no background music. listened I think it's only because it's when people were first introduced to live sound and dialogue among the people in the movie. The few times that music is heard is during the beginning, since it shows us how it makes its way in the chain. The filming and the different scenes were fantastic! The director of this film made all the right angles and all the right tricks, making this film full of realism. <br /> <br /> This movie was, on the whole, a good movie. The end of this movie was not so good. as it should have been, but it did not ruin it completely. Baby Face had its slow-moving scenes throughout the movie, and perhaps some predictable parts, such as who it will lie with next. But this is an adorable movie that can be seen more than once and suggested to some people and friends.
