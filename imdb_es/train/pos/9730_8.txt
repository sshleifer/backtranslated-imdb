Reviews of UK newspapers seem to have focused on the fact that critics tend to know Toby Young, the journalist whose real life experiences this film is based on. The keyword here is "based". How To Lose Friends is a fictional romantic comedy. <br /> <br /> Sidney Young joins a prestigious gossip magazine in New York, where he proceeds to make farce after gaffe before finally understanding it well and doing it. This implies that it is being sold, and the film has some important points to make about journalistic integrity. However, they are not exaggerated: the main substance is still a comedy that focuses on Sidney's misadventures. The script has his cake and he eats it, since Sidney is a stupid and well-intentioned buffoon, at the same time he is an intelligent, skilful and moderately detestable writer. This contradiction is never such a big problem, since Simon Pegg (like Sidney) projects sympathy too well. <br /> <br /> Jeff Bridges gives little importance to the editor of Sidney, and Kirsten Dunst is quite anonymous as the eventual conflict. object of the affections of Sidney And, with respect to Megan Fox (who plays a hollow-headed bimbo star), I can only say this: just say, Miss Fox, and I will leave my wife, sell all my belongings and buy myself a plane ticket to take my place next to you as your consort. Of course, since I'm a fat 56-year-old English accountant, my offer may not be too attractive, but it's still there at the table anyway. Considering how short her career has been until now, one might think it's too early for Megan Fox to assume a role that mercilessly deceives the kind of actress she might become: however, she does it with gentleness , with some Skill, and extremely sexy. This girl will go far. <br /> <br /> There is unconditional support from a variety of experienced artists: Miriam Margolyes and Bill Paterson from the United Kingdom, Gillian Anderson and Danny Huston from the United States. <br /> <br /> There are several moments of laughter out loud, and I smiled almost all the time. As always, the word F makes appearances when it is not really necessary, although at least some of them are very funny.
