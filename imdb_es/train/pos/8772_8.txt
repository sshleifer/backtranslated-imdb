Director Raoul Walsh was like the Michael Bay of the 40s and years before. And I say it in a positive way, since I'm definitely not a fan of the Bay. His films are simply high-quality entertainment, just like the Raoul Walsh movies of his day. <br /> <br /> "Gentleman Jim" is excellent quality entertainment. In addition to a first class director, he also has a cast of first grade, with the main character of Raoul Walsh, Errol Flynn, in the main part. <br /> <br /> What surprised me was how well the boxing matches took the screen. They used a very dynamic camera work, which also made the boxing matches encouraging and exciting to watch, with the final championship bout against John L. Sullivan as the highlight. <br /> <br /> The biopics of the 40s and earlier were obviously very different from the biographies that are being done today. Modern biographies often glorify their main theme and show their life from birth to death and everything, mostly emotional aspects, in between. "Old" biopics were made the same as movies that were not based on real people from real life, which also means that filmmakers would often use a lot of creative freedom with the main character's personality and the events that happened in his / her life. This film is not only a biography of a boxing legend, but it is also a good portrait of the period when the illegal fight with the knuckles entered the modern era of boxing. <br /> <br /> Errol Flynn does a great job representing the real The famous boxer of life, James J. Corbett, also known as the Knight Jim. Not many people knew it, but Flynn did some really good acting jobs in the 1940s, of which this movie is one. Physically it also looks in top form. He also looks quite different, by the way, without his trademark small mustache in this film. The film also presents some good supporting actors and good acting everywhere. <br /> <br /> An excellent and entertaining movie that also stays really well today. <br /> <br /> 8/10
