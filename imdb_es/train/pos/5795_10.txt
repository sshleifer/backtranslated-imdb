This movie is my favorite of all time! You really have to see Michael Jackson in this wonderful movie !! I'm always on the moon, looking at it !! This is a movie that you really have to see, also if you're not a fan of MJ, because this movie writes, like Captain EO, E.T. and ghosts, a little cinema and musical history !! This wonderful movie, from Michael's pen, is a must! And: Smooth Criminal, it's really the most wonderful, exciting and amazing song I've ever heard in my life! Thanks Michael for this movie and I love you !!! MJ is the best musician to hit this planet, he is a good man and always brings flashes to your eyes, when you listen to his music! Please, if you do not know this movie, look at it and do not miss it, because it would be very bad for you if you missed it. -Film highly recommended, for each lover of the film-
