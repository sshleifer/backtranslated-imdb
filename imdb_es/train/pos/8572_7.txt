The first movie was good, but it is not as good as the wonderful animated classic that I found more moving and moving. This sequel is inferior, but it's not bad at all. Sure the slapstick is too much, the script has its weak points and the plot is a bit uninspired. But dogs are very cute here, and Eric Idle is hilarious like the macaw. The film is pleasing to the eye with a cinematic style and flashy costumes (especially those of Cruella), and the music is pleasant. The performance in its majority is very good, Ioan Gruffudd is attractive and Gerard Depardieu, although it has given better performances, it has fun like the accomplice of Cruella. But the best asset, as it was with the first movie, is the surprising Glenn Close in a delightfully exaggerated performance like Cruella, even more evil than before. In general, well 7/10 Bethany Cox
