['Hey, now I can not say that I&#39;ve seen all the movies of Jesse (Jesus) Franco, and it seems there are many of them, but this is one of the best (and strangest) of all. I would say that it is most likely that it was at its height in the late sixties / early seventies and lately everything has been too strange for me, and I find it hard to declare it. Anyway, this is like a big bad dream where parts of it seem to come true at several points. This woman is an actress or something, she acts in a Berlin theater where acts of &quot;false&quot; torture are performed for an appreciative audience (?!) And she seems to have this problem with dreams. The capture of what is real and what is not in this film is, apparently, what really is in a clear focus and what is not in the dreams. She seems to exist in a state of deja vu. I will not say that this makes much sense, but it is quite wild, strange and entertaining. The shots of Berlin make it look like a lonely and spooky place, so it adds to the atmosphere. However, the ending is extremely abrupt, the movie just finished and the tape went black, I guess there is no need for you to know it was over at that time. My copy was from the Euro-Trash collection of Anchor Bay, and I say, give me more Euro-Trash, I can not get enough of that garbage. But it&#39;s good shit.']
