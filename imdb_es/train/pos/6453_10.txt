The arrival of a world-famous driver of unexpected events and feelings in the small town. Some people are threatened by the way they handle the church choir and how the people in it change gradually. This movie is moving and makes you leave the cinema with a smile on your lips and tears in your eyes. It's about getting the best out of people and Kay Pollak has written an excellent script based on the ideas he has become so famous for. The actors are outstanding, we already know Michael Nyqvist, but Frida Hallgren was a new and lovely acquaintance for me. She has a very vivid face that leaves no one untouched. Per Moberg does his part as Gabriella's husband almost too well, he is also horrible. A single wish that he was going to be released to play a good boy one day, so we can see if he also dominates that character. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that will not leave you untouched. If you have not seen it yet, do it today!
