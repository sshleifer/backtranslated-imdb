['Jerome Crabbe has the main role in this movie. I saw this movie 6 times and I&#39;m still not tired of that. This movie is similar to Flesh + Blood in some aspects. Gerald Soetman is a great writer. He wrote all the Dutch films of Paul Verhoeven. Paul Verhoeven is one of the best directors. I&#39;ve seen all his movies, except Showgirls. My mom does not like it very much, but I do not agree. I think all his films are a walk to see, especially Total Recall and Basic Instinct. Jerry Goldsmith made some of his films that include Total Recall, Basic Instinct and Hollow Man. I wish Jerry Goldsmith never died. Dutch films are different but still nice.']
