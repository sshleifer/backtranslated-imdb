Cinematically, this movie sucks. The same goes for a lot of the acting. But I dont care. If there is a strong representation of what the 80's were like <br /> <br /> (anyway, for many of us in the inner zone) and what hip-hop, Zulu <br /> <br /> nation, and bankruptcy The dance was really great. Good music, excellent <br /> <br /> dance! It almost looks like a documentary from a bygone era <br /> <br /> when hip-hop was a way of life. It is also interesting to see New York <br /> <br /> looking like ground zero of a nuclear attack. Some viewers may be too young to remember that it was a poor and deteriorated city <br /> <br /> during the 70s and 80s. This is the best of all hip dance movies -hop / break <br /> <br /> that emerged in that period. Of course, the <br /> <br /> 80s are now considered a joke with all the bad TV shows and movies, but those of us who live it will always remember <br / > <Br /> lovingly for a time when music, dancing and graffiti were cool, me!
