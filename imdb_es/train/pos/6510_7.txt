I really like what I've seen of this caricature so far. Sure, the animation is not the best, but, frankly, I prefer to see this kind of cartoon style faster and cheaper than the old style done quickly and cheaply (which was starting to happen more often) is just a style which looks good when you spend a lot of time and effort). There is nothing wrong with the angular lines and the small eyes with black dots; In fact, I think it's really cute. As a child I never thought that the Scooby-Doo design was particularly adorable, but I think I'd like to know better. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Shaggy has always been my favorite character, and believe it or not, but I think he has the most potential for some depth. Of course, the program does not focus on the original theme of "Solution of mysteries", but anyway that was just an old tired formula. Do not get me wrong, I'm sure there are writers who could attract much more interest to the traditional activities of Mystery Inc. (which were late until late), but in the meantime, Show is a fun deviation from the standard. Shaggy and Scooby are still fun, but they are not just comedic relief anymore. They are still cowards, but they finally have the opportunity to use what appears to be intelligence (shock!). They are the same old loafers who have eaten too much, but now it seems that they continue with their lives with the help of Uncle Albert's inheritance. <br /> <br /> I used to find most of the original Scooby-Doo jokes. to be pure cheese and, unintentionally, hilarious at best, but this show actually exerts a capacity for real humor. Also, I never really like Casey Kasem as Shaggy, so the new actor does not bother me as much as other people. (Although I still think that Billy West was the best) <br /> <br /> In general, although it is not a big caricature in the field of all the history of cartoons, it is still an achievement among other incarnations of Scooby.
