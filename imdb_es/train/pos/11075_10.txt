['After reading the reviews of this movie, I understandably began to see it with a big doubt in my mind that it really would be a good thing. However, this is one of the best movies I&#39;ve seen in a long time. Most of the criticisms I had read said that the complicated plot made it too difficult to follow. And while some parts leave you confused, the end binds so many loose ends that you feel like kicking you because you&#39;ve lost a lot. It&#39;s not like &quot;Lock, Stock ...&quot; or &quot;Snatch&quot;, in the sense that it&#39;s not that funny (in fact, it&#39;s quite dark), and it&#39;s much smarter, in the way you see parts of scenes from different points of view (and, in one of the best scenes of the film, Jason Statham spends five minutes in an elevator discussing with himself). The way it is similar to the two films I just mentioned, is that it is full of memorable characters, specifically Statham, which offers a fantastic performance as a protagonist, and Ray Liotta, who spends most of the movie in Speedos, but It gives a great performance, however. If you have time, and then have time to think about the movie, and even watch it again, you really begin to see all the symbolism and suggestions that are presented throughout the film. I think it&#39;s fantastic, and that Guy Ritchie is a director of his game.']
