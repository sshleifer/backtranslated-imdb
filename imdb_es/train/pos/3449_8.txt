TACHIGUI: THE INCREDIBLE LIVES OF RAPID FOOD TAPES Japanese title: Tachiguishi Retsuden <br /> <br /> Director: Mamoru Oshii With: Toshio Suzuki, Mako Hyodo, Kenji Kawai, Shinji Higuchi, Katsuya Terada Narrated by Koichi Yamadera - - ------------------------------------- <br /> <br /> In 1995, Mamoru Oshii He unleashed his dazzling animated film Ghost In The Shell, which helped to consolidate the international acceptance of the anime, and also sank into the general concept of Andy and Larry Wachowski for The Matrix. <br /> <br /> The sequel to the film, Innocence (2004)), was the inaugural Japanese animated film to compete for the Palme d'Or at Cannes, and left it to spin around its style and innovative effects. , as well as its unfathomable plot. <br /> <br /> Always set the trend, Oshii has now introduced us to Tachigui: The Amazing Lives of the Fast Food Grifters? that has absolutely nothing to do with Ghost In The Shell, nor with the Japanese anime for that matter. <br /> <br /> Say hello to the creation of Oshii's "superlivemation": it's not exactly animation, nor live action. Instead, the cast held somewhere close to 30,000 snapshots, which were processed and digitally reconstituted in a seemingly simple paper-cut shape reminiscent of Balinese puppets. The movement itself is a stop-motion style with strides that echoes the sequences of the experimental Tetsuo: Iron Man (1988) by Shinya Tsukamoto. <br /> <br /> "I could not think of any method, except this one," said Oshii. In a recent interview with The Daily Yomiuri. "I realized that this project was not suitable for traditional animation." <br /> <br /> The choice of cast is equally enigmatic. Kenji Kawai, who also composed the superlative soundtrack, appears as a ravenous hamburger fan, while the renowned producer of Studio Ghibli, Toshio Suzuki, spends his screen time being murdered in a strange way. Others include Katsuya Terada, who dabbled with Oshii in Blood: The Last Vampire, and Shinji Higuchi, a special effects genius who worked on Godzilla movies. <br /> <br /> Koichi Yamadera's narration sounds like the stuff of a dry NHK documentary. ?? that belies the comic tone here, as well as Yamadera's extensive career that expresses stoic anim√© characters such as Spike Siegel in Cowboy Bebop. <br /> <br /> And the plot itself is a strange reimagination of post-World War II Japan in the context of several fast-food outbreaks, from soba ramen stores to gyudon support bars; American dogs in the hot food trays of the convenience stores of McDonalds hamburger chain restaurants. "Food is a primordial root of desire," Oshii said, by way of explanation. <br /> <br /> A new generation of consumers is included in the mix: the fast food sellers of the title, the people who do not like to pay for their tucker and they constantly tune their elaborate scams to qualify for free Munchies. <br /> <br /> Oshii said his hidden motive was a tribute to the "art" of eating food in the streets? something that is still considered a bit taboo in this country, and that in a way explains the use of "tachigui" in the title. <br /> <br /> The director of live action films (Avalon, Stray Dog) In addition to animation, Oshii has often blurred the definition between the two media. The result of the celluloid here is deposited somewhere in the gray area between both formats. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, the visual experiment here is as stimulating as it is irritating. Just do not ask what it is really supposed to mean; Oshii films, which are brain and innovative parts, are often not particularly clear about the story. Where is Oshii successful through a liberal dose of black humor? Here you will find Kentucky Fried Rat, death by hula-hoop, the fastest samurai burger chef in the world? and in the very nature of the film's surrealism. <br /> <br /> This is a man who differs from the influence of filmmakers like Godard and Truffaut, and perhaps owes as much to Andrei Tarkovsky as to David Lynch. Therefore, it should not surprise us that at one point a B-52 bomber makes a flight in a franchise that looks similar to Yoshinoya. The 54-year-old writer and director seemed to think that this was natural. "The Japan I described in the film may not necessarily be true to reality," he suggested. <br /> <br /> Of course. -------------- <br /> <br /> By Andrez Bergen
