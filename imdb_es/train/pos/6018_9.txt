I saw this in the early 70's (when I was 16) and, despite the slow set-up, the meetings, the riots, etc., once the desert section started, everything was in context and I loved it. (Still, he has aged very well). At that time I was in what appeared to be a small minority. All the criticisms seemed to concentrate on the lack of action and narrative. Happily I am no longer in such a minority. <br /> <br /> Skillfully (in a somewhat prophetic way) shows the political fragmentation, discontent, confrontation, brutal repression, commercialization and deception that lie ahead. <br /> <br /> The appreciation for this masterful film has grown, and I'm glad for that.
