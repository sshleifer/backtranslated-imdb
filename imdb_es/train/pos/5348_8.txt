Another excellent Arnold movie. This futuristic movie has a great action and is one of the best films of Arnie. Arnold is framed as a bad boy in this movie and plays a Game of Death. This movie is excellent and a great science fiction / action movie. I've always liked this movie and it has to be one of the best adventure films of all time. 10 out of 10! PERFECTION
