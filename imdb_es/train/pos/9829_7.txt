['This movie is amazing on many levels ... and none of them is the level at which it was intended to be impressive. <br /><br /> Just remember this: when you&#39;re watching Shaun of the Dead and other recent zombie movies ... be they good or bad ... THIS is the formula they are using. THIS is what makes zombie movies so great. <br /><br /> And what makes it BETTER than great is the story behind the movie. A simple search on the web will provide everything you need to know. <br /><br /> All in all, it does not stop. There is never a point where you think &quot;let&#39;s go, keep going&quot; ... it moves fast and it inclines very well. This is the sporty, small Italian number of zombie movies. <br /><br /> So horrible, it&#39;s wonderful! If your tongue spends a lot of time on your cheek ... rent it, buy it, love it. <br /><br /> As a great trivia note: if you are watching it on a DVD, you will notice that there are sound effects during the menu screen, below the musical score ... Well ... that&#39;s because that music was taken directly from the trailer. .. which is probably the only working copy of that music that still exists and that is long enough to make a loop.']
