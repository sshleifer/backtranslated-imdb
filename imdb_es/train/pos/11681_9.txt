Many of the reviews and comments I have read about this movie say that this is a fairly old movie and a performance by Clara Bow. Although the story line was quite typical of Clara's later silences, I still find it moving and incredibly funny. Clara plays a carefree Hawaiian girl who will stop at nothing to win the man she loves ... it does not matter if this man is married! Clara's lack of modesty was shocking in the day, but I think it lends itself to the sweetness and general fun of the movie. Although it is definitely not a brilliant plot (quite typical, really), this film is a good example of Clara's ability to make the audience laugh.
