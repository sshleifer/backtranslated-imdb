I would say that this film gives an idea of ​​the trauma that a young mind can face when a family is divided by divorce or other disaster. I would recommend this film especially to parents or people who plan to have a family. <br /> <br /> I thought the characters were attractive and very understanding from a multitude of dimensions. <br /> <br /> The frightening monster, although probably not terrifying to most adults, has a very real clue as to what might create the overactive imagination of a child facing unknown terrors. <br /> <br /> I found the movie is charming!
