I saw this movie on Sunday afternoon. I really liked that movie. I loved everything about it, from the sad moments of mothers and daughters to the scenes in which Mamie Gummer (Lila) cries for her bad decision to marry a man for her parents and not because she is really in love. I loved these moments because they were so real. At first I was very scared because I hoped it would not end up like Bobby, it was a great cast, but a badly written movie that had nothing real. But during the middle of the movie I felt completely different. You will laugh and cry, but in the end you will want to see Evening one more time. Trust me when I say SEE IT!
