There is so much garbage in cable movie channels that I came across a gem with this one. From start to finish, he grabbed me and deserves the best grades. <br /> <br /> The father of two children listens to "God" messages to kill people who are said to be "demons". <br /> <br /> When the opening credits showed the director as one of the actors that can often be a warning of a bad movie; Exceptionally it is the opposite here, since the drama does not stop from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> And there is not a moment in the movie where one is not totally captivated, as there are no unnecessary or unnecessary subdivisions. Plots, and the script is first class. <br /> <br /> All the actors offer totally convincing performances, especially the main children's actor, which is exceptional. <br /> <br /> This movie is at least as good as "Silence of the Lambs".
