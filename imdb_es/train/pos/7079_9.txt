I really enjoyed this. I am a big fan of movies that confuse your mind and leave you with many questions and ideas to debate, and this was a stellar example. But then, Terry Gilliam is always good at that (well, almost always, forget about Jabberwocky and The Brothers Grimm, okay?). <br /> <br /> I especially liked the way he handled the theme of time travel and avoiding paradoxes, the way events in the past and the future were intertwined and combined with each other. <br /> <br /> It was also very well done aesthetically: the direction of the art was really great, and I would like to see it on the big screen. The future scenes had a feeling similar to that of Brazil in many ways, and even the current scenes were often visually compelling. <br /> <br /> But perhaps the most surprising thing about all this is that I had two actors that I usually play. I do not like them very much, Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt, and both offered incredible performances here. Especially Pitt: before I had seen one or two movies that made me realize that I could actually act (contrary to what I had originally thought), but it really exceeded them. In fact, I found myself asking my friends at one point "Are you SURE you're Brad Pitt?" This is probably the most memorable performance of his career (although you have to admit that he may not be saying too much).
