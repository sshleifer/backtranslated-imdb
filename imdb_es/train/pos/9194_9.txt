The first time I came across this program was when I was in Japan for six months last year. I found it on the Internet when I was looking for subtitle dramas to help me with my Japanese. My host mother warned me to stay away because I thought it was strange, but I found it delicious! Koyuki showed such conflicting character traits and the spirit of Matsujun made me the day every time I connected! I saw it for the first time in "Hana Yori Dango", but I liked it a lot more in this! <br /> <br /> Although the characters are interesting and well developed, I was disappointed to find that they did not change much. a lot throughout the show. Their relationship grew, but in reality they did not. Even so, everyone had a great time (even for Fukushima!).
