I saw this movie when I was a child on television (thanks to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation) and I had nightmares about it for years. <br /> <br /> Trnka was one of the mentors of Bratislav Pojar, one of the Canadians. The best animators of the National Film Board. Pojar was, in turn, a mentor and collaborator for the great Drouin. If you like Trnka you should see "Night Angel". <br /> <br /> The symbolism is obvious, but skillfully used. The oppositions of beauty and life (the plant) are placed in opposition to the anonymity of the gloved hand. The poor puppet hero is condemned despite the lack of a political agenda. <br /> <br /> What I remembered most was the feeling of oppression in the decoration. The small room where the action takes place is the whole world of the character. The invasion of the hand is a complete violation of that world. <br /> <br /> Beautiful and disturbing movie. I found a copy of this and other wonderful Trnka shorts at the public library and showed them to my own children. You must see it.
