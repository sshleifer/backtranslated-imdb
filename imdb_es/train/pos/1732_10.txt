"Sandra, Making of a Woman" is a standout among the exploitation films, and it is for two reasons: (1) an excellent, but effortless, performance by Monica Gayle, and (2) the fact that Gary Graver was at the head of the project. These two talents, both very underestimated, make "Sandra" a film that should be seen. <br /> <br /> Another key element of the success of the film is its realism: there is nothing false or "Hollywood". about this set-in-california movie. It is truly a piece of life. The modest house in which Sandra lives at the beginning of the film, the simple dresses that the character uses, the scene in which Sandra wakes up in the morning to find Uschi Digart jumping in the door of her house, and Sandra sits in the sofa without doing anything. up, while Digart tries to sell her some cosmetics, looking really like she has just woke up (but at the same time beautiful), the harmless and extravagant Sandra realizes that she likes to make love to her while wearing a bra, the apartment of a room in what Sandra displaces: all these elements of the film seem totally real, and as such, the viewer is attracted to Sandra's little world from the beginning and immediately becomes interested in her and wants her to succeed. Sandra also advocates free love with eloquence and dignity and gets away with a lot of class. <br /> <br /> This movie could have easily failed in less competent hands, and it could have exploded in any of the usual Sexploitation Instructions, but the Garver / Gale team ensures that "Sandra" is not just the creation of a woman, but also that of an excellent movie.
