I thought this was an absolutely charming movie. The story seems to be a slightly disguised autobiography of John Waters: Pecker's greatest gift is his ability to find beauty in unexpected places. Edward Furlong is doing well up front, but the best performances are from his grandmother, Mink Stole (a hilarious cameo) and, of all people, Patty Hearst. I think the critics are very far from this base. They seem to be taking Pecker's worst assessment of his work as a gospel, when I think the film clearly states that he is a promising artist.
