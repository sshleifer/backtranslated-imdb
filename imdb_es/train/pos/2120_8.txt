James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan play co-workers in a gift shop in Budapest who do not like each other, not knowing that they are friends of the bride who have not yet met. <br /> <br /> A very charming romantic. Comedy, played in a very attractive way by its two nice stars and a very anxious cast to please. The story is well written and the film has that romantic innocence (I do not know how to explain it) that today's movies do not have. Obviously, this can be compared to the recent You've had mail, and the original wins in every way. <br /> <br /> This is mandatory to see every Christmas, I can not think of a better way to start a Christmas. Feel that this little gem.
