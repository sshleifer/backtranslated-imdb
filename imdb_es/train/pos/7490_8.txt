Until today I had never seen this movie. It was filmed on the sets of Old Dark House and Frankenstein and concerns a small Bavarian village where supposedly giant bats are sucking the blood of the villagers. <br /> <br /> Frankly, it's a very good movie that has an atmosphere to spare. and a cast that will not give up, Lionel Atwill, Dwight Frye, Faye Wray and Melvin Douglas playing a character called Brettschnieder that interests me since that was my great-grandmother's maiden name. <br /> <br /> This is a carefully modulated movie that has suspenseful and witty liners that accumulate slowly for its brief run time, only deviates when about ten minutes before the end they realized they had a Limited time to wrap everything up. From that point to the end, it's a straight race to the end with very little of the fun that preceded it. <br /> <br /> Leonard Maltin and IMDb show a run time of 71 minutes and warn about shorter impressions. The problem is that IMDb and Maltin may be wrong, and in this case I think they are, since one source I trust more says that the total execution time is 67 minutes (The Overlook Film Encyclopedia) Discuss this I know which is crazy, but most of the prints that are available tend to run around 60-63 minutes, the amount of missing material is considerably less if it only lasts 67 minutes. Personally, I think it will not matter much since they are a maximum of five minutes and I very much doubt that he makes or destroys the film. <br /> <br /> Whatever the execution time, if you like old and squeaky movies, doing, by all means, see this movie, it's a great dark and stormy night movie.
