Although others have commented that this video is only an edited version of the two programs: "Fire in Space" and "Living Legend", if you see the original programs, you will see that the dialogue of this video edition was eliminated. I found this video version much better because scenes and lines were added. I would say if you want to see the program in its original version, see the video versions on VHS. They have more to offer the fan than the original episodes on DVD now. Another good video is Conquest for the Earth, which had more Galactica 1980 scenes than the broadcasts themselves. In general, I qualify this as a 10 because it gives more to enjoy than what the networks wanted to show in the interval of time they gave to the producers.
