The short film that begins this film is the true image of a guy named Gary, who apparently took himself at random in the parking lot of a television station where Gary works in the city of Beaver. Gary is a little "different"; He is an imitator and drives an old Chevy named Farrah (after Fawcett). Behold, the filmmaker receives a letter from Gary some time later, inviting him to return to Beaver to get some images of the local talent show he has organized, including the amazing performance of Gary as Olivia Newton Dawn. Oh my. The two shorts that follow are the story of Gary, the same one you just saw, the first is played by Sean Penn and the second by Crispin Glover entitled "The Orkly Kid". If you're in the mood to make fun of someone, this is definitely the movie to watch. Most of the time I laughed with laughter, especially the performance of Crispins that could definitely stand on its own. When it was over, I had to rewind the movie to see once again the real Gary and all his brilliant idiocy. Although Olivia was the center of attention, I would have liked one of the "fictitious" shorts to take a punch in Gary's Barry Manilow's impersonation, which was equally ridiculous.
