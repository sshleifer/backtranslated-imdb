The Australian Fred Schepisi (A Cry in the Dark) directs this comedy / romance that is fun, relaxing and set in the spring. You will laugh while watching this movie. Tim Robbins (Shawshank Redemption, Dead Man Walking) is an auto mechanic, Ed Walters, with a high IQ, which increases with the help of Albert Einstein, Walter Matthau (Grumpy Old Men) and his academic friends Nathan, Kurt and Boris . You can tell them by their prep shoes. Meg Ryan (without sleeping in Seattle, you have mail) is Catherine Boyd, Einstein's niece who is a competent mathematician, but not so sure. Maybe it's because she's surrounded by all that genius. She thinks that if she marries someone with a high IQ. your children will have a high I.Q. also, but she does not know what she wants. Between the cute smile of Tim Robbins and the beauty of Meg, this is a refreshing movie. I love sweet stories. People of all ages should enjoy this movie. Catherine is committed to the idiot James Moreland, who works on animal behavior, but is very burdened. It is a situation of love at first sight, between the mechanic and the mathematician. Ingenious lines and subliminal lines! The cinematography is beautiful. Princeton, New Jersey is beautiful in the spring. With all the help of all those brilliant men, Catherine falls in love with Ed, not knowing that he is a car mechanic. <br /> <br /> Favorite scenes: Ed does a multiple-choice test in front of a crowd with the help of Einstein. Nathan, Kurt and Boris. Ed and Einstein mounted on the bike. Nathan, Kurt and Boris leave all the research animals free! <br /> <br /> Favorite phrases: Albert Einstein: "Do not let your brain interfere with your heart". Ed Walters: "When was the last time you said" Wahoo ""? Catherine Boyd: "Well, I'm sure I do not know." This is a refreshing movie, I recommend it. I have the tape and I will see it from time to time.
