In Arlington Heights, IL, we never had a cafeteria in any of the elementary schools (1961), so I rode my bike home from school for lunch and I always saw this game. Right, I was 11 years old, but I thought it was the best! I would draw hidden images on my blackboard and see if my family or friends could find it. I also remember winning wonderful cars (Pontiac or Oldsmobile) if the contestant got the final game of the hidden image. I even had the home version! <br /> <br /> I wonder why this game lasted so briefly. I enjoyed the music and the hidden images, the only one I could get was the lemon hidden as part of a bridge over a garden stream. <br /> <br /> The really good memories are related to camouflage.
