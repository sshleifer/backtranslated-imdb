This movie was great. <br /> <br /> The plot was absurd. <br /> <br /> The action sequences created. <br /> <br /> But, as long as you can relax enough to laugh, it was a completely exciting game combining Keystone Cops and the Lone Ranger. <br /> <br /> The bad guys were more foolish than bad. The good ones were not too good. Black actors interpreted normal characters instead of black stereotypes. <br /> <br /> The inclusion of a baby gave it a good touch. The sympathy could have been a bit difficult otherwise. <br /> <br /> I have to disagree about acting. It was, in general, very good. I really wanted to hit Judge Reinhold. <br /> <br /> And, after all, is not that what makes a good movie, wanting to hit Judge Reinhold?
