I really can not say much more about the plot of the movie that has not yet been said. I have not seen the movie in about 25 years and his memory has never left me. I've been looking for it everywhere. I have done net searches for him in the past but I left empty. Last night I was thinking about the movie again and I was trying to remember who was in it, but when I saw it for the last time I was only 10 or 12 years old, and I was not even sure if it had the correct name of the movie, so I decided do what. Another search and I finally found this view. I was right. If anyone knows where I can get a copy of this wonderful movie to share with my family, please allow me to send it now to tawnyteel@yahoo.com. I would appreciate it very much. And for anyone who has not seen this movie and has the opportunity to do so, it's worth it.
