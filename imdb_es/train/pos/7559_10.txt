['This movie is so good! Despite Carmen Electra, this has to be one of the best movies I&#39;ve seen in a long time. Jamie Kennedy is simply amazing, and Loren Dean plays a crazed movie star very well. The plot is also great. Everything is very real, which is scary. It says it&#39;s a drama here, but this is one of the funniest dramas I&#39;ve seen in my life. Go see it.']
