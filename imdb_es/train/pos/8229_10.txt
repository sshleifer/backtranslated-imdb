This is a fairly slow-paced movie, which slowly builds the story of a former stripper who starts a new family life with a complete stranger. The viewer feels slowly that there is something wrong here ... <br /> <br /> I really loved this movie even though in the end it leaves a slight bitter taste. He is intelligent, of good rhythm and very well acted. Both Philippe Toretton and Emmannuelle Seigner are deeply interested in their characters. <br /> <br /> The little son "pierrot" is also very moving. <br /> <br /> A thriller that does not look like one. A very unconventional film, a very particular atmosphere throughout the film, although you may feel uncomfortable a few times with a couple of scenes. <br /> <br /> I will give you an 8/10!
