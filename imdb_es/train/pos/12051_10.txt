This movie gave me nightmares for months and I am 17 years old. This is the most terrifying movie ever made! That is not exaggeration! I saw this movie at school in English classes and nobody else was scared, which surprised me. After reading other reviews, I'm glad I'm not the only person who found it so scary.
