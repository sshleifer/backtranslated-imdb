Okay, this is the deal: if you get offended easily, you'll want to stay far away from this one. There are some painfully funny moments in the movie, but I probably blushed as much as I laughed. Actually, I probably blushed MORE than I laughed. And if I was not literally blushing on the outside, then I was blushing inside. If there is absolutely nothing in this movie that embarrasses you, you simply have no shame. I guess that's a badge of honor or not. <br /> <br /> I will not deny that I laughed a little, but this is a movie that I just can not give a general recommendation because of its purpose. If I had to say: "This movie is hilarious, take a look!" and a sweet little old woman who goes to church goes to the theater and suffers a heart attack during one of the explicitly graphic sexual situations, well, that's something I do not need in my conscience. <br /> <br /> So, how hot is it? Hmm, try about 100 times worse than The Wedding Crashers. Honestly. My mother would have left during the first scene. I feel it is my duty to warn you at least what you can expect. <br /> <br /> Here is a clever comedy, but that is what I expect from the man (Judd Apatow) who intervened. Freaks and Geeks and Undeclared. I'm in favor of making fun of Michael McDonald; the only man whose hair and beard are white enough to give Kenny Rogers a run for his money. Paul Rudd proclaiming: "If I hear that Ya Mo Be There I'll burn this place once more", it's funny, but it's one of those things that most of the audience will not appreciate. <br /> <br /> And when we see a quick 3 seconds flashback of Steve Carrell singing along with Cameo's Word Up, I laughed for a good two minutes after the joke ended, while most of all laughed and Then they forgot about it. <br /> <br /> Oddly enough, despite the trend, there is an admirable moral in the story. The film does not show Carrell as a strange loser just because he is a virgin. He is really portrayed as a nice and admirable character. Sure, it's a little weird. After all, it has a framed poster from Asia, "more video games than an Asian child" and a toy collection that features the Million Dollar Man BOSS, but they never make us believe that there really is something wrong with the fact that it is a virgin Oddly enough, there is a bit of a message "it's okay to wait". <br /> <br /> But man, oh man, keep in mind that this increases your R rating as much as possible. . That was undoubtedly the intention of Apatow. According to him, he just let some of the guys (particularly Rogen and Malco) improvise and talk the way they normally talk, all in an effort to find many new ways to be dirty. If you can handle that or talk like that, then you'll love the movie. <br /> <br /> I'm not a big fan of bad words and sexual jokes. I find that subtle and intelligent humor is much more entertaining than about 200 uses of f-word or fratboy sex discussions. But that's me. As I said, there are some absolutely hysterical moments here, but you should ask yourself if they are worth sitting in one of the most vulgar movies you can see in the theater. I just do not know how interested women will be in what men argue while playing poker. Honestly ladies, you do not want to know. If you have ever been curious to know why some girls think that boys are disgusting, well, this gives you a good idea. <br /> <br /> There you have, my humble and honest opinion on what to expect. Be that your guide. It definitely should not be seen with your Sunday School class, mom, grandmother, any family member of the opposite sex, children of any age, or anyone who is easily offended by excessive blasphemy or an explicit sexual conversation. If you see it with any of the previous points, apparently you have no concept of what it means to feel uncomfortable.
