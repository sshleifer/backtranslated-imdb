From a modern sensibility, it is sometimes difficult to watch old movies. It is annoying to have to see the stereotyped wall flower librarian, take off his glasses and become pretty and stupid to win a man. Especially a man so superficial and inconstant. Obviously, he is a player (I would not trust him to stay true to it) who does not want to calm down, who only looks at attractive women and calls them "baby" (yuck!). Even after she totally changes her appearance and life for him, he only goes to her after (supposedly) is rejected by another woman and learns that Connie spent all her money renovating a boat for him. He wanted her to face him, not to chase him pathetically! His sudden conversion in a few minutes was totally unreal and did not work for me. <br /> <br /> Apart from that secondary plot, I liked the movie. How do you not like sailors dancing with each other? (You can say they were from San Francisco ...; D) The "rehearsal" dance was great, seeing Ginger Rogers fall and getting out of the "right steps" was great. The last dance scene "Face the Music" with the beautiful costumes and the decorated art deco was beautiful. And I really enjoyed "We Saw the Sea" (although they used it too many times, as if they realized it was their best song). <br /> <br /> Anyway, the plot was a bit weak, like most musicals (IMO), and the songs were fine, but the dance was worth it to watch the movie. I wish they could have shown some images of San Francisco since the movie was supposed to be set. <br /> <br /> It is also strange to see a naval film so happy that it knows what Hitler was already doing at that moment. hour. I have to try to suspend all knowledge to immerse myself in a land of invented fantasy.
