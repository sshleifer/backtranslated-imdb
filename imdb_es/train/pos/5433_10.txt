This movie is one of my favorites of all time. Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen and Douglas Fairbanks Jr ... what a deal. Not to mention Sam Jaffe as Gunga Din. Drama, action, adventure and comedy, all in one. The final scene of the battle to this day gives me chills and the end always leaves me crying. If you have not seen it, I highly recommend it.
