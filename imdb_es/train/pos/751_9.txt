This is one of the best films of Jodie Foster and is largely ignored due to the misconception that the general public has as a movie for teenagers. It has wonderful performances, particularly a fight scene between Jodie and her mother, played by a convincing Sally Kellerman. The three girls who play with Jodie's friends are somewhat amateur, but I think it's worth seeing.
