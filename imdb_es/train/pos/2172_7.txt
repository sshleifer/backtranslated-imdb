'Mad Dog' Earle is back, along with his sad stuffed sack, Marie, and that fickle Velma. The same goes for Babe and Red, Doc and Big Mac, and even with Pard, the landscape chewer. The only thing missing is a good reason to remake Raoul Walsh's High Sierra 14 years later without rethinking a line or a frame, and doing it with talent remarkably one or two steps lower than the original. (In place of Walsh we get Stuart Heisler, for Humphrey Bogart we get Jack Palance, Ida Lupino Shelley Winters, and so on through the credits). The only change is that, this time, instead of black and white, it is in Warnercolor; Unfortunately, some people consider it an improvement. <br /> <br /> Did I die a thousand times can it be unnecessary? and lower? but at least it is not a farce; The story still works in its own theatrical terms. Earle (Palance), fresh out of the pen near Chicago, drives west to headline a great job devised by the sick leader Lon Chaney, Jr. knocking down a hilltop position. On the way, he almost collides with a family of Oakies, when he is in love with his granddaughter; the wound is maintained even when he discovers that she is lame. When you get to the cabins where the rest of the gang crowd, find the fans fans in the throats of the other, as well as Winters, which is launched towards him (like the dog). When waiting to receive a call from his inner man at the hotel, Palance (to the chagrin of Winter) offers to pay an operation to cure the deformity of the girl, a gesture that fails. Then, the surgical attack against the complex becomes a bloodbath. At the moment, Palance ventures into the cold Sierras ... <br /> <br /> It is a quite absorbing story, executed competently, that lacks the distinction that Walsh and his cast brought in 1941, the year in that Bogie, with this role and that of Sam Spade in the Maltese Falcon, became a star. And one last heretical note: those mountains look beautiful in color. <br /> <br />
