A sophisticated contemporary fable about the tensions that work to loosen and, ultimately, unleash marriage vows. The main impulse of the narrative arises from a "homily" pronounced by a country priest after the marriage vows of a young cosmopolitan couple from Milan. In it, the future course of marriage is explained, which gradually gets rid of the stress of modern life. The "moral" of this story within a story is that for a marriage to work well, both now and in the past, it has been necessary for that relationship to be supported by family and friends. This film was a relative box office success according to Italian national standards. It's a pity that this movie is not available on DVD or VHS.
