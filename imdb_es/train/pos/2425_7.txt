I caught this film at IFC and enjoyed it, although I felt that the editing work was a bit harsh, although it may have been deliberate. At first it took me a while to figure out what was happening at the beginning because they seemed to go for a bit of a non-linear presentation of the plot of Pulp Fiction. Although it seemed a bit forced. I certainly think it's worth watching the movie, but I think I could have done a little cleaning. Some scenes just do not seem to make sense after others. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised to see the rating here as low as it is. It is not exceptional, but it does not have really serious problems. I gave him a 7/10. The film showed at least that Laurence Fishburne can act when he wants. They must have told him not to do it in the Matrix movies.
