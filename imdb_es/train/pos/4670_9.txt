Those who only remember the late Sir Peter Ustinov as Hercule Poirot or a circuit professional would do well to look for this charming piece of late sixties satire. Ustinov plays a condemned embezzler (we see him for the first time during his last day in prison, where he is preparing the tax declaration of the governor of the prison) who, feeling that the future is in the computers, poses (by a clever document of identity theft) as he is a computer expert and intends to infiltrate an American multinational. <br /> <br /> Ustinov (who co-wrote the script) is in top form, as is the charming Maggie Smith, here unusually chosen as an accident-prone cockney - sparrow carrion bird. Bob Newhart also presents a funny performance as a suspicious executive who has designs on Maggie Smith. In addition, Karl Malden is reluctantly satisfying as the womanizing boss of Ustinov and Newhart. <br /> <br /> What do I like most about this movie? Not only is it a well-thought-out "caper movie," it's also a small and moving love story; Ustinov and Smith are very convincing since the two misfits stumble over love (the whole scene involving the deck of cards is particularly effective). <br /> <br /> So, what do you not like? Well, the script is not more computer literate than most movies (that is, almost nothing) despite the fact that it captures the feel of business computing from the '60s' iron'. There are also a couple of small flaws in the plot that are not likely to be noticed until the second or third visit, but I think these are minor problems. <br /> <br /> As I said, this is a movie that is worth looking for, and after having seen it once, you will want to see it again at regular intervals. <br /> <br />
