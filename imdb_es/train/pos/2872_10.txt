In my opinion, this is an absolutely romantic Disney masterpiece. If you ask me, the stepmother (voice of Lucille La Verne) was truly diabolical. You will have to see the movie if you want to know why. On the other hand, despite the fact that she did many cleaning tasks, Cinderella (voice of Ilene Stanley) was a very beautiful lady. For me, the landscape was beautiful, the cast was well chosen and the writing was strong. Before finishing this, I would like to say that everyone involved in this movie did very well. Now, in conclusion, I recommend this absolutely romantic Disney masterpiece to all those who have not seen it. A good time is waiting for you, so go to the video store, fix it or buy it, relax with a friend and watch it.
