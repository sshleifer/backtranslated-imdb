I went to find this movie in the typical obsession of the fans. I just wanted to take a look. I did not expect much of anything. After all, a musician, an actor and a screenwriter? It is not possible that so much talent resides in a person. Right?? <br /> <br /> Bad! Leaving aside the obsession, it quickly became one of my favorites. The line of the story and the characters are not lost in the typical Hollywood special effects. History holds your emotions and drags you. As the credits pass, you suddenly realize that you were stuck to the end. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, the acting seems a little exaggerated. However, I think it has been done with a comical intention and very appropriate for the character. Otherwise, I would not have expected the level of face-to-face action. <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing more than once. I find myself laughing hysterically or panting unexpectedly for something I missed or forgot the first or the second time. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie completely. Feel free to enter with your doubts, but I'm sure you'll find a place on your shelf.
