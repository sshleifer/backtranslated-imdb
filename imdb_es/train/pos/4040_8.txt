An inventive exercise, of suspense in claustrophobia. A Japanese thriller that imposes itself on a challenge by being completely acclimated in two rooms. Not completely successful, but tense, surprising and well acted. One could find the movie something that reminds of SAW? Two men trapped in the room and facing each other? but unlike that movie, he dares to keep his premise and keep the hero locked in his cell throughout the film. It's like watching a laboratory experiment. Some may find the content suspense tedious, but this reviewer found it fascinating. The sound and images of the film are surprisingly well made. This is undoubtedly a good movie to show a good home video system. Right for a night film festival, when one is in a paranoid mood. He certainly kept me awake that night.
