Yes, a dance horror thriller ... with Shelley and Debbie! Goody Goody. This is crazy and unbridled fun and part of the 60s cycle that leaked in the 70s. Launched as a double feature with Burt Reynolds comedy, FUZZ, this crazy scare is so insane as to be completely entertaining . As a mix of DAY OF THE LOCUST, THE OTHER and BABY JANE, I suggest that any possible viewer take the idea that this is almost destined to deviate and sit down with someone you can yell and rub elbows with all the time. Actually, get drunk while you watch it ... with cheap champagne. Again, with many cinematographic ideas of the 30s, it is also about cheating; The struggle of the time for a better life becomes bitter and is twisted by the emotional madness that falls in the murder. But this is just crazy. It also reminds me a lot of BLOODY MAMA the De Niro - Winters Shlock Fest that makes this film look positively glorious.
