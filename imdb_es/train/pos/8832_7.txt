"Hey Babu Riba" is a film about a young woman, Mariana (nicknamed "Esther", in honor of a famous American movie star), and four young people, Glenn, Sacha, Kicha and Pop, all from 15 to 17 years old in 1953 Belgrade, Yugoslavia. The five are committed and crazy friends for jazz, blue jeans or anything that seems American. <br /> <br /> The close relationship of the teenagers is touching and, ultimately, a sacrifice is made to try to help one of the young people. The group that has fallen into unexpected difficulties. After the change of the communist policy, they split up in 1985 (the year before the making of the film). <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the movie with some reservations. Subtitles for one thing were difficult. Especially at the beginning, there was a series of dialogues that had no subtitles at all. Perhaps the rhythm of conversation required it, but he could not always read the text and absorb the scene, which meant he did not always understand which character was involved. I saw the movie (a video from our public library) with a friend, and neither of us really understood a part of the story about the acquisition of streptomycin for a sick relative. <br /> <br /> This Yugoslavian coming-of-age film effectively conveys the sense of invulnerability of teenagers, idealism and strong and loyal ties to each other. There is a main flash forward, and it was intriguing, keeping me guessing until the end as to who these characters were with respect to the 1953 cast, and what really happened. <br /> <br /> I would rate it 7 out of 10, and I would like to see other films by the director, Jovan Acin (1941-1991).
