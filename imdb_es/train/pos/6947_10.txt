24 is the best television show! It is an incredible television series with incredible suspense, excellent plots and unforgettable characters. And the first episode of all is my best evidence. Because it's only the first episode, just the introduction, and you're hooked because of the plot and the continuous twists and turns. <br /> <br /> Jack Bauer is a federal agent who is assigned the protection of Senator David Palmer. He can not trust anyone because the people of the CTU can be involved. And, when these events happened, her daughter: Kimberly escapes from the house to a party. But ... <br /> <br /> At the end of the episode, you want to see more, and more, and more. <br /> <br /> It's just the first of all, and it's excellent.
