Maybe "Presque Rien" is not the best movie ever made ... But it's better than many of you have said. I still have not seen a homo-thematic movie better than this one. <br /> <br /> You, the Americans, are used to watching very narrative films, with a beginning, development and clear results. But European films are less narrative, but they make you think and feel a lot. <br /> <br /> Many of you did not understand the meaning of the movie. The purpose of this is not to show us a simple "summer". Amorous film, "with commercial characters who" fall in love and live happily ever after. "Summer vacations and the beach are just a backdrop, and this film is aimed at all young children who may feel identified with those children. /> <br /> Maybe some of you did not understand this movie well, due to its 3 Parts, shown as flashbacks, These 3 moments are: - Summer in Pornichet, when they meet and love - After a year and a half Living together in Nantes, Mathieu does not go to a psychiatric clinic, tries to commit suicide by taking something, and Cedric takes him to the hospital, and later, he appears talking to a psychiatrist to find the reason why he did that. - The last part is when Mathieu returns to Pornichet, only in winter, to think about how your life has changed, how it has become your life and try to find yourself. <br /> <br /> It is possible that some people can not understand all this well, because all the scenes are mixed among them. But anyway, as I said before ... this is not a funny movie. If what someone wants to see is meat, for that, we have Belami movies. <br /> <br /> Presque Rien, what he wants to show us, is how cruel life can be for a child who is not sure. about their feelings and I'm not sure what to do in life. Mathieu just wants to leave home and try to live the kind of life he thought could bring him happiness. But what seemed perfect at the beginning ... then it is not as good as he thought, and he was disturbed, and feeling that he has lost the way of his life. He is lost and does not know what he really wants to do, or what makes him happy. Finally, he becomes depressed and tries to commit suicide. <br /> <br /> So, funny? It is not a funny movie. Very hot scenes? Only a few ... but this is not an entertainment movie. It's about feelings ... friendship, love, happiness, unhappiness, pain, depression, loneliness ... I, like many others, identify with Mathieu's life and problems, and that's what the director wanted to do. .. a movie that shows us the cruel reality of a child's life. <br /> <br /> For me, the best homo-thematic film of all time.
