"The Tenant" is Roman Polanski's best film, IMO. And I love "Chinatown", but this one is much more original, unconventional and downright spooky. It is also a great black comedy. Some people that I have shown this movie to have been "very disturbed" by that later, so you are warned that it affects some people in that way. Polanski does a great job playing the lead role in "The Tenant", as well as directing it.
