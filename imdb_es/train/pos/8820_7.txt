I watched the movie while I was recovering from a major surgery. Although I knew it was just a "B" movie, a western space, I loved it. It may be missing the flash of high-dollar productions that, however, sustained my imagination and gave me great escapism. Unfortunately our society has a lot available, discounting small attempts is too easy. In the same way that I can enjoy a performance of Shakespeare even in an elementary school, I can appreciate many levels of achievement for art. I am a policeman and I found an affinity with the retired LAPD. Dreams like his chase me that I will not be able to respond at the time of the crisis to save someone else's life (or mine). While it was a romantic ending where Farnsworth brought out the bad boy (predictable), he needed a small happy romance where good can triumph. My world is really too cynical.
