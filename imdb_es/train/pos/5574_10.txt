Peter M. Cohen has a winning satire in the mating game, he twisted and turned inside out. The critical blow of the film in mainstream media publications as "offensive" and "obscene" only serves to highlight its intensity as a refreshing and concentrated dissection of people's sexual activities and passions. It's in the tradition of what I call a "reality-based" satire that follows the steps of "In The Company of Men," "Chasing Amy," "Your Friends and Neighbors," and "Two Girls and a Guy." Cohen's dialogue is hilarious and I was continually intrigued by the way he captured the true rhythm of today's conversations. Brian Van Holt, Zorie Barber and Jonathan Abrahams are three unrelenting and unrelenting sex-obsessed predators who, along with their newly-married companion blade (very well played by Judah Domke), are converted on their own terms by a female predator ( Amanda Peet). Below the satirical surface hides a romantic comedy much more satisfying than most studio products coated with sugar.
