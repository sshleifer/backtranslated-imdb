<br /> <br /> Then, not being a poet, I do not have a real way to convey the beauty and simplicity of this documentary. Goldsworthy's effortless movement, while molding the beauty of nature in his own work, is captivating. Watch him gathering the rods in a net hanging from a tree in the foreground for a few minutes while talking about his work, and then receiving the reward when the camera cuts to the general plane. Surprise yourself with the ease with which it operates and then understand the uselessness when a light breeze breaks down the entire network. <br /> <br /> Goldsworthy's genius apparently has no limits, since his inspiration is nature itself. It is in the essential change of nature that his work, although complete in its own sphere, is completed.
