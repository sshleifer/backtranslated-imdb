Moonwalker is a Fantasy Music movie that stars Michael Jackson with different segments. I will qualify each segment individually. <br /> <br /> Segment 1 opens the movie with a music video. The music video is a concert of Michael Jackson performing the song "Man in the Mirror", the music video also shows montages of historical characters like Gandhi, Martin Luther King JR, John Lennon and more. The first segment was a good option to open the movie. I liked the song and I also loved the montage of the historical figures. I even loved the message in the song. I give the first segment a 9/10. <br /> <br /> Segment 2 shows a montage of the start of Michael Jackson from Jackson's five until his solo career. The montage that I thought was well done, I liked the animation they put into it and I also loved their options of songs like "I love you back, Beat it, Thriller, you can feel it and how you make me feel". The only thing I wish they could have improved a bit in one of the songs of the set is "We are the world". The reason why all you see is the raindrops and in those drops there are images of Michael Jackson and the choir of celebrities, but it is a bit difficult to see the choir. Apart from that, the segment is still good. I give it a 9/10 <br /> <br /> Segment 3 is the Bad song. You're probably thinking that it's Michael Jackson's video of bad, good, yes and no. This segment is the music video but it is made again by the children. The segment was nice but it was not as good as the other segments. I give it a 6/10 <br /> <br /> Segment 4 is a short film by Claymation Music that takes place after the children's version of the bad call "Speed ​​Demon". The short film is about Michael Jackson being chased by his beloved fans and the press, and he disguises himself as a rabbit and rides a motorcycle to try to escape them. The key to the chase sequence was excellent, but in some parts of the film the Claymation characters seemed a bit fake when interacting with real people. Also at the end of the clip from nowhere, Michael Jackson's rabbit costume comes to life and is dancing with him. I liked dancing but that was like nothing. I give it an 8/10 <br /> <br /> Segment 5 is the music video for Michael Jackson Grammy winner "Leave me alone". The music video is about the media that look at the personal life of Michael Jackson and Michael Jackson feels that they will not leave him alone, no matter how much he has proven to be innocent. The music video really speaks (but keep in mind that this happened before the sexual abuse of the children, this is only about the rumors of him in the 80s), but I did not feel that this video should be in this movie because it is a movie for children and me Do not think that children will understand what they are singing. I give this music video 8/10 <br /> <br /> Segment 6 takes us to the main story of the whole movie called "Smooth Criminal". Michael Jackson plays a gangster who uses his wish-list power as a crime figure to protect children (including John Lennon's son, Sean Lennon) from an Evil Mobster called Mr Bigg (played by Joe Pesci). The segment that I thought really took out the movie, especially when he danced and sang the song "Smooth Criminal" with a group of criminals. I also thought that the special effects were good. The strange thing about this segment is that children who walk with an adult man never explained why. Also the character of Joe Pesci talks about drugs and what he plans to do with them. I mean, why do you talk about drugs in a children's movie? On the other hand it was good. My qualification for this segment is an 8/10 <br /> <br /> Segment 7 is the final segment of the entire film. The end of the film is with Michael Jackson singing a version of the Beatle song "Come Together" and then, during the credits, we see Michael Jackson singing with Ladysmith Black Mambazo. Michael did a good version of "Come Together" and I think it was a good idea to include a group of good singers with a talented musician like him. My rating is 9/10 <br /> <br /> This movie is a good Michael Jackson movie, I think it really highlights the children's imagination. The movie is almost as imaginative as the Beatles animated movie "Yellow Submarine" if you like Michael Jackson and are ready for a film with a lot of creativity. This is the movie. My overall rating for this movie is 8/10
