I really like this movie, but it's a fact, that you can not understand it, unless you're from the former Yugoslavia. Most of the actors are dead and those were the best actors of the former Yugoslavia. I appreciate that this movie is now on Divx and I can have it in my collection. Macedonia. Serbia Montenegro. Bosnia and Herzegovina. Croatia. Slovenia. <br /> <br /> All this was former Yugoslavia, a melting pot of the Balkan nations. It could be a dreamland, if Slobodan Milosevic, Franjo Tudjman and other nationalists do not poison the mind of the nation with their sick ideas.
