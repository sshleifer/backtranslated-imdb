This is a generally good movie, with a good story, great actors and great songs. The cinematography was unfortunately bad. One of the weakest points of the film is the annoying string of sequences copied from Pretty Woman. Why? Does it hurt to try some originality, Abbas? Mustan? Someone? <br /> <br /> The film is about a newlywed couple, Raj and Priya (Salman - Rani). Priya can not conceive after an accident she had during the previous pregnancy, and finally they decide to use a surrogate mother, who will take her son. They choose Madhubala, a vulgar prostitute played by Preity Zinta. The movie is not really realistic, I mean, is not it easier to adopt? And even if they choose a girl, does that mean that the man has to sleep with her? Have you heard about insemination? Anyway, I suppose if the writers had heard about all this, the film would not have been made, so the concept is apparently intentional. <br /> <br /> Salman acts very well. It's nice to see him play a serious character. But his character suffers from unnecessary and cheap dialogues about his great love for his wife and how difficult it is to sleep with another woman. Come on, it's corny and unrealistic. Rani is almost fine; She is generally effective and tries to do something with paper, but Preity Zinta completely eclipses her. <br /> <br /> The film belongs to Preity, who steals the show in style with her impeccable performance. She makes the transformation from a noisy prostitute to a sensitive woman easy and natural. She lives the film, it thrills her and makes her love and admire her at the same time, partly because of her role, partly because of her magnetic and positive personality. This is one of the best performances of his career. There is no doubt that he has more talent than his industry contemporaries. She should do more of those roles. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie only highlights what I said earlier. It is heartbreaking, exciting and very well acted. Look at it for Preity. <br /> <br /> 7/10 for the movie! 10/10 - for Preity!
