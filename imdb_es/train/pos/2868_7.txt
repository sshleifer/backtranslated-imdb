First of all, I must say that I am Portuguese and it is not usual for me to spend my time watching Portuguese films, probably one every year or even none ... <br /> <br /> ... And the reason is The idea is almost widespread among the Portuguese is that the national images are horrible, very close to the worst! However, in the last decade, I began to surprise when we returned to the fun of the 40s, when "Leão da Estrela" and "Costa do Castelo" were among the best in the world, with films like "Pulsação Zero" or " Sorte Nula ", by director Fernando Fragata and also with some actors and music in common. <br /> <br /> This one is also good, not the same type because it is not a true comedy; in fact, it is officially a drama, a women's drama that has some unexpected fun parts, funny characters cause or funny things that happen to them, like the hypothetical trip to the Caribbean just to get laid. <br /> <br /> The plot works and may surprise us sometimes; the actors are fine, regular locations such as punctuation; But the truth is that everything makes sense, so we can consider it as a good effort for the national cinema, which seems to be starting from the ashes like the phoenix. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a Portuguese film, you can surely choose a better option, but you still have to measure it.
