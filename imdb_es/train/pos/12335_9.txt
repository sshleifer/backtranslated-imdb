Warning: contains a spoiler. Horned plot and in many cases of terrible performance. Fontaine is great, but some others, particularly Richard Ney, Ivy's husband, are extremely wooden. Ney lies in bed, dying of arsenic poisoning, with each hair in place. However, the movie is so juicy and so exciting. More faithful to the book than most of the films of his time. Choosing Joan Fontaine as a poisoner (and an adulteress, which was equally shocking at the time: I'm not kidding, children) was a masterful blow. She is your usual Joan Fontainey. As the murderers were supposed to do, she dies by falling "feet above the ground in an empty space".
