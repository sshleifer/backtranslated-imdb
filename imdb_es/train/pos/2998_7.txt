I enjoyed watching this movie at TCM and seeing a young William Powell (Philo Vance) playing a detective as he did with Myrna Loy in "Thin Man Series". In the 1930s, William Powell played in the series Philo Vance and in this picture, the famous veteran actress Mary Astor (Hilda Lake) becomes one of the suspects in a murder / suicide case in which a man named Archer Coe (Robert Barrot)) was found dead and Archer was in a room that was locked inside. Ralph Morgan, (Raymond Wrede / Secretary of Archer) gave a great supporting role and it was the brother of Frank Morgan who appeared "In the Wizard of Oz" in 1939. Eugene Palette, (Detective Sgt. Heath) appeared in some of these Philo Vance films and also gave a great performance in "Robin Hood" with Errol Flynn. Always remember, the least likely actor could be the killer. Enjoy a great classic from the past.
