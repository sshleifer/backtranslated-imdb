The gang of roses. "Every rose have thorns". <br /> <br /> A mixture of old western and hip hop, perfectly mixed. The styles of clothing, the landscape and the plot are adapted to what the director wanted. <br /> <br /> Plot: in five years, twenty-seven banks were stolen and then disappeared without a trace. Now, a small town in the west is under siege, and one of the first victims is Rachel's sister. The Rosa Gang is ready to ride again. And this time it's personal. <br /> <br /> Rachel (Michael Calhoun), Chastity (Lil 'Kim), Maria (Lisaraye), Zang Li (Marie Matiko) and Kim (Stacey Dash), five female holsters who separated After five years of ride together. When Rachel's sister is murdered, she ends up reuniting her friends once again and riding a path of revenge. <br /> <br /> A good version of Western Muck. (If you've seen Bad Girls, well, this is a bit better in terms of the female characters). <br /> <br /> I gave it 10/10 because the characters, the plot and the stage did it for me. .
