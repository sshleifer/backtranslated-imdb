['I came across this series rather by accident. After half a episode, I was hooked. American Gothic was a dark and strange series with Gary Cole as the mysterious and probably evil Sheriff Buck, who is trying to control his illegitimate son Caleb, played by Lucas Black. I was impressed by the sinister sheriff of Gary Cole and Lucas Black impressed me even more. Caleb, Lucas Black, could face Sheriff Buck, one of the most terrifying characters ever created for a television series. I have rarely seen a child actor with as much presence or talent as Lucas Black. If you did not have the luck to see Lucas in American Gothic, look at him in Slingblade. <br /><br /> It was a remarkable show with many ambiguities and mysteries that were never explained during his short career.']
