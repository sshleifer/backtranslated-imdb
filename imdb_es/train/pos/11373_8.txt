['Here is a rarity: a modern day film about a serial killer who has no fight scenes, no one looks dead, no car chases or loud noises ... and takes place in Russia. There are only two short action scenes, but they are horrible. <br /><br /> The rest of the story is detective work, and the amount of bureaucracy the poor detective had to go through to solve the murders. This is a very grim movie, and &quot;grim&quot; best describes the personality of the hero (Stephen Rea), too. However, the story is not depressing and it is very interesting in every way. <br /><br /> Rea is outstanding as the determined, troubled-looking detective. Jeffrey DeMunn is downright scary as the killer. The Russian accent of Donald Sutherland is suspicious, but he plays the only character in this film who has some warmth. <br /><br /> Once again, history is peppered with liberal agendas, here and there, with not one but two references to the bias against homosexuals, the total validity of secular psychology, the police and government officials are rude / raw / intolerant, yadda, yadda, yadda <br /><br /> Otherwise, it is a low profile, refreshing, intelligent crime movie. This is a somewhat unique film that is probably not very well known but the people who have seen it like it a lot. Since it is based on a real life account of this killer, it is even more chilling. Do not go through this just because you do not have anything about it.']
