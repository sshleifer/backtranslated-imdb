This nice minor noir has a superior cast and many memorable scenes. The great distraction is the complete disregard for authentic accents. The Spanish characters in the film are played by a Frenchman (Boyer), a Belgian (Francen), a Greek (Paxinou) and a Hungarian (Lorre). And to top it off, Bacall is supposed to be an English aristocrat! Despite these absurdities, the performances are very good, especially those of Paxinou and Lorre. But the scene in which Boyer, Paxinou and Lorre meet, and speak with tremendously different accents, is a real problem! And I guess, seeing that they were alone, they should have spoken in Spanish anyway! It seems rather strange that the Warner Brothers could not find any Spanish-speaking actor in Los Angeles! Of course, Hollywood has often had a policy of "any old accent will do", my other favorite is Greta Garbo (Swedish) as Mata Hari (Dutch), who falls in love with a Russian soldier played by a Mexican (Ramon Novarro). Maybe they should have obtained Novarro for the "Confidential Agent"; I would have been excellent in the role of Boyer or at least in Francen's (which would have saved a lot in the dark makeup budget).
