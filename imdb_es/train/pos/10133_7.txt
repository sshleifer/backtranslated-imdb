Why did it sound like the husband called her Appy? It ruined a great episode and, therefore, I can only give it a 6. Proper grammar and pronunciation are essential for a movie. <br /> <br /> It was very hellish, with all the skin torn, although I do not know how anyone can survive. Without skin, the skin is a vital organ for the body, the largest organ in reality and without us we would die. The truer a horror movie is, the more spooky it can be and the more entertaining it is. <br /> <br /> I admit that the stories of the great horror directors are very disappointing and very mediocre. <br /> <br /> 6/10 come on, Yankies, put your English on par!
