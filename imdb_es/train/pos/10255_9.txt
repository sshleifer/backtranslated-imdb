This movie is the first of the six infamous guinea pig movies and is one of the best. At the same time, it seems realistic and unrealistic, only knowing that the film is false. The story is about a woman who was captured and tortured in many different ways. A man at the beginning of the story receives a letter with no return address, and includes a manga video, which shows the torture. The men who capture her are testing the limits of a human before dying. Some scenes are shocking, like the scene of the eyeball and others are not as shocking as the girl who gets punched 100 times, because she sees blows in almost every movie. This movie has a lot of blood, so I would recommend this to people 17 and older. <br /> <br /> 9/10
