It helps if you understand the Czech, you can see it in the original language and you understand the Czech obsession for 'The Professionals', but if not, 'Jedna ruka netlaska' is another great Czech film. It's fun, dark and extremely nice. The greatest compliment that I can pay is that you never know what will happen next and it even stays well in the second and third viewing. <br /> <br /> In a small country, the Czech Republic has produced an incredible number of world-class films and literature, from Hrabal, Hasek and Kundera to the films of Menzel, Sverak and many others. Czech humor by its very nature is obscure and often intransigent, but often with a naive and warm feeling behind it. This movie is just that, it is unpleasant and it deals with the less kind aspects of human beings, but underneath everything there is a beautiful story full of promises, good intentions and optimism. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it and in most other projects Trojan and Machacek are involved. Enjoy it, it's a movie made precisely for that reason. Anyway, it's as close as the Czechs will get to writing a truly happy ending ...
