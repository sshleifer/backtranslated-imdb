This, and the "hidden fortress" are the Kurosawa that I like the most. I do not distribute 10 as sweets, but this certainly deserved it, in any case. Although it is quite long (like all Kurosawa), it coincided with the problem that bothers me in most of his films; The story is often too slow and evolving slowly, containing scenes that are unnecessary or too long without any real purpose for the story or description of the character. Dodesukaden gave me the same experience that, for example, "Hidden Fortress" did; despite its duration, there was not a minute to cut. <br /> <br /> In a way, this is also a very unusual Kurosawa movie, it has no history, but there are many small independent stories that are based more on the description of the character than on the story, unlike any another Kurosawa movie I've seen so far. He also relies heavily on dialogue, which he uses brilliantly (especially in the story between the father and son who plan their "new house"). <br /> <br /> Even so, what makes this a masterpiece is how the subject, as tragic as it is, can be described in such a human and friendly way, without pointing at anyone at any time. From the beginning to the end, it offers the whole emotional scale from laughter to tears in perfect balance.
