Undoubtedly, Private Lessons II is the best movie I've seen in my life. A Japanese import (bad) translated into English, it's a joy to see it. It does not make much sense, but that does not matter. It is the best comedy that exists without ever being intentionally funny. <br /> <br /> The movie is rare and is not available on video, but I've seen it a couple of times late, late at night with pay cable. My recorded copy has been viewed dozens and dozens of times as slowly, person by person, I present this gem to the world. <br /> <br /> Joanna Pacula plays the tutor / lover of Ken, our hero. (Apparently, she was only working for her check). Ken is played by Goro Inagaki, of the Japanese pop band SMAP, who gives everything and has great hair throughout the film. Stacy Edwards, of the fame of "In the Company of Men", also appears in the film and is likely to be happy to have found another film work afterwards. <br /> <br /> At least three presentations are needed to find out what the plot is. By repeating it, you can enjoy elements like the abnormal amount of vases that Ken has in his house (at least 50) or that Ken wears a shirt with corn husks embroidered at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> The movie is predictable, but highly quotable. My friends and I recreate full scenes. Yes, we seem to be losers and what we are ... but we are losers who have seen "Private Lessons II". Be one of the ten people in the world who have seen this movie. You will thank me.
