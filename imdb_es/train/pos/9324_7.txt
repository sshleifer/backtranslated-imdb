['I have read some of the reviews and I am a little sad that many of the stories seem overlooked. It is easy to do because it is not a book, it is a movie and there is only so much that can be done in a movie, in the United States or in Canada, or anywhere. <br /><br /> Colm Feore does it, at least for a recovery of &quot;F @ g-Hag&quot; like me, a great job not only to play the gay man of the &quot;friendly neighborhood&quot; but also to get sick. I mean, the man really can not get much paler! However, you may never know it from the strip down near the ... um, final. <br /><br /> If you need something decrepit, there are some SKing movies that you may like. <br /><br /> Being the daughter of an Alchoholic in Recovery, the drug addict brother (David Cubitt) was the trick for me. I&#39;ll give him credit, he grew up fast and, believe me, that&#39;s good. And, as an aspiring writer, moimeme, I can unearth many of your ideas and general visions. But I&#39;m more prosy than poetic. <br /><br /> It may be easy to please, but I enjoyed it. A pretty story pretty well organized by Canadians, surprise surprise. He simply played the &#39;Movie of the Week&#39; line, losing it for not being so strange, GREATLY grateful. And it was pretty well portrayed.']
