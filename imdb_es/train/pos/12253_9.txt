['This has long been one of my favorite adaptations of an Austen novel. Although it is definitely not in the same category as the spectacular &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, &quot;Emma&quot; is an exuberant and relatively faithful television version of Austen&#39;s novel, especially considering its short duration. The biggest change between the novel and the film is good, since the unnecessary snobbery that Austen exhibits at the end of the story is removed here and replaced by someone much more like the character of Emma in the rest of the book. I thought that the characters chosen to represent the roles were well chosen. Kate Beckinsale crosses the thin line between youth and social snob with a grace completely lost in the &#39;96 version of Gwyneth Paltrow. The blond locks of Samantha Morton adapt to her attitude and character, since the simper that accompanies her role in the previous characterizations is replaced by the Harriet we know from the book. Mr. Knightly&#39;s role is carried out extremely well in my opinion; both the seriousness and the gentle compassion with which the hero is painted in the novel are present here in this sumptuous and neglected film.']
