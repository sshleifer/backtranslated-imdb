['In 1945, and after a series of solid propaganda pieces from World War II, Errol Flynn&#39;s control over the US box office. UU It began to decline, so, despite the increased burden of diminishing appearances, he embarked on a series of films belonging to that genre that had made his name: the swashbuckler. The first of them was really good - ADVENTURES OF DON JUAN (1948) - but it also proved to be his last Hollywood protagonist vehicle with big budget. The rest of his days wielding swords they spent wandering all over Europe: in England for KIM (1950), THE MASTER OF BALLANTRAE (1953) and THE DARK AVENGER (1955), in France for ADVENTURES OF CAPTAIN FABIAN (1951) and Italy for the aborted THE STORY OF WILLIAM TELL (1953) and the little seen CROSSED SWORDS (1954). However, Hollywood called him for the last time to his old marine habits, although for a universally modestly budgeted image instead of a production of Warner Brothers &#39;A&#39; to which he was accustomed when it was at its height ... <br /><br /> Still, the glorious Technicolor cinematography jumps off the screen here and, while a skinnier older Flynn may resemble the pale shadow of his former self, his red-haired protagonist, Maureen O&#39;Hara, has a field day as a Buccane leader who has nothing to do. deep down she craves romance and wants to be treated like a lady. Anthony Quinn was still a few years away from his protagonist vehicles bigger than life, so here he is usually seen as the bad guy: the pirate captain Roc Brasiliano, a role he attacks with enthusiasm. Like THE BLACK SHIELD OF FALWORTH (1954) - one of which preceded this one - AGAINST ALL FLAGS brings me back to my precious childhood days of constant television when old Hollywood movies were the order of the day in both Italian local as in the neighboring channels <br /><br /> As far as I know, this could have been the first pirate movie I&#39;ve seen and I shudder to think of today&#39;s generation of young people, supposedly believing that the PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN trilogy is what buccaneering is all about. As I said before, AGAINST ALL FLAGS may not be the best pirate thread that has been brought to the screen, but anyway is a solid example of this prolific genre. Today, the loving persistence of the infant Indian princess (Alice Kelley) towards her pirate captor Flynn may seem silly but the rest of her, even though she is clearly not climbing the heights of THE SEA HAWK (1940) and THE BLACK SWAN (1942), to mention the best marine companies of their respective stars, is a fast and reasonably attractive rhythm. By the way, the film is then remade as THE KING&#39;S PIRATE (1967) with Doug McClure. <br /><br /> To make it worthwhile, the unprecedented success at the box office of that modern and unappetizing franchise is probably what led movie studios to be reluctant to dust off their catalog titles and publish them on DVD and, in fact, AGAINST ALL FLAGS on she was the only Gem in a set of &quot;Pirates of the Golden Age Movie Collection&quot; by Universal, which also consisted of dark scum like BUCCANEER&#39;S CHIRL (1950, with Yvonne De Carlo), DOULE CROSSBONES (1951, with Donald O&#39;Connor) and YANKEE. BUCCANEER (1952, with Jeff Chandler)! Value for money, perhaps, but until now, I&#39;ve only purchased the film Errol Flynn from other sources; Even so, if the mood hits me in the future, I might want to dip into similar marine adventures like MUTINY (1952) by Edward Dmytyk, the BUCCANEER DE YANKEE and PIRATES OF TORTUGA (1961) mentioned above.']
