['This movie is very funny. However, the actors really make the film go far. Without revealing the plot, I would describe it as a new cult favorite for the Princess Bride who should stand the test of time. You can see a completely different side of Robert DeNiro in this movie! (It&#39;s worth the ticket price just for that!) All the elements are there, from adventure to romance, and a well-placed comedy. <br /><br /> People of all ages will enjoy it. (My parents even did it!) Good special effects can scare little ones. Good date of the movie. Ideal for a little escapism. <br /><br /> He deserves an A. (I hope he does well at the box office)']
