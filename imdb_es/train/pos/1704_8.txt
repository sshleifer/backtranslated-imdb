"I moved here to get away from this kind of thing!" The sheriff of the small town laments. <br /> <br /> "Does this happen a lot in Chicago?" Your deputy asks. <br /> <br /> Well, no, not really. The plot is that a group of Martians confuses a Halloween broadcast of War of the Worlds by Orson Welles as an account of a true Martian invasion, and concludes that they need to participate in the action! What follows is a lot of setbacks related to the fortuitous attempts of the Martians to conquer the city of "Big Bean, IL". All conclude that they are children with very good disguises, except the Sheriff's daughter and her friend, a boy in a duck suit. <br /> <br /> The Martians themselves are comical, and it gives the impression that they are not a threat to them. Nobody but themselves early enough. It's a fun family movie.
