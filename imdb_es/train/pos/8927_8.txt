Clair Denis returns to the theme of separated parents, men who follow their own happiness in a determined way, without paying attention to the emotion of their family, but while Nénette and Boni from the previous film live in a narrow world of Marseille, our Louis Trebor's exam in The Intruder takes us from a remote location along the Franco-Swiss border to half the world, to Korea and Tahiti. Once again, the film begins midstream, with Louis, in his sixties, facing a sick heart while trying to maintain a high level of fitness. We learn that Louis is no stranger to violence, since his booth is the place for smuggling and the frequent shooting. Louis sleeps with a large knife under his pillow with rifles nearby. Denis is in no hurry to move the action forward, and we must patiently develop our understanding of Louis from his daily activities and the few people he deals with along the border, including a son, Sidney (Grégoire Colin, almost unrecognizable with long hair and wisp of a mustache) that rejects him as a "lunatic": he is shown as a dedicated father of two. There are many short scenes that, although they do not seem to be related, create an impression of Louis and his surroundings. Ms. Godard's camera work is exciting here. The controlling metaphor is Louis's heart transplant, so he goes to Korea and then to Tahiti to find another son, not found, and where Louis's new heart rejects him as Sidney rejected the previous one. We are used to the brief scenes in Denis' film that are inexplicable: Nénette straddling Boni feeding herself with a spoon; a tour of the shot of Boni's father and then the briefest of the images of Boni with a bullet wound to the head; a scene of Louis in a morgue with a corpse with the scar of a transplant but the body of Sidney. The implication, of the last two, is a rejection, real or imagined, by a father, kills something indefinable in a child.
