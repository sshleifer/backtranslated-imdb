['The movie actually has a pretty good story, but it gets stuck in several key places. It&#39;s almost as if the director compiled the film without taking the time to make some essential cuts in the film. Dennis Quaid does a pretty decent job in his role ... but clearly something is missing in several key scenes. <br /><br /> This 2.5 hour movie could have been reduced to approximately 2 hours. And it probably would have been a much better movie if I had not had the feeling of being thrown together. <br /><br />']
