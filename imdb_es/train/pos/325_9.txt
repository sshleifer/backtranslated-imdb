This is a great movie, especially when compared to the sometimes annoying fervor of current political-minded filmmakers. A film that can easily combine sex, gender relations, politics and art is a rarity these days. While the optimism of the 1960s can not be recovered, I think we can at least learn a lesson in the energy and charm of the film. I do not know what those who label the movie "boring" were seeing: there is so much content that never remains as the same film for more than 15 minutes at a time.
