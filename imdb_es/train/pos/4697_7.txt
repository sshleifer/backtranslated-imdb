Michael Keaton is "Johnny Dangerously" in this takeoff of the gangster films made in 1984. Maureen Stapleton plays his sickly mother, Griffin Dunne is his DA brother, Peter Boyle is his boss and Marilu Henner is his girlfriend. Other stars include Danny DeVito and Joe Piscopo. Keaton plays the owner of a pet store in the 1930s that catches a child who steals a puppy and then tells him, in a flashback, how he became the owner of the pet store. He went to the robbery at an early age to perform a pancreas operation on his mother ($ 49.95, special this week) and started working for a mob boss (Boyle). Johnny uses the surname "Dangerously" in the world of gangsters. <br /> <br /> There are some funny scenes in this movie, and Stapleton is a riot since Johnny's mother, who needs an organ in her body sometime. Peter Boyle as Johnny's boss gives a very funny performance, like Griffin Dunne, a straight arrow DA who does not "play ball" with crooked Burr (Danny De Vito). As Johnny's nemesis, Joe Piscopo is great. Richard Dimitri is a standout like Moronie, who tortures the English language, but you have to listen to it instead of reading it. What makes it fun is that he does it all with an angry face. <br /> <br /> The movie gets a little tired towards the end, but it's worth seeing, and Keaton is great as the good boy / bad boy Johnny. For some reason, this film was underestimated when it was released, and like Keaton's other gem, "Night Shift", today we do not hear much about it. With some performances and scenes that are real gems, you'll find "Johnny Dangerously" immensely nice.
