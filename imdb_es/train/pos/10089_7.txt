. . . or write on a computer keyboard, they would probably give this homonymous movie a grade of "10". After all, no elephant is shown being killed during the movie; It is not even implied that anyone is injured. On the contrary, the ELEPHANT WALK teacher, John Wiley (Peter Finch), complains that he can not shoot any of the pachyderms, no matter how threatening, without a government permit (and his tone suggests that such permits are not within the realm of probability). In addition, the elements conspire, in the form of an unusual drought and an epidemic of human anger, to leave the plantation of Wiley vulnerable to total destruction by the Elephant People (as the natives call it) to close the story. If you see the current version of EARTH, you will discover that Elephant People are not doing so well today.
