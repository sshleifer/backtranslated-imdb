This film is one of the most underestimated of its time. When you see this movie, you are full of action, and when something is not really happening, the humor is unparalleled. Brilliant script for a movie that was made to give us a bloody mix, a game show where the criminals are the contestants, and a near future where the general public is thirsty for blood. Nor Arnold does not disappoint us with some of his best liners. I do not want to spoil anything for you, but I'll tell you when Arnold says "I'll go back to the line." You get the best response from everyone in this movie. I hope you enjoy this gem as much as I do.
