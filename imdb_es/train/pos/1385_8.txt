I saw him at Cinema MK2 Hautefeuille one night after his first public screening in Paris. A very beautiful film about three teenagers of 15 years, all of them in the same psychological stages. Many of the scenes allow us to return to our adolescent age and our first feelings about sexual relations. it is possible to imagine that the director would like to reduce the first sensual feelings of the girls to lesbianism, but even in that case it does not corrupt the possibility of the story. Sometimes you can find the movie a bit slow, but it is what creates this intimate atmosphere. Funded to young talented actresses, special mention with Floriane and Marie, very convincing. There are many small details, but this film also allowed me to discover what synchronized swimming is: it impresses!
