What a pleasant surprise: a sequel to Disney DTV (Direct to Video) that is really GOOD. "The Lion King 1 1/2" is a comedy affair involving the favorite meerkats and wild boar, Timon and Pumba. Start with them watching the original movie and making comments, until Timon complains that "we're not here yet." After fighting for the remote control, Timon and Pumbaa decide to tell the audience "their story". They start the new movie and the laughter begins. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I was losing hope in Disney. Most of their direct video rate has been aggressively horrible, with the story lines desperate to capitalize on the original. "1 1/2" decides to try something different: tells the original story from a new point of view. Okay, add some things, like where Timon came from and how he and Pumbaa met, but it's an interesting concept. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella perfectly recover the bond and friendship that made us love them in the first film. There are also some crisp parodies of movies (including a scene that simultaneously simulates "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" and "Luke's Cold Hand"), and the script is full of gracious memorable lines. <br /> <br /> Added Julie Kavner ("The Simpsons") is Timon's mother, and Jerry Stiller as Uncle Max, a little crazy about Timon. Matthew Broderick appears as Simba, and his "teen" scene reminded me of Ferris Bueller. Everyone does well, especially Robert Guillame (is that how you spell it?) Like Rafiki, who emanates more and more Yoda words in this movie (Timon comments on this several times). <br /> <br /> 'The Lion King 1 1/2' is a perfect alternative option for those who tire of the Shrekification of animation. 10/10
