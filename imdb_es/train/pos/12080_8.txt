Julia Ross (Nina Foch) agrees to take a position as secretary with the rich Hughes family to overcome her boyfriend and leave her. Almost immediately they drug her and send her to the family farm in Cornwall. When she wakes up, they keep telling her that it is Marion Hughes, that she has been mentally ill and has kept her locked up ... but why? You'll probably guess why, but you will not mind because this is fun. <br /> <br /> Along with "The Narrow Margin" and "Face Behind the Mask", this is one of the best B photographs ever made. (The B images were low budget images made quickly with low budgets and no major stars). It is as long as it should be (only 65 minutes), it is well directed, it is fast and it is exciting. In the end he stumbles, which I found a little too unlikely to buy. <br /> <br /> Foch (a good actress) is fine, but Dame May Witty is great and George Macready is excellent (and scary). ) like the villains. Well worth catching. A perfect example of how you can make a great movie with a small budget.
