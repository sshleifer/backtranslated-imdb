['Shintarô Katsu, best known for the Zatôichi films, once again stars in this third and final Kenji Misumi film (best known as &quot;Lone Wolf and Cub&quot;), directed by Hanzo &#39;The Razor&#39; Itami. violating the &#39;ghosts&#39; and discovering murky things in the treasury of the Shogunate. Hanzo&#39;s &#39;plot&#39; was becoming a bit old-fashioned and repetitive. What was once novel in the first movie was not anymore. Thanks for having more humor. I&#39;m glad they decided to stop at the only trilogy (I&#39;m looking at you, Lucas) <br /><br /> My degree: b <br /><br /> DVD extras: simply trailers of the 3 Hanzo the Razor movies <br /><br /> Eye Candy: Aoi Nakajima unties both tits, Mako Midori only hers.']
