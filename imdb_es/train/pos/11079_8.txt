I always like to watch movies that make you think, and I do not just feed the answers to your audience. "Revolver" is one of these movies, and although many reviewers have stated that it is difficult to follow, with a little concentration and an open mind, I have it. First time. It is true that it does not compare with other fanatics of the mind like "The Usual Suspects" or "Memento", but in its own right it is an intelligent and stimulating film. <br /> <br /> Another thing that I really liked about this movie is how beautiful it is. Each scene, each camera angle seems to have been thought for years. If you see it, you'll know what I mean. <br /> <br /> So, to conclude ... look at it with an open mind and you can enjoy it. If not, well, nobody said "Revolver" is for everyone. And those are my 2 cents.
