I went to see this Finnish film and I must say it's one of the best movies I've seen this year. The intrigue consists of 5-6 different stories, all made the same day in a small Finnish town. The stories come together very well at the end, remembering, perhaps, a bit of the way in which the Tarantino films are made. Most of the actors performed very well, which is certainly needed in realistic dramas of this kind. I especially enjoyed the performance of Sanna Hietala, the main actress, and Juha Kukkonen. I realized by the way that IMDB has the wrong information about Sanna. His name, as you will have noticed in my review;), is not Heikkil√§, but Hietala.
