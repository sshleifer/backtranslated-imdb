Good for one night's entertainment, but the plot was not convincing. Garrison's affair with the First Lady was unreal and without passion; The president was a cardboard cutout. And who were the real villains anyway? Nothing was developed or explained sufficiently. I still do not know why they wanted to kill the president or how the mole got involved. The villains had no name and were underdeveloped, so you never felt involved in their plan. Michael Douglas and Kiefer Sutherland did their best to inject some reality into the story: the persecution and the confrontation were good. But Kim Basinger and Eva Longoria were incredible in their roles, Basinger lacked character and it was not possible that Longoria had been a Secret Service agent. This could have been a very good movie but somehow it got lost, with too many unanswered questions. Disappointing in general despite some very good scenes. And they used the 'West Wing' set for the White House scenes? - I kept waiting for CJ or Charlie to appear!
