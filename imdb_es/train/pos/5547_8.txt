Strangler of the Swamp was created by PRC, a low-budget studio, and it's certainly one of the best movies I've seen. <br /> <br /> A man who was hanged for a murder to which he did not commit refunds as a revenge phantom of the people who accused him. He uses a rope to strangle his victims and after several deaths, including the old man who operates the ferry through the swamp, disappears. The granddaughter of the old man takes the ferry herself and also falls in love with one of the local men and they decide to get married. <br /> <br /> This movie has many nebulous atmospheres, which makes it very spooky. <br /> <br /> The cast includes Rosemary La Planche, Blake Edwards and Charles Middleton (Flash Gordon) as the choke. <br /> <br /> The swamp choke is a must for old horror fans like me. Excellent. <br /> <br /> Classification: 3 stars and a half of 5.
