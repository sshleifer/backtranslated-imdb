"The Grudge" is a remake of Shimizu's own series of popular horror films in Japan. Shimizu knows that he is not dealing with anything new, so he does what any smart person would have done in his place: he forgets logic and focuses on giving viewers a fun ride. He uses commonly known clich√©s associated with ghost stories, but Shimizu plays with these elements in an imaginative way. The non-linear narrative is not a mere trick, but an interesting way to present sequences from different perspectives. In the end, all I can say is that if the only purpose of a horror movie is to scare the audience (in the same way that a comedy is to make people laugh), this movie was successful. I saw him in a theater with an audience and it was fun to watch the spectators go crazy with this. You probably do not play so well in your living room.
