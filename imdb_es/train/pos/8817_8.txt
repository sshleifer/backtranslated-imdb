French production in which the main film directors of 11 countries were invited to create short films of 11 minutes that convey their thoughts on the events of September 11. <br /> <br /> Movie segments vary widely in content and quality. Two allude to the complicity of the United States in terrorist acts (in Chile against Allende, who died on September 11, 1973, represented in the segment by the British director Ken Loach, and in Palestine by Israelis backed by the United States, shown in the segment by the Egyptian director Youssef Chahine). Two more recall other destructive acts (a Palestinian suicide bombing in Tel Aviv, shot by Israeli director Amos Gitan, the Japanese "holy war" against the west in World War II, by Shohei Imamura). <br /> <br /> Ironies abound in several stories. The shadows that darken the New York City apartment of an afflicted old man suddenly disappear when the towers of World Trade plummet into Sean Penn's piece of land, bringing man momentary joy. But in this bright light, he can finally see that his wife has really gone. In Mira Nair's film, based on a real incident, a missing young man, also in New York City, the son of a Pakistani family, is first presumed to be a fugitive terrorist, but later shows a hero who sacrificed himself trying to save others in the towers. <br /> <br /> There are moving moments scattered everywhere. Loach has quoted San Agustin as his exiled Chilean man, in the sense that hope is based on anger and courage: anger for what things are, the courage to change them. Imamura tells us that there is no such thing as a holy war. Samira Makhmalbaf shows a teacher with her little Afghan schoolchildren, exiled in Iran, trying to tell them about the events that just happened in New York. But, understandably, they are more impressed with an important event in their refugee camp, where two men have fallen into a deep well, one dead and the other with a broken leg. This is a comprehensible, large-scale tragedy for 6-year-olds. <br /> <br /> Idrissa Ouedraogo, from Burkina Faso, creates a drama in which the son of a sick woman sees Osama bin Laden in his village and gathers his friends to help capture the fugitive terrorist, to obtain the $ 25. Millions of rewards in the United States. He tells his friends not to let adults know their plans, since older people would simply spend money on cars and cigarettes, while he plans to help his mother and other people who are sick and destitute. <br /> <br /> It's the Mexican director Alejandro González Inarritu (creator of "Amores Perros") that provides, by far, the most powerful and chilling segment, one that, for the most part, shows only a dark screen with audio tape loops of chants and voices and occasional sounds of banging. The brief visual flashes allow us to see bodies falling from the high floors of the towers, and we realize that the blows are the bodies that hit the ground. The sequence ends with elegiac orchestral music and a fixed shot, with a phrase that is only shown in Arabic and then a translation is added: "Does the light of God guide or blind us?"
