"FULL HOUSE", in my opinion, is an absolute classic of ABC! I'm not sure if I've never seen all the episodes, but I still enjoyed it. One of my favorite episodes is where Jesse (John Stamos) and Rebecca (Lori Loughlin) get married. If you want to know how he made it so fun, you should have seen it for yourself. It was a double game, so you should have seen both sides. Another of my favorite episodes is where Jesse, Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin) and Michelle (Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen) lock themselves in a gas station on Michelle's birthday. You should also have seen it for yourself if you want to know how and why it happened. I have many others that I also like. They all always gave a good performance, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well designed and the writing was always very strong. In conclusion, although it can be seen in syndication now, I strongly recommend that you catch it in case it leaves the air forever.
