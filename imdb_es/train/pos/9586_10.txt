The film really challenges your notions of identity and the society in which we live. It is well made and very powerful. The people in the film are honest and revealing about the world that exists outside the normative ideological perspective. I think it gives a great perspective of a subculture that shakes the viewer's ideas of society. It is shocking at times and more powerful because of that. Some parts were hard to see, as is most of the reality, but it is not over. It's good the first time you look at it, but it gets even better the second or third time; because he has had the opportunity to wrap his mind around the issues that are discussed and challenged.
