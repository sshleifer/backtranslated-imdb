Considering how corny these films are, you have to imagine that they must have had fun doing them. The film focuses on a house that strangely accommodates who lives there. The inhabitants were: the author Charles Hillyer (Denholm Elliott (with hair!)), Who is harassed by one of his own creations; Philip Grayson (Peter Cushing), who comes too close to a wax statue; John Reid (Christopher Lee), whose daughter's beauty is apparently a facade; and actor Paul Henderson (Jon Pertwee), about to get too involved in the character. <br /> <br /> "The house that drips blood" is really worth seeing (well, it's starring Peter Cushing and Christopher Sotavento). Besides being clean, there may be some nuances: I could be questioning the problem of true horror in the face of the supposed horror. As in "The Shining", we could ask if the house / hotel itself keeps some memory of past events. And if it's nothing else, Ingrid Pitt (as Paul's co-star) is HOT HOT HOT! Around the time this came out, he also starred in "Countess Dracula" and "The Vampire Lovers" (also with Peter Cushing). Maybe she, like Barbara Steele, will continue to be known only as a screaming queen, but mark my words: SHE IS A HOT QUEEN! I would like to see Ingrid Pitt and Barbara Steele co-stars in something. <br /> <br /> I guess the only strange scene (so to speak) is where Denholm Elliott is wearing a pink shirt and a fluffy jacket. You read it well. What kind of name is "Denholm" anyway? Oh good. A very cool movie.
