I'm really getting old, I'm in the middle of watching this 40-year-old movie and I wonder what my grandchildren will see in 40 years, it's an old saying, but they do not do it that way anymore. ... it's not just the story, it's the music, the performance of young and old ... the cast, it seems, they were born to play their roles, the young oliver, the old Fagin ... too many to mention them all. , the role played by Judge Oliver is previous, I have seen in other roles over the years ... the ingenious dodger, Ron in a bad mood as Fagin, Mr. and Mrs. Bumble, the movie not only won 5 Oscars , but I also received some Golden Glob awards ... if you decide to watch this movie ... do yourself a favor, take some, if not all, of the children, to see this masterpiece.
