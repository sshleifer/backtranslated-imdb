This film is available from David Shepard and Kino in the Before Hollywood There Was Fort Lee, NJ program, although this is an abbreviated version with only the behind-the-scenes film sections. I'm not sure if Blackhawk Films only had one movie. The original version of Blackhawk was renamed A Movie Romance. The full feature survives, but the preprint of this version had some decomposition of nitrate, and a couple of sections looked bad, so it may be the reason why the Blackhawk version was edited. <br /> <br /> Directed by Maurice Tourneur, the film has Tourneur playing himself, or more likely a caricature of himself. Supposedly, the director Emile Chautard and the future director Joseph von Sternberg can also be The girl Mary (Doris Kenyon) longs for a romantic man to raise her. She dreams of a troubadour who will court her, but is constantly interrupted by the only available local boy, Johnny Applebloom. <br /> <br /> Meanw hile, a New York film company (actually New Jersey) is filming a western on the field. Mary sees an Indian (with a full headdress) and gives the alarm, spoiling a scene that the film company is filming. She is immediately attracted to movie star Kenneth Driscoll (Robert Warwick). He encourages her to leave home and try to become an actress in the big city. <br /> <br /> When he arrives at the studio, he discovers that everything related to the films is false. The doors and walls are just floors that are assembled hastily for the whole. That gait of the western hero or the happy jump of the heroine are also acting. The sets are in a large rotating stage, so that the angle of the sun can even be manipulated. The black assistant in the studio signs the "autographed" photos of all the movie stars. The signs on the wall say "Positively No Smoking," but they all smoke anyway. Even the titles of the film (which are very well illustrated) emphasize everything that is false in film life. <br /> <br /> Movie star Driscoll is so disenchanted with the boredom of everyday movie making. He makes a temporary separation from girlfriend Vivian (June Elvidge) to pursue this "exciting" country girl. Her plans are thwarted when Mary's screen test stinks. We can not see the film itself, but only the painful reactions of the audience. <br /> <br /> Mary is devastated, but she does not want to admit everyone at home that she was a failure, so she keeps seeing Driscoll and we have lunch with him in the studio cafeteria along with other extras disguised as policemen, soldiers, cowboys, etc. <br /> <br /> Mary decides to stay with Driscoll. At a party with her "friends" from the movie, she agrees to marry him even though there is not much love between them. Surprisingly, her mother appears, with a cake especially for Mary's birthday. This makes Mary re-evaluate her future. <br /> <br /> This movie has all kinds of fascinating scenes from studios, movie sets, dressing rooms, editing rooms, etc. If you have always wondered what happened behind. The scenes when a silent movie was being made, this movie peeks out from behind the curtain.
