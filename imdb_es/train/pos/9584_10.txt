Yes, this movie is the best. I can not recommend it anymore. Gay or narrow is a great doco for anyone who likes movies. Very funny, sad and interesting. Never boring. Great access A film made with passion and interest in the subject. Some of the performances and just amazing. If you only find this movie on VHS, it's still worth watching. Cool. 10 out of 10. I could see part of this document about ten years ago and I did not understand what I was seeing. The interviews are very revealing about the egos of the performers who are like heavy boxers trying to make their way out of the ghetto. The filmmaker was apparently a first timer so what an achievement. Cool Trace it.
