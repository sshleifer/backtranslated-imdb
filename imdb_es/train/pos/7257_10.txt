The reason I say this is because I wrote the script and I knew very little about what was being done until I was asked to watch the movie. I wrote it for some producers who sold it without telling me. Because Alan Dobie was a friend of mine, I found out. I had only written a first draft, so I was understandably worried when I heard I was on the floor. I asked Peter Collinson, through my agent, if he would like me to make another draft. I also asked if I could see my original script because I had lost it. They told me, too late. So I did the only thing I could do under the circumstances and removed my name. I had no idea what they could have done with my script. Then they invited me to watch the finished movie. I was so impressed that I quickly asked for my name to be re-entered. It is a beautifully made piece, of a hastily written first draft, I expected to be asked to work much more on it; Maybe if I had it it would not be so good. I'd love to see my original script again if anyone knows where it is. I would also love to see the film again, I only saw it once in a small theater in Soho.
