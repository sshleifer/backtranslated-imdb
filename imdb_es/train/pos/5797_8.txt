['And I do not say it in a bad way. <br /><br /> I saw this movie at the cinema when I was 6 or 7 years old. For me and my cousins it was magical, beautiful and scary at the same time. When we left the theater, Michael was our best friend, although we knew he had no idea about it. <br /><br /> Over the years, I saw that this movie was broadcast several times, but it always changed the channel. Even watching a few seconds would return that feeling of magic and warm my heart. And I liked it that way. <br /><br /> So I&#39;ve only seen this movie once and I think it was a good decision not to see it again. If I saw it today, I know I could not avoid criticizing MJ&#39;s performance, the plot (if there was one) and this and that. For me, this is a childhood memory, so my feelings towards him are those of a child 20 years ago. <br /><br /> I see that my adult self intervenes in my rating and gives an 8 for the memories and the wonderful music. However, for that little boy who saw him with astonishment 20 years ago, this is definitely worth 10.']
