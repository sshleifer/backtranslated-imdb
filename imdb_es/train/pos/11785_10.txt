I'm not sure how to explain "Darkend Room", because summarizing it would not do it justice. It is a short film by excellence of Lynchian with two beautiful girls in a strange and mysterious situation. I would say that this short is definitely more at the "Mulholland Drive" end of the Lynchian spectrum, instead of "The Elephant Man" or "The Straight Story". It's hidden on the Lynch website and it's worth the search.
