If you have the opportunity to see this movie, you can see it. It's quite shocking in some places and it really makes you think about so many important topics, but it's not didactic. In my opinion, it is a work of art ... beautifully filmed, good music of many styles, the typically impressive performance level one expects from the BBC Drama. Nathalie Press (cataloged as 'Natalie' Press) is convincing in her role as a depressed teenager exploited by a male classmate. Celia Imrie has a beautifully reassuring quality that gives stability to the sometimes disconcerting action and the comfort of the viewer to know that someone is really "normal", but the real protagonist is Timothy Spall, one of the best actors of our time. !
