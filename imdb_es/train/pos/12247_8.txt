I really loved this version of Emma the best. Kate Beckinsale was amazing as Emma and Mark Strong was very good as a gentleman. the only complaint I had was about Mr. Woodhouse ... I can not believe that a man could whine so much or be so selfish about his daughter's life ... although in the end she was a smart girl. As always, I love the places where these Jane Austin movies were filmed. The settings are so spectacular. It makes me want to visit England as much as Ireland and Scotland. I think the actors chosen for this film were also a good choice and all the other story lines were intertwined with Emma's! I'm glad I saw this one too.
