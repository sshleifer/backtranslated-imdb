Goal for the top! Gunbuster is one of those anime series that has classic writings everywhere. I loved this series and, to this day, it's still my favorite anime. And although it was not the first animated Gainax product, it was his first OVA series. <br /> <br /> Mainly starting as a parody of the 1970s sports drama Aim For The Ace (Ace O Nerae!), Gunbuster takes Steam back as a serious drama towards the end of episode 2, when Noriko Takaya she is forced to relive the death of her father, who died in the initial encounter of humanity with the race of insects with which humanity is at war. It is due to the death of his father that Noriko wants to become a fighter pilot. But his lack of confidence shows that he gets in the way sometimes and hesitates. Her friend, Kazumi Amano, even has doubts about Noriko's choice as a pilot. However, Noriko's coach, Koichiro Ota, has faith in her. And he has made it his personal mission to see that she succeeds in becoming a pilot, since he was a survivor of the battle in which Noriko's father was killed. <br /> <br /> Other characters include Jung-Freud, a Russian. Fighter pilot assigned to serve with the squad to which Noriko and Kazumi belong, Smith Toren, a love interest for Noriko who dies on their first outing together, and Kimiko Higuchi, Noriko's childhood friend. Kimiko's participation is also of interest, since while Noriko is in space, Kimiko stays behind on Earth to lead a normal life. And due to the acts of time dilation, Kimiko ages normally on Earth, while Noriko is relatively the same age as when she left school. At the end of the series, Noriko is approximately 18 years old, while Kimiko is in her mid-fifties. <br /> <br /> In general, this is an excellent series of anime to see if you are a fan of giant robots. Wick and animation of Gainax. If you like the other Hideaki Anno shows, or if you are a fan of Haruhiko Mikimoto's illustrations, then give this show a try. It will grow in you.
