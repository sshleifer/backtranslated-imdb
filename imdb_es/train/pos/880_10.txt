Probably the best movie of the year for me. This small French film focuses on office secretary Carla (Emmanuelle Devos) who spends her days doing other men's jobs, uncredited, and being the source of her contempt and conversation at lunchtime, which is too clear for she, as partially deaf, reads her lips A change is set in motion when she hires Paul (Vincent Cassel) as her assistant. The relationship that develops between them is the center of the film. Mutual dependence, for very different reasons, unites them. Carla is attracted to Paul and the fact that it makes her feel attractive for what seems to be the first time. Paul does nothing to dispel his feelings because he needs your help. He owes money to a local gangster and creates a plan to rob him, which will imply Carlas' ability to read lips. I think the main thing that leads to the film above an average of suspense / drama is the incredible chemistry between the two stars. Throughout the entire film, no matter what other characters are on screen, you can feel this incredible bond between Carla and Paul. I can not remember when I witnessed such sexual chemistry between two actors. Emmanuell Devos gives a brilliant performance (won the French Cesar for the best actress). You never feel like you're watching a piece of acting, this really is Carla. The chameleon like Vincent Cassel is also wonderful. He makes a somewhat unattractive character both attractive and attractive. I loved this movie because of these two people, and on the two occasions when I had finished watching it, I wanted to go back to the movies and get involved with them again.
