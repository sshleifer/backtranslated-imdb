I bought this movie a few days ago and I thought it would be a fucking movie. But when I put it in the DVD player, it surprised me in a very good way. James Belushi plays very well as Bill "The Mouth" Manuccie. But especially Timothy Dalton plays a very good roll as Sheriff. The 'final' scene in Bill's house is very excellent, good camera work, good dialogues and very good acting. Bill "The Mouth" Manuccie has stolen 12 million dollars from the mafia. Along with his wife, he lives in South Carolina in a witness protection program. But the mafia follows him and he wants the 12 million dollars. Bill can only trust the only person he knows from the inside out, himself.
