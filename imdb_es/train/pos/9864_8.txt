I watched 'Ice Age' at the cinema and I liked the movie. Although the 'Ice Age' has many faults and scientific errors, such as humans, sabers, dinosaurs and mammoths that live in the same period, and even the location where the story takes place (it seems North America, but it has some characteristics of Iceland). for example) we can still have fun (unless you are very severe) <br /> <br /> The planet is entering an ICE AGE, and many animals are migrating south, where it is warmer. Sid is a stupid sloth who is left by his own family, who can not take it anymore. Walking on his way, he meets Manfred, or how he calls "Manny" a capricious mammoth who does not care about extinction. Or immigration and going north. Concerned that he can be easily captured, Sid decides to follow Manfred, and in the middle of his journey, they found a human mother with her baby. The mother dies, but Manfred and Sid decide to take it away and return the baby to the humans. Diego, one of the sabers, decides to follow them and help them to go to a shortcut to the human camp. What Manfred and Sid do not know, is that Diego belongs to a saber clan that hates humans and wants to kill the baby, and also tries to trick the two into becoming the food of the sword. What will happen will depend on Diego's behavior and conscience ... <br /> <br /> alias "A Era do Gelo" - Brazil
