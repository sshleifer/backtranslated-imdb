The good thing about this movie: the concept is interesting and there are some funny scenes. It also makes you think of those little things in life that could greatly affect another person's life without you knowing it. It's a small world and this little movie shows us. <br /> <br /> The bad: there are too many characters and it is difficult to say who is the main character, but it is still a great movie. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie and a lot of people compare it to Magnolia that I have not seen. <br /> <br /> 8/10 <br /> <br /> Without classification --- I would rate PG -13 for brief violence, some language and sexual situations.
