['I accidentally felt in this movie on television, and I could not leave it ... It&#39;s really an excellent movie that makes people learn about the history of Americans with the Vietnam War, the moment of the power of flowers, the struggle of racism ... It illustrates the conflict of generation, of political opinion, of race that took place in the 60s ... I was born in 1980, so I did not know all that before ... In France, the history of the United States It&#39;s not a priority and that movie really taught me a lot of facts! By the way, I think all the actors are great; especially Jordana Brewster, Josh Hamilton and Jerry O&#39;Connell. Now I can watch this movie more than 1 time each day! It&#39;s really cool ... what a pity that it only appeared on TV, not in theaters ... <br /><br />']
