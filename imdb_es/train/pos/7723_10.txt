A number of factors make it easy for me to say that I still think this is the most important science fiction film ever made, despite some of the records, obsolete dialogues, etc. <br /> <br /> First, there is the scale of imagination in describing the Krell, a humanoid race native to the planet, now all dead, which were 1 million years more advanced than the humans on Earth (us), and its technology, particularly the 8,000-cubic-mile machine. <br /> <br /> Second, there is the music and the sound effects, which are inseparable from each other. It creates a strange and supernatural feeling, unlike "2001", which had traditional classical music. <br /> <br /> Third, your "monster" is not only the most powerful and deadly you have ever imagined, it is also based on real science. and it does not break the laws of physics and biology. <br /> <br /> Finally, and most importantly, Forbidden Planet is the only film that has been made and, what is more incredible, it manages to make an honest, intelligent and merciless film. logical statement about the limits or ceiling of human development (or any other biological entity), no matter how long we survive as a species. <br /> <br /> In other words, it predicts our inevitable fate.
