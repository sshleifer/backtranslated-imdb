Here is a movie that is really fun in every moment it covers. How can you not say that this film is starring the creators of South Park and is directed by David Zucker? The first time I saw this movie, I did not immediately realize that Coop and Doug were really Matt and Trey, but their acting and writing talents proved quite impressive. I was pleasantly surprised to know that they were really Matt and Trey, later. Humor is sometimes raw, sometimes dirty, sometimes bright, sometimes subtle, sometimes noisy and sometimes stupid, but in general, this is a hellish movie that is undoubtedly underestimated. Well, actually, it's crazy. Totally crazy.
