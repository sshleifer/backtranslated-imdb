One of the ten best comedies in history. <br /> <br /> It seems like a comedy so light and cheerful that it sings. Keaton's comedies are internal thought, harmonious and intelligently ordered. <br /> <br /> Wonderfully funny, deliberately delicious and inventive, THREE AGES should belong to a draft of the ten best comedies if I had to sketch one. A triple love story will enchant the spectators; I want to bring this approach here: Keaton's comedy is like Lang's DESTINY upside down or down. Once again, a couple crosses the waters of time and times in the Stone Age, in Rome and in the times of Keaton, in a Mohammedan country, in Renaissance Italy and in China. The same device works in both films, a dark and disturbing melodrama; - The other, a light comedy, virtuously to rhythm. In Keaton it is essentially the same couple; And maybe the same is with Lang. The baby wanted by Buster and Beery is nice. I have found THREE AGES well written and intelligent, without being ostentatiously sophisticated; The plot is basically very POPEYE "as" the baby is a piece of furniture, the only protagonists are the two male rivals "Keaton and Beery". <br /> <br /> Keaton's movie is simply hugely enjoyable, and perhaps One would be tempted to claim that this looks like an ambitious diversion, but it is not, but it's great fun, great fun, great fun. And Wallace Beery makes a good nemesis.
