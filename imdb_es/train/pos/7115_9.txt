A wonderful and courageous war movie that focuses on the inner torment of the navy Al Schmid. Although it is difficult and unpleasant, it is ultimately heroic: Schmid's triumph over disability and depression. The battle scene was excellent. But a bone to pick up. No matter how many .50 bullets fired, I never saw water or earth raised by the impacts! Realism hurt, but I can live with it. Good performance by Eleanor Parker, again, as his girlfriend.
