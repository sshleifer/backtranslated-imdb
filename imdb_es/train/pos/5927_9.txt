Some of the little ones, I loved them. Sleepwalkers is one that I really enjoy and see it regularly. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around Charles Brady and his mother Mary. They are sleepwalkers, changing creatures that, although they have a human appearance, become feline creatures. They are immune to the scratching of cats and every time they move to a new city, they set traps to catch and kill the animals. When they move to their last city, they need to find a virgin and when Charles finds her, he actually falls in love with her, but his mother needs to feed on her to maintain her strength. The story revolves around what will happen to the girl. Charles will save it or use it to save his mother. <br /> <br /> Although this story has incest connotations that some may find unpleasant, it actually plays an important role in the story and, therefore, is not alone in the movie. for the scandal.

The performance is not the best, nor the special effects, however, somehow, all this tends to 'gel' and is a very observable and pleasant adaptation. <br /> <br /> For UK readers: this production has the most It has recently been shown on channels BBC1, Sci-Fi and Sky Thriller / Horror.
