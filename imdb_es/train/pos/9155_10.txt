Who came up with a story is a sick person. I rented it for our pajama party and the six of us got scared because we're all together in an acting class, and we know a couple of actors in the class. Besides all screaming all night, I had strange nightmares. I kept thinking, oh my God, if I get up to go to the bathroom to urinate, I'll be stabbed in the middle of a cleaning or something. I could not even go to the bathroom because we saw this horrible horror movie. I also thought why all the girls are topless in this movie but we do not do any of the guys units? You should make a horror movie in which the murderer is a girl and cut units. I would look at that again and again. Call it hard or soft or something stupid. I only give this movie a 9 because you have freed me.
