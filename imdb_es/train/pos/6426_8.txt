One of the best "Amitabh comeback" movies that I liked. This was the phase in which Govinda was going strong with Dhawan. The songs were awesome and totally as we call it "masti" type. An evergreen animator with characters like the multi-faceted Anupam Kher participating. The story has many twists and turns funny as is known by the potboilers of David Dhawan. With a timely appearance of Mrs.Madhuri "Nene" Dixit, it was a total disturbance towards the end. It was great to see Amit act with such force and humor after a long exile. Although some may consider it a typical "Bollywood Masala" movie, I would see it any day. I give an easy 8 of 10 just for being pure Bollywood.
