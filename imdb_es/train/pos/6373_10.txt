Atlantis was much better than I had anticipated. In a way, it had a better story than other movies aimed at a higher age. Even though this movie did demand a lapse of attention at times. It was a great movie for all ages. I noticed that some of the younger ones were expecting a comedy but ventured. I think everyone is tired of an endless parade of extreme parodies. Many of these children have seen nothing but parodies. After a short time, all seemed to observe intensely Atlantis.
