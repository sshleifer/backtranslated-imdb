There are many police dramas doing the rounds. I'm not sure why. It probably has to do with the old basic theme of good versus evil. <br /> <br /> This movie has a documentary style, as we follow the difficult initiation of Anne, a brute recruit, into a police squad stationed in the Baltic area. . No attempt is made to glamorize the police. They are truly simple, hard at times and implacable. Anne, on the other hand, has a soft heart, perhaps a little more understanding of the human condition. Against all the rules, he sometimes withholds incriminating information found in his searches for strippers and other investigations. <br /> <br /> This is not a nice movie. It is not one to relax. There is not much feeling of optimism in it. The police seem to be involved in a losing battle. Tomorrow there will be more clashes, more murders, more family breakdowns and more children in difficulties. Let's be honest. This is the world we live in. <br /> <br /> As the days go by, Anne becomes more intimately involved with the police and the families that are investigating. The only real heat in the movie is that provided by the character Benny, a 12-year-old boy from a broken family. Anne has her own way of fixing things. She turns a blind eye to the theft in Benny's stores and tries to help him as best he can. However, I was surprised that she came to seduce Benny's father. It made me wonder if it was in consideration of the father or his own needs. After all, the film makes it clear that she desperately needed a loving couple and children. <br /> <br /> Well, but it's not my idea of ​​one night's entertainment,
