This is a great adaptation and a great miniseries in its own right. The cuts of the plot could disappoint the fans of the book (but in fact how many modern readers have read Bleak House without first seeing a film version? I only know some). <br /> <br /> I think it's pretty horrible to see critical reviews of the series that have clearly been written by people who have no idea about the story. Did you watch the series or did you just make a bag? BBC production because Gillian Anderson was in the most recent version? <br /> <br /> The series captures mood, rhythm, characters and plot drivers (eliminating the Dickensian adornments that are not necessary and detract from a cinematic treatment like The Turveydrop Story, the dynamics of the Smallweed family and the additional lawyers (Tangle, Vholes, etc. are very truncated) .The only omission that I wish I had saved was the Jellyby incident, but as the first episode is already a bit slow (after the first episode , the rhythm is perfect) I can see that it had to disappear. <br /> <br /> The only other criticism I have is that Jo's death could have been done more faithfully.I can see that he practically canonized Woodcourt and has remained a little more human for not having that scene, but I really think that Jo's death is one of the most moving points of the book and I missed it although it always makes me cry. <br /> <br /> Theowinthrop has really seen the Serie? How did you think Esther was raised by her aunt and UNCLE? Who is this guy? I suppose that someone who could confuse the name of DENHOLM Eliott with Desmond is not really an appreciator of English art (cinema or literature). <br /> <br /> I also think it confuses the treatment of the law. YES, the law is very badly drawn in Bleak House. Fail to the descendants of Jarndyce, whose valuable heritage is devoured by the costs of the litigation, fails the deceased Tom Jarndyce and Rick Carstone, and all who have faith in the lawsuit. You miss Miss Flyte. In a certain sense, it also fails Captain Hawdon, who is driven to his death by the monotony of the copyist work of the law. Yes, feed the scavengers of Vholes and Tangle. But it also makes men like Guppy and Kenge go beyond their position in life. Although they were not friendly with social status, the Dickens climbers would clearly have preferred that they were not tied to being trapped in the station in which they were born (contrasting Jo's families and brickmakers with the out of poverty of Charley Neckett). <br /> <br /> In addition, the law, although it is misused by Tulkinghorn and the vultures of the Chancellery, is actually the source of security for the pupils of Ada and Richard, and for Esther, who is simply the pupil from Jarndyce. Their safety was guaranteed by the law that delivers them to Jarndyce. <br /> <br /> I can not see how anyone could have trouble following the story; remember that you should not realize that Esther is the daughter of Lady Dedlock. the beginning. Nor are you supposed to "get" all connections immediately. Instant gratification simply does not happen in Dickens. <br /> <br /> As for "seeing clearly" through the fog, Gosh the Gillian Anderson had such an edgy edition that I found it impossible to follow her and I already knew the plot! <br /> <br /> I found Diana Rigg absolutely brilliant (overacting and drama are not a good Lady Dedlock, but if you think they do try Gillian Anderson's version). <br /> <br /> It's ADA and Rick is not "Kate"! and you get everything you need from the Rouncewell subplot.
