Ghost Train is a fine and entertaining film, typical of the best British comedians of the 30s and 40s. The pranks of comedian Arthur Askey are not as funny as they apparently were, but this can be overcome by seeing it as a vintage piece or a curiosity . <br /> <br /> For a low budget war production, Ghost Train is atmospheric, effective and provides some suspense. Great fun for a dark night (and, yes, stormy). Relax, take off the critic's hat and enjoy.
