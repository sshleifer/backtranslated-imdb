I got to see this at the International Film Festival of New York in November 2005 with my boyfriend. We were both very impressed with the complexity of the plot and found it emotionally moving. It was very well directed with strong images. The visual effects were amazing, especially for a short one. He had an original fantasy approach to a very real and serious theme: this film is about a girl who is visited by a demon who offers to help her in her situation with her abusive father. There is also a surprise twist at the end that took me by surprise. This leans towards the gothic sensation. I would love to see this as a complete movie. - Carrie
