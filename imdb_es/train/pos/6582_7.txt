Well, then there's a front view of a Taxi Checker, probably in the late thirties. It has large triangular shaped headlights. There is also a DeSoto booth in this story in black and white, driven by characters, almost a musical love that went wrong. <br /> <br /> The real pleasure here is the look of the interiors and the fashions of the rooms of the 40s and the hotel elevators. The hairstyles, male and female, are beautiful. If Dolly Parton had Victor Mature's hair, he could have made it big. There is an artist loft that would be the envy of every aspiring Andy Warhol. <br /> <br /> If you see this waiting for a great story of Casablanca or Sound of Music oom-pah-pah, you will be disappointed. There is a nice little story below the approach of the catwalk model in this movie. <br /> <br /> My DVD copy with another movie for $ 1 was very visible. The title sequence was nice, but not up with Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World or The Pink Panther. This was an RKO movie, but it did not have the nice logo of the plane that used to use RKO. <br /> <br /> I liked Victor Mature in One Million, B.C., and Sampson and Delilah and especially in Violent Saturday. See if you can find that one. He was wonderful in the comedy with Peter Sellers called Caccia Alla Volpe or After The Fox. <br /> <br /> Richard Carlson made I Led Three Lives on television in the early 1950s. <br /> <br / > Vic Mature was offered the role of Sampson's father in the new version of Sampson and Delilah. Supposedly he was asked if he would have trouble interpreting his father since he was as well known as Sampson. Victor replied: "If the money is right, I will play with Sampson's mother." <br /> <br /> Tom Willett
