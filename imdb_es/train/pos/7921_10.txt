It's funny, look at it! <br /> <br /> OK, they want 10 lines so there: this is a parody of werewolf movies of the 50/70. A lot of satire, some politicians. It feels like an early film by Clouseau (probably because of Alan Arkin), but with less slaps. If you like Naked Guns movies, you will also like this (once again less slapstick in this). <br /> <br /> Actually, humor varies from a slight sexual innuendo (inevitable in a teen comedy) to a truly moving socio-political satire. The transformation of Moon High School from 50 to 70 is really fun. The sequence with the changing presidential portraits is brilliant! Okay, maybe it's not bright, but it's still hilarious. There are tons of (historical) cracks from the paranoia of the Cold War of the 50s and the inflation of the late 70s. <br /> <br /> Anyway, just watch the movie if you have the opportunity !
