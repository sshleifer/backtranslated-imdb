Do not get carried away by the detractors. This is a wonderfully spooky movie. This was a thesis project for the writer / director, JT Petty. He did a great job of having me on the edge of my seat. I never really knew what to expect, and for a horror movie fan, this is Nirvana! The film is about an old man who lives in a secluded cabin in the woods. One day, while looking for his cat in the forest, he witnesses the murder of a child, does not it? The rest of the film agonizes over this. The most unusual thing about this movie is that there is no dialogue here until the last scenes. I found that this is intriguing. The writer manages to control your senses and gives them a relentless pull. Try this movie, you will not be disappointed.
