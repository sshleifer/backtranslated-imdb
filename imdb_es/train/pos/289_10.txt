I love all the films by Michael Landon Jr. And the casting of Michael Landon Jr. by Dale Midkiff as "Clark Davis" could not have been better. Dale Midkiff has ways to achieve this character. <br /> <br /> This movie kept me fascinated from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> The death of the girl Missie and Willies with Clarks' time The visit was only God's time. The way they dealt with death and the way Clark helped them do it was that of a love of parents. <br /> <br /> Although there are 3 movies before this [[Love Comes Softly, Loves Enduring Promise & Loves Long Journey], I feel like you can watch this movie and understand it easily. However, leave and want to see the 3 previous films because of the story that all the characters have behind them. <br /> <br /> Michael Landon Jr. is an excellent director <br /> <br /> I hope many more films of him in the future.
