Was the script more suitable for a 30-minute comedy? Yes, but they still make it work! I thought the actors did a fantastic job with an otherwise smooth script, especially Jack Black and Christopher Walken. Most people on the board seem to really hate this movie. Personally, I can not see how that could be, but Envy is just one of those movies that you love or hate. Like Napoleon Dynamite and all the Leslie Neilsen films ever made. Or you think it's one of the worst movies that have been made or one of the funniest. Do not avoid this movie because of the criticism. Look at it and see if you are one of those who really like it! If you do, I guarantee you it's worth your money. If you do not like ... well, now you know.
