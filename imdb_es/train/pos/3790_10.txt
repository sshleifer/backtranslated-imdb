I synthesized this accidentally in the independent film channel and was fascinated. I am a professional actor and I was amazed by the performances. They felt totally improvised, absolutely unaffected. I could not tell if it was scheduled or how it was filmed and waited until the end to see the credits and then spent half an hour on the IMDb to find this movie. Do not miss it. I see that the writer and director also did a very good movie called Everyday People that I enjoyed a lot. The shame of the film business is that this excellent projects do not get the distribution and publicity they deserve and live under the radar. This movie deserves to be blown up and proudly. I urge people to look for it and look at it.
