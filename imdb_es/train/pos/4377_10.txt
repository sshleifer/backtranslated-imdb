The beginnings until the mid-90s were a highlight, in my opinion, for the historical drama. The last of the Mohicans, Braveheart and Rob Roy, all represented a distinctive passion and intensity in their respective periods of time. <br /> <br /> Rob Roy was a unique and intriguing flavor of a moment and place rarely represented by the film. It really has it all: interesting history, great acting, extraordinary dialogue and amazing landscapes. I was particularly impressed by the seemingly genuine dialogue. I imagine that this is how people talked and behaved at the beginning of the 18th century. <br /> <br /> Another thing that surprised me was the vulgarity expressed by the characters. I found it more repulsive and shocking, although often more subtle, than most movies set in modern times. The film had a very spicy edge and full of sexuality that was unique and very realistic in the context of the era. <br /> <br /> The pace was very tight, with hardly a dull moment. There were many intrigues and political subplots that complicated things a bit, but still did not detract from the main plot. <br /> <br /> The action was also very well done and exciting. Something I will always find remarkable is that during the most outstanding piece of action in the film, there is no soundtrack at all. It is a very tense and exciting sequence, since we have no musical indication as to the direction and resolution of the scene. <br /> <br /> Rob Roy will always occupy a prominent place in my list of favorite movies. I would recommend it to everyone.
