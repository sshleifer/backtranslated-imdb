Many reviews here explain the history and characters of 'Opening Night' in some detail, so I will not. I just want to add my comment that I think the movie is a wonderful affirmation of life. <br /> <br /> At first, Myrtle Gordon is remembering how "easy" it was to act when she was 17, when she was Young and energetic and felt she knew the truth. The experience has left her emotionally fragile, wondering what her life was like and, in fact, if she can continue living. A tragic accident triggers a personal crisis that almost overwhelms her. <br /> <br /> Almost, but not quite. At the eleventh hour, she rediscovers the power of her art and reaffirms herself ("I'm going to bury that bastard," says actor Maurice as he takes the stage). It seems almost sadistic when the director of Myrtle avoids that people help her when she arrives drunk without hope for her first performance. However, she knows that she has to have the guts to do it herself if she wants to do it. <br /> <br /> Some critics wonder if this triumph is just a temporary pause in the downward path of Myrtle. I think this is truly your "opening night": it opens like a flower to new possibilities of life and action, see a way forward. It is tremendously moving. <br /> <br /> Gena Rowlands is excellent. The movie is excellent. Thank you, Mr. Cassavetes, wherever you are.
