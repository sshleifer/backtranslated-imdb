Funny. Sad. Charming. These are all the words that floated in my head while I was watching this beautiful and simple movie. <br /> <br /> It's rare that a movie really moves me, but "Do we dance?" Achieved that with grace to spare. The mild humor mixed with the occasional subtle agony made this one of the best experiences in my movie history. It left me with a quiet feeling of joy, but with a little touch of mixed sadness. <br /> <br /> And the dance, oh yes, the dancing. Even if you are not an art lover, or can not put one foot in front of another, the steps shown here will take your breath away and make you want to enroll in classes as fast as you can. It was absolutely charming, even the parts that show Sugiyama's work steps (touchingly portrayed by Koji Yakusho) when he was learning to dance for the first time were charming in a humorous and childish way. And yet, this film was not entirely about the dance, but rather about the subtleties of human behavior and feelings. We are witnesses of a shy man who learns to express his repressed feelings through dance, a beautiful dance instructor who rediscovers his love for art and the personal growth of each member of the wonderful cast. <br /> <br /> Beauty. Pain. Emotion. All the love and the small agonies of life are here, expressed with the delicate feeling of a beautiful Japanese watercolor painting combined with the emotional strength and grace of culture. <br /> <br />
