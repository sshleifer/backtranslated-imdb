This is a musical adaptation of "Oliver Twist" by Dicken. For the most part, the original story has been maintained, although certain secondary plots are omitted for the flow of the film (such as the summer spent recovering and the half-brother). The biggest difference in the film and in the story is that at the end of the book, Fagin is hanged, a very different ending to this musical film. <br /> <br /> This is a unique musical: One whose style and scope has not really been matched before or since. The songs are not only often very singable and memorable, but the choreography of the film is something worth seeing. While in most musicals some people or perhaps a small group are choreographed dancing, here the numbers often reach hundreds or perhaps more. It's really a show to see and I was lucky to have seen it in the theater when it debuted and it is one of my earliest memories of childhood. Having seen it again a few moments ago, I would have to say that the movie only improved over time. Great sets, wonderful acting and singing: this is a special gift that is hard not to love. <br /> <br /> By the way, when I saw the movie again tonight, I was surprised at how tall and feminine. The singing of Mark Lester went to the movie. Well, according to IMDb, her singing was doubled by a girl and this would definitely explain her voice.
