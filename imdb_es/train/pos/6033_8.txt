I just want to say that this may be partial, since I'm a producer of the movie. However, I will maintain a sense of dignity. <br /> <br /> The star of the film, Oscar Ovies, offers a stellar performance as Jeff Grinderlin, a nebbish hypochondriac who spends more time worrying than living. It brings a certain touch to your character that really allows the audience to connect with him, expressing his mind often and with a sense of hard comedy. His mother, played by Christine Haber, is the constant support, which without him would collapse on itself. His friends also lend a hand in Jeff's life, often making decisions for him instead of letting him use his free will ... which he often neglects is there anyway. <br /> <br /> The writing is excellent, and the conversations flow like scenes from a Kevin Smith movie, with half the Ben Affleck boo-hoo festivals. <br /> <br /> The camera work is a bit Crabby at some points, and the sound could also improve, however, the performances highlight the minor details. It is also backed by a beautiful soundtrack with local talent and an exceptional composer. <br /> <br /> In general, it was a delight. A rare jewel, among many jewels.
