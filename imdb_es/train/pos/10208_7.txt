['We rarely see such short comments written by IMDb viewers. Maybe it&#39;s because this dark and light comedy entertains and pleases without depth, or is something missing? I would see it again if I had any incentive. <br /><br /> So, what is a coincidence? For the French is &quot;Le Battement d&#39;Ailes du Papillon&quot; Serendipity? Destination? Perhaps it is an event that is the culmination of a series of random events. We&#39;ve all had these (it&#39;s called life) but when you see them this way, you start to get the feeling that &quot;random&quot; might look more like a &quot;destiny&quot;. <br /><br /> A &quot;coincidence&quot; in this movie can be as small a matter as hitting some lettuce leaves from the back of a truck or as important as basing a life&#39;s important decision on the accuracy of a stranger throwing a pebble. All these incidents cause other events that ... do you understand well? Domino Multiply those by 30 characters and an average of 6 each, and you&#39;ll have to really stretch your imagination to accept the remote possibility that this scenario might happen. And I think there is a diagnosis for those who believe that life is like that. But this is the magical world of cinema. <br /><br /> We admit that it is fun to see the way the writer / director intertwines these unrelated events in a story that entangles the lives of these French citizens. If you have a couple of hours and are looking for a capricious escape, this is the place to do it. Or if you are recovering from surgery and will not go anywhere, this will compromise you as your stitches heal. <br /><br /> &quot;Happenstance&quot; will not pass as a prize winner, but should develop a cult. Stranger things have happened. <br /><br /> Soren Kierkegaard is credited with the following: &quot;Life can only be understood the other way around, but it must be lived forward&quot;. If you looked at the details in many of your own life experiences (knowing your first love, finding the perfect gift, your last car accident), you would find a series of seemingly random events that led you. <br /><br /> That is the answer! I forgot to bring an existentialist to explain &quot;Success.&quot;']
