['This movie is a true masterpiece, it really is. It is rare that you find yourself with such a moving film, full of fun, laughter, anguish and with a bit of drama to keep you alert. <br /><br /> A true family film, Homeward Bound tells the story of three brave pets, who set out to cross the Rocky Mountains in an attempt to find their owners, following the changes they are going through and the obstacles they encounter along the way. One of the really amazing things about this movie is its ability to give animals human personalities; the voice is so good. Shadow is a wonderful character, old, wise and brave, and seeing him trying to save Sassy in the river was a very powerful moment. Chance - Who would not love a dog like Chance? It has to be the most naughty and adorable puppy that has been seen on the big screen. And Sassy is very ingenious for a cat: she had me in stitches when she mocked the caregiver; &quot;Here kitty kitty kitty ... not in your life, chubby.&quot; <br /><br /> There were also many emotional scenes well done, like Sassy going through the waterfall (I was really scared by her), Shadow falling in the ditch (almost with tears) and then the fantastic ending, when the three pets come home ... including good old shadow! <br /><br /> A favorite of all times, anyone who does not like this movie should not like animals. Rent it or buy it now, and it will leave happy memories that will last a lifetime.']
