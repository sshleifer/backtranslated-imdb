This cheerful comedy should be enjoyed for its entertainment value. Sometimes it becomes quite fun, but if you have not spent any time on "that" side of the tracks, you will miss the comedy when it explodes. <br /> <br /> The cast of characters blends well and they are quite believable in their roles. The way Grace manages to meet her dead husband's girlfriend was well interpreted. She is a true lady. And, my favorite is Grace's white outfit she wears. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to laugh out loud, who applauds the homeless or just wants to see something different.
