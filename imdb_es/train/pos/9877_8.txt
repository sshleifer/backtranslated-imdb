<br /> <br /> Introducing Lily Mars is one of a kind of film that unfortunately seems to have disappeared with the studio system. Ok, now that you know my bias, here are some reasons why I think this movie stands out. <br /> <br /> 1. Although the basic plot - Lily Mars (Judy Garland) goes to New York, becomes a star and wins the heart of its director (Van Heflin) is a pretty loose story of the time of Hollywood, writers vary the subject a bit. more than usual. Although Lily gets her big break when the star retires, she is unsuccessful and has to swallow her pride and play a minor role in the show again. <br /> <br /> 2. Judy Garland (enough said!) <br /> <br /> 3. The supporting cast includes some really great performances. Spring Byington as Lily's mother is truly wonderful, as is Fay Bainter (the mother of the director - John Thornway (Van Heflin)). The outstanding supporting performance, however, is directed at the character actress Connie Gilchrist as Frankie, once an actress who became a theater concierge. <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing for sure. One of those movies that are designed to make you feel better about the world and your dreams.
