This is the Columbo that Steven Spielberg directed early in his career. It's nothing sensational, but in this movie you can see some small hints of great things for Spielberg. The film is basically the same style as most films and television works of Spierlberg in the 70s. That means that some characters tend to show some peculiarities and no, I'm not just talking about the Columbo character alone. The type of extravagance of the character that perhaps can be seen better in the 1975 film "Spaw", "Jaws". But aside from some small hints of the typical elements of the early Spielberg, you can not call this film work and the excellent example of a rising star. It's not that it's bad, of course it's not, but as I said before, it's not too sensational either. <br /> <br /> This movie started really well and was very promising, but after its inauguration, in which As the murder always happened, the movie became slower and boring to watch. Bored because it's mostly a Columbo movie from the book that does not have memorable moments, not boring because it's a boring movie. <br /> <br /> The murder itself was quite ingenious and the concept of having a crime story writer who murdered his writing partner showed great interesting potential. However, the story did not really explore all its possibilities. At least that's the feeling that this movie left me with. <br /> <br /> The movie was still good to watch, however, thanks to the character of Jack Cassidy, who believes he is smarter than Columbo, because of his mystery / crime. Write experience and try to give all kinds of possible clues, away from himself. But, of course, Columbo knows it better and is his number one suspect from the start, but as always, he follows the game. <br /> <br /> The film has a good general style and uses a good camera position and editing. It's funny to see that most of all this too was mostly consistent with Spielberg's later work, especially with some of the camera angles. <br /> <br /> An excellent Columbo movie that can be seen perfectly, but do not let Spielberg's name be attached. so that it increases your expectations too. <br /> <br /> 7/10
