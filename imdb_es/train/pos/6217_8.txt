['Follow the Fleet, a RKO production in 1936, starring Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers in a complex romantic comedy. Although Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers have had many similar romantic movies together, RKO helped them create a new story that incorporates situations relevant to society at the time it was made. The Follow the Fleet narrative relies heavily on the use of layered story lines between the two sets of main characters to create a satisfying romantic comedy. <br /><br /> The general plot of the film revolves around Bake Baker, a Sailor in the US Navy. UU Performed by Fred Astaire, and Sherry Martin, former love and dance partner of Bake who is now a singer and dancer played by Ginger Rogers. Her story begins when Bake is on the ship and her partner Bilge Smith finds a picture of the two together, and Bake reveals that the last time he saw her, he asked her to marry him, so Bilge suggests they try to meet her when they are on land, hoping that she can have a friend. <br /><br /> The next important scene begins with the second plot of the film when Connie Martin, Sherry&#39;s sister, is denied entry to Paradise where her sister works, unless accompanied by a gentleman. He turns around to find Bilge behind her with a bag full of drinks, so he plays it as if he were waiting for it and also buys his ticket to Paradise. Connie then finds Sherry and tells her that she is depressed because she can not have the luck that Sherry has with men, so Sherry suggests that her friends make a makeover while acting on stage. Connie pretends to be in, and re-enters the ballroom, and approaches Bilge again, who is amazed to see her. This begins the second romantic story between Bilge and Connie. <br /><br /> Throughout the rest of the film, the story and the ascending actions go through the transition between altering the comic reliefs of the problems of the two couples that create several ascending and descending mini actions within the general plot. Bake and Sherry achieved their first moments together while competing in a dance competition and end up winning it, reminding them of the success and pleasure they both have when they are together. Similarly, Bilge can faint Connie through her romantic attempts to please her, and they retire to her house. <br /><br /> This series of happy events is soon followed by disturbing measures that cause the increasing action to fall again. Bake left Sherry the night before to retire to the ship before midnight and told her he would come for her in the morning. Unfortunately, the ship sets off after the shipmates have returned, bothering Sherry and letting her think that Bake was still a typical sailor looking for a good time when he is on shore. <br /><br /> The mood changes again as another secondary plot is introduced into the film when a &quot;large group of shots&quot; takes a tour of the ship. This alternative story is used to create a buffer between the stories of the two main relationships of the film, as well as to help develop the trust and affection of Bake&#39;s general good intentions. The party is interrupted by Bake&#39;s and his companions&#39; music play when the sound was lost to report on the cover for the company. The ladies are intrigued and ask them to listen to them, and Bake gladly begins to entertain them with a little dance, which ultimately helps to brighten the mood of the film, as well as bring happiness to the boaters. <br /><br /> After returning to the interlocking stories of the couple, Sherry is trying to prove to Bake that he does not need his help to get a job. Unfortunately, Bake does not realize he&#39;s auditioning, and he says something to Sherry when he hears his friend in the studio talking about a lady&#39;s extraordinary hearing. Bake is in charge of helping Sherry manipulating her water, making her unable to sing properly and destroying her hearing. In addition to Bake&#39;s mistake, Connie spent all her money to repair a ship that she expected Bilge to assume as captain. She had also planned a remarkable dinner date for him when he was supposed to come, but Bilge was aware of her intentions and hopes of getting married soon and was no longer interested, so he picked her up. <br /><br /> The rest of the film continues in the same format of ascending and descending mini actions until the climax between the two couples is reached, ending the film with the happiness of both couples. The use of altering stories helps generate interest and emotion within each couple, as they deal with happiness and pain through each of their struggles. The stories that are intertwined can also relate to each other, as well as incorporate other unrelated secondary arguments to help bring the narrative to the final scenes. <br /><br /> Although Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers have innumerable films together that incorporate romance, comedy, song and dance, Follow the Fleet is a unique film for the two actors who successfully use the subframe technique to help the narrative between the two main characters.']
