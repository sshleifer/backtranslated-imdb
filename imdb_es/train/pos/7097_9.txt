['Joking, I rented 12 Monkeys the other day because I&#39;m a big fan of Bruce Willis and I heard some things about the movie. Some good and some bad, but it was one of those movies that you had to pay attention to every second, so I was a little worried. Just because I felt for a minute if it was going to be one of those movies I had to watch several times. But I saw it last night and it really impressed me, this movie had everything: action, drama, science fiction, history, black humor and even a little romance. All the actors did an excellent job, I give a lot of credit to Bruce, during his scene in the car with his psychiatrist, he really convinced me. But Brad Pitt, I&#39;m surprised at how much he did a great job. He did not do his character too much, he was crazy, and he just made it work and was extremely believable. The story was terrifying, but very good and a wake-up call. <br /><br /> James Cole is a man in the future where a virus was unleashed in the past and killed 5 billion people and only 1% of the population survived, including him. The animals are now ruling the ground above while the humans are down, but the scientists sent James back to the 1990s (which really means sending it to &#39;96), to find out about the virus information. James is admitted to a mental institution that meets his new psychiatrist, Dr. Kathryn Raily and another mental patient, Jeffrey Goines. He tells them that the future, of course no one believes him, he returns to the future. But scientists send him back to the right year to the place where the doctor is kidnapped by James, but he tells her more and believes him. Now they are determined to try to prevent the virus from happening. <br /><br /> 12 monkeys was an incredible movie. As I said, the story was very scary simply because it is not hard to believe that we are not far from that happening. But the whole movie was great, the cast, the sets, the whole picture was great. It had a kind of Terminator feeling in which we could lose something precious one day, ourselves if we do not listen to others. What is good and what is wrong? Who knows? But I would highly recommend 12 Monkeys, it&#39;s a great movie that if you give it the right opportunity, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll enjoy it. <br /><br /> 9/10']
