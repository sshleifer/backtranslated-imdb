I loved the idea of ​​this movie from the moment I saw a trailer. Einstein has always been one of my heroes and the image of him as kind, playful and a little crazy genius was enough for me to see the movie. The added spice of Matthau as Einstein made it even better. <br /> <br /> The story is pure fantasy, but lovely. A mechanic falls in love with a beautiful woman, who is Einstein's niece. With the help of four Fairy Godparents of Physics, Ed embarks on a quest to win Catherine's heart. Launch a jealous fiancé (who exemplifies the worst of experimental psychology) and Eisenhower in the mix, and you'll have fun. <br /> <br /> The movie is full of great character actors and deliciously sweet and dazzling performances. Walter Matthau plays Einstein as an evil imp; Cupid with a slide rule. Tim Robbins is wonderfully attractive, since Ed and Meg Ryan play one step above their normal romantic comedy level. Stephen Fry is a joy like the "RRRatman" and Ryan's fiancé; who lacks a single romantic bone in his body. <br /> <br /> The film fell below most radars, but it is a delightful treasure that does not become obsolete with repeated views. It presents writings and performances of first category and it is a soft treatment in a less than kind world.
