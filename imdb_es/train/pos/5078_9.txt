This one stood out for its originality. I'm seriously tired of watching Hindi movies that are a hotch-potch of a lot of Hollywood and Brit movies. Some flaws were inevitable, however, this movie is a must see. Surya's depiction of the policeman as clean and conscientious (unlike the pot-bellied and money-hungry we normally see) was impressive. He has come a long way since his work on Nerukku Ner. I liked the movie so much that I had to possess it. Normally I do not like the kind of senseless violence film, somehow I really felt for each character and, therefore, I can not call it "senseless" violence. I do not appreciate the excessive melodrama and sentimental scenes that go hand in hand with most films in Hindi and Tamil. I loved this movie because it lacked the same. The reaction of ACP Anbuselvan to losing his wife is not exaggerated, it is heartbreaking and makes me want to cry. There are certain times when I'm watching a movie when I want to press the FF button. Many times I've wanted to do that in a movie theater. I never wanted to do it when watching this movie. I really hope that Ghajini is released soon.
