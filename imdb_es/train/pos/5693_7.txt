The real story of a bunch of drug addicts who steal from a businessman not so honest drugs, jewelry, weapons and money. Some would say that this is the tragic account of America in the late eighties, where the peace and free love of the sixties had crashed against drugs and AIDS. Honestly, this is just normal people without a goal in life who sit down to drug themselves and decide to rob a ruthless man. What is the second part of your master plan? Once they have their things ... they will sit down and drug themselves again. Great plan Even if you do not know the story, there is no suspense in this movie or surprises. The fact that Cox tries to make some kind of popular heroes of these characters, with party scenes and a montage of his booty, is weak and insulting. The story was better with a more direct approach. As it stands, this is just a sad story that drug dealers kill short-term drug traffickers. The greatest story, in more ways than one, is John Holmes. He is the center of this story anyway. This movie should have been all about him, his life. He was the one who was in Wonderland, with the wonders about to vanish. <br /> <br /> P.S. Although not official, Boogie Nights is a better version of Holmes's life. It is not entirely real, but it is much more pleasant.
