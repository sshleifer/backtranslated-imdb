For all of you who do not speak Swedish: the Swedish [original] title of this film; "Rånarna" translates into something in the line of "The Robbers". This fact is the main problem I have with the film, because it is not really about thieves. This is a young woman who works for the Swedish police investigating robberies. One might think of a normal desktop job, but this girl will soon be in the field taking the matter into her own hands, as the story goes, even shooting one of the thieves ... Exactly: We've seen this before. The fact that there is a pretty interesting twist in the plot midway really does not help, since the ending is as clichéd as the first two thirds of the film. <br /> <br /> What prevents it from being just another mainstream. The film is the fact that it is performed masterfully in every way, that the actors are as great as the ones that are not and that the director really makes it as exciting as most of the story. <br /> <br /> One thing that I really loved about this movie is the fact that music creates the right mood when it's needed, but it's absent for the rest of the time, which gives it a good sense from reality to shootouts and car chases scattered throughout the film. A good touch! The fact that Michael Persbrandt is one of the few Swedish actors who are often typified, hurts the movie because you know that not only will he play the heroine's boyfriend and he will be a secondary character in the background, but that's something you have to neglect. <br /> <br /> In general, it is an entertaining movie that steals more money in its plot than time. 7/10
