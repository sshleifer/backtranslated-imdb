This has to be a unique twist of two genres never seen before. The genre of the giant monster movie with the genre of the living mummy movie. This unique mix makes for a unique and compelling story. The cast is outstanding, including TOM BOSLEY, who, as far as I know, has never been in a horror movie. The effects are impressive and the idea of ​​a giant mummy full of smaller mummies is great. My only complaint, I wish we saw more of the giant mummy, but other than that I think they did a great job. The dialogue, the characters and the story were perfect. The performance was wonderful. This has to be the best movie out of the science fiction channel. You heard me, the best movie that came out of the science fiction channel. I give the fallen 9 out of 10.
