['In the areas where they overlap, this good film is light years away from the innocence of 2004, which gave the impression of a tearful eye and a heavy breathing that ravages girls. Here, the effect is much more realistic and really reaches the heads of the three protagonists as they make their way through an adolescence full of pitfalls. The three directors, all unknown to me, offer very safe performances, of the type, in fact, that can be so natural that it will be difficult for them to replicate this acting quality in other films, so I would not be too surprised. If they do not listen again. It would be good if this could move away from the Art Houses and enter the Multiplexes where there is an external possibility that you can &quot;talk&quot; to the crowd of chewing gum to which it is not directed.']
