This movie is brilliant in every way. Touch the complexities of love relationships in a meaningful way, but never give lectures. The script never condescends towards any character, not even the unfortunate Johnny. It also benefits from spot management, production design, casting and performance. The fact that Cher is so perfect in the movie and is more different from "Cher" than she has ever been, is a wonder to me. I see Moonstruck at least once a year and I saw him again this Christmas Eve with my 16 year old twin daughters and they also loved it. It has something for everyone with a heart and leaves you full of joy in the end.
