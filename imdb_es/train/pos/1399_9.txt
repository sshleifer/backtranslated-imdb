This is one of the most superficial episodes in which the plot really seemed to be an excuse to have fun. BUT, I appreciated this cheerful approach and this is really one of the best episodes to watch on a purely funny level. Think about it: the crew members have encounters with the white rabbit and Alice from Wonderland, a Bengal tiger, a samurai warrior, a knight on horseback who kills McCoy, and a series of other seemingly strange events that simply do not they do nothing. meaning at all until the end. Despite all the danger, you can not take everything very seriously, it's too much fun and the whole episode seems very surreal. So, on a purely non-aesthetic level, it's a great thing.
