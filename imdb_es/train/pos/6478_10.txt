Despite being said from a British perspective, this is the best documentary of the Second World War ever produced. Presented in digestible episodes (as digestible as war), the serious voice of Laurence Olivier connects the crowds of eyewitnesses who were forced to experience the events of that horrible moment. Waiting for his appearance on DVD in the US. UU., Europeans had their opportunity with a DVD release earlier this year.
