I'm overwhelmed by the work of Jim Carrey. I keep trapping this movie in my head. Al Grinch likes Martha May, Cindy Lou (who is very upset, her sweet innocence) who tries to get the Grinch in the Christmas spirit, the Grinch's childhood (very funny!) And, in addition, the weak and obvious ending with ... Christmas is not all about gifts. I must say that I felt stupid coming out of the theater with a group of babies and young children laughing and so on, but this movie was a good integral adaptation of the short film by Dr. Seuss and the SI for all ages.
