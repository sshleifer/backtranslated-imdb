Zane and Beringer will keep you on the edge of your seats. Normally I will not watch military or war movies, but it was worth my time. <br /> <br /> He was serious, but he also had humor. Beringer's character turned out to be heroic and honest. Whatever happens, you know that it supports you. <br /> <br /> Zane's character developed throughout the film. It was not just a suit, it definitely showed that he could be a hero and handle a weapon. <br /> <br /> However, the end through me a bit. It really was not like that in the whole movie, but I'm glad I saw it. <br /> <br /> It's worth taking a look.
