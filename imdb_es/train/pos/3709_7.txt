Any screen adaptation of a John Grisham story deserves a general Hollywood approach, and Robert Altman is about the last director he would go to for an outlet anywhere. But this south fried pot boiler is pretty good. While he's not among Altman's best, he's certainly not among the movies he made that left you scratching your head and wondering what he was thinking. <br /> <br /> Altman had thrown his hat into the suspense mystery with noir tints. before, in his 1973 film "The Long Goodbye." "The Gingerbread Man" is not as good as that movie, but it stays pretty good on its own. Kenneth Branagh is an arrogant lawyer who is framed for murder after he becomes involved with a client (Embeth Davidtz) who has asked for his help to protect her from her cuckoo father (Robert Duvall). The film takes place in Savannah, Georgia, during a tropical storm, which gives the film an oppressive atmosphere that I liked very much. The twists and turns towards the end of the movie become increasingly heavy, and Altman proves that he is not as expert at organizing shootouts, but overall the film is not a bad addition to Altman's canon. <br /> <br /> He also stars Robert Downey, Jr., Daryl Hannah, Tom Berenger and Famke Janssen. <br /> <br /> Grade: B
