Fragility - 8/10 - It's a non-sensational title and the owner of "Bill Paxton Directs" aside, this is a pretty old-fashioned biblical horror thriller. In the end, it may end up being just the Gothic cousin of the bloodline south of Kubrick's "The Shining", but hey, that's a pretty entertaining notion. It also has a touch of plot ... and a very ambiguous moral message. This is the kind of film that years from now people will take late at night with a basic cable and will scare the beejesos to see it. Pity that the director Bill Paxton had to go to contract to star in ... well ... is still a demon of good income.
