I liked the movie a lot. I remember reading it several times as a child and I was glad to see that a film about the book had been made. <br /> <br /> I was sitting as a child for a boy and a girl, aged 11 and 8, and I had to talk to the girl to watch the movie. But happily, in the end, he was glad to see it and even said he wanted to buy it on a DVD as soon as it came out. <br /> <br /> There were great moments of laughter out loud and The movie was not as "disgusting" as I expected, although it did have a pretty high range in the thickness of the meter ... <br /> <br / > The only thing I can not understand That's why they had to have the line "dilly" there made by Woody in reference to his private part ... that was for me the only shocking moment (and you could hear the adults in the audience audibly panting at that moment in the movie) ... I have no idea why that was put in the movie; He did not add anything to the real movie, except for that shock / panting factor ... other than that, a pretty good movie. Pleased to see the girl "Pepsi" all grown up.
