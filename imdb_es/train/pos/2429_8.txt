If you loved Deep Cover, this movie might like you too. Many of the poetic interludes recited by Fishburne in Deep Cover are from the lyric screenplay of "Once In the Life," a screen adaptation of a play that Fishburne wrote. If you love Larry as much as I do, you will love this movie that is all Larry, all sexy and complete. Of course, there are gun games and illicit substance use, after all, this is a gangster movie, but the script is beautiful and the story is touching, even a bit on the side of the movie. <br /> <br /> INCREDIBLE movie ... dark, terrifying, sexy and exciting. If you ever escape at night or hang out in a clubhouse, you will get the proper impact of the reduced sets (methophorically echoing being trapped in life). Full of witty omens and complex relationships, this film is tense ... all feelings are reflected in the bandage and camera shots. GOOD JOB!
