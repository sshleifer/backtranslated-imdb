This is a pretty boring movie. Well captured with realistic performances, especially a very good Depardieu as cad and bad boy with realistic locations and artistic connotations everywhere, fails because the director does not take a position, support or critical comment on the subject stipulated. One of the most respected and respected co-workers in France in the films with Depardieu (I think they made 7 together), Pialat does not get involved. It seems to be a treatise about why women fall in love with the bad boy that is going to hurt when they have around them a loving boyfriend and a good hearted husband. Isabelle Hupert, who plays the filmaker with an indifferent distinction, offers opprobrious responses such as "I do not know"; "I like your arms"; "I like the way he makes love" to her inquisitive husband who tries to throw her out of the house, but stops her and reconsiders because ... I guess he loves her. So accept and wait for why? That one day he will wake up and recover his senses. Things like this do not respond in Pialat's condescending docu-drama style with long speeches and even longer scenes that do not fit. I know the answers do not add up, but please take a position. Jules and Jim, this is not it. The final shot as cold as the film we have just seen is a headache and headache only for the most indulgent.
