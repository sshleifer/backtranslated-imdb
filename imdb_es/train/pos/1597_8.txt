This is the kind of movie for a snowy Sunday afternoon in which the rest of the world can go ahead with their own business while descending into a large soft chair for a couple of hours. The wonderful performances of Cher and Nicolas Cage (as always) gently pad the plot throughout. There are no rapids to cross, no dangerous waters, just a warm and ingenious oar in New York life at its best. A family movie in every way and that deserves the praise received.
