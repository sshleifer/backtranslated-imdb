This is without a doubt the most hilarious movie I've ever seen. Starting with the four delinquents sent by their parents to the Wienberg Military Academy, a tone is set that continues throughout this whole film of nonsense, and does not stop for a second. <br /> <br /> It's hard to try to describe this movie; The elements of humor are so successful and brilliantly conceived that, for the first time, it seems that it is nothing more than a stupid 80's teen comedy. But it is much more than that! Fresh out of the minds of those in the MAD magazine, Up the Academy offers a formula and style that I have never seen duplicated by ANY of Hollywood's "funniest" offers in recent years. Basically, the film is so full of children's cornball material that one could guess that the writers were a couple of 14-year-olds. Watch this movie if you like to act "immature". A classic. *****
