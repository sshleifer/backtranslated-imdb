I'm surprised that movies like this can still be made. I see all kinds of movies with my friends all the time and I can say that this is one of the best I've seen. I never thought that a movie of 146 minutes can make me think about that again and again. <br /> <br /> Washington, charismatic and intense as always, plays Creasy, a former exterminating anti-terrorist agent who was taken to the bottle. Once the protection of young Pita (Dakota Fanning) has been assigned to him in Mexico City, his emotional and redemptive arc begins in the way that only an adorable child can offer. Inevitably, Pita is kidnapped by thugs, and Creasy decides that most of Mexico City must pay the price for daring to take his character the catalyst of his teddy bear. Yes, it has become ... a man on fire. <br /> <br /> You must see this movie.
