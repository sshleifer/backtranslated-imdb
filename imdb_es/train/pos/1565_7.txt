I just saw The Saint Strikes Back for the first time and I thought it was pretty good. This was the first appearance of George Sanders as the Saint, where he replaced Louis Hayward. <br /> <br /> In this case, Santo is sent to San Francisco to investigate a shooting in a nightclub. With the help of his well-known inspector Fernack, who came from New York, they help the daughter of a crime boss. <br /> <br /> Along with Sanders in the cast are Wendy Barrie and Jonathan Hale. <br /> <br /> It's not a bad San movie. Worth to watch. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 stars out of 5.
