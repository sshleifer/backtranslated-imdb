I saw "Fever Pitch" by chance; I was playing on the plane that was going to Europe. Actually it was not so bad. Ben (Jimmy Fallon) is the number one fan of the Red Sox in the world, but his relationship with Lindsay Meeks (Drew Barrymore) can be difficult. The film is a rather interesting vision of how world events can affect people's relationships. It's especially telling now that the Red Sox ended their 80-year losing streak. I guess this kind of thing happens all the time and we just do not notice it. Not bad. <br /> <br /> Another movie that has an unusual relationship with baseball is the "Frequency" of 2000. Review them both.
