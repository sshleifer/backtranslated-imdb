(Sorry for my faulty language, I'm not a native speaker ...) <br /> <br /> Yes, this is a movie that almost demands an overwhelming reaction. Personally I agree with all the superlatives that are around. But I will not use this somewhat semantically empty way to describe the movie here. Because those "perfect, the best of all!": Criticism makes some people discourage (including me). <br /> <br /> Therefore, if you are looking for another 'Hamlet' that has the Potential to compete with many theatricals and all cinematic ones. Then, do not miss it, if you find it somewhere. (Unfortunately, not many people will have the opportunity to see it - there seems to be no DVD and the German version, which is pretty well done, is not available in any format). <br /> <br /> In case you decide to get a copy: save that reduced version of two hours (more or less) of this movie. It does not work or is fun, and it gives the wrong impression of a movie, which deals interestingly with the flow and architecture. And it has also been reduced to a 4: 3 aspect ratio. <br /> <br /> Greetings from Germany, F.L.
