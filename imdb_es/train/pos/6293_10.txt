Buster shines absolutely in this episode, which is the only vehicle I've seen towards the end of the race that allowed him to make the physical comedy (and silent!) That made him famous. It is still a shock to hear his voice deep in the sequences of talkies, his voice is almost the only thing that does not matter to me, as far as Buster is concerned, but his ability to make a premature leap is unparalleled. He even repeats some of the gags used in his first two pitchers with Roscoe Arbuckle. <br /> <br /> My deepest gratitude to Rod Serling for introducing us to this episode and for giving Buster's genius the ultimate reach. He did not have much time (one episode) to do it, but this is a moving tribute to Hollywood's greatest genius.
