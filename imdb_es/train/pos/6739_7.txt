"Film noir" is an overused expression when it comes to describing movies. All criminal drama seems to be a "noir". But "Where the Sidewalk Ends" is really a good example of what the genre is about. <br /> <br /> Very briefly, an over-enthusiastic detective (Andrews) accidentally kills a non-goodnik who works for mobsters. The murder is attributed to the father (Tom Tully) of a woman Andrews knows and falls in love with (Tierney). To save Dad from Old Sparky, Andrews captures the rest of the mafia and delivers himself. <br /> <br /> The morally guilty policeman is driven by impulses from the past. His father was a thief who was killed trying to get fired from prison. But that does not justify his actions after he accidentally gets rid of the no-goodnik in self-defense. Immediately he goes to the phone to report on the incident, but he doubts. He is already in the hot water with the department and this could end his career. Then, at the wrong time, the phone rings. He is Andrews' partner and Andrews tells him that the suspect they are following is not at home. He hides the body and then removes it with a slugging of a watcher and throwing the body into the river. <br /> <br /> What motivates a man to do something so foolish? Good. Your work was at risk. But now he has committed multiple crimes. At least I think they should be multiple. I counted the obstruction of justice, the assault, the removal of a body without permission, the trash, the vans of the first degree and the false testimony against their neighbor. <br /> <br /> In the end, we do not know if Andrews Root or not. The suspect did not deserve to die, it is true, but after all it was an accident because Andrews did not know he was a war hero and "had a silver plate on his head". Maybe it's that kind of ambiguity that made noir what it was, among other things, like characteristic illumination. If noir involved nothing more than black-and-white photographs, murders, criminals, mysteries, and suspicious women, we would have to include all of Charlie Chan's films under that rubric. <br /> <br /> Andrews is pretty good. It is a kind of Mark MacPherson (from "Laura") that has become bitter. He never laughs, and he rarely smiles, even when he's sitting in front of a Gene Tierney restaurant table, a situation that can make many men smile. He has no sense of humor at all. His few jokes are downcast. When he puts a man in a taxi and says: "Be careful, I almost hit my head", Andrews' answer is: "It's okay, the taxi is insured". Andrews may seem a little stiff at times, but this is a role that demands a stubborn and humorless determination, and he handles it well. His underestimation is perfect for the role. Small contractions or flickers project their thoughts and emotional states. And I suppose the director, Otto Preminger, prevented him from pronouncing the bullet as "BOO-let" and the police as "POE-lice". I could never decide for Gene Tierney. She is well in the role of the daughter of Tom Tully, a model, but it is like Marilyn Monroe in that you can not separate the adopted gestures from the features of the real personality. Did Tierney really have such an innocent, almost holy person? When he answered the phone at home, did his voice have the same quality of singer he has on the screen? Poor Tierney suffered some psychiatric problems, before there were effective medications for bipolar disorder. And Andrews too, although he seems to be a good guy, slipped into alcoholism before finally recovering and making public service announcements. <br /> <br /> Peter Muller's DVD commentary is modest, informed and, at times, funny. <Br /> <br /> Anyway, this is a good movie, as well as a good example of black cinema. The good ones are not all good, although the bad ones are all bad. Maybe that ambiguity is what makes it an adult image instead of a popcorn movie. For children, only one shot is fired on the screen and no one's head explodes. Sorry.
