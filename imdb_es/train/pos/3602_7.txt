['While the story of a child with problems that uses boxing for self-esteem and anger management is not new, history takes a new turn when the protagonist is a girl instead of a child. <br /><br /> Diana has problems at school. She simply can not stay away from the fight. At home, her father is humiliating her constantly. His brother trains boxing in a gym and one day, when he picks it up, he decides that he also wants to train. <br /><br /> It would be easy to call this movie &quot;Rocky with girls&quot;, I suppose. But that is not at all what it is about. The story actually benefits a lot from the main character being a girl instead of a boy. That way you can deal with more problems at once. First, the problem of not being accepted because she is not a girl, and then, when she arrives at the boxing gym because she is a girl. It is also a story about how a purpose can change someone&#39;s life. What positive things can make you grow. I do not want this to sound pretentious, because the movie does not feel pretentious at all, but what I&#39;m saying is true. <br /><br /> Michelle Rodriguez is also very good at the head. It&#39;s a shame really that she got stuck in the &quot;tough girl&quot; box now, because that&#39;s not what her part in &quot;Girlfight&quot; is about. Of course she is a boxer, but it is the most sensitive moments that really make her shine. <br /><br /> So maybe this is basically your weakest average story with a spin, but it&#39;s way above the public for Rodriguez&#39;s performance. I qualify this 7/10.']
