I'm certainly glad that a movie was made about Carl Brashear's incredible life story. As happened during the era of Civil Rights, Brashear became an inspiration for people of all minority groups who are not willing to settle for an expected state. <br /> <br /> Brashear interpreted by Cuba Gooding, Jr. is a leader in the example in the behavior of life that she has chosen. Very similar to Jackie Robinson, who integrated baseball and maintained it for his character and behavior. Like Brashear, Gooding knows that he does not want the sharecropper life that his father Carl Lumbly has and Lumbly makes it very clear to get more out of life than he has obtained. <br /> <br /> But while Harry Truman joined the Navy. Services after the Second World War, the Navy still has its restrictions. A black man can only be a cook or an officer servant, the real parts of the fight are denied. That's not good enough for Gooding, who is applying to become a Navy diver. <br /> <br /> Once at the diving school in Bayonne, New Jersey, Gooding receives it all, mostly by the Chief Operations Manager. In charge, Robert DeNiro. DeNiro may have some leftover prejudices, but nevertheless he is a hero and one that can inspire if one can overcome racial division. <br /> <br /> The best of Men Of Honor is the chemistry between DeNiro and Gooding. They certainly come from different places, but as they get to know each other, they both become Men Of Honor. <br /> <br /> Other good performances to highlight are Charlize Theron as the wife of DeNiro and Hal Holbrook as the head. At the diving school, a man that the Navy just wanted to retire for the reasons you'll see. <br /> <br /> Men Of Honor is an inspiring story about people with surplus value and the ability to change.
