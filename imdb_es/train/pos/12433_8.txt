This is a good movie, although people who are not familiar with the comics and books of Modesty Blaise can find it a bit slow and without action. For the Modesty fan, the film will be very enjoyable, particularly because he is very faithful in his presentation of the "story" of Modesty Blaise. Peter O'Donnell appears in the credits as "Creative Consultant" and the filmmakers must have paid attention to him as the plot closely follows the details that have been presented in the comics over the years {although the events have been recasting to modern days). The only thing that the true fan can find disappointing is that there is no Willie Garvin in the story. This lack of Willie again is to be faithful to the chronology of Modesty Blaise since the film takes place in the early days of Modesty's career. Alexandra Staden is a very credible young modesty that actually looks a lot like the modesty that is supposed to be seen. A welcome change from the portrait parody of Modesty by Monica Vitti.
