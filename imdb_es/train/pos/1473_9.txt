Keep in mind that any film (and much less documentary) that affirms any kind of truth, will generate an adverse and proportional amount of cynicism, from those to whom any suggestion and / or search for truths no longer makes sense, those of you who already There are Masters of psychology, cinema and the captains of the soul, they will undoubtedly find this film redundant, after all, you already know everything there is to know. Congratulations. <br /> <br /> For those of us in the minority like myself, I found "The Perverts Guide To Cinmea" ... mostly brilliant, and it's worth seeing for those interested in movies, psychology and philosophy modern <br /> <br /> A bit like Scott Mclouds "Understanding Comics", the director Sophie Fiennes, interrogates the Slovenian philosopher, psychologist and social critic Slavoj Zizek directly in many of the films and specific scenes he analyzes. The cover is an image of "The Birds" (Zizek takes a boat to recreate the shot). <br /> <br /> Lacanian psychoanalysis does not necessarily scream, a night of great fun ... but it is! If you like movies, that is ... Having a little knowledge of Lacanian psychoanalysis helps (Symbolic, Real and Imaginary) are terms that are expressed a bit at the beginning, but the scenes that Zizek selects and analyzes are very clear. What was always for me, a very abstract subject. In fact, it is probably better to become familiar with the movies you are discussing than with the terminology you use, which becomes clearer as the movie progresses. <br /> <br /> Why I love it, this movie is not because it chooses great films to analyze or reveals great truths about Lacan, but it shows in a very practical and intelligent way, where cinema and psychology (and by default philosophy) meet. <br /> <br /> Why is "The Sound Of Music"? A bit fascist, why are "Short Cortes" more than just classes and alienation? Why do birds attack in "The birds"? What is there to learn about the mind of "Alien Resurrection"? What does the planet of "Solaris" do? want, what do "Psycho" and "The Marx Brothers" have to do, and what the hell is David Lynch doing in every movie ... Zizek has some ideas. <br /> <br /> The role of the voice in both "The Excorcist" and "Star Wars: Revenge Of The Sith", is perhaps the strongest and most lucid moment of the movies, when it is involved in sexuality feminine Subjectivity I begin to wonder ... At one point, Zizek admits his feeling that the flowers are a kind of decorative dentatta vagina, which are disgusting and should be hidden from children (jokingly, it seems that ...). <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's a fascinating documentary, in which anyone who has seen a movie and thought it means something more than what was literally said, should try to see. <br /> <br /> And anyone interested in Slavoj Zizek, this is also an obligation, much less dry than "Reality Of The Virtual", and more direct than "Zizek!", Other two pseudo-docs, about "The Elvis of contemporary cultural criticism," as it is bent, in the English-speaking world. <br /> <br /> "The Perverts Guide To Cinema" is NOT the role of sex in the cinema. Zizek says that cinema is the last perverted art, because it teaches "how to wish and not what to desire", and that it is the only form of contemporary art that can allow these desires to be articulated. This is not a film about how to find reality in the cinema, it is about finding the cinema in reality and how important and exciting it can be. Hard to find, and a bit long, but well worth it, it's one of the most "stimulating" "movie" experiences I've had.
