['This movie was good for your time. If you like Eddie Murpy, you must add it to your collection. Eddie was young and funny with his 80&#39;s haircut. Charlotte Lewis, Eddie&#39;s star is sexy. This was one of his first films and it was not bad. The graphics were good for the 80s. Many of the actors went on to make other good movies that you should see through IMDb. Another one that Eddie must have is &quot;Coming to America&quot; and &quot;48 hours&quot;. Another actor &quot;Victor Wong&quot; has a small part in this movie. Check out some of his older films such as &quot;Big Problems in Small Porcelain&quot;. If you liked the action movies of the 80s, this is your movie.']
