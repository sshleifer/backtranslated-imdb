Three horror stories based on members of a transgressive Hindu cult who return home but who changed in some way In the first story, our former cult member is now in an asylum and is visited by a reporter who wants to know what happened in the cult. The story is told a little slow, while the two sit on chairs and face each other. The reporter is particularly interested in what led to the death of the participants. What seemed pretty boring suddenly becomes very exciting with a surprising twist in the story. Things get pretty bloody. <br /> <br /> The second story has a young and violent criminal who visits a psychiatrist for a mandatory therapy. The patient seems to have some kind of agenda but the psychiatrist is up to the task. Once again, things slow down a bit and become rare. Then, there is a strange twist in the story that is very well written and surprising. <br /> <br /> The final story is about the spiritual healer who claims to be able to eliminate people's diseases with their hands. One of the patients is a former member of the cult, so that successful healing is complicated. Once again, we are surprised by a turn. It has a pretty bloody scene there. <br /> <br /> There is some nice feminine frontal nudes as well as male frontal nudes for some reason. I discovered that the stories are very well written and the director manages to completely establish each story with its surprising twist and bloody sequels. <br /> <br /> Note: review of the German DVD.
