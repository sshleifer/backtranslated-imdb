The Sentinel, I expected it to be a good movie, and he was right. A great story, first of all, of a novel. I thought it was an original story, but I guess not, and that was a very smart story. Michael Douglas in this film is very good and Keither Sutherland is also good, but nevertheless, it is very difficult to leave him out of his role as Jack Bauer in 24, but eventually you do and it is very different in The Sentinel than in 24. Also other person who tried to ignore his role on television, but failed. Eva Longeria. She was not that good in the movie and had a back seat on the whole thing. After watching the movie, I had constant dreams about The Sentinel and I could not sleep. In general Sentinel is a good movie and I would recommend it.
