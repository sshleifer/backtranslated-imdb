Wow. I saw this last night and I'm still recovering from how good it was. All the characters felt so real (although most of them are petty, selfish and ** holes) and the strange story: the middle-aged widow starts fucking her daughter's boyfriend, who is absolutely convincing. Main performances around the world, but congratulations to Anne Reid and Our friends in the north, Daniel Craig (the latter will be the next David Thewlis). <br /> <br /> And the director Roger Michell? This is as far from Notting Hill as possible. Thank God. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie!
