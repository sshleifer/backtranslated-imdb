['Full House is a wonderful comedy about a father, Danny Tanner, whose wife had just died in a car accident. Danny then asks his brother-in-law, Jesse Katsopolis, and best friend, Joey Gladstone, to help raise their three daughters, Donner Jo &#39;DJ&#39; Tanner, Stephanie Tanner and Michelle Tanner. This is my favorite show, and I can watch it all day. And something in Full House always makes me laugh and there are also sad parts. There is never a dull moment in Full House. The main characters are played by Bob Saget (Danny Tanner), John Stamos (Jesse Katsopolis), Dave Coulier (Joey Gladstone), Candace Cameron (DJ Tanner), Jodie Sweetin (Stephanie Tanner) and Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen (Michelle Tanner) ).']
