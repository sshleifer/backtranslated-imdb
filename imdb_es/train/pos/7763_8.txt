One thing about Hollywood, someone is successful and is always rushed to be copied. And another thing is that the players give some of their best performances outside of their home studio. <br /> <br /> Rock Hudson received so much praise for his performance in the giant Texas movie that Universal executives must have thought, quickly in another modern Texas environment. <br /> <br /> Similarly, Robert Stack got excellent reviews for The High and the Mighty as the pilot that was cracking under the pressure of flying a damaged plane that was natural to give him another chance. Until the paper. <br /> <br /> Both of these ends were achieved in Written on the Wind. Before Hudson was the owner of the great ranch, he is now the son of a hunting partner of Robert Stack's father who took Hudson under his wing. In other words, the part of James Dean without the racism of James Dean de Giant. <br /> <br /> Lauren Bacall is the executive secretary of an advertising agency that uses Stack's Hadley Oil Company. Hudson likes her, but is dazzled by Stack's millions and when he courts a girl, he has the means to really pursue a campaign. She marries Stack. <br /> <br /> And last but not least, we have Dorothy Malone, Stack's loving sister, who has a yen for Rock, but Rock is not about to get involved with this wild girl. <br /> <br /> Dorothy Malone spent more than 10 years on a pile of colorless film heroin papers before getting this gem. She won the Best Supporting Actress Award for her role as Marilee Hadley and was deserved. <br /> <br /> If you like the telenovela of the fifties in technicolor color, this is the movie for you.
