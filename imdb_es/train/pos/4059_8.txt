The first of Ghibli's official films, Laputa is very similar to its predecessor Nausicaa, but while Nausicaa was an SF epic, this is more an adventures and adventures comedy with a rather weak SF premise. <br /> <br /> For the first half hour of the movie I thought I was going to love it. Once again, you are amazed by Miyazaki's attention to detail, and his ability to evoke an imaginary world in a meticulous and beautiful perfection. The animation, although not yet in the league of the latest Ghibli films, is a bit better than in Nausicaa. <br /> <br /> I mentioned in my Nausicaa review that a character is drawn in an anime more 'lupinesque' style. Here are a lot of them: the pirates. They provide the comic element in the movie, although I'm not sure why you need a comic element. Nausicaa was not funny at all, and I think he was better. Still. Having said that, Dola, the pirate leader, is easily the most memorable character in the movie (even if she is basically a Long John Silver woman, do not be surprised if you are sometimes reminded of 'Treasure Planet') and it's fine. expressed by Cloris Leachman in the American dub. <br /> <br /> The English voice is well recognized for the most part, actually. However, something started to get pear-shaped for me about this movie about half way. I think the best way I could describe it is that the characters are swallowed by the vast scope of the story. I'll come back to that later. <br /> <br /> There is so much to admire about Laputa, and obviously many people love it, that I almost feel bad for only giving 8 out of 10, but for me the operative word here is "admire". It was more impressive than affecting personally, and in more than two hours he began to crawl. <br /> <br /> The crucial thing for me was the following: I really discovered that I did not care much about any of the characters. . Disney would have taken the precaution to develop the characters, make you really fall in love with them, instead of leaving them as relatively two-dimensional pieces to move while you were still speechless at the incredible views of the film. Even that would have been tolerable if there was a bit of SF in the story to make up for it, but it was basically a lot of nonsense about the Princesses and the magic crystals. That's where Laputa falls as far as I'm concerned, and that's what prevents a potential movie from being 10 out of 10. Having said that, it must be admitted that Miyazaki was way ahead of Disney in general in 1986, when we considered that his movie of the same year was the very serious 'Big Mouse Detective'. <br /> <br /> Laputa is a good movie in some way an amazing movie, and you should definitely see it, but I feel it is overrated. I definitely prefer the previous 'Nausicaa del Valle del Viento'. <br /> <br /> By the way, if you can see them in chronological order, look at the Nausicaa fox squirrel that appears briefly in Laputa.
