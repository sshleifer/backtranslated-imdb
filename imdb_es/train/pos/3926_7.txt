Generally speaking, it is a small and ridiculous whodunnit masquerading as a period drama / biopic. <br /> <br /> However, the only reason I wanted to see it was because I was curious about what the great Henry Fonda really was. As in its heyday. He did not disappoint me, he produces a truly warm and charismatic performance. <br /> <br /> In addition, I can honestly say that I never really got bored at any time in the movie, so I am a huge 1/2 fan of *****
