This is a very difficult movie, and it is almost impossible to have an idea of ​​what is happening. At first, it seems to be a fairly pedestrian movie about a boy (Trelkovsky) who needs an apartment and a person is invited when the current tenant (a woman) commits suicide. Then the twists and turns begin. Are the neighbors trying to kill him? And why are the clothes of the dead tenant appearing in the apartment? One wonders, finally, if Trelkovksy is the previous tenant. <br /> <br /> SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER <br /> <br /> One of the tricks that Polanski throws at us is to lie to us. We assume that when we see things from a character's point of view, we see things as the character does and that there may be distortions of reality. We assume that when the camera shows us things from its omniscient point of view, we see reality, but Polanski makes us lie to the camera.
