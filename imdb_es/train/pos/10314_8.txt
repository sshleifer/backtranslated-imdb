This and "His Pilgrim Soul" are two of my favorite episodes in this new version of Twilight Zone. As I mentioned in my commentary on the new series, there is something missing in this new series. Perhaps they emphasize too much the lesson to be learned. It's a bit more clumsy and sentimental than Serling's version. However, this episode can also be considered quite sentimental. I think the appeal is that no matter what they do, lovers can never join. I remember I was not surprised by the Korean film "Il Mare" (which later became "The Lake House." I think it's because I saw this episode for the first time and it ruined the impact of the later movie.
