The first time I saw Enchanted April was five years ago. I loved it so much that my husband surprised me with a copy next Christmas. They are two women who decide to rent a castle in Italy for the month of April, leaving behind their daily lives. At the beginning of the film, they are very sad women, and you can not stop venturing into them while they plan this getaway with two other women whom they invite to share the expenses. This is perhaps the most good feeling movie I've ever seen. It is pure and simple, without car chases, without animosities and without deaths. It was made with great care and very good taste. You can not help smiling all the time, except when you cry happy tears!
