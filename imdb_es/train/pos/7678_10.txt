I just saw Holly along with another film about trafficking and child sexual exploitation called the International Film Festival by the Sea Film. I have to say that Holly flew the trade out of the water. <br /> <br /> Holly is a powerful and amazing film on many different levels. From a purely artistic and cinematographic perspective, it is incredible. The sound mix, the camera angles, the direction and the acting are successful. <br /> <br /> In addition, the way you handle the subject is in good taste and not exploitative. Presents the issue of sexual exploitation of children in an educational and accurate manner. The filmmakers paid an exquisite attention to details, truly capturing the nuances of the epidemic of child sexual exploitation and trafficking. Too often, when it comes to a topic of this kind, it is tempting to surprise the audience with graphic scenes of rape and violence. Holly is able to achieve all this without falling into that typical Hollywood trend. <br /> <br /> I have had the pleasure of seeing Holly at two film festivals, once in the United States and once in the Netherlands. I can honestly say that I have never seen the most moved audiences. After listening to the conversations after the evaluation, people ask what they can do personally to combat child sexual exploitation. <br /> <br /> I recommend it to everyone, both for its cinematic value and its theme.
