I saw this movie on the cable, it was really fun, from the stereotype of the police chief to the stereotype of the big bad guys, Jay Leno and Mr. Mayagi from Karate Kid Star in this good comedy about a car part prototype. I compare this movie with "RUSH HOUR" in which a local policeman has to associate with an Asian police officer to solve a case. The persecution through the farmers market in downtown Detroit brings back memories. Nice soundtrack, good script, I give it 10/10.
