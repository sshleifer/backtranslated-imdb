LA DANZA MACABRE is an unpretentious series movie that challenges you to fall in love with Barbara Steele and suffer the consequences.

Not only is it a product of the sixties, but the large percentage of unskilled cretins in Hollywood can not understand MACABRE's horror formula. That formula is based on a primordial factor: GOOD WRITING. Low-class classics such as CASTLE and the films of Poe de Corman with R. Matheson and OUTNE OF THE PAST by Tourneur share a common feature of strong writing. It's simple.
