['Karloff and Lugosi - Together again! This is one of those movies that occasional fans will overlook and tend not to appreciate as much. It&#39;s not a total horror movie like the duo&#39;s two previous hits, The Black Cat and The Raven. But, it is very worthy of both talents and it is a fun movie when you visit again. <br /><br /> The Invisible Ray was directed by Lambert Hillyer, a director who made westerns mainly, but curiously in these last days of the reign of Los Laemmles in Universal, he found himself at the forefront of this and the last horror movie of The Laemmles, Dracula&#39;s Daughter Both are clear and well defined fantasies that are very light in content of horror despite the fantastic elements. <br /><br /> Just when Lugosi went crazy in The Raven, there&#39;s a lot to be said about Karloff&#39;s Hamoff in The Invisible Ray. The only aspect of the story that is particularly unsatisfactory is that Karloff&#39;s character, Rukh, acts so angry before being poisoned by Radium X, that there really is not much change once it starts to shine. This is very similar to the complaint that people have about Jack Nicholson in The Shining: he is basically a madman from the beginning. There is no real transformation. Same here. Halfway, Karloff simply has an additional purpose of revenge in his mind. However, I still enjoyed his performance, just as I did with the antics of Lugosi in The Raven. <br /><br /> Meanwhile, Lugosi completely surprises him and gives him a moderate and thoughtful turn as Rukh&#39;s rival in science, Dr. Benet. Lugosi also has some of the best lines of the film, including a memorable warning for the police trying to catch Rukh, of which I&#39;m aligned with the horror film writer John Soister in &quot;What if he (Rukh) touches someone?&quot; the inspector asks Lugosi, answering hesitantly, in a way that only Lugosi could say: &quot;They die.&quot; Just as Lugosi could be so dull, he could also be more perfect than any actor. this is one of those moments. <br /><br /> Therefore, the interactions of Karloff and Lugosi are very good, since we managed to get Karloff&#39;s crazy antics to face the cold logic of Lugosi. Karloff would go to play similar mad scientists many times, however, one would wish that Lugosi had played a more direct role like this. He only had one more opportunity (Ninotchka). <br /><br /> The Invisible Ray is a fun movie and a real pleasure for the true fans of Karloff and Lugosi. It is one of those films that improves in each visualization, not because it is a masterpiece, but because of the charisma and talent of its stars and the way in which this story complements the darkest and most horrible pairs that they had. The special effects, by the always innovative John Fulton, are spectacular and all the supporting actors are suitable. Frances Drake looks as beautiful as she did in Mad Love and plays a strong woman, something rarely seen in classic horror films. The scene at the end, when Karloff stalks her and she does not scream, is one of the most disturbing moments of the film. A great movie, fun!']
