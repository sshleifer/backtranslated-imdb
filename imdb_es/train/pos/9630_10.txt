I've seen Dirty Work several times and it's probably my favorite short of Stan and Ollie. <br /> <br /> In this case, Stan and Ollie are chimney cleaners and get the job to clean the chimney at Professor Noodle's house (Lucien littlefield). While Noodle is doing crazy experiments in his lab, Stan and Ollie cause a lot of chaos when trying to clean the fireplace and mess up the living room. The end is where Ollie falls into a tank of special formula that Noodle uses for his experiments and this makes him a chimpanzee! The best part is where Ollie falls down the chimney and a pile of bricks fall on his head, but he does not seem to suffer much from this. <br /> <br /> Dirty work is Stan and Ollie in their funniest way. Very funny. <br /> <br /> Rating: 5 stars out of 5.
