This movie has many strong points. He has one of the best horror releases outside of the Lugosi-Karloff-Chaney circle: Lionel Atwill, Fay Wray and Dwight Frye, as well as Melvyn Douglas, the protagonist. It has all the right ingredients: bats, a castle with many stone stairs, a mad scientist, people from the town waving torches and hunting vampires, a character of the type "Igor", a beautiful girl, even a ridiculous hair Burgomeister. The soft focus camera work is changing and imaginative. There's even some comic relief well spaced throughout the script. <br /> <br /> But it's not really a monster movie because there's nothing supernatural about "Kleinschloss" ("little castle"). The plot revolves around the mad generic scientist (very well interpreted by Atwill) who values ​​his work more than human lives. <br /> <br /> It is not a top-level material, due to a boring plot resolution and some embarrassingly bad dialogues for Dwight Frye. But it's worth checking out if you like the first horror images of b / w.
