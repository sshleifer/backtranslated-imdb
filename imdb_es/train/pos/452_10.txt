"My little girl, my sister, dreams <br /> <br /> How sweet all things seem <br /> <br /> If we were in that kind land to live together, <br /> <br /> And there slow and long love, <br /> <br /> There is love and death between <br /> <br /> Those scenes that show you, that sumptuous climate ". <br /> <br /> Charles Baudelaire <br /> <br /> Based on the novel by Elizabeth Von Arnim, "Enachanted April" can be described in a sentence? It takes place in the early 1920s when four London women, four unknown, decide to rent a castle in Italy for the month of April. It is the correct description, but it will not prepare you for the fact that "Abril Encantado": a definitive film to "feel good" is the perfection of its genre. Charming and sunny, tender and peaceful, friendly and magical, it's like a ray of sunshine on your face during the spring when you want to close your eyes and smile and stop this moment of serenity and appreciate it forever. This is the movie that really affected my life. I watched him during the difficult times when he was lost, unhappy and very lonely, when I had to deal with the sad and tragic events and accept an unflattering truth about myself. It helped me to recover my optimism and hope that anything can be changed and that anything is possible. I had promised myself then that no matter what, I would get rid of misery and self-pity and appreciate every minute of life, with its joy and sadness ... I promised myself I would go to Italy and that same year I did it and I was not alone . <br /> <br /> Charming, charming and comforting, "Abril Encantado" is one of the best movies ever made and my eternal love. This little movie is a diamond of the highest quality.
