Barbara Stanwyck as a really hard cookie, a waitress from the working classes (and a prostitute at the hands of her father) who escapes to New York City and uses her feminine trickery to obtain a file job, move on to the mortgage and the security deposit, and later as deputy secretary of the second in command at the bank. The dramatic study of a female character without fear of being unseemly has not lost any of its power over the years, with Barbara acting like a storm (portraying a woman who learns to be a first-class actress). With a bit of Nietzschean philosophy in her disordered life, this lady crushes the feeling, but never loses our fascination, our admiration. She is a talkative, simple, tough speaker, but she is not a bitch, nor is she a man-eater or a woman who hates. This girl is totally out of herself, and while we wait for her to finally discover real values ​​in life, her way up and down the ladder of success provides heated and sexy entertainment. John Wayne (with thick black hair and too much eye makeup) performs well in an early role as an assistant in the archives office, although all support players are quite good. *** since ****
