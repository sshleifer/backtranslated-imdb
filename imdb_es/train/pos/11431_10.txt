My 3rd year French classes always enjoyed this movie a lot. At a multicultural high school in the center of the city, the film provided many discussion topics (in French in class, but I know that a lot of discussion continued in English after class). The most obvious is the relationship between Protée and Aimée compared to Protée and France. <br /> <br /> I always mentioned that this movie had one of the "most attractive" scenes I had seen in a movie. . One year, a 17-year-old African-American shouted "Yes!" when he discovered the scene: in which Protée is helping Aimée to tie her evening dress, while both examine the other's reflection in the mirror. The directors use the "mirror technique" when they then want to focus on the internal conflict of one or more characters in a scene: this is a perfect example of the technique, and it is "sexy". <br /> <br /> Most students had trouble understanding the end of the movie. One suggested that one of the themes of the film was "Africanism", and that no matter how much he loved Africa or the Africans, one can not "become" African (as the driver tried): one must BE African.
