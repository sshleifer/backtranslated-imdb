This movie can be really bad, but it's very funny. The poor performance and bad direction enhance the hysteria of the film. The twins are very funny in their roles aanescos. If you enter this movie waiting for the first Conan or Excalibur, then you will hate it. If you see it in a good mood and accept it as fun, silly and fun, you will have a good time. Look at the scene where they try to hang the brothers, the funniest scene in the movie. I wish Mystery Science Theater 3000 had done this!
