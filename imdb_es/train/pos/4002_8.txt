At the beginning of the film, we see May and Toots preparing for their trip to London to visit their older children. One can see that Toots does not have the best health, but he goes ahead. When he dies suddenly, May's world starts to get out of control. <br /> <br /> The film directed by Roger Michell, based on a screen play by Hanif Kureshi, is a study of how this mother figure comes to terms with her new status in life and her awakening in a world that I did not even know existed until now. <br /> <br /> May's life as a suburban wife was probably boring. Obviously his sex life was almost nothing. We come to know that you have had a brief extra marital relationship, and then nothing. When May loses her husband, she can not go home, so she stays behind taking care of her grandchild at her daughter's house. In this environment, May begins to covet the young and cunning Darren, the occasional lover of his daughter. <br /> <br /> Darren awakens in May a passion she has never known. May responds by transforming before our eyes. May, who at the beginning of the film is not very elegant, suddenly begins to dress, becoming an interesting and attractive woman. She ends up falling madly with this young man who keeps her satisfied with a passion she had never felt before. <br /> <br /> Having known a couple of cases similar to this story, I was not surprised. Watch the reaction of May. Her own ability to have a normal relationship with Bruce, a widower, ends frustratingly for May, who realizes how good her sex with Darren is. The younger man, we think, is alone in this matter to satisfy himself and for the possibility of extorting May money. Finally, the daughter, Helen, discovers what Mother has been doing behind her back when she discovers the erotic paintings that her mother has made. <br /> <br /> The film is a triumph for the director. In Anne Reid, Mr. Michell has found an extraordinary actress who contributes a lot to May's role. Also amazing is Daniel Craig. He knows how Darren will react to the situation. Anna Wilson Jones as Helen is also vital to the story, since it is she who has to face the mother about what has been happening behind her back. Oliver Ford Davies has a small role as Bruce, the older man in Helen's class, and he's quite effective. <br /> <br /> The movie is rewarding for those who will see it with an open mind. <br /> <br />
