I took a chance on "Hardcastle and McCormick" buying the value of Amazon's first season (Canadian release). When I got it, I started with the pilot and I was instantly hooked after that. I rated it with 5 stars on Amazon, and I rate it with 10 stars here. That's how good it is. What I liked were the opening and closing themes and, of course, the Stephen J. Cannell logo at the end of each episode, but above all, the relationship between the Judge and Mark as they worked together to solve each case. I was so hooked that I also bought the second season as a companion and enjoyed it equally. If you do not have this excellent series on the disk, I think you should buy it and put it in your collection.
