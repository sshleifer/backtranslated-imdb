This movie is still one of the favorites of all time. Only a pretentious and humorless imbecile would not enjoy this wonderful movie. This movie feels like a slice of hot apple pie topped with French vanilla ice cream! I think this is Cher's best job and her most credible performance. Cher has always been blessed with charisma, good looks and an enviably thin figure. If you like her to sing or not, who else looks like Cher? Cher has definitely left her mark in the entertainment industry and will be remembered long after others have arrived and left. She is one of the most unique artists there is. It's funny, because who would have thought of Cher as an actress with a natural talent? She is the head above the so-called "stars" of today's movie. Cher is a real actress on the same level as Debra Winger, Alfre Woodard, Holly Hunter, Angela Bassett and some others, in the sense that she never seems to be "acting", she really becomes the character convincingly. She has earned the respect of her peers and the audience that goes to the movies. <br /> <br /> Everything about Moonstruck is wonderful: the characters, the stage, the dialogue, the food. I never get tired of watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Every time I see the scene where everyone is sitting around the dinner table in Rose's house, I pause on the remote control to see exactly what delicious food Rose is serving. I saw spaghetti, mushrooms (I think), but I do not know if they are eating ravioli, ziti? What is that main course? It looks wonderful and it's driving me crazy! <br /> <br /> Everyone in the family were hard-working people who respected and cared for each other. The grandfather was not separated and tolerated, he was a vital part of the family and was listened to and respected for his age and wisdom. He seemed to be an old independent codifier, quite healthy. <br /> <br /> Loretta's mother was not "just a housewife", she was the glue that united the family and was a model example of what a wife, mother and house manager They must aspire to be. She was proud of the lifestyle she had chosen, but she did not let her define who she was. High-powered businessmen are not as comfortable on their skin as Rose Casterini was. Look at the way he said, "I did not have children until after age 37. It's not over until it's over." You had the feeling that she was the kind of young woman who did exactly what she liked and got away with it without the other person realizing what had happened. She was charming, witty and very intelligent. What a great mom! <br /> <br /> I did not really like Loretta right away because she seemed a little wise, I was not as adventurous and I had as much control of myself as I wanted others to think. She could tell others about themselves and where they had been wrong, but she really did not apply common sense to her own life. He was going to marry the son of a middle-aged mother simply because he wanted a husband and a sense of identity and purpose for his life. She was more conventional than her own mother. She dressed and wore her hair like a midwife in a detention house and seemed lacking in humor and bored, but underneath you felt that she was vulnerable and lonely and had a lot of love to give to the right man. She would probably end up being an amazing mother too. <br /> <br /> I will see in the future, a house full of Loretta and Ronnie noisy, happy children and screams, and Rose and Cosmo enjoying every minute.
