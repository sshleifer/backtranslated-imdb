Although recognized as the best cinematic treatment of the difficulties of having a house built in the country (or purchased) according to your specifications, it is not the first nor the last. In 1940, Jack Benny and Ann Sheridan were the protagonists of the film version of the comedy GEORGE WASHINGTON SLEPT HERE by George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart. And about fifteen years ago, Shelly Long and Tom Hanks had the lead in THE MONEY PIT. The first thing was to move to an 18th-century country house that ... err, needs work. The latter was about the construction of the house of your dreams, at the end of the eighties. Although the two films have their moments, both are not as good as BLANDINGS, which was based on an autobiographical novel of the same name. <br /> <br /> Jim Blandings and his wife Muriel (Cary Grant and Myrna Loy) are noticing the narrow corners of their apartment, which they share with their two daughters Joan and Betsy (Sharyn Moffett and Connie Marshall). Although Blandings has a good income as an advertising executive (in 1948 he earns $ 15,000.00 a year, which is like winning $ 90,000.00 today), and he lives in a luxury apartment, which in the New York City of that day he rents! - Feel that you should look for something better. He and Muriel drive to the country (Connecticut) and soon find an old ruin that both imagine can be arranged as the house of their dreams they want. <br /> <br /> And both fall into the worm's financial hole that the purchase of land and construction can lead to. On the one hand, they are so enthusiastic about the idea of ​​building a house like this that they do not pay attention to the warning following the warning of their sage, if it is the cynical friend and lawyer Bill Cole (Melvin Douglas, in a very sarcastic role). For example, Jim buys land from a Connecticut dealer (Ian Wolfe, sucking his chops under his breath), with a check before checking twice the correct cost of land in that part of Connecticut. Bill says he paid about five or six thousand dollars more for the land than it is worth. There are problems with the water supply that both Blandings have never thought of, such as hard and soft water, which leads to the Zis - Zis water softening machine. They find that the designs they have in mind, and that they have worked with their architect (Reginald Denny), can not be ruled out cheaply by the time Muriel decided to build a small colony that no one planned. <br /> <br /> The escalating cost of the project is a matter of concern to Jim. He was appointed to manage the account of "Wham" ("Spam" had become a popular result of World War II, since the public began to use it as a substitute for meat, in light of his success with the armed forces ). Jim can not control this (he's not alone, one or two more executives have twisted him before him). He comes up with the following part of "poetry" (?): <br /> <br /> "This little pig went to the market, <br /> <br /> It was pink and as beautiful as ham. <Br /> <br /> He smiled on his way, <br /> <br /> When they gave him the ax - <br /> <br /> He knew it would end up being "Wham"! "<br /> <br /> His Secretary looks at him as if he needs a straight jacket when he reads it. <br /> <br /> Jim also suspects more and more of Bill's attentions to Muriel, although (in this case) Bill is not to blame. But it's always close (Jim keeps forgetting that Bill is the clear-headed one and that he's preventing Jim and Muriel from making so many mistakes). All three have setbacks, the best being when they are locked in a room in the half-built house, just as the men have gone for the day. They can not open the door, and Jim (in panic) tries to break the door with a battering ram. Break a window, and the door opens alone. <br /> <br /> The movie works quite satisfactorily, with all the actors apparently having fun. It's a film that (despite the changing price and salary levels) does not really age at all. After all, most Americans dream of having their own house and always have. <br /> <br /> Some years ago, a painting company used a lovely scene with Myrna Loy and Emory Parnell in relation to the painting work that Parnell's company has. To do in different rooms. She carefully shows the different shades of red, blue, etc. he wants to even give a courteous Parnell a single thread for the correct shade of blue. The commercials indicated that the paint company had a wide variety of colors to choose from in their painting work. They proudly called Loy "Mrs. Blandings" in the introduction to the commercials. However, you can imagine how the carefree Parnell handles the situation later, when Loy leaves him with his painting team.
