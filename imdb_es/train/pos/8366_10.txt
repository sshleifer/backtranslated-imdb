['From the beginning I knew I would be in the best movie watching experience of my life. The idea of two giant robots, manned by brilliant human beings, fighting each other for the control of the world was the most intense and best thought plot I have ever experienced. I can not even begin to describe the brilliant performance and the well written script. Let&#39;s just say that it compares with the two images of The Lord of the Rings, combined. The Academy had a serious neglect not to celebrate the joy that is ..... ROBOT JOX.']
