In the first place, it is not supposed to be a brilliant and provocative film, as many other critics seem to compare it. the first review says something similar to whoever likes this does not know anything about horror movies, apparently it's the other way around. If you looked back after the movie, it was not meant to be convincing, it was a low-budget ipecac. But in reality that was all he was looking for, he was destined to scare away viewers with a total impact value (and all the flaws in his visuals were much less noticeable in the original VHS versions). <br /> <br /> I gave this one a high score because it reached its goal and, although it was not quite horrible (no sense of shock), it made me feel a little sick and completely paranoid / pessimistic (I did not do it. I trust nobody for about a week because I did not want to wake up stuck and tortured)
