I loved this episode. It's so great that the 5 team up to stop LutherCorp and save the world. I also love this episode because Kyle Gallner (Bart Allen / Impulse) and Justin Hartley (Oliver Queen / Green Arrow) are guest stars. I just hope that Clark joins the Justice League and we can follow this group of heroes around the world! =) It was really exciting and keeps viewers interested in what will happen next. I think Chloe should also join the team as a Watchtower, that would be something very interesting for her besides the Daily Planet because she has no superpowers. Also, I want to know what kinds of themes Lex will use for 33.1, I wonder what other kinds of powers other people in the world have!
