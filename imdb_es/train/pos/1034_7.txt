['I think that this movie was probably much more powerful when it debuted for the first time in 1943, although nowadays it seems too preached and static to elevate it to greatness. The film is set in 1940, just before the United States entered the war. Paul Lukas plays the very serious and decent head of his family. He is a German who has been fighting the Nazis for seven years and avoiding capture. Bette Davis is his understanding and suffering wife who has managed to educate and raise children without him from time to time. As the film begins, they cross the border from Mexico to the USA. UU And, for the first time in years, they will relax and stop running. <br /><br /> The problem for me was that the family was too perfect and too decent, which made them look like obvious positive propaganda instead of a real family that was suffering real problems. While this had a very noble goal at that time, today seems false. In particular, the incredibly strange and extremely scripted dialogue used by children simply did not sound as true. They sounded more like anti-fascist speeches than the voices of real children. As a result, they were extremely annoying, especially the smaller one that came off, sometimes, as a brat. About the only ones who seemed real were Bette Davis and her extended American family, as well as the Romanian who lived with them (although she did not have a discernible accent). <br /><br /> It&#39;s really hard to believe that the ultra famous Dashiel Hammett wrote this dialogue, since it just does not seem to be real. The story was based on the work of his lover, Lillian Hellman. And, the basic idea of the story and the plot are good, ... but the dialogue is bad sometimes. In general, an interesting curiosity and a movie with some excellent moments, ... but that&#39;s really all.']
