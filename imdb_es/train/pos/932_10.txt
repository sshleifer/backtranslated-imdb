['********* Ten out of ten stars ********* <br /><br /> It&#39;s hard to believe that this was made for a television movie. Only the phrase, &quot;made of TV&quot;, makes me shudder. The production values for television films are almost always much lower than the production values for professional film studios. That said, this version of &quot;Christmas Carol&quot; should have been released in theaters, because it&#39;s that good. It is my personal favorite of all &quot;Christmas Carol&quot; movies because all aspects of this production are of the highest quality. Yes, there are some minor glitches on the screen with two of the ghosts that visit Scrooge, but there is not a movie in existence that does not have at least a couple of bugs. <br /><br /> Scott becomes a stellar performance like Scrooge, it&#39;s a pleasure to see him. In fact, I can not think of a performance in this movie that should not be applauded. The costumes, the shooting to the place and the winter background are fascinating. The musical score is endearing and moving. Add to that, solid direction, impeccable cinematography and faithful writing; Here we have what will one day be considered a holiday classic. There really has not been enough to be a classic, but mark my words, one day soon it will be. This film has become an annual Christmas tradition in my home because it embodies the true meaning behind Christmas: love, disinterest and surrender. In a world so selfish and greedy, my family and I can get lost in &quot;The Christmas Carol,&quot; starring George C. Scott.']
