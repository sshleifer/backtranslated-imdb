['While the title &quot;Before the Devil Knows You&#39;re Dead&quot; comes from an Irish proverb, the film unfolds like a Greek tragedy. It all starts with a failed robbery and continues out of control while two brothers try to escape the mess they have gotten into. <br /><br /> The cast is well assembled with Philip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke playing the aforementioned brothers. The remarkable support includes Albert Finney as his father and Marisa Tomei as the wife of one brother and the other&#39;s lover. Beyond these principles, the performance is not remarkable. <br /><br /> The story is convincing and there is a certain degree of enthusiasm. The narrative structure keeps things interesting by providing different points of view and frequent turns of time. That said, the unpredictability of the film is somewhat muted, as it becomes clear from the beginning that this story is a tragedy. In short, a quite impressive debut for the first screenwriter Kelly Masterson. <br /><br /> Sidney Lumet&#39;s management is well managed, but I am more impressed by the fact that he is still over eighty years old. I was less impressed with Carter Burwell&#39;s score, but it&#39;s not a major distraction. <br /><br /> In the end, the film proves to be a compelling visualization and, while the story and the presentation may have superficial similarities with other films, this remains a unique experience.']
