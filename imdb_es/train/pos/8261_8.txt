Emotional and naive sense, but without a doubt affective, emotional man helping man, in this case personified as German and French miners forced to close each other after the Great War thanks to a new frontier, leading to the disappointment of the German side. As the French are the bosses. But when a fire starts on the French side, the common decency of German men leads to assistance, security and even friendship. This was a request that would fall on deaf ears within the decade, since a certain man on Pabst's side would break that piece and turn the Great War into a mere prelude. But it is obvious to me that Pabst really believes or at least wants to expect this kind of fundamental humanism, since this film radiates with this optimism, while his more cynical and extravagant adaptation of The Threepenny Opera lacked the necessary bite to make That will work. . Also fostering their honest belief is the fact that the characters here are not simplistic spokesmen for the positions, but real people, with real families to whom we also live in private homes. These are ordinary, working-class men, who simply believe in the value of caring and treating their neighbor well, and on this day of individualistic opportunism, I will take a little dilution in my plan to get a positive message that represents a point of view to which I believe we can all aspire. <br /> <br /> (Note: Apparently, the end is cut off in most impressions, where the French rebuild the mining gate, closing the men once more.) This is a brutal turn of events , and may have made the movie a better movie in general, but I would have regretted having soured the positive vibrations of the final sequence, so in summary, I'm glad it's been cropped.) {Grade: 8/10 (B) / # 7 (of 11) of 1931}
