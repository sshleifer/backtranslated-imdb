I came across this movie by chance when I listed all the films I wanted my sister to record for me while I was on vacation and I'm very glad I included this one. These are issues that most directors avoid, my only problem with this movie is that it was made for television, so I could not buy a copy for my friend! <br /> <br /> It's a poignant story about how people with eating disorders do not necessarily get away from everyone and the number of dieting friends. I was struck by the fact that while bulimics can maintain a fairly stable weight, they have more serious consequences for their health than many people do not know.
