In this film, made JUST when the production code was applied, Jean Harlow is Eadie, and Patsy Kelly is the companion "Kitty" who chases men. Girl from Missouri begins with the girls getting on a train, with Eadie promising herself to make money while searching for a millionaire husband, remaining integral to the process. It does not take him long to meet Frank Cousins, (Lewis Stone, was the kind Doctor at Grand Hotel, as well as Judge Hardy in the "Andy Hardy" films), but it is not what it seems ... The censors must having LOVED Harlow's line "A girl could not accept an expensive gift like that of a gentleman unless she was engaged." Later, someone says "you know we've never been alone together" and Eadie replies "Yes, and we're not going to be!" Lionel Barrymore is T.R. Paige, another perverse and rich person who comes to rescue her when a problem comes in search of Eadie. At one point, Paige declares: "You should erase me from your list, I am not a man of ladies" ... I wonder what that line would have been just a couple of years before the Hayes code arrived in the city. What was he really saying? Carol Tevis appears to be the high-pitched "baby talker" featured in the credits on IMDb. It seems that he was only in the entertainment world from 1931 to 1939, with "Munchkin" in Wizard of Oz as the last part he played. Fun toy games, while girls chase men all over the country. Look for Nat Pendleton as the lifesaver, who was an Olympic wrestler from 1920 (silver medal winner) become a movie star (he was in many of the Kildares doctors, and would appear in four of Harlow's films). the young Franchot Tone, love stories, even Jean Harlow in swimsuit at "Palm Beach", although the outdoor scenes of the center seem to be a backdrop.
