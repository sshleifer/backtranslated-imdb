It has singing. It has drama. He has comedy. It has a story It's one of the best movies ever made ... period. If you can not enjoy this movie, you must be asleep or in some kind of mental disorder. In "Yankee Doodle Dandy" James Cagney sings and dances on his way to an Academy Award; But in this movie he is BETTER! This is James Cagney in his BEST essential! It's fast with the one line! He's fast with his feet! It is an action without stopping. And the parodies of songs and dances are classics, especially "Shanghai Lil." And the cast of support is great; and the whole movie is optimistic, moves fast and exudes confidence. And even though this movie was made more than 70 years ago, it can still be seen, even today. And, of course, this movie features Miss Ruby Keeler (who was married to Al Jolson). She is the perfect partner for James Cagney ... and Dick Powell too! If you like optimistic movies, fast-paced, with much singing and dancing, this is the movie to watch.
