Incredible and challenging, beautiful TESS OF THE STORM COUNTRY is the daughter of a fisherman squatting in the land of a rich man. Animated and audacious, she captures the heart of the millionaire's son, but violence, terror and sudden death are what will pursue her immediate future before she can claim the sweet peace of happiness. <br /> <br /> Mary Pickford is absolutely charming In this splendid, heartbreaking film. She considered Tess as her favorite role and filled it with all the joy and enthusiasm that made her for years the most popular movie star in the world. The story has all the essentials for a modern fairy tale, with Mary, the charming and anguished heroine harassed by all kinds of dangerous and stressful situations. The environments are first class, and the sets of outdoor fishing villages are especially well conceived. <br /> <br /> In the cast of cast, Jean Hersholt stands out as the vile villain who tries to force Pickford to marry him. Hersholt, a very gentle soul off the screen, manages to brilliantly portray the complete moral corruption of his character. <br /> <br /> This was actually the second time Pickford filmed TESS. A 1914 version had been one of his first major films, but his production values ​​were somewhat outdated by the standards of the 1920s (without close-ups, for example) and Mary, who produced her own films and powerful enough to 1922. The movie that he wanted, he decided, for the only time in his career, to remake a film. The final result certainly lived up to its expectations. Both films were very popular at the box office. <br /> <br /> A fascinating study for some future film researcher would be the influence of Christianity on the life of Mary Pickford; Without a doubt, she runs like a golden thread through the silent films she produced. While the romanticism inherent in the very nature of silent cinema can make these spiritual feelings seem somewhat uncomfortable today, we are forced to accept them as sincere reflections, by their very repetition, of Mary's sincere beliefs. In TESS, a beautiful scene in particular stands out in this regard: Pickford is teaching herself to read using a Bible. She tells Lloyd Hughes (who plays his girlfriend) a word from the back of the Book that he does not understand. He imitates it for her (the word is obviously "crucified") and, with her eyes turned toward the sky when the full meaning of the Sacrifice appears, Mary's face becomes positively beatific. <br /> <br /> A splendid new orchestral score for Jeffrey Mark Silverman has supplied TESS, which perfectly highlights the beauty and pathos of this wonderful film.
