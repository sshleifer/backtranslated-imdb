['I just finished watching this movie and I must say it impressed me a lot. Everything was magnificent. The performance of the characters, the story. A credible child who became brave, always willing to help others. Your mother should be proud. I could not look away from this movie for fear of losing something. It is the fable / tale of the prefect with morals, cute and terrifying spirits and &#39;monsters&#39;, but in spite of it, moving people. A child showed up and harassed at school and became a hero. Chosen to be a rider at the local festival in the village and a trip to Goblin Mountain where he discovers the Yokai, which are amazing creations of which Brian Froud would be proud. And the evil Kato and his batter who definitely needed a hug. These evil people capture the Yokai and throw them into a red pit along with unwanted objects, such as motorcycles and other mechanical things, and merge into horribly violent robotic monsters whose only job is to kill. Takashi, a little boy, is the one who becomes his savior, along with a man / red dragon, a turtle man and a river princess, as well as a cute little creature that, if it had been America, could have turned her into a stuffed and sold. It&#39;s in all good toy stores. The lines are good, especially the Do not try this at home with children and other gems that bring a smile to your lips. Suspend the belief and see this with a child or alone and enjoy! Although I must admit that the end was a bit sad. And not necessarily like that. Greetings Furdion']
