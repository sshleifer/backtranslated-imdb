['I liked the movie a lot. In the end, I was crying. This movie is amazing. Watch the movie You will enjoy it. I could have given him a rating of more than 10. I liked the jokes between chance and shameless. I like the leadership of the shadow. In general, this movie was perfect. <br /><br /> its sequel is good but not as good as this movie. I think there should be a third sequel. Not only does this film attract children, but also adults. My whole family enjoyed this movie. The opportunity was full of humor. . <br /><br /> again I say that THIS MOVIE IS A TRUE TO LOOK. The more you see this movie, the more you will be linked to this movie. This movie is a classic.']
