It's only been a week since I saw my first John Waters movie (Female Trouble), and I was not sure what to expect the second time. <br /> <br /> Although the previous film was outrageously exaggerated, Pecker is actually a funny movie that satirizes New York art critics to a T. Anyone who can not imagine what these "Experts" find so attractive to modern art, you will enjoy seeing these smug snobs so full of themselves about Pecker, a Boy who has just found a broken camera and starts shooting at his friends and neighbors. <br /> <br /> Edward Furlong (Pet Sematary II, Terminator 2: Judgment Day) was surprisingly good as Pecker. There was not much importance in any of the roles in this movie, but it really shines. <br /> <br /> Christina Ricci (Prozac Nation) comes with another great performance as Pecker's girlfriend. In fact, it was an exceptional year for Ricci (Buffalo '66, The Opposite of Sex, and Pecker. <br /> <br /> Lili Taylor, who had the only good role in The Haunting, was also an important part of The movie and it really made it nice. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of funny scenes, but I have to say that the best thing was when the crown came together shouting: "We want Bush!" "We want Bush!" "We! I want a bush! "I thought it was a Republican convention until I saw the police get away from the dancer. <br /> <br /> I'll have to look for more work from Waters, especially Hairspray, now that it's in the news.
