['To say that a movie is depressing is not necessarily a bad thing. I am very willing to watch a depressing movie if there is a point to make and this one certainly has one. It is the often heartbreaking story of a Chinese man and his family, as they experience many years of hardship and a lot. BUT, I must warn you that this could be the most depressing movie that came out of Hollywood in the 1930s, because peasant life in China was DIFFICULT, at the very least. Be prepared to see segments on hunger, death and disease. <br /><br /> The only negative thing that is not the persistent tone of the misery is that Paul Muni plays the main role. While he was an exceptionally talented man, it is a pity that Hollywood has always chosen people of European descent to be Asian leaders during this era. If he is paying attention, it is quite obvious that Muni is wrong in the part.']
