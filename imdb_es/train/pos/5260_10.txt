Yes, it can be ridiculous and it may not seem as fun as many high-budget comedies, but this movie is really fun if you really see it. Tim Meadows has always seemed funny to me after the Saturday Night Live show. Every time he made this character on the show I would laugh out loud. Then, when I saw that I was going to be at Comedy Central one night, I decided to check it out. In general, I was deeply impressed with this film, because I was not destined to win an Oscar or become a comedy of the year, but it did entertain the fans of Saturday Night Live who love the character of Ladies. This movie also includes some highly quotable lines that can be recited over the next few years.
