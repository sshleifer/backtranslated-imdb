The barriers seem to be one of those series that have been lost in the mists of time. After its transmission in the early 80's and a repetition, it has sunk without a trace. This is a real shame. <br /> <br /> Originally I saw it when it aired in the Southern TV region on Sunday afternoons and it was a classic visit at tea time. Although I do not remember much about the program, some things remained in my mind. The most remarkable were the unforgettable titles. The sad flute music that accompanies the escape attempt across the Eastern European border and the subsequent car accident (and that scene has left me with a lasting love for Mercedes 'fintail' models when they used a Merc 200). Although it was not obvious at the beginning, the solution to the mystery of the series was in these titles. <br /> <br /> The plot about a young music student trying to unravel what really happened when he discovers he was adopted had many twists and turns, but Barriers was a surprisingly "adult" children's drama. Benedict Taylor was excellent as Billy and it was a shame he did not do much more. <br /> <br /> This was a quality drama, very late for a DVD release and I hope to have the opportunity to re-familiarize myself with this in the future. <br /> <br /> A fond memory of my childhood
