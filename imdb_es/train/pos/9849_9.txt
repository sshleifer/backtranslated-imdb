When I saw the trailers, I HAVE to see the movie. And when I did, I had the feeling that I felt dissatisfied. It was a great movie, do not get me wrong, but I think the big parts are already in the trailers, if you understand me. It was very fast and it continued, so I never got bored and enjoyed watching it. The mood was absolutely great. My first contact with a sloth (... or something like that).
