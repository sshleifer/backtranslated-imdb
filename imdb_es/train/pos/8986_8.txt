Anton Newcombe makes the film and he is the main subject. Watching him play a song if not an entire album quickly showed the boy as a true talent. Think it is god, but it is so prollificante and interesting. The DWs are not really that interesting in comparison musically or otherwise. "Hey, do you have a driver's license?" , Anton says to the cameraman: "Well, let's pawn this guitar!". Great use of footage / home video. Great to see the rock documents are still being made. A great document about the creative process. If you like this go to see Nirvana Live! Tonight! Exhausted! on DVD A good experience Anton is this movie. 8 out of 10
