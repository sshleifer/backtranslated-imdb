['The other night I saw this movie at midnight on On Demand, not knowing what to expect. I had heard about this movie, but in reality I never had any opinion about it. <br /><br /> I have to say that I was impressed by what I saw. I was really scared in some places and I definitely remember jumping in my seat several times. <br /><br /> The Blob was scary. Now, I look in a jar of jelly and wonder if it will catch on my hand. <br /><br /> Steve McQueen was really good like Steve Andrews, the protagonist of the movie. I also liked the old man at the beginning. <br /><br /> For a horror movie of the 50&#39;s, this was very well done even by today&#39;s standards. <br /><br /> 8/10.']
