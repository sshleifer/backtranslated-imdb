Very good, except for the end, which was a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> The script was very good as was the performance. The images were often very grainy, but this somehow added to the film, since the snowy features were in good places that helped to create an atmosphere towards the film. This effect was ruined by the incredibly incredible end. <br /> <br /> I was going to give this movie an 8 out of ten, but the end was down from a point to 7 because it seemed to get away radically from the first 75 minutes of the movie and it seemed quite forced in the End to make the filmmakers look smart <br /> <br /> However, this movie was much better than movies with much larger budgets and it seemed to be filmed as a home movie with some additional equipment. There are not many special effects like these, but for the suspense it was very good.
