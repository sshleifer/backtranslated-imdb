I thought that this movie was very well done, Heath Leger was very convincing and his Irish accent was impeccable. Orlando Bloom and Naomi Watts were also really good and credible. I have no idea what really happened with what really happened, but it reflected why people sometimes become what they do. Maybe those in authority have always been corrupt and I found it interesting that more than 30,000 signed a petition for Ned Kelly NOT to be hanged, so maybe there is more truth in this movie than previously thought. In many ways it reminded me of Cold Mountain, which was another good historical movie. In general, I would recommend this film and I'm a little puzzled why it did not fare better in theaters.
