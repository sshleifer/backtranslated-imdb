The wit and rhythm and the three numbers that stop the Busby Berkley numbers put this ahead of the overrated 42nd Street. This is the definitive musical of the 30s with a frantic performance by Jimmy Cagney. One of the latest releases before the Code of motion picture production was strictly enforced. You must see it.
