The filming is nice and the atmosphere is very realistic. I liked it, since it boldly risks the conceptions of the many difficult moral and social customs of the fields of mainland China of the 1930s, as well as more basic human questions: I felt that I could have a real idea of ​​the times, recreated even in splendid photos of the traditional Chinese. Theater and purist representations of life on the street. It seemed worth experimenting. The interwoven role played by Buddhism is probably the most faithful to form, both in its modest aspect and in its philosophical aspect, perhaps the most effective I have seen in the Chinese film. The casting is great. The images are memorable. Acting is solid enough. Thematically puerile but rich enough to complement the vehicle of its expression.
