['ROLL is a wonderful little movie. Toby Malone plays an 18-year-old boy (very well acted, by the way) who is in football. Malone&#39;s cousin takes him out the night before his big game in an adventure with many twists and turns that involves two gym bags, a drug dealer, some difficult cyclists, some policemen and some prostitutes ... and the movie keeps us guessing about which characters are on which side of the law, what is the content of each gym bag and even what gender is a key biker. Parts of it reminded me of LOCK STOCK AND TWO SMOKERS. <br /><br /> For me, ROLL reinforced three opinions I had before seeing ROLL. Those opinions are: 1. I really want to visit Australia one day. The country and the cities are beautiful and it seems such a great place for a vacation. <br /><br /> 2. Some of the best filmmakers in the country are Australian. The cinematography on the roll was especially impressive. I loved the stylized colors and lighting in many of the scenes. <br /><br /> 3. Australian women are HOT!']
