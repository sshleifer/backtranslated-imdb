A fascinating and wonderful look at the films that inspired the excellent Martin Scorsese. Many of the films he talks about are easy to relate to his works, particularly the previous ones, the silent era. Very nice despite being a bit long, I found that this is one of the best film documentaries so far. Obligatory visits if you admire Martin Scorsese and his work.
