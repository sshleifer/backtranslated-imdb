When watching this movie for the first time, it is difficult to know what has happened, but in a later visualization it becomes clearer. I enjoyed this movie. Dean Cain was excellent in the role of Bob. The character of Lexa Doig was confusing to understand, at first, she was willing to catch Bob, but I really think she fell in love with him, although by then she had already broken his heart. The performance of Dean Cain was an excellent habitual. He improves with every movie he makes. My only question at the end of the movie was what happened to Bob, to Camilla and to the baby. The viewer was left to decide.
