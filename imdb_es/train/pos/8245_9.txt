['Even without saying a word, Billy Connely is a wonderful zombie ... Carrie Ann Moss as &quot;mom&quot;?, Even better. Zombies girlfriends? <br /><br /> &quot;... My father wanted to eat me ... I never tried to eat Timmy.&quot; <br /><br /> And I thought Dawn of the Dead was good. It&#39;s something like Airplanes meets (meats?) Night of the living dead, sponsored by Zomcom .. <br /><br /> And do not forget my coffin head <br /><br /> And Fido with an Aloha shirt is great! <br /><br /> And yes, the social comment is too much to start commenting on. <br /><br /> Suffice it to say that everything really works!']
