Made just ten years after the actual events, and set in the Bunker under the Reichstag, Pabst's film is totally exciting. It reeks of the death of sulfur waiting for the perpetrators of the world war. I have not seen it in more than three decades, but it remains strong in my visual and emotional memory. The characters seem to be waiting to be walled in their cave. A little dialogue between two generals: "Does God exist?" "If he did, we would not do it." It is a pity that it is not more available for exhibition or purchase because it would be interesting to see and compare this film with the documentary about Traudl Junge, "Im Toten Winkel" (also known as "Blind Spot: Secretary of Hitler") and "Downfall" with Bruno Ganz.
