24 has to be the best series of spies / adventures that has been broadcast on television. The idea of ​​telling a story in a real time period of 24 hours is dazzling. The style of filming and the rhythm is what gets us to see it. And Jack Bauer is one of the great protagonists of a television series in a long time. I rate this, along with The Simpsons and The X-Files, my three favorite television series. <br /> <br /> This first episode begins with the conspiracy to assassinate US Senator David Palmer, who is also running for president. Bauer is called to his office to find out who is behind all this and, at the same time, decipher his daughter's path to the unknown after fleeing her bedroom. Thus, an adventure with the best political style begins and, what is better, is that it always takes place in real time, which makes this television series a real work of originality at a time when almost all the programs of Television seems to be showing us the same things over and over and over again.
