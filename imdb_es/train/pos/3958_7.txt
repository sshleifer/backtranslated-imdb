Moe and Larry are newlyweds and have married the demanding sisters of Shemp. In his music studio, Shemp learns that he will inherit a fortune if he marries someone. <br /> <br /> "Husbands Beware" is a new version of "Brideless Groom" from 1947, considered by many as one of the best Stooge films with Shemp. The remake contains most of the images in that movie. The new scenes, taken on May 17, 1955, include the plot of Moe and Larry marrying the sisters of Shemp, along with the cooking of a turkey with turpentine! Also some new scenes are added at the end of the movie (a double was used for Dee Green, if you blink, you will miss the appearance of the double). <br /> <br /> "Husbands Beware" would have made For a good movie with only the plot to marry the sisters. Budget considerations, along with fewer reservations for two-reel comedies, influenced the decision to use older images. <br /> <br /> Although the Stooges were still making completely new films, most of their releases for 1955-56 were composed of old movies with some new scenes released. "Husbands Beware", while one of these hybrids, is visible and entertaining; we see again the majority of "Brideless Groom", and the new scenes are funny enough for the viewer to go through the movie. This film is one of the last Stooge comedies that presents new images of Shemp, and premiered six weeks after his death. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
