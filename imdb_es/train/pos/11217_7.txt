Being an otaku since the days of Robotech, I can still say that Gunbuster is one of my favorite animes of all time. Considering when it was made, the animation is of superior quality. There are no loops or sequences in which the quality of the technique decreases. Although the final episode is in black and white, it does not detract from the enjoyment of watching the film. Although it has been described as "sappy", it must be taken into account that females do not react in the same way as males. Since the main character is a woman, it must be obvious that she does not necessarily need to resort to "macho man" tactics to earn the respect of her peers. The seiryuu for Noriko, by the way, also plays Akane in Ranma 1/2. Noriko is like a three-dimensional cartoon you can get; her personality captures the essence of an energetic girl who at first seems to be completely helpless but who ultimately triumphs through the strength of her will. The only complaint I have is that the wick looked a little like teddy bears. Even the Gunbuster uses a rather dubious "Homing Laser" and "Buster Shield" (which is nothing more than having the machine wrapped in a giant velvet cape around itself in true Dracula style). I doubt that the scene was to be fun, but it broke me. However, overall, I would rank Gunbuster among the top 20 animes of all time.
