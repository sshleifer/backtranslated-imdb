['I did not feel that this movie was as smart as it seemed to think it was, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. <br /><br /> It is original, although it reminded me a bit of two other French films, Vidocq and City of Lost Children, mainly because of the coloring, but also because of the avant-garde quality of the close-ups of the characters. <br /><br /> Located in a prison cell, but do not let this discourage you, this movie apparently goes beyond many box office hits from multiple locations. <br /><br /> Always interesting, with the perennial &#39;Black Arts&#39; at the forefront and a very good characterization that makes some are too credible. <br /><br /> Fear with some blood, it&#39;s worth seeing.']
