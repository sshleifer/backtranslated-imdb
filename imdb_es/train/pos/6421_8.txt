['&quot;Men of honor&quot;: the true story of a proud and persistent black navy diver (the fabulous Cuba Gooding Jr.) is definitely a great film that touches and entertains, and is part of the absolute essence of the new millennial cinema. The wonderful performance is the main reason to make this film something really special and very enjoyable, a splendid experience. The charismatic Robert De Niro is wonderful as the abrupt, fierce and ruthless boss of Billy Sunday; the paper is practically written for him. This film, along with the fantastic &quot;15 minutes&quot; (2001), are two of the last proofs that he remains one of the best actors of our time. On the other hand, &quot;Men of honor&quot; includes an excellent performance by Cuba Gooding Jr., who has been one of the most promising young black actors since &quot;Boyz n the hood&quot;. &quot;Men of honor&quot; goes directly to the company of &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot;, &quot;As good as it gets&quot; and &quot;Instinct&quot;. Cuba Gooding Jr. is a skilled and fantastic actor, and I am prepared to get many more great films from him. &quot;Men of honor&quot; also has an excellent story and probably the most exciting diving sequences in the history of the film. This is a great fascinating movie and I can only recommend it.']
