Soldier is not a great movie, and everyone who hates it has many good reasons. But I liked Soldier a lot, partly because my expectations were so low that what I saw surprised me. <br /> <br /> First, the artistic direction is strict and well executed. As for science fiction backgrounds, Soldier was doing things with more design than 90% of the genre. The sets, costumes and accessories were all consistent and executed competently; I did not love all his future military style, but I was impressed by the effort. For me, this made the movie worth the time it took to see it. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I'm a Kurt Russell fanatic. I grew up seeing this guy in some of the most memorable films of my youth ... The Barefoot Executive and his films by John Carpenter. Soldier is essentially an action movie, and the role of Sergeant Todd is an essential action hero. It's not an award-winning role, but Kurt retains the convincing emotion with VERY small dialogue. <br /> <br /> Third, the fight scenes and the battles are well choreographed. This is not iron monkey, not even the matrix, but, once again, far exceeds the average level of quality in the genre. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen it, you like science fiction. Action movies, pick it up if you go through the rental deposit you choose. Just do not wait for the next Bladerunner.
