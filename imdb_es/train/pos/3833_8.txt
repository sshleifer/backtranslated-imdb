I can not believe that others have had such a serious opinion of all this. God, it was really fun to encourage Cassidy Hop-a-long. It was a great tribute to the Western series of years ago. It was not meant to be a great cinematic experience, except that it was. And what if there was not a great bonanza of special effects? It was fun, tongue in cheek, look at old Western. Man, relax and enjoy.
