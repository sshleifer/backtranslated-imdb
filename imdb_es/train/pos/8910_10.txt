Most of the Atomic Age monster movies that I saw on television as a child, and some of them, including THE BLOB, scared me the lights of the day. Films like INVADERS FROM MARS made it very clear to us "little friends" that children could not be trusted when it came to things like things that invaded the Home World; THE BLOB has just reiterated that fact. I remember, fondly, the late afternoons spent on the floor watching Body Snatchers and Martian Invaders and Blobs filter into an unsuspecting society. There was a summer, in the early 1980s, when a local science museum (in Richmond, Virginia) made an Atomic Age classic every weekend. These were 16mm films, and most were black and white (and the projector was noisy), and the "color" print of THE BLOB had faded to a faint pink, but, man, it was fun. I dragged my mother and she enjoyed it as much as I did. It was there, in that science museum, that I really fell in love with THE BLOB. The filmmaker's intention was, of course, to make money, but it was the sincerity of everyone involved, from the filmmakers to the "talent" (the players), which made me fall in love with this film. Corny? You bet Cheesy? They do not get any cheese. But, man, what a movie!
