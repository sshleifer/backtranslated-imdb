In her first non-aquatic role, Esther Williams plays a school teacher who is a victim of sexual assault. It gives a good performance, which shows that it could be very effective outside the pool. Like the detective who solves the case, George Nader gives perhaps his best performance. And he is so handsome that it hurts! John Saxon is the student under suspicion, and although he excels in credits, Edward Andrews is his overprotective father who is the standout. <br /> <br /> Bathed in a glorious tecnicolor, The Unguarded Moment is irresistible. Hokum and, sometimes, compelling drama.
