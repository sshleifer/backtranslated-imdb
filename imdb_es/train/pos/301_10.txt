"Everyone laughed" is a magnificent Peter Bogdanovich who finally gets the recognition he deserves, and why? There are many reasons why the fact that it is established in New York is what really sets the tone, the fantastic soundtrack, the attractive turns of the Ben Gazzara star and the late John Ritter, which is excellent. And, of course, no classic is complete without Audrey Hepburn. The film is a light and windy romantic comedy that is very much in the vein of the thirties comedy, the film is essentially about the Odyssey detective agency, directed by Gazzara, who along with his fellow detectives smoke and skate on the eccentric Blaine Novak (the co-producer of the film) and John Ritter, basically, Gazzara falls in love with the rich wife of mogul tycoon (Hepburn) and Ritter falls in love with the beautiful Dorothy Stratten, who sadly murdered after the production, "They All Laughed "It's an essential show for the Bogdanovich fans.
