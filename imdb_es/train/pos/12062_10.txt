This movie has been scaring me since the first day I saw it. <br /> <br /> My mom had seen it when I was on TV in '92. I remember that she woke me up in the middle of the night because of her tears while my dad helped her up the stairs. <br /> <br /> I was saying something like "Do not let me catch you" or something like that. . I asked her what had bothered her so much and she told me that she had been watching The Woman in Black. <br /> <br /> So obviously I had to see it and, even though I was only eleven years old, it left me. It scared me a lot. I have been immune to horror movies since I saw this!
