This movie is incredibly realistic and I think it does a great justice to the crime that many people do not understand due to lack of experience. The many people who think they could understand what goes through the mind of a victim are arrogant. As a victim, I feel that Dawson did a fantastic job in his role as Maya. I agree that this is an incredibly brave movie. This refers to the violation from a different and more realistic point of view than any other movie I have seen on the subject. The ending lasted a bit, but I know that many victims imagine this kind of justice, since the odds of an attacker being sent to jail for their crime are 1%. It is good to see a film that adheres more to reality than most would dare.
