['It&#39;s hard to say anything about a movie like this because there are not enough words to give this magnificent, elegant and unique film the veneration it undoubtedly deserves. They must make this the only real true film of Hamlet, because all the previous films of the same immortal show are being eclipsed by the &quot;Hamlet&quot; of Kenneth Branagh. <br /><br /> It is a perfect, complete version of the work, a powerful, massive and moving first class masterpiece of which Shakespeare would have been proud. They have brought together a dozen of the world&#39;s best actors in the same movie and each of them is having one of the best performances of his career. Each touching and charming sequence leaves behind a broad sense of satisfaction. <br /><br /> The cameras embrace the charming charms with grace. Branagh is phenomenal in the main role. His sharp and irresistible performance is the only one of its kind and will be a permanent part of the glorious history of cinema. Every second in this presentation is a party for movie lovers from the beginning to the end. Branagh&#39;s version of &quot;Hamlet&quot; is among the ten best films in history.']
