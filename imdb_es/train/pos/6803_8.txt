In one of his early films, Romy Schneider shines as Britain's young Queen Victoria, as she is suddenly put on the throne at the age of 18, learns to rule despite the machinations of politicians, and eventually romances and marries Prince Albert of Saxony. Kitschy and campy (although surprisingly true to real events), this romantic piece is irresistible. Seeing this film about British royalty spoken in German adds to its picturesque charm. On that front, one wonders why an Austrian film was made about an English queen; but then one remembers that in 1954, Austria was still occupied by allied troops, including the British. Maybe this was one of the reasons for the existence of this movie.
