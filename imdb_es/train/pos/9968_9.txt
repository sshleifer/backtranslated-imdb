My mother took me to see this movie as a child and I look forward to seeing it every year as I do with all my other Christmas favorites. What I remember most is the silly Devil and Santa Claus looking through his telescope. I waited and watched through the TV Guide every year after that to see when it would show up. I usually find him playing on a Saturday afternoon. I only found the movie in English that took something special from the movie and I wanted to find a copy in Spanish. I have this film very dear in my heart and I have never suffered nightmares as others might suggest. Yes, it's a different movie about Santa Claus and that's what makes it special and unique. I can not wait to get a copy of this movie and watch it with my children while I explain my favorite parts and memories!
