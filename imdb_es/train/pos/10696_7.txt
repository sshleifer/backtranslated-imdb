Every time I see Nicole, I like it better. I love a movie like this. A woman you just will not give up, but she keeps breaking your heart. The first film I remember seeing like this was De Human Bondage, the version of Kim Novak - Laurence Harvey. The comments about the correction of the Russian spoken of in this film are petty, it was good enough to fool me or anyone who can not speak Russian, I'm sure. It's funny how people lose the point. The Russian non-goodnik boys were also well chosen. Finally, I have to take my hat off Ben Chaplin, as someone else noticed, he plays a sap with great dignity, and there was definitely some warmth between him and Nicole. To think, the boys receive PAYMENT for that, amazing.
