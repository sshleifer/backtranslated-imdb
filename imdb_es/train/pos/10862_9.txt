['The choice is a Chinese mafia, or triads in this case. Every two years an election is held to decide on a new leader, and at the beginning it seems a change between Big D (Tony Leung Ka Fai, or as I know him, &quot;The Other Tony Leung&quot;) and Lok (Simon Yam,? Who was the judge in full contact? Although once Lok wins, Big D refuses to accept the election and does everything possible to get recognition as the new leader.Unlike any other Asian movie that I see with mobsters, this It&#39;s not an action movie, it has its bloody moments, when it&#39;s necessary, like in Goodfellas, but it&#39;s basically a really effective drama, there are a lot of characters, which is really hard to track, but I think that plays a little bit in the madness of all this, a 100-year-old cane, which is the symbol of the power I mentioned before, changes hands several times before things calm down, and although it may seem that the film ends at the 65 or 70 minute mark, there are still a couple of great ones Respects waiting, Simon Yam was my favorite character here and in some way anchors the image. <br /><br /> The election was quite winning awards at the Hong Kong Film Awards last year, winning for best actor (Tony Leung), best film, best director (Johnny To, who did Heroic Trio !!) and best script. I also had nominations for cinematography, editing, movie scoring (which I loved), and three more performances (including Yam).']
