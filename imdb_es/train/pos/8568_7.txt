While this was a better movie than 101 Dalmations (live action, not an animated version), I think it was not yet what Disney could do. It was filmed well, the music was better adapted to the action and the effects were better (compared to 101). The performance was perhaps better, but then the human characters were assigned much more appropriate roles in this sequel, and Glenn Close can not be lost, as in the first film. She makes it shine. His poor lackey and his exaggerated furry companions are wonderful characters to play with, and they add to the show that Disney has given us. This is a great family movie, with little or no objectionable material, and yet it remains fun and interesting for adults and children alike. It's probably a classic, as are so many Disney movies. Hoping that the third party is even better, because they know they probably want to make one. ;)
