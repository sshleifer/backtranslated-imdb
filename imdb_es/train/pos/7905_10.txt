I am very sorry for people who go to the movies with a pad and a pencil to write faults and write down how bad a movie is. I feel the same contempt for people who go to the movies and CAN NOT suspend reality and / or allow themselves to enjoy 90 minutes of their boring or busy lives. Get a GRIP people. ECGTB is a very entertaining movie. If you take movies seriously, this is NOT for you. If you are waiting for the movie to look like the book of ANY form, this is not for you. But if you enjoyed the absolute hilarity of Priscilla Queen of the Desert, or the "what the hell am I seeing" of Moulin Rouge. Or the comedy of "The Sweetest Thing" and then escape from Cowgirls. It has some very funny parts. Hilarious really. He also has very good music, congratulations to kd.lang. I also mentioned that you have 90 minutes of Uma Thurman ... do I need to say more?
