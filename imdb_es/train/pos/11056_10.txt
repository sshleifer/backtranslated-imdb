Monty Berman and Dennis Spooner followed 'The Baron' with this, a fantasy series about three superhuman spies who got ahead of 'The Six Million Dollar Man'. It was one of my favorites when I was young, and I still enjoy watching it. Stuart Damon and William Gaunt had unmistakable chemistry on the screen as Craig Stirling and Richard Barrett, while the delightful Alexandra Bastedo pouted in her role as Sharron Macready. The late Anthony Nicholls made a wonderfully abrupt tremayne. By far, the best episodes were those written by Tony Williamson, Terry Nation and Brian Clemens, while Spooner's 'The Interrogation' compared favorably with 'The Prisoner'. I regret that there is never a second series; The concept had so much life left. Would Craig and Richard have been competitors for Sharron's affections? What if Tremayne had known about the powers of the Champions? Did the Champions have other abilities than what we saw? We never found out, unfortunately.
