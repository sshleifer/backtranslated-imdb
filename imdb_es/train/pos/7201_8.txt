Very good dramatic comedy about a playwright trying to figure out how to keep his head out of the water after running out of ideas. I can not say much about this movie without telling the story. I can say that little was what it seems when you look at the picture. Everyone has their own agenda. Pleasant little surprise at the end, after all the other surprises. Well written with good performances from everyone.
