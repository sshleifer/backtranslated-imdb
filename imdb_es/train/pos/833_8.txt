First let me say that the director has a wonderful use of titles in his establishment shots. I really enjoyed them. I really enjoyed this movie, but I have to say that along with Pierce Brosnan, Greg Kinear is pretty lackluster. Brosnan merges into this character so well, that it is very difficult to remember that this is the same guy who played the bonus. He also shows his range and depth as an actor. It's a kind of indie movie and it was very nice to watch, especially with all the conventional movies that flood the movies at this time of year. I found that the characters are well made. The twist in the middle that I felt was especially good. I also liked how the characters come out realistically. So many times we have in the cinema these caricatures of people who are not really characters but stereotypes of walking ... I like the different approaches that this film takes. I think aside when I think about this movie, but I think it's more visible and a better movie in general ...
