Just a masterpiece. Not so well written. Beautiful cinematography I think not. This movie was not too terrible, but it was not much better than the average. The main story about highly immoral teenagers should have focused more on the forbidden romance and why this was ... should have gotten into it instead of scraping the surface with basically "because mom says we can not". Some parts should have fallen completely or go back to work to be more important to the plight of the two main characters. A couple of times I wondered if the writer / director was a fan of the classic American Graffiti of George Lucas. It's not that it's a mistake to be a fan of that movie, but to make your movie sometimes look like that, come on! The worst of this was that Madchen Amick had such a small part, I mean double, come on! She was the only one, in one or two lines, who really tried a Southern accent. (Listen well, she was there even though her character was from California! DOH!) Maybe if she was the star that others could have followed and we would have had a more authentic movie. Oh, well, what can you do when you have a director who is just a director and not an artist, too? Too. In general, I give it a B- and that's a little generous because I'm partial to Mrs. Amick.
