Solino really moved me with his deeply drawn characters. While it is a simple story of rivalry between two brothers, it is not simply hate or jealousy. What I liked most about the film was how I could identify with the feelings that Gigi was going through, especially when she had to take her mother to her hometown in Italy and miss the opportunity to attend the awards ceremony of the festival in which his film participated. Seeing this character who fought so much between his artistic dream and his innate sense of duty towards his mother was very frustrating. Even in the end, when he made another attempt to approach his father, he was so brave. And like in real life, most parents can never get past their walls to reach their children. I could even identify with Giancarlo, the brother, who although he was the older brother and more sure of himself, had so many insecurities. A really beautiful movie that made me laugh and cry.
