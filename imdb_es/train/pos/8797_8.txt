A great idea: 11 stories about September 11. 11 directors from different countries with different results. Ken Loach speaking of an immigrant (as always) is simply brilliant (as always). The French also do a good job, while the Burkina Faso movie was a pleasant surprise. However, the Israeli film was a bit boring, and the Mexican, well, should stop directing and working in a Mexican restaurant. 8/10
