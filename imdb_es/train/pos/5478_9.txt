It does not make sense to review the story since enough critics have done that. Here are some different points of view about one of those "religious madmen", as a very tolerant enthusiastic critic says. <br /> <br /> 1) "Baby Face" (1933) offers perhaps THE classic example ever seen in a movie of how women can manipulate men with sex. Barbara Stanwyck shows a lot of truth in this movie: be bright, bat your eyelashes, offer your body for free ... and men will take the risk to help you with whatever you want. <Br /> <br /> In this case, it was a job advance with the ultimate goal of money ... a lot. At least four men in this film provide that, even if it ruins their lives in the process. <br /> <br /> 2) The ending, which many of the critics here seemed to hate, gives another great message: all the money and material goods in the world will not make a person feel satisfied. A sad comment that so many "critics" here would have immoral messages, preferring sleaze over substance. No wonder, I suppose. <br /> <br /> Either way you see it, the film is entertaining from start to finish and Stanwyck has some great lines, particularly at the beginning when she tells her raw father and his Indisciplinary bar patrons. In just over 70 minutes, this movie moves at a rapid pace and ends before you know it.
