Like his first masterpiece "The Elephant Man", Lynch demonstrates to his detractors that he can tell a simple story without losing his artistic touch. This is a true story of a retired old man (played by Richard Farnsworth) who decides to drive a tractor through some states to make a final visit to his separated brother who is now at death's door. A beautiful Badalamenti score, an exquisite photograph of rural life (I love those air shots of cornfields) and an astute hand of a director who reveals the basic humanity of man. This is a beautiful movie of life. Its extremely slow pace can calm some viewers to sleep, but those who stay during the trip will be well rewarded at the end.
