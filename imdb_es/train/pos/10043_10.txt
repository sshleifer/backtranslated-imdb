This film rewrote the history of cinema in every way. Nobody cares what they think about this movie, because it transcends criticism. Each flaw in the film is easily overcome by the many surprising things the movie has in its favor. It is an extremely beautiful film, and I doubt that many of us will see something like this again. I have seen it more times than I would like to tell, and I still feel paralyzed every time, with a feeling that is difficult to describe. One for ages.
