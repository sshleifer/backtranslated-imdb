I think Charlotte Gainsbourg is one of the best performers in the world. I can not understand why some people say that it is not. Boring....??? Maybe who said it is boring is because he / she is bored. She is a great actress and the movie was excellent. He has many wonderful ideas and very good artists. The address was great. I imagine myself in the French environment with all the sophistication and the perfume, the flowers, the churches, the problems, etc. When she goes to the sister shop it is simply amazing. Everything is great. We have a very good actress, wonderful, for a long time. Alain Chabat and Bernadette Lafont are perfect. I like it better than in his next movie LA SCIENCE DES RÃŠVES. And Eric Lartigau did a very good job. <br /> <br /> Ana
