I was a book fan since the third grade, so of course I had seen the movie, I read the sequel and then I watched the television show. It was a good show in itself, and now as an adult I still enjoy the show. My only real problem was that I did not follow the book. The first time I saw it, it disappointed me so much that I turned it off. But that comes from a girl who has a first addition to the book. But after a while I decided to try again and ignored the book (something like what you have to do with the Harry Potter films). I thought the series was wonderful! It was clean and something everyone could enjoy, just the right comedy for everyone to move on. Is really nice! Clean and wonderful!
