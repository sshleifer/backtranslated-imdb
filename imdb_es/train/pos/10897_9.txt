['What would you expect from a movie called &quot;Surviving Christmas&quot; and presented as &quot;festive fun&quot;, something like a patient from Ghandi or English? There are many things that I like about this movie, it&#39;s funny, it&#39;s very well presented and it&#39;s beautifully written. I came to the film as a fan of Kaplan / Elfort, but I had doubts when I read the argument, it sounded ridiculous. But the film is not like that because Affleck (like Drew Latham) plays his role perfectly, in one minute as an adult, the next, a mature man who realizes he has won everything in life, apart from what really want In fact, we see Latham grow up in this movie, when he encounters the problems of those he envies and realizes that their lives are not so good, he sees that his luck is not so bad. <br /><br /> This movie has fewer weak or dubious scenes than many other comedies I&#39;ve seen. Comedy is much more difficult than any other type of drama, it works well or not, and very few comedy writers always do it correctly. I especially loved the drama scene, where the family reads the parts written by Latham. The pleasure is in the reaction of Tom Valco (James Gandolfini) and the comments of Brian Valco (Josh Zuckerman). It is the dilemma of the greedy Tom Valco who has to bite his tongue, wear silly hats or sing the Christmas tree to win the prize that makes the movie go well. <br /><br /> The addition of daughter Alicia (Christina Applegate) to the story brings a lovely romantic angle, and why not in a Christmas movie? Of course it is cheesy and artificial; He is rich and handsome, he is beautiful and single, and inevitably she and Afflect end up falling together in the snow and find themselves face to face. Cool! One thing I would have liked was more use of festive music to improve the atmosphere, but I really can not complain. I have what I wanted.']
