This movie was a favorite of my childhood and I must say that, unlike other films that I liked at that time, The Thief of Baghdad has maintained its quality as I grew up. This is not just a movie for children to enjoy, but also adults can see and enjoy it. The only drawback that exists is that one can not see beyond the "bad" effects (compared to the current effects) as you can see when he was a child. I did not remember any of those effects, of course, it had been about ten years since I had seen this movie, when I was about eleven years old. Who then watches the effects? Only good stories and entertainment are sought, and this is exactly what this movie offers. In my opinion, this film is one of the first great adventures films of the twentieth century. Come to think of it, I feel that Indiana Jones movies are a lot like this movie. There is comedy, romance and adventure all in one, which creates a wonderful mix that will captivate you from the beginning to the end, and although the film is old and the music and style of the movies are not modern, it manages not to be so modern . dusty and old. All this is mainly due to the great history, the good direction and the good performances of the actors. In that department they emphasize Sabu (like Abu) and Conrad Veidt (like Jaffar), that provide the comedy and the chilling elements of the film for the most part. Great movie and although an 'oldie', it is definitely a 'goldie'. I hope someone has the brains and the guts to release this on DVD someday. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
