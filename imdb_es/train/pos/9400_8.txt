If the man in the white suit in America had been made, can not you see Danny Kaye or Jerry Lewis testing Sidney Stratton from Alec Guinness in size? <br /> <br /> This is one of the best of Alec Guinness films and, without a doubt, one of the best that Ealing Studios in the UK has ever shown. It fits perfectly into the time frame of the new Labor government and the society it was trying to build. It is amazing how in times of crisis capital and labor can agree. <br /> <br /> Alec Guinness, this meek and small businessman is obsessed with the idea that he can invent clothes that will never need cleaning, which in fact repels all kinds of foreign matter at the moment he touches the garment . <br /> <br /> It's a persistent insult and he succeeds. Of course, the implications have not really been analyzed about the type of impact clothing that will have on society. In the end, everyone is chasing him as if he were a fugitive, almost like Peter Lorre from M or Orson Welles in The Stranger or even Robert Newton in Oliver Twist. <br /> <br /> It's the mark of a great comedy movie that a potentially serious situation like that chase, as described in some of the serious movies I've mentioned, can be played to laugh. Poor Guinness's costume is not only white and repellent to stains, it shines like a neon sign. <br /> <br /> Apart from Guinness, the best performances are by Cecil Parker as another pompous woman, Joan Greenwood as her mermaid daughter and Ernest Thesiger, the largest clothing manufacturer in the UK> <br /> <br / > Now that I think about it, did Paramount borrow that Ealing suit and give it to John Travolta for the Saturday Night Fever?
