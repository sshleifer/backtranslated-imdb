How to lose friends and alienated people left in 2008. Bombed at the US box office. UU It's an absolutely hilarious movie with a great cast. Simon Pegg is great at playing Sidney Young, who wrote the book "How to lose alien friends and people, I know it's not a true story, the only way I know that is because Sidney wants to go out with an actress named Sophie Maes." Sophie Maes it does not exist, but other than that, the movie could be real, how to lose friends and people from Alienate is probably the funniest movie of 2008, and I think you should definitely see it. As I said before, the movie has a fantastic Cast includes: Kirsten Dunst (Spider-Man, The Virgin Suicides) Danny Huston (The Number 23, 30 Days of Night) Gillian Anderson (The X Files) Megan Fox (Transformers, Confessions of a Teenage Drama The Queen) Jeff Bridges (The Big Lebowski, The Vanishing ) In general, how to lose friends and alienate is fun, I think Simon Pegg and Kirsten Dunst work well together, and I think you should see it, although there is a bit of nudity including Trans-sexuals, it's a Hilarious and impressive edia. One of Simon Pegg's best. <br /> <br /> The Synopsis: Sidney Young, journalist from England, travels to New York to work in Sharp magazines. While there, he meets an actress named Sophie Maes and tries to sleep with her before his boss does.
