I am quite surprised that no critic has commented so far on the rather elementary chess error in Luzhin's game as a target against an anonymous opponent immediately before the final. Despite the use of Jonathan Speelman as a consultant chess expert, Luzhin is shown winning the game with an illegal move. Between the quick cuts and the return to the board, it is not hard to realize that after Luzhin's combination culminated in a queen sacrifice, his d1 tower is still held by the black tower in c1 against his king in the corner on h1. Therefore, it is unable to play the supposed mating movement Rd1-d8, which would be illegal, but it is shown by the applause of the audience.
