Los Angeles television journalist Jennifer (the beautiful Barbara Bach from "The spy who loved me") and her two assistants Karen (the sexy Karen Lamm) and Vicki (the beautiful Lois Young, who is not only killed first, but also Undress her delicious body in a tasty and free nude bath scene) go to Solvang, California, to cover an annual Danish festival. Since all the local hotels have a solid reserve, the three beautiful ladies are forced to look for lodging and food in an elegant remote mansion that presumes the property of the stranger Ernest Keller (deliciously played to perfection geek by the late great Sydney Lassick) and his gentle sister Virginia (a solid Lelia Goldoni). Unfortunately, Keller has a dark, very unpleasant and lethal family secret, which resides in his damp basement: a corpulent, pathetic Mongoloid boy-child, sired by incest named Junior (a touching and terrifying depiction of Stephen Furst; Animal House "), which naturally breaks loose and causes some murderous ravages. Directed capably by Danny Steinmann, with a uniform and elegant performance of a robust cast, a convincingly perverse plot, excellent makeup by Craig Reardon, a pleasant and spooky atmosphere, an incredibly wild climax, a slow but steady rhythm, pleasant characters and well-drawn, and a surprisingly heartbreaking final freezer frame (the secondary plot of incest is an unexpectedly strong and poignant blow), it's worth taking a look at this psychopath of the early 1980s unfairly overlooked.
