When a little hobbit named Frodo Baggins inherits a magical ring from his uncle, the magician Gandalf investigates and discovers that the ring is an ancient creation of an evil dark lord. If the ring is back in your hands, it will regain its power and destroy Middle Earth. Frodo and his loyal friends undertook a mission to destroy the ring with a band of warriors. This is an underestimated adaptation of classic novels, since it only covers the first half of the story. In any case, this is an epic and wonderfully animated film. <br /> <br /> The animation is done superbly with a rotoscope, which is tracking live action images. Ralph Bakshi worked well with the low budget he received. The film also features a great musical score by Leonard Rosenman that adapts to each scene. There are some holes in the plot with the script, but that has to be excused, considering that the original agreement was to make the trilogy of the book in two films, much in the first. My biggest complaint is the character design, Samwise was a bit too stupid, while the other hobbits act completely normal. The other characters are really well written for the screen, and the voice actors do a great job, I'm happy that Legolas is a bit more useful for the plot. The rotoscoped orcs are more comical than terrifying, while the specters are strange and nightmarish. <br /> <br /> Another problem is that the evil wizard Saruman is called Aruman, thanks to the writers. In general, I think that a little more money and better writers would have done a lot of justice, but there is something charming about it. Ralph Bakshi made a valiant effort to adapt the screen of these classic stories. The film suffers terribly from being overshadowed by live action movies, but it's still a great movie for animation lovers of all ages.
