I saw this many years after the television series and, initially, I did not care. Then, when my memory of the series receded with the passage of time, I observed it again and found it absolutely hilarious. Based on the theatrical work of Neil Simon, he has not "opened" much for the big screen, and that is one of his strengths. Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are brilliant as Oscar and Felix, and the cast is wonderful, particularly John Fielder as 'Vinnie'. Even now, certain moments can reduce me to tears of laughter: Felix interrupted Oscar in the middle of a ballgame with a dinner, Oscar cracking and chasing Felix through the apartment, the smiling 'Pigeon Sisters' knocked down by the stories of sobs from Felix and, of course, the legendary caf√© scene (which was later ripped off by 'When Harry Met Sally' by Nora Ephron). Very sharp dialogue too. When the children believe that Felix has taken an overdose, Oscar says: "They could be vitamins! It could be the healthiest in the room!". Fantastic!
