I just watched this movie for the second time on television. He is charming, warm, sentimental, very very romantic. Rarely have I seen actors better able to reveal by their movements and gestures the love for another -Cybill Shepherd, Ryan O'Neal, Robert Downey, Jr. and especially Mary Stuart Masterson simply surpass themselves. Masterson probably has the most difficult role and is simply adorable. <br /> <br /> The film is in line with both romantic films, such as While You Were Sleeping, When Harry Met Sally, Sleepless in Seattle and the "trick" type of films like Big, Back to the Future, Peggy Sue got married. I hate to say this, because this cast was excellent and would never change any of them, but I think it did not succeed as well as the films mentioned above because the appeal of the box office of the cast was not as good as Meg Ryan, Tom Hanks, Michael J Fox and Kathleen Turner at the time the movie was made. <br /> <br /> It is not very well written, for example, the lines of the characters are not particularly memorable. However, it runs perfectly. <br /> <br /> The romantic yearnings are truly palpable, the "feeling" of people who fall in love is exquisitely communicated, the timelessness of love and the all-encompassing sweep, the feeling of loss and desire to recover that connection, they are so moving. delivered. Again and again, you will find yourself moved. Actually, a comparable movie is Made in Heaven, the same romantic yearning. <br /> <br /> If you see this, it's beautiful.
