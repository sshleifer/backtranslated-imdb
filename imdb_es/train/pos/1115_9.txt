This is one of those unfortunate movies that suffered an even sadder and unfortunate death at the box office. I saw this film in a local art cinema, in the form of a revival, shortly after it stagnated in traditional cinemas. No doubt deserves to be approached for the second time (or even a third). Sandra B. takes it to the limit by making a spoken word and taking some of the best-known songs of this piece (her version of 'I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry by Hank William' could make you cry easily). Maybe one day, the audience is ready to take this movie a little more seriously (but not without some well-placed laughs, too). The film advances at a good pace (thanks to a good edition), so that some viewers will not find it obsolete and boring. Maybe a revival is only by the pipeline.
