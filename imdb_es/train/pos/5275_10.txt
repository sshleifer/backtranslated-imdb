This movie is great! This movie is beautiful! Finally, a film that portrays Muslims as people, there are no stereotypes here. This film is driven by history, by acting and, above all, by its theme, that of affirmation and cultural discovery. They may seem clich√©s, but they are not, at least not in this movie. The view of the Great Mosque of Mecca is absolutely wonderful and the public can see a side of the Muslim world that is rarely displayed in the West. Here people are supportive, supportive, devoted, tolerant and dedicated to each other. How welcome and so far from the usual negative representations of the Arabs. Outstanding film.
