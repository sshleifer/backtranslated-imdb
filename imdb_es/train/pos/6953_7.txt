This is one of those movies that make better trailers than feature films. The concept was really great and different, the humor was unique, I felt there were missed opportunities to put the "hit" in this movie. So many lines and arcades were hanging too long, without a definite end and they really did not let me laugh. Wilson, Wilson, Farris and Thurman were great. Wanda Sykes was underutilized in this film and needed more exposure and more opportunities to turn her character into more screen time. 7 out of 10 for me, more than one DVD rental. Also, I was looking for some type of music video to feel good during the final credits, something that has become a kind of brand for these romantic comedy movies, something like Mary, Meet the Parents but again, I was a little bit tricked by the fact that it COULD have been a much better movie with a little more music and more punching. It felt like he was ENTERING the theaters.
