Cary Grant, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Victor McLaglen are three soldiers in the 19th century in India who, with the help of a water boy (Sam Jaffe), got rid of thuggee's murderous cult area. The chemistry between the actors makes this one of the most entertaining films of all time. Sam Jaffe is exceptional as the marginalized water boy who is mistreated by everyone and still wants to be accepted as a soldier in the company. Based loosely on Rudyard Kipling's poem. A must for anyone who enjoys these types of movies.
