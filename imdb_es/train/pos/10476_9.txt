My first exposure to "Whale Music" was the Rheostatics album of the same name, which I bought around 1993. I was reading the liner notes and the band said that the album, which remains in a prominent place in my collection, was inspired by Canadian The author's book Paul Quarrington. <br /> <br /> I picked up the book a few months later and I devoured it! An incredible reading! Since then I have read the book several times, finding each time a new element for Desmond and his desire to complete Whale Music. <br /> <br /> I found the movie in 1996, in a video. I have not had many good experiences with the Canadian film, but it worked for me. Claire's role could have been different, but in general I think that Paul Quarrington's vision transferred very well from the book to the screen. <br /> <br /> Maury Chaykin gives a poignant performance as the isolated genius. The film is about family relationships, love and the search for someone who understands. I would highly recommend "Whale Music" not just to music fans, but to anyone who has lost something or someone and tried to find the way back to the world.
