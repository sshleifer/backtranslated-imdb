This film is about the unlikely friendship between a businessman and a man with Down syndrome. <br /> <br /> The character development in this movie is excellent. We believe that Harry is a businessman who neglects his family, and Georges is an innocent man who yearns to love and care for the "normal" society. The performance is excellent, and the award for best actor in Cannes is well deserved. <br /> <br /> The fantasy scenes in the film highlight the fact that Georges feels unhappy about his family and his desire to be treated like a normal character. person. The song that is played repeatedly also reinforces this message. The film shows that people with mental disabilities are of good character. We have been treating them with discrimination and negligence, a fact that stands out in the scene in which Georges gives a gift to the waitress in the kitchen. If we understand and share the world of these people, both we and the mentally disabled can feel very happy. <br /> <br /> I was so attracted to the film and the emotional experiences of the characters. It is a moving film for souls of good character.
