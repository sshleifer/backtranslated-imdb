This is the movie is very moving. I do not care what people say about this movie, this is a very good movie. Amitabh Bachchan's role plays have the dying father, because he wants to teach his son how to handle life in case something happens to him and Akshay Kumer was excellent in his role as Aditya Thakur, a spoiled brat. The supporting role of Shefali Shetty, who played the role of Sumitra Thakur, was magnificent. Priyanka Chopra was good in her small role in the film. Ragpal Yadav as the brain-dead servant and Boman Irani as the presumed family father have a very good connection and the comedy scene was very funny. The address is very good.
