Originally it was meant to be a movie in which Gene Kelly would star, but when the manufacturers could not get it, they got "the best actor in the world" and the result is pretty good. Basically, Nathan Detroit (Frank Sinatra) is having trouble doing what he does best, creating a dice game of high risk, because he needs $ 1000 to get the place. So to get the money you need, you have a bet of $ 1000 with old friend Sky Masterson (Marlon Brando) who can not get Sergeant Sarah Brown (Great Expectations Golden Globe winner), and Jean Simmons nominated for BAFTA ) accompany him to Havana. Meanwhile, Nathan is having trouble getting rid of the woman he wants her to ask for his hand in marriage, Miss Adelaide (Vivian Blaine). Also starring Robert Keith as Lieutenant Brannigan, Stubby Kaye as Nicely Nicely Johnson and B.S. Pulley like Big Jule. An interesting romantic musical comedy, with Brando singing all his own songs, and Sinatra being soft and great. He was nominated for the Oscars for Best Art Direction Set Decoration, Best Cinematography, Best Costumes and Best Music for Jay Blackton and Cyril J. Mockridge. He was nominated for BAFTA for Best Film from any source, and won the Golden Globe for Best Film - Musical / Comedy. Frank Sinatra was number 43 in The 100 best icons of pop culture, Marlon Brando was number 30 in The 100 best movie stars, was number 11 in The 100 best sexual symbols, was number 4 in 100 years, 100 stars - Men, Sinatra was number 35, and Brando was number 1 in The best actor in the world, "Luck Be a Lady" was number 42 in 100 years, 100 songs for, the movie was number 23 in 100 years of musicals and the number 36 in The 100 best musicals. Very well!
