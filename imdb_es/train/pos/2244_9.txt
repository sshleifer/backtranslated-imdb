The only explanation I can give to explain why this film is not widely distributed is because, for some, it is too close to home. This movie was a real happy surprise, the satire is a genius. This movie lights the lights in the darkness organized by religion and the big media, and the cockroaches rush to cover themselves. Rent the DVD and watch it yourself, if you have not already done so, this movie is successful where many have failed (Dogma comes to mind) to stick your nose under the tent, using humor and very smart analogies along with backdrops counted and locations. . You can not comment in depth without revealing some significant spoilers, there are some surprises in this movie that even the experienced film aficionado will be surprised by surprise.
