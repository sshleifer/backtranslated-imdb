"May Contain Spoilers * <br /> <br />" All Dogs Go to Heaven "is a great movie I saw in 1989 when I was 2. I did not understand it so well, but as I saw it More and more times I started I love the songs in this movie, my favorite songs are "Let me surprise you" and "Soon you'll come home." Those are beautiful songs, the only thing that bothers me is that the movie is Charlie's death. Little, my sister could not even see that part, other than that, this movie is wonderful. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the movie is when Annabelle and Charlie are flying around. The sky is beautiful in the movie and the I also love Itchy, in fact, I have 3 dachshunds from my property, they are very cute. <br /> <br /> In general, I love this movie and I suggest everyone should watch it. to this movie 10/10 stars.
