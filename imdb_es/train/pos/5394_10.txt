I was absolutely fascinated by this series from the moment that Tom Long came on the scene. The whole 'bad guy' thing was just addictive. <br /> <br /> The story has hooked you, what will happen next - Joey getting the girl at the end, after spending 5 years in prison, and all that time thinking about her lost love, crossing paths with her again, finding that he has a son ... Although he is a violent villain, you still want him to find happiness. <br /> <br /> A truly captivating couple - please bring it on video!
