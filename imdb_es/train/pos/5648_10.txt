I recently bought the complete American Gothic series on DVD and fulfilled my memories. I was very grateful to see for the first time episodes that were never televised. I loved the "Ring of Fire" in particular from the stories I had not seen the first time. <br /> <br /> Gary Cole is fantastic as the "evil and sexy" Lucas Buck. Lucas Black as Caleb is also an excellent player. I thought that Brenda Bakke as Selena Coombs was also excellent in her acting. In fact, the entire cast had fantastic talent and had a great chemistry between them. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that the series has been fucked by the network (in collusion with a group of budding censors) because it was really designed for adults. A mixture of comedy, tragedy, farce, satire, Gothic romance and horror genres, offered brilliant characterizations supported by genius-level acting. <br /> <br /> I had the most tremendous lust for the devil for once in my life. Long live Gary Cole (Sheriff Lucas Buck), the most delicious "fallen angel" of all time.
