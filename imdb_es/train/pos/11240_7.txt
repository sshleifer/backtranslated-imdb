The low-budget British pop melodrama focuses on a girl who wants to be a star, becomes one and then finds everything too. The good sharing and the sense of time and place can not hide the fact that we have all been here before. Several scenes are a bit hysterical and O'Connor's voice looks a lot like Mini Mouse! He disappeared from sight shortly after making this film, so life can imitate art! You have to see if you want to see a punk version of a Star Is Born.
