Fascinating but disconcerting look at Edith Bouvier Beale (Big Edie) and her daughter (Little Edie) aunt and first cousin of Jacquelyn Kennedy Onasis. They live in a dilapidated and infested mansion of rodents that the city considered a danger to health. It becomes quite clear very quickly that these two are eccentric. Little Edie seems to be the luckiest, as she acts with the mentality of a ten-year-old girl, even though she is actually 53 years old. The content is composed of two things. The first conversations were when Little Edie criticized Big Edie for driving away all her potential suitors and ruining her aspiring career as a writer, actress and dancer. These discussions usually become very rhetorical, pointless, and often fun. The second part consists of long episodes of singing attempts by both parties. Of course, everyone thinks that their singing is perfect and only the other sounds bad. In an incredible scene, Big Edie actually physically attacks Little Edie with his cane so she stops whistling. Very captivating, however, one has the feeling that there is a serious exploitation here and that the subjects are too far away to know. The filmmakers seem to treat this as a rare spectacle in the circus, and come every day to record (and laugh) at any strange behavior that may arise. Ultimately, this is a sad picture, because it shows how the world has simply overcome these two. Their hopes and dreams are as deteriorated as the mansion in which they live. Despite their fights, these two are needed more than ever. Because without the other there would be no refuge from loneliness. The most surprising line comes from Big Edie, whose many cats are relieved in their room. Your response to a complaint about the smell is simply incredible.
