Tom the cat, Jerry the mouse and Spike the Dog (here called Butch, his third name, his second is 'Killer') decide to sign a peace treaty so that everyone will love each other. It's weird and a little unnatural to see all of this friend's friends and those of his friends also seem to think the same. But in the end, thanks to a disagreement about a steak, everything returns to normal and everything is as it should be. This short is the second of the three in the new Spotlight DVD that will be edited and I have no idea why this was. This cartoon can be found on disk one of the "Tom & Jerry" Spotlight DVD collection. <br /> <br /> My degree: B
