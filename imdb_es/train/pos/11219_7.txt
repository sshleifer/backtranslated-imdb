/ * slight spoilers * / <br /> <br /> A long time ago, before Evangelion was made, before Hideaki Anno was an idol and a household name for many anime fans, and before Gainax had reached the fanfavorite status, Gunbuster was created. With only the Wings of Honneamise made by Gainax at that time, and the famous Otakon shorts, of course, Gunbuster had some difficult acts to follow. It did not make it any easier by selecting a genre that had been done countless times before, the space opera. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Gainax decided to do it as a six-part OAV (direct to video series). This allows the series to have a greater range than would have been possible if it had been converted into a movie. This also prevents it from becoming too boring and too long, with many useless battles and filling in the road. On top of that, they made an effort to stay out of the proven space opera mechanics used in Macross or Gundam, and many other popular space operas. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, the shows start quite clearly, with Noriko at the Okinawa secondary school for mechapiloting. Noriko is the daughter of a respected ship commander who died in battle, when she was still a little girl. This makes his life in the academy quite difficult, as some of his classmates begin to suspect that Noriko is favored by teachers. The first episode is practically a comedy drama, with a very close focus on the characters and the school environment. Things change quickly when the threat of an extraterrestrial invasion is announced, and Noriko and Kazumi (the best girl in the class) are chosen to help the assembled fleet. <br /> <br /> The middle group of Gunbuster leaves our female protagonist. Space, focusing on both personal drama and action. A couple of other characters show up, and parts of Noriko's past crawl again. Besides that, the alien threat becomes more imminent every minute, and the Gunbuster, the last hope of humanity, is presented. Intelligent as a writer, Okada was, incorporated the principles of time dilation, to encourage a little things. In short, time moves slower for those who travel at the speed of light. This means that Noriko can be part of a war that has taken almost a century to complete. It also accentuates the dramatic aspect of this, when Noriko returns to see her friends on their return to the base, who have aged considerably more than her. The science may not be perfect, but it is presented in a fairly credible way, even with some SD science theater shorts between the episodes, where Noriko, Kazumi and their coach give a brief description of the scientific principles used in the series . <Br /> <br /> Animation, for a series made in the 80s, is definitely good. The designs are retro 80's style, of course, but it has its charm. The animation is fluid enough and the character designs are nice, although the costumes betray <br /> <br /> part of the fascination of the fan service that Gainax will exploit to the fullest. The wicks throughout the shows are also great, with Gunbuster as the best killing machine, strong and vast. The last episode was made entirely in black and white. Although in general it is believed (but not confirmed) that this was done for budget reasons, it lends a completely different environment to the series, which fits perfectly to the last part. <br /> <br /> The music is a very typical opera fair space. Too grandiloquent in places, very generic, and definitely not worth buying. It fits the series for the most part, but sometimes it can get quite annoying. Tanaka is not really a famous composer, and the only other respectable series he has worked on is Dragon Half. If you think about the anime music of the 80s, you will know what to expect. <br /> <br /> As the series progresses, the focus slowly shifts from drama to space opera to epic battle, but in this way the viewer will hardly notice. is. Step by step, the drama will diminish and the battles will take the front row. However, neither aspect is completely outside. With the last episode in sight, Noriko and her team fight for the existence of humanity, and with the last battle in sight, certain questions are presented to the audience, related to the position of the human race in the galaxy, and up to what point. It can go to guarantee self-preservation. Although they are never answered later, they still present some interesting food for thought. The last episode is very epic, with a nice ending, but quite predictable, although not all the endings must contain numerous extravagant turns, of course. Once again, it fits the series. <br /> <br /> At first, Gunbuster may sound like your average space opera anime, with extraterrestrial invasions, huge battles and some personal dramas, and for the bigger part, it is. But it is exceptionally good for a change. Instead of resorting to a constant mix of previous elements, with six episodes, Gunbuster presents us with a change from small-scale drama to epic heroism on a large scale. Along the way we find several interesting and well-developed characters, whose mutual relationships change greatly due to the phenomenon of time dilation. The show is very well written, although it tends to slip in some spots. Too dramatic events and overly kitschy wick attacks could have been easily avoided. In general, the journey that Gunbuster takes you is very relaxed, sometimes sad, sometimes heroic. It may not have broken the boundaries and limits of the genre of the space opera, but at least it doubled them a bit. Classic animated very nice, but not without flaws. <br /> <br /> *** / *****
