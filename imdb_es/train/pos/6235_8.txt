This is one of the best films of Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers, or at least one of my favorites. Most A-R movies feature great dances, but sappy romantic stories. This still has the courage of courtship, but not as pronounced as the other movies. <br /> <br /> This film presents not only a great dance but also nice characters and a lot of good songs. Music is the central theme here and what is good is the addition of a single touch of Rogers. She was not only a super dancer, but a very pretty woman and one with a tremendous figure. She also dances with Fred, of course, and they are always a fun couple to see on the dance floor. <br /> <br /> Growing up in the 1950s watching "Ozzie & Harriet" on TV, it was a real pate the first time I saw this to see a young Harriet Hilliard. No wonder Ozzie fell in love with this beauty. Although I had that short hairstyle of the early 30s, I recognized his voice immediately. Also in this movie there are brief appearances by Betty Grable and Lucille Ball, but I have to admit that I still have to get Ball out. I can not find it, but I know it's here. <br /> <br /> Astaire, except for some unpleasant chewing gum in the first third of the movie, was fun to watch and Randolph Scott, although better in westerns - it's also nice. <br /> <br /> This is just a nice movie, of feeling good and good if you want to enjoy the great talents of Astaire and Rogers.
