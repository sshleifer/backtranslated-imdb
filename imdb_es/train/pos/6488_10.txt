['War is hell. But this documentary of the Second World War is heaven. <br /><br /> This series is not only an impressive and almost exhaustive look of the Second World War, but it is a poetic masterpiece told in a clear and magnificent by Laurence Olivier. <br /><br /> This documentary series defines the genre. It&#39;s incredibly long, no doubt, but you&#39;ll enjoy them all and want to go back for more and more. (I have the series on DVD and probably see it three times a year). <br /><br /> In truth, this is a bit impeccable to make movies. Apart from Olivier, the best part of the series is listening to veterans tell their stories; either for a real battle or for finding a pig to butcher so they can have something delicious for dinner. <br /><br /> I&#39;m going to go see him right now (again, my ... 11th time).']
