['I saw that movie a few days ago. This movie is so cool that it makes me feel that if you want something really bad, you&#39;ve always dreamed it, you can have it. This shows a great desire made reality, happiness and sadness, hopelessness and failure. But if you are strong enough and your heart really belongs to something you love, you can do different things and be happy.']
