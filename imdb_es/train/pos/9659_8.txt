'Presque Rien' is a beautifully observed portrait of the experiences of a young French homosexual. Avoiding stereotypes and preaching, it is a wonderfully naturalistic film, superbly acted, surrounded by an idea of ​​the coastal city where the action unfolds, never melodramatic but often painfully real. In any case, it is almost too realistic, since there are few conventional plots, only scenes of a life. But the absence of conventional dramatic tension counts for less than it could in a world so subtly drawn. 'Presque Rien' may not be the most exciting movie ever made; but his simple humanism serves him well in comparison with the preconceived viewpoints of celebration or intolerance that often mark the treatments of this subject. It is worth a watch.
