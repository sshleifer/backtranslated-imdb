['Perhaps he is not interested in the social comments or the point of view of the filmmakers (I myself am puzzled by the angle of &quot;insignificance&quot; that Kasdan seemed to promote, when clearly, the actions taken in the film promote CERTAIN significance. ). However, the way in which the story is presented can not be denied; The magnificent symbolism throughout; the arcs of threaded characters; visual dialogue - it&#39;s absolute masterpiece. I&#39;ve seen the movie dozens of times and I still marvel at its perfection. There is not a moment, action, cut or line that does not have everything to do with the subject. Realistic human actions of all actors. Scene by scene is woven fantastically. <br /><br /> I have a pretty level sap meter. The bell never fired during this movie. If you are a thinker (instead of an occasional spectator), this film offers it. Exponentially Absolutely fascinating. (Do you have to agree with the message to appreciate the screen? Who cares if it made you feel warm and confused or not, was it interesting?) <br /><br /> Personally, the movie affected me - significantly. In my top 5. <br /><br /> Note: the first page critic speaks clearly of a defective African-American perception. What you may have failed to recognize is that there was a handshake. It is not a deal. The &#39;spiritually dead white man&#39; simply saw a man to respect and admire. And he did something about it. The fact that it was black had little or nothing to do with it (the color is simply used to draw the parallel and the abyss - it is not by chance that the opening sequence changes from black and white to color). If you see blacks in this film as a token, you can re-evaluate YOUR anguish. You may only see black and white, huh. Just a thought.']
