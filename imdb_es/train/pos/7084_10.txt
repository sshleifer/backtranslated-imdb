I can not decide if this is one of my favorite movies. It's a good thriller and it has an emotional core, but I still can not decide. I definitely liked it. This is the first Terry Gilliam movie I've seen. My first impression? I was committed to the end and it's not that complex (to be confusing). <br /> <br /> The film is set in the future. A man James Cole (Bruce Willis) is sent from the future to obtain information from the past (1996 to be specific). A virus killed 5 billion people. He is sent from the future to obtain some information about it. Also involved here is a psychiatrist named Kathryn Railly. The love story is beautifully represented and you can really feel the longing in this love and the longing for a normal life. The loose ends are tied in a very interesting way in the end. <br /> <br /> One thing I liked about this movie is that, unlike other post-apocalyptic films, the film did not prefer to give a boring social touch. Comment and instead focused on this guy and his longing for a normal life. "You want to see the ocean, be with her" is especially a moving line in this movie. Choose to focus on the tension and confusion in the person's mind. Therefore, this is not exactly an apocalyptic film, but could be described as a romantic science fiction movie with themes that go from time travel to fuzzy realities, etc. This is what makes this movie a special movie of the nineties. The complex plot flows smoothly without adding too many characters. <br /> <br /> The performances are pretty good. Bruce will surprise me here since he did not act like a normal hard guy but gave a good performance of a confused man who is in love. His desperation in certain sequences is beautifully portrayed. I have to see your other movies. The beautiful Madeleine Stowe is a real pleasure to see. After watching this movie, I became so obsessed with it. She has given a great performance of a woman who sympathizes with her patient and finally falls in love with him. Brad Pitt is the real surprise, however, with his interpretation of a madman named Jeffrey Goines. His Oscar-nominated performance is quite surprising given that he does not have many critics who have kind words with him. <br /> <br /> The ending is quite chilling and that is also another reason to watch the movie. The duration or complexity is not such a big problem because this movie moves fast enough and there are enough incidents to keep people interested. And every incident in this movie has a meaning and there is nothing that is unnecessary. <br /> <br /> Good thriller 10/10
