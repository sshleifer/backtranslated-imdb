I was surprised how a movie could be so cheesy and excellent at the same time. The Frisbee's flying saucer was incomprehensible, especially when landing, but the special effects when the Krell attacked were impressive for a film that was made more than half a century ago! Living in the Middle East I saw Shadows of Islam appear when JJ Adams suggested that Alta should dress modestly and, as an engineer, was amazed by the imagination used for the "futuristic" gadgets and gadgets designed by the accessories department. All in all, an entertaining hour and a half, the first time I saw Walter Pidgeon and the chance to see Leslie Neilsen as a "young" man.
