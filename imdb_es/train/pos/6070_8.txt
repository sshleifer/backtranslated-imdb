Yes, Shakespeare would have been proud. Laurence Fishburne was not at her best but certainly not bad. Kenneth Brannagh on the other hand was brilliant. His machination was wonderful as well as his way of playing with the public. Very good work. <br /> <br /> Sometimes there was very little drama where more was expected. The murder of Cassio, for example, was a bit clouded by the fact that it happened too far, which caused the viewer to turn his head to catch everything. <br /> <br /> Did I mention Michael Maloney? His madness striken Roderigo was unusual; even annoying. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen Othello before, look at this. If you have not read Othello, look at this. If you have not listened to Othello, look at this. On the other hand, you do yourself a favor by reading it, watching it act on stage and listening to it too.
