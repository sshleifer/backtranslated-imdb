Kay Pollack (the man behind this movie) is a great man who tries to share the philosophy of his life in different ways. He has written a lot of good and well written books on how to control your senses and keep your soul happy. The message in most of his books and in this film, is that his thoughts, in fact, is what causes his problems and that the reason for his anger is almost never due to what he thinks. The main message is that you can choose to be happy, but you almost never do it. <br /> <br /> To see this movie and learn something very important in life, you must keep your mind wide open and LISTEN to everyone. the "hidden messages" (or guidelines to overcome life) that contain most parts of this movie if you listen and observe. Look at it with your ears. <br /> <br /> You will not learn the meaning of life, but you will learn how to live and make the most of it ... <br /> <br /> Then, while observing, keep in mind: <br /> <br /> "The mind is like a parachute, it does not work unless it's open!"
