A year after losing the beautiful Jane Parker (Maureen O'Sullivan) to love his rival Tarzan, the hunter Harry Holt (Neil Hamilton) returns to the jungle to have another chance to win the brunette's heart. Combining business with pleasure, he also plans to grab some ivory from the elephant cemetery that lies beyond the Mutia escarpment, Tarzan's stomping ground. <br /> <br /> Accompanied by his sticky and womanizing friend Martin Arlington and a group of expendable carriers, Harry finally arrives at his destination (having narrowly escaped death at the hands of wild natives and stone-throwing monkeys) only to discover that Jane is still in love with her muscular yodeller, and worse, that Tarzan refuses to let the hunters take any ivory from the cemetery. <br /> <br /> Nasty Arlington decides to solve the problems by ambushing and shooting the ape man and then telling Jane and Holt that Tarzan was attacked and eaten by a crocodile. Of course, Tarzan is not dead, he's just hurt; after being breastfed by Cheetah (!), he returns to action just in time to rescue Jane from a tribe of ferocious savages who eat lions who have attacked Holt's expedition. <br /> <br /> Tarzan and his partner, the second film starring Weismuller as the man of the jungle of few words, is often cited by fans as the best of the series; Although I prefer the original slightly, I can definitely understand the popularity of the film: it's very sexy and there are some great action sequences! The undeniable chemistry between Weismuller and O'Sullivan is fabulous and gives rise to some pretty funny scenes, and with both stars wearing eensy-weensy outfits all over the world, there are a lot of visits for viewers of both sexes (despite The highly acclaimed O'Sullivan The bare underwater scene is actually being performed by a double body, the lovely girl still shows a lot of skin, even threatening to make a 'Sharon Stone' at one point while her canvas moves towards a side!). <br /> <br /> The most exciting moments of the film come in the form of a wonderful underwater fight between Tarzan and a crocodile, and the spectacular finale where Jane is attacked by lions and natives, but is rescued by her boyfriend, her Monkey friends and a lot of elephants. In lion-crushing mode (once again, the violence is surprisingly unpleasant at times, though as far as I'm concerned, there's nothing so surprising as the pygmy pygmies and their gorilla pit of the first movie). Cheetah also has its fair share of emotion, dodging rhinos, crocodiles and big cats, riding Tarzan's back while crossing a river, and even jumping to an ostrich for a walk. <br /> <br /> Like his predecessor, Tarzan and his partner suffer slightly from some negative effects and unconvincing properties: an unreliable projection, ridiculous monkey costumes, more Indian elephants disguised as African cousins ​​and poorly disguised trapeze swings , but this should not ruin your enjoyment. From this very entertaining movie. In any case, they make it even more fun! <br /> <br /> 8.5 out of 10, rounded to 9 for IMDb.
