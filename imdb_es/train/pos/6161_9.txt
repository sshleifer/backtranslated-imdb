Set during World War II, Bedknobs and Broomsticks is a fun-filled fantasy adventure for children, starring Angela Lansbury as a witch's apprentice who, with the help of three evacuated children and a 'Witchcraft Teacher', thwarts a Nazi invasion . <br /> <br /> Brilliantly inventive, with lots of laughs, this film will delight children of all ages with their great characters, their exciting story and their catchy melodies. Lansbury is perfect, since Eglantine, the not quite perfect witch who takes the three children to the adventure of her life, and her three young supporting stars (Cindy O'Callaghan, Roy Snart and Ian Weighill) are as impressive as Cockney scoundrels who help in the fight against the nasty hun. <br /> <br /> Special effects are somewhat outdated, but let's be honest, children do not care about these things as long as they're entertaining. And entertained, they will be. With some stunning scenes that brilliantly combine live action and animation with great effect, and cinematic magic more genuine than a hundred Harry Potters, it would be hard not to enjoy this wonderful part of cinematic escapism. In fact, only a fairly extensive musical number established in Portobello Road marks the perfection of the film, but with much more to enjoy, which can be easily forgiven. <br /> <br /> And also, any movie that shows UK television. The legend Bruce Forsyth as 'Flash' spiv Harry style is guaranteed a good rating on my part.
