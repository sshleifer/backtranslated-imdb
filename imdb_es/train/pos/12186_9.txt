It's not a movie as good as many people think (including my deceased aunt, who said it was her favorite movie). But due to the best sections of this film noir, particularly that famous "fun house" justly famous, THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI has gained a position of importance beyond its real value as a key to the failure of Orson Welles in the conquest of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> In 1946, Welles' position as a Hollywood figure was mixed. CITIZEN KANE was not recognized as the great movie that has been seen since then due to the way it was attacked by the Hearst press and by the Hollywood members themselves. Welles' attempt at total control (direction, production and acting) of his films seemed to threaten the entire system. His best work in this period was like Edward Rochester on JANE EYRE, supposedly filmed by Robert Stevenson, but actually filmed heavily (with Stevenson's blessing) by Welles. But the credit went to Stevenson. Only THE STRANGER, a film that benefits from the post-war interest in fleeing Nazi war criminals, made a profit. For five years in Hollywood it was hardly a big record. <br /> <br /> Welles returned to Broadway in 1946, hoping to regain his critical skills with his production of AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 DAYS. But despite the help of Mike Todd and Cole Porter in composing the score, the musical was a failure. His failure came at the same time that his wife, Rita Hayworth, was on the rise with his interpretation of GILDA. So the marriage also went under. <br /> <br /> Welles had to earn money: his Broadway production had led to his personal bankruptcy. He sold his interest in the possible film rights of AROUND THE WORLD to Todd (which he would eventually regret), and also sold the idea of ​​a film about Henri Desire Landru's career to Charlie Chaplin, who was supposed to direct. it (and who turned it into MONSIEUR VERDOUX). <br /> <br /> The story goes that Welles, with a $ 10,000.00 tax bill to worry about, called Cohn and offered to make a movie with Rita for a down payment. Cohn was willing to do it, but naturally he asked what the movie was. It was a wise question. Welles had a pay phone in New York at a pharmacy that had a book department. He grabbed a book with the title THE LADY OF SHANGHAI, and commented that it was a great thriller. Somehow, Welles convinced the usually cunning Cohn that Welles knew what he was talking about. Cohn said he would seek the rights and sent Welles the initial payment of $ 10,000.00. After Cohn hung up, Welles bought the book and read it, and discovered that it was bad enough. He spent time rewriting a treatment and a script that would increase the character of Rita by Elsa Bannister. <br /> <br /> It certainly has a curious development of the plot. Michael O'Hara is a sailor / stevedore. He rescues Elsa Bannister, when she is apparently attacked by gang members in a park in San Francisco. Elsa is married to Arthur Bannister (Everett Sloane), a criminal lawyer with a great reputation. She convinces him to hire Michael as the patron of his yacht. The cruise also contains the sinister Bannister companion, George Grisby (Glenn Anders) and a Sidney Broome (Ted De Corsia) who turns out to be a detective hired by Bannister to watch over Elsa. When they can, Michael and Elsa try to find time together, but Broome or Grisby keep showing up. <br /> <br /> Grisby makes an offer to Michael: he wants it (for reasons related to his so-called fatalistic vision of modern society) Abandon him, pretending to be dead. According to Grisby (the plan turns murky here) he can still collect his life insurance (even though he is dead?) And use it to escape to the southern seas. He will pay Michael $ 10,000.00 if he pretends to shoot Grisby. This actually includes signing a document that admits the murder (Michael does not realize that such an admission would eliminate the need to produce a corpse if all other evidence suggests that Grisby is probably dead). <br /> <br /> Of course, they kill Grisby and arrest Michael for that, and for the murder of Broome (shooting with Michael's gun). Michael was tried with Bannister defending him, and discovers that the latter is doing second-class work because he wants Michael to be condemned. Michael is convinced that Bannister is the real murderer, and manages to escape just before the verdict of the jury. They eliminate it and deposit it in a desert carnival, and this leads to the famous "fun house" sequence and the conclusion of the movie. <br /> <br /> It's a terribly confusing movie (as I said). That does not mean it's not worth seeing, visually it's surprising. Witness the fight between Michael and the police in the chambers of the trial judge, where he hits the sheriff on the judge's bookshelf, breaking a glass. Or the intelligent use of photography to capture Hayworth's diving from a rock, reflected in Grisby's lusty binoculars. <br /> <br /> The acting is pretty good, in particular Sloane (possibly the best role of that excellent actor's movie). Glenn Anders was a prominent Broadway artist. He rarely made films before THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI, and his slim Grisby is unforgettable. Ted De Corsia also does very well with Broome, a detective who is really looking for his own interests, at his own expense. <br /> <br /> As for Hayworth, she presents a performance that does not resemble most of what she had done before (BLOOD AND SAND, TALES OF MANHATTAN, and STRAWBERRY BLOND are exceptions), and is a Memorable mermaid. O'Hara de Welles is a very unusual character for the actor, a nice but naive man who learns the hard way not to believe what he wants to believe in secret. It's not KANE, AMBERSOMS, OTHELLO, TOUCH OF EVIL or CHIMES AT MIDNIGHT, but it's a good movie for all that.
