I loved the way the EARTH is made. His photography is incredible, his editing must have been an interesting challenge and the voiceover of Patrick Stewart is PERFECT. In addition, music and sound editing make seeing EARTH a deep experience you will not want to miss. You are really on a trip to where you would probably never end alone. <br /> <br /> And although, at first, I was quite surprised by the laughter of the audience when we see animals in their daily struggle to survive, I could not help but laugh sometimes. Nature simply seems too impressive to understand. <br /> <br /> But, instead of the need to laugh, I left the cinema with a profound question: "As 200 years of industrial revolution can destroy the natural systems that have been here for thousands and thousands of years? "<br /> <br /> With this question in mind, you will understand how I felt somewhat bitter and powerless after seeing EARTH. I felt the immediate need to change the world, to help all these animals in their struggle, to undo the changes we have experienced in recent centuries and to stop global warming once and for all (all this is not an NGO activist!). .. <br /> <br /> So I immediately visited the website mentioned at the end of the movie to see what I could do to save our fantastic planet (and the polar bear) from its depressing fate. . (www.loveearth.com) <br /> <br /> I was a little disappointed not to find direct answers to my questions there. However, it was very interesting to know more about the film and the fight that his team had. <br /> <br /> I hope that the reduction of my energy consumption will work. I do not know how to shorten the distance that polar bears have to swim to get to land before drowning or attacking animals that can not beat in their exhausted state ... <br /> <br /> It's an inspiring movie, but No I left the cinema feeling very happy.
