Paul Mazursky's magnificent comic farce, Richard Dreyfuss, plays Jack Noah, a very successful actor, who is on the set of a movie in a fictional Latin American banana republic Parador, ruled by the fascist, Alfonse Sims, who unfortunately has succumbed to a heart attack after enjoying too many local cocktails! Raul Julia plays the oily police chief who forces the reluctant Noah. To pose as the deceased dictator Just Noah has a remarkable resemblance, Sonia Braga plays the glamorous and lustful lover of the dictator, who gives Noah some lessons on how to "act" as a dictator.
