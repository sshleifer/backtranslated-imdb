I did not expect the powerful film experience of "Girlfight." It is an indie; Low budget, there are no renowned actors, first year director. I had heard it was good, but not so good. <br /> <br /> Placed in a contemporary, ethnic, working-class Brooklyn, Karyn Kusama has done an extraordinary job of capturing the daily struggles of urban areas. Latinos Diana, the protagonist, is angry with rage and lashes out at her high school classmates, getting into trouble with the school and her friends. She is being raised by her single father, who seems to love her and her brother, but applies a strict double standard based on sex to their children. The double standard of the father is illustrated by the fact that Tiny, the brother, is taking boxing classes at the local gym, but Diana is denied similar activities. On a message to the gym to meet Tiny, Diana is captivated by boxing. Tiny does not like boxing, so he and Diana exchange places; He receives Dad's money and then gives it to Diana to take the lessons instead. <br /> <br /> Actually, it's a movie to feel good about, since Diana grows up and learns about herself through boxing, meets a guy. and tackles some very serious problems in front. There is no laughter, "everything that can go well goes well" in the "Bend It Like Beckham" resolution. The reality and personal problems of the attendees are too big for resolutions, but in my opinion, "Girlfight" is a better and more satisfying movie for her.
