This piece of set about adults returning to the summer camp of their youth was very entertaining and exotic in theaters in the fall of 1993. I would say it was a shame, but again, some of the best movies ARE quiet releases that do not receive much publicity or praise. <br /> <br /> Diane LAne, Kevin Pollack, Elizabeth Perkins, Vincent Spano, Julie Warner, Bill Paxton, Kimberly Williams, Matt Craven and Alan Arkin (who is painfully good here) are the group of actors who develop these roles as people who have aged with good, bad and funny memories of past summers. This film covers the emotion of emotions, mostly pleasant, and the film never hits the viewer to feel what the characters are feeling, preferring to allow the viewer to enter the memories on their own. Since I am a moviegoer who gets mad at the brusque and blatant manipulation of movies, this is something that I appreciate from writer / director Mike Binder. <br /> <br /> This movie is a great cheap rent, a good main income and even a nice sit down in a theater movie. You may find this on television, and I would definitely suggest a review.
