I was born in 1982. Most of my childhood memories are from the late 80s and 90s. I watched the Groove Tube for the first time in 2001, when I was 19 years old. <br /> <br /> And I found it fun. <br /> <br /> Then, for anyone who thinks that something "old-fashioned" can not be very fun 30 years later ... Think again! It's funny, even if you have no idea what the 70's were like, and the thought of the low bell-bottoms makes you tremble. Who can argue with a Bozo guy the clown who reads adult literature? There is a lot to laugh about. The scrotal puppet show at the end is the best.
