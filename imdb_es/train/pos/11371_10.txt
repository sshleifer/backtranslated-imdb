This is a truly remarkable cinematic achievement. From the beginning I was completely hooked on the (true) story when Lieutenant Viktor Burakov (Stephan Rea) cries while performing the autopsies on the remains of the children's bodies. This is the compelling story of Andrei Chikatilo, played wonderfully by Jeffrey DeMunn (The Green Mile). In fact, he plays it so well and with such sympathy that the viewer almost begins to feel sorry for him, until we remember what it is. The psychiatrist Dr. Alexandr Bukhanovsky, wonderfully played by Max Von Sydow was absolutely credible in every detail, and the point he makes when talking about paranoia in the Soviet Union is made evident by the behavior of local communist commissar Bondarchuk. Joss Ackland. For me, however, the outstanding performance was by Donald Sutherland, proving once again that he is an excellent character actor. He was about to cry when he told Burakov how the FBI had followed closely and admired his work. This film puts the silence of the lambs in the shade, from the atmospheric and sombre Soviet landscape, to the superlative performances of all those involved. <br /> <br /> I rate this movie 10/10
