For starters, I've always been a fan of Batman cartoons because the theme is so universal, "that all who are alive have an alter-ego." This is true in the Mystery of Batwoman. While the overall story is good, I am disappointed that they have not done much for the franchise with this. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, you try to discover who Batwoman's identity is, unfortunately You can easily find out by looking at the list of credits published on this website (therefore, if you have not already seen it, do not go there). I was a bit disappointed that they did not extend the film. 75 minutes is too short for any movie. The secret identity of Batwoman also arrives too early in the movie, halfway, and then becomes anti-climactic because you know that the good guys will always win and that the new character known as Batwoman will disappear after the film ends. <br /> <br /> I'm also not too sure about the new style of animation used in this movie. I love the new elegant characters, but there should be more details where detail is required. Some parts of the animation look so clumsy and rigid that they attract your attention immediately, diverting your attention from the story. I also did not like the bright atmosphere that is used in most of the scenes, somehow it loses its dark and gothic feeling, which is Batman. Similarly, we should have come to know more about Batwoman's personality so we can build the same deep and compassionate feeling we do with Bruce Wayne. I also think that the fight with Bane should have been made better. In typical children's fashion, the bad guy faces his demise too easily, whether it's stumbling, falling, doing electricity or doing something silly that works against them. Now that I think about it, not one drop of blood was spilled in this film either. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, it's a good entertaining movie and I recommend to anyone who is a Batman fan to see it. It has a good story, a universal appeal and even a great performance to finish off. I just wish they could have provided a more permanent change to the story by having Batwoman stay to do the most interesting things. Do not just present it and then throw it out once it's finished. I would also like to see someone else discover the mystery for a change finally. For someone other than Batman to solve the mystery and complete the details later. <br /> <br /> I hope there are more animated films to come and we look forward to the moment we can see the Rupture between Bruce Wayne and Barbra Gordan. He's been attracting her forever and he does not even like her and I can not believe she was foolish enough to fall in love with someone 20 years older. I also want to see the moment when Tim Drake leaves because he's getting tired of the old man. In short, I want to see all the things that led the characters to where they will be in Batman Beyond. Otherwise, the same formula repeated will end faster than if they decided to move on with the story. <br /> <br />
