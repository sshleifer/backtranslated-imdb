About thirty years ago, the author Numa Sadoul published an interview with the Belgian comic artist Georges Remi (better known as Herge, the creator of Tintin). This film meets Sadoul today when he remembers the interview, while we listened to the cassettes (Herge died in 1983) and we see some old photos and images of the man himself. Some parts of the interview were not published in the book at Herge's request, and we now know that this was related to his separation from his wife, after he had an affair with one of his collaborators (who years later would become his second wife). One interesting thing that the film does not address well is the change in Tintin's books from the first books of the right and imperialist (Tintin in the Congo, Tintin in the lands of the Soviets) to quite anti-imperialist books only a few years later (The Blue lotus). In general, I come out of this movie knowing a few more things about Herge and seeing it as a little more unpleasant than when I enter the theater.
