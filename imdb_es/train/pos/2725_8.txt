"In Cold Blood", adapted by director Richard Brooks from the famous novel by Truman Capote, is about the brutal and senseless murder of a family of four by a pair of hapless criminals. The film stands out as a study of the character of the killers, in particular the activist Perry Smith (Robert Blake). <br /> <br /> The cast includes some recognizable names, but in spite of that they make the story come to life with ease. Robert Blake and Scott Wilson are excellent together as two criminals with disparate personalities. They face each other effortlessly, while Blake also has many opportunities to explore the idiosyncrasies of his character. The rest of the cast is simply average and not worth commenting on. <br /> <br /> Richard Brooks received Oscar nominations for both his screenplay and his direction. In my opinion, both were excellent, although the script is not calculated correctly with an ill-advised narrative in the later stages. Oscar-nominated cinematography by Conrad Hall is also top-notch, as is the edition. Also worth mentioning is the incredible Quincy Jones score, which secured the last of the film's four Oscar nominations. <br /> <br /> Unlike many other crime movies, this is not a glamor movie. Brooks turns the murderers into unfortunate characters instead of condemning them outright. Whether or not you agree with that feeling, the film presents an interesting alternative to the usual Hollywood approach. I recommend the film for this reason and also because of the experience with which the technical aspects are handled.
