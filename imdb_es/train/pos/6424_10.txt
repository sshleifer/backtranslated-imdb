When I was a kid, I remember being nine or ten years old and loving this movie. It was the Bollywood comedy and action movie. It's an imitation of Bad Boys obviously! All the exchange of identities, but the arrival of two other twins throw everything out the window and then the arrival of colorful villains who dance and sing. The action scenes in the film are not revolutionary, but they are still incredible scenes. The movie is really very funny and it was the great return that Amitabh Bachan needed. Govinda is a gem as always and this is probably his best work to date, it shines when the side kick offers the best comedy scenes available in Indian cinema. <br /> <br /> The songs ... The songs are fun and sticky .............. show laughter when you least expect it ... Amitabh Bachan, surprisingly, is very funny and it will make you laugh like "Bade Miah" ... your accent ... body language ... Brilliant ... <br /> <br /> 'Assi chutki naab re daal' is the best song ..... ......... Hilarious.
