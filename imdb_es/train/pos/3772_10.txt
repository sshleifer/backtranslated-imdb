Bill and Ted's fake trip is the most excellent movie I've ever seen. Although the performance and the stage, etc., are poor, who cares. The story line is brilliant and the jokes and the words that come up are excellent, the ideas are great too. I recommend to anyone who sees this classic. The best part is, obviously, when they "merge" with death, I was laughing for 10 minutes and I missed the next part of the movie. This is much better than the first, which was also great. Possibly the most fun movie of all time !!!!! However, I think the best parts of the movie are when Bill and Ted scream excellent and play the guitar solo, it was very funny. Rock on Bill, Ted and Eddie Van Halen, release a third movie.
