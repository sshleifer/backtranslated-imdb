This is excellent: the wonderful performance, the stages, the clothes, the music, but above all the story itself. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised there's no more criticism of this movie, certainly one of the best 1980s. <br /> <br /> It's also a wonderful movie to watch along with the great "Random Harvest" ", which has almost the same opening crisis <br /> <br /> - a middle-aged and unknown WWI in English The officer is in a hospital near the end of the war, suffering a shell shock and complete amnesia without having an idea of ​​his name, origin or place to which he belongs (it is shown that he is a very rich and established man) when he "recovers", I will not remember the years before the war - <br /> <br /> But there They end the similarities of the movies. <br /> <br /> My sincere thanks to everyone who participated in the film, especially the actors Ian Holm, Alan Bates, Ann Margret (what an excellent and amazing casting choice), Glenda Jackson, Julie Christie. <br /> <br /> This one stays with you forever.
