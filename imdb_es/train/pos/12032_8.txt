The film I am about to review is a small television movie made in 1996, starring Melissa Joan Hart and Daniel Baldwin. <br /> <br /> The protagonist / main antagonist Jennifer Stanton (Hart) is a typical American teenager. who is feeling the pressure of having such a controlling father (Baldwin). However, when she meets a former con man named Nick Ryan (Jeremy Jordan "He was never kissed") they instantly "fall in love" with each other, but Jennifer has a different idea about where to lead their relationship. She manipulates him to kill his parents, to protect his 'love', but only used it to get rid of his parents to be with Brad (David Lascher, the future co-star of 'Sabrina' for Hart). Melissa Joan Hart really surprised me with her role as an evil manipulator and takes the movie well by using her friends and Nick so that she can literally escape the murder. The rest of the supporting cast works well and each one holds up when they have screen time. I also found it interesting that this film was made and launched the same year, Hart, began to play Sabrina, the Teen Witch and this shows that you can act in my genres of film and television. <br /> <br /> Although the film has somehow dated, it still stands out as part of its best work involving drama or thriller and I'm looking forward to 'Nine Dead' coming out in November because it shows that it can be seen as other people who are not called "Clarissa Darling" or Sabrina Spellman "<br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of Melissa Joan Hart or Sabrina, you can see this on the Internet, so I suggest you take a glance.
