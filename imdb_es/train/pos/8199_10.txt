After what was considered the official trilogy of Dirty Harry with The Enforcer (1976) to be the final chapter of the series. Harry is back, he's older, dirtier and dirtier than ever since the original 1971 classic. <br /> <br /> Harry, in the past, killed a murderous psychopath, vigilante police and veteran terrorists from Vietnam . But now he is looking for a new killer, a murderer who wants to recover his money, killing his attackers. <br /> <br /> Sudden Impact gives a new meaning and a darker tone to Dirty Harry. Callahan is in a new murder case that is surrounding a woman (played by Sondra Locke), who was brutally raped, along with her sister, who was traumatized. Ten years later, she is going to take revenge for shooting her attackers. At the same time, although Callahan is in trouble for the problems of his superiors after provoking a Mafia boss in a heart attack, of which the Mafia is also pursuing him. Then, to let the heat go out inside the city, Harry is on vacation to go to a coastal city, but at the same time the raped victim is also in the city, while hunting his attackers one by one. Harry is investigating and finds that the murders are very similar, as he approaches the killer's tracks. <br /> <br /> The sudden Impact in my opinion, has to be one of my 10 best revenge movies, besides being the second best Dirty Harry movie, much better than The Enforcer and The Dead Pool combined. Sudden Impact has what the original Dirty Harry had, a dark tone with an entertaining value. <br /> <br /> So, do you feel lucky, punk?
