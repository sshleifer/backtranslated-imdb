Anyone who thinks that anime is nothing but sex and violence will be silenced forever after watching this movie. This is a good movie that talks about Tetsuro's quest to avenge the death of his mother, but it also grows in the process. The trip on the train in some way represents Tetsuro's journey from childhood to adulthood. The music and the visual styles of the film are a little outdated (it can be said that it is a movie from the 70s) and the animation is only slightly better than your average episode of "Star Blazers". But the story and the characters are so strong, it really does not matter. A must for any fan of the animation!
