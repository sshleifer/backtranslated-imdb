As someone who has never played sports, it seems that it would be difficult for me to enter football (or as we Americans inexplicably call it, football), with the theme "Bend It Like Beckham". But I have to say that this was a great movie! Anglo-Indian Jesminder Bhamra (Parminder Nagra) and her friend WASP Juliette Paxton (Keira Knightley) love to play soccer (yes, I'll say it in the British and international way) and they love soccer player David Beckham. But the traditional Sikh parents of Jesminder do not approve (his mother offers a really crazy description of football at the beginning of the film). Well, maybe it was a kind of clich√© in that sense, but you must love this movie! And if like me, you go to this movie without knowing the definition of "doubling" in football ... do not worry, the film explains it (I had never heard of David Beckham before this movie). And we all know that Keira Knightley arrived in a big way: a few months after "BILB" came out in the United States, she starred in the equally great "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl".
