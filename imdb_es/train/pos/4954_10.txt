A great, funny and sweet movie with Morgan Freeman (who plays himself) and who meets a Spanish girl named Scarlet (Paz Vega) in a small shop while investigating a possible independent film. For the first ten minutes I hesitated a bit about the movie, but as soon as he was in the store, I started enjoying the movie. It shows how a positive attitude can change anything. It does not contain complex plots and is easy to follow, but it will lift the saddest mood and make you smile completely without the need for a clich√© little romance. Includes several scenes to the end that make you squeeze the sides with laughter. A very rare masterpiece!
