I just saw this at the 2003 Vancouver International Film Festival and it was fun and a bit surreal. It takes place in Toronto, where these two losers live in this ruined house in the middle of a highway system. David Hewlett (PIN, CUBE, CYPHER) and Andrew Miller (CUBE) are great, as the two losers who want the world to leave. The acting, the dialogue and the writing are very good, and the whole movie looks great for a movie with such a low budget. The director / writer Vincenzo Natali was present at this screening, and seemed so intelligent and realistic. This guy is so clever with these great stories that work so well with small budgets that it makes Hollywood's budget a mess.
