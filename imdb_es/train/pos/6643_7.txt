['When I heard that this movie came out the night before Halloween, I was very excited. When I discovered that it was a book, written in 1978, I had to read it before watching the movie. I&#39;m sure the movie would have been very different for me if I had not read the book. The writers really did a good job of staying true to the main plot of the book, with small differences, of course. I think what disappointed me most about the movie was that Boyle played the role of the Colonel. I&#39;m not a big fan of Boyle, and it seems that no matter what the mood is during the movie, she&#39;s always trying to use it. Lips full, and dark makeup eyes to look super sexy. In fact, I think the film stayed true to the genuine chill of the house. My favorite secondary argument was the Sheehan family (which is so strange because the son was murdered in Iraq and now, Casey Sheehan, whose mother went to a big tirade against Iraq). In the book, obviously, the war was not Iraq, but Vietnam, and when the house turned on the video of the son in the helicopter, it really scared me. In general, I was impressed with the film, as it went very well with the book.']
