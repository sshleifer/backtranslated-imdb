I've seen this movie after seeing Paltrow's version. I found that a very good one, and I thought that this would not be so good ... but I was wrong: the British version was much better and more enjoyable! I found Jeremy Northam more "nice" than Mark Strong, but I can say that Strong traps Austen's Knightley much better. Anyway, both versions are good, but anyone who loves Austen's books should see this movie. I agree with * caalling *: Andrew Davies changed some things, but remains true to the original. <br /> <br /> 10 of 10 <br /> <br /> My 2 cents!
