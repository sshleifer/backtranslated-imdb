I think if you asked most of the JWs if they expect a miraculous cure because of their faith, you will find that they do not. I know I do not. What you will find instead is that they believe the promises that Christ made of a resurrection. Then, even if the worst happened and we died while we clung to our integrity, Jehovah can, and will correct this. <br /> <br /> It really boils down to a simple question: is God real to you or is all this just make you believe? If he is real and you trust him, he will follow your instructions no matter what the short-term result is. <br /> <br /> I had a heart attack about a year and a half ago. One of my family was horrified when she saw the words "WITHOUT BLOOD" written in large letters on my board. I reasoned with her that if I were in a position where only a blood transfusion would save my life, would it be a good time to get angry, the only one who could come back to life when the time came? She did not understand, God is not real enough for her. Too. I wish she could have the comfort that gives strong faith.
