The fight with the sword was out of this world, the spectacular fight scenes without the techniques of flying on a wire (to the end) that are too common nowadays. The scene with Chan and Pray was probably the highlight of the film. The characters in the assault on the mansion of the bad guys were clich√©, but the movie feels comfortable with that. A shot of Woo's humor. <br /> <br /> The plot with its twists and turns was unpredictable and exciting and you could not tell who was good or bad or whose side people were on. <br /> <br /> A good sense of suspense and timely surprises. The depth of the story is quite intense for a flying movie of this genre and it comes to you in ways that most kung fu movies do not.
