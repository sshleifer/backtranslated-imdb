I enjoyed a lot "The revolution will not be televised". Once again, it gave me a positive feeling about the power of people to decide for themselves how they want to be governed. <br /> <br /> It is unfortunate that in Venezuela twenty percent of the rich citizens have done everything possible. Decisions for eighty percent of the poor for decades, if not centuries. However, when his coup failed; After the interim government dissolved the Supreme Court, the Constitution, the Ombudsman, the Electoral Boards and all Civil Rights, nobody took the conspirators behind a barn somewhere and shot them. They have not even gone to jail. The main conspirators are living in Florida, continuing. And the protection they had was the "Bolivarian Constitution" approved by a large majority of the Venezuelan people. It's not just history that bites. Democracy can give you a drink if you let go. And in Venezuela it's loose.
