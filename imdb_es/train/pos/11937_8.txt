That was definitely the case with the Angels in the garden. It was on television last night and I think I had not seen the movie since my second year in high school and now I'm in my fourth year of college. Although the movie has many flaws, it is so moving that you can not help but sit back, look at it and enjoy it. It is also hilarious. The complaint of Danny Glover is so exaggerated that you can not help but laugh out loud in most cases. It adds to the film and I'm sure that's exactly what the director wanted. You really feel for the characters in the movie, although the development is not the best. You must see it. I highly recommend it. <br /> <br /> 8/10
