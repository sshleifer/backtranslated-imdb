How to lose friends and alienate people is a decent comedy with a bit of romantic approach. <br /> <br /> It's actually a story of Sidney Young (Simon Pegg) making his way into the newspaper and magazine writing business, which is played in a fun way. Simon Pegg made a good appearance, a little worse than usual. The movie is neither funny nor funny at all or anything like that, but it has its moments, and those moments are really fun. <br /> <br /> I recommend this fun and it is worth seeing American Comedy with English cream to all the people that I just want to sit down, relax and enjoy the movie for what it is. If you are about to see this film with a critical approach, you should approve it unless you want to disappoint yourself and start to tear it apart.
