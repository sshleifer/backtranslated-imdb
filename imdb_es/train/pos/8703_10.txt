I entered this film after having read that it was a drama about a man with a supernatural gift, who was turned into a monster by society. Suffice it to say that I expected something completely different from what I received. But it was a happy surprise. My friend and I thought that the movie was very romantic (the fact that the male lead was not bad to see for sure helped), and there was enough plot development, action and even humor (the fact that it took them to the 3rd part of the film that was called the other's name had the whole filmmaker laughing) to keep you entertained and invested in the story. In short: it was not what I expected, but a very good surprise. I will definitely buy this movie when it comes out on DVD.
