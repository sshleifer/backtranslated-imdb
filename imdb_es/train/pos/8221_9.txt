Sudden Impact is the 4th of Dirty Harry's films and one of the best features of these films is that they do not really degrade in quality from one film to another. Therefore, Sudden Impact offers another exciting journey through the life of Dirty Harry Callahan. This time Harry tries to solve a series of murders while on vacation. Harry is always at work that seems. Clint Eastwood plays Harry as he plays all his action men, slow, deliberate and fearless. Like the first of Dirty Harry's films made in the 1980s, Sudden Impact lacks the 70s feel that characterizes the first three films. This does not mean that the quality is less. Conclusion: Brimming with intensity and action, Sudden Impact is another worthy addition to the dirty Harry series.
