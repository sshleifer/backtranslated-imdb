CAT SOUP has two "Hello Kitty" type kittens that embark on a strange journey through the future life, where anything can happen, and it does. This Asian short film that does not stop thinking does not use dialogues, but replaces the word balloons. There is no way to describe this demented caricature except to tell him to see it for himself. And make sure there is no one under the age of 10 in the room. Dismemberment and cannibalism and cruelty and savagery and sudden death and insensitive contempt for others are common themes. Honest. Perhaps the most memorable image is that of an elephant composed of water through which kittens swim and enter, and also ride. But like almost everything else in this movie, that foolish and picaresque interlude soon comes to an awful end.
