This movie is bufoonery! and I loved it! The "lord of the dragon" (Jacky Chan) and his friend, "cowboy", made the film fun, meaningful and simply silly. The film is a rare combination of struggle between good and evil and (in some way) the wonders and fun that is growing. Long Shao Ye takes the viewer through the daily activities of the young "lord of the dragon" (so called because he is the son of a wealthy family) and "cowboy", which includes the implementation of intelligent and elaborate ways to escape study ( with the help of the whole family, including the tutor), competing in quite infantile (and idiotically interesting) ways to win the affection of a local girl, competing in "football" (you'll see what I mean) and the list goes on. Somehow, they are in the middle of a struggle to save a shipment of valuable antiques and the lives of several people. <br /> <br /> The movie has its serious moments. But they do not depress, they inspire. The joy of children is not lost in this exchange, but is actually used against evil. What I really loved about this movie is how it ends. Not the typical confrontation (which in itself was incredible), but hey, you'll see. Let me say that it really captures the spirit of the movie. <br /> <br /> silly, witty, meaningful and nostalgic. great movie.
