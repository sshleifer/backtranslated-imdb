I must point out, before reading this review, that in any way, this is a statement against the Iranian people ... if you really want to read something about it, I hope you see that I am against politicians in general. ... but if he wants to be offended ... I can not help him! <br /> <br /> Not in Iran because this movie is forbidden there (see IMDb Trivia for this movie). Which is a shame, because the movie is great. If it were not for "Grbavica", this film would have won at the Berlin International Film Festival. <br /> <br /> Rightly (it was the second place, or the second place, if you wish). Why? Because it's a movie about oppression. It's not even that this is a complete women's issue. It's about the government trying to keep people depressed. An analogy so clear that the government felt the need to ban the film. But by prohibiting it, nothing is resolved and / or they can make this movie disappear! <br /> <br /> Another critic had a great summary line: "Comedy about a tragedy", sums it up quite well!
