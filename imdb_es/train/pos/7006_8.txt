Persecuted by a secret, Ben Thomas (Will Smith) seeks redemption by radically transforming the lives of seven people he does not know. Once your plan is established, nothing can stop it. At least that's what he thinks. But Ben had not planned to fall in love with one of these people and she is the one that will end up transforming him. Will Smith is back with Director Gabriele Muccino, after the life-inspiring movie "The Pursuit of Happiness." "Seven Pounds" is another life-changing film experience that not only reminds you of your previous, tearful collaboration, but inspires you with joy at the end. Will Smith, is also the producer again with some of the others. These films are very realistic, they represent the life of an ordinary man and his struggles through life. Seven pounds may have taken some time to gain their real momentum, but just after half an hour of the movie, the movie is ready to rule your heart. In addition, this film has some twists that revolve around, allowing viewers to continue guessing. The director Gabriele Muccino, once again, is the winner all the way, with his emotional but inspiring message. He makes all the characters in the film very real, that people would really be somewhere in the movie. Along with the director, Will Smith is another winner, with his excellent acting skills. Once again, the duo of the director and actor works like a charm. In addition, there are other talented actors in the film who did their part quite well. Rosario Dawson, beauty with intelligence, that's what you can call it. She looks beautiful and does her part extremely well. Barry Pepper gives great support to the film and Woody Harrelson does the same, although Woody did not have much screen time (it would have been nice if he had more). You will not forget this movie easily. Watch this movie and change your life. First class cinema!
