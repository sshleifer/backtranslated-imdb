Stack should have received the Academy Award for this performance, period. It is a crime that he did not do it. Incredible how it humanizes a rich character without value. <br /> <br /> Dorothy Malone earned a well-deserved Academy Award for her performance. In fact, the whole performance in this movie is excellent. <br /> <br /> The plot begins with a taxi ride, then a plane trip, and then continues to move on an emotional journey that will keep your interest at all times. It will entertain you! <br /> <br /> However, this is just a blatant soap opera. One-dimensional, 100% soap dish. You could call him the best drunk, because acting trumps the material. Excellent performance, well directed, but strictly within its soap genre. I would not even call it melodrama (like "Mildred Pierce" or "Imitation of Life"). While it does not deny the great entertainment value of this movie, you can only imagine what this talented and talented director could have achieved with a more substantial theme.
