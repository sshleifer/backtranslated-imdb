I just read the summary of the plot and it's the worst I've read. It does not do justice to this incredible movie. To see an example of a good summary, read the list in "Turner Classic Movies". Anyway, this was one of my favorite movies when I was a girl. My sister and I could not wait until every April, when we could see him on television. It is one of the best horse movies of its time. It is one of those great classics that the whole family can see. The romance is clean and endearing. The story line is interesting and the songs are great. They do not make movies like this anymore. Good performance and not exaggerated. Pat Boone and Shirley Jones are at their best, along with many other great character actors.
