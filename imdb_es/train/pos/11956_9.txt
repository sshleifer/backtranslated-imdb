I would even say some nuances of Hitchcock ... this is clearly better than the MMM, which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some, if not most, by Woody fans. By the way, did you know that Annie Hall was conceived for the first time as a murder mystery? Anyway, Woody regains some relevance in the film comedy with this. The twists of the plot are beautiful and tight. I will say that in the first 20 minutes or so, some of the actors are too hasty in the delivery of their lines, but they stay. Scarlett Johansson is well played in the role of Diane Keaton, and at no time there are uncomfortable moments between her and Woody, who is much older. Nobody could imagine a more perfect actor for the role of Peter Lyman than Jackman.
