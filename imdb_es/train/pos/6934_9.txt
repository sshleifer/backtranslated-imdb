Winchester '73 is a great story, and that's what I like about it. It is not the everyday style of his western life: he uses a rifle, which passes from the hands of several characters, as a mechanism to tell the story of these people. Rock Hudson plays an Indian boss, Jimmy Stewart plays a great leader with heart and strength, and Shelly Winters plays a girl who has to face the realities of her husband and the wild west. It is important to keep in mind that those politically correct types kill many Indians in this film without remorse. By today's standards, it is still quite violent. But it's a great story and it's worth seeing. Enjoy!
