['Here is my first film directed by David Mamet. Adequate, since it was his first, too. <br /><br /> The story here is uneven and it moves like a scam movie, from the small disadvantages to the big disadvantages to the all-encompassing scam. It&#39;s like &quot;The Grifters&quot;, but without the acting level of that movie. (In that film, John Cusack was somewhat insipid, but that was the nature of his character). The performance here is very flat (sometimes I wondered if Crouse&#39;s bland performance was supposed to be a kind of attack on psychoanalysis). At least in the beginning. It never gets really good, but evolves beyond a painfully stiff line reading after about ten minutes. At the beginning of the film, some of Lindsay Crouse&#39;s lines, the way he reads them, sound as if they were a monologue or internal narration, which they are not. With the arrival of Mantegna, things are collected. <br /><br /> The dialogue here is not as fun as it should be. I expected the lines of the crackerjack&#39;s ring-a-ding-ding to come out of the tongue, but not these. Everything sounds very read, more than spoken. Maybe Mamet evolved after this movie and it loosened, but if not, maybe he should let others direct his words. He is too valuable to them here and, as a result, they lose their rhythmic and dazzling quality. What is more strange is that, apart from this, the film does not seem or feel like a play. The camera is very cinematic. My only problem with &quot;Glengarry Glen Ross&quot; was that it looked too much like the movies, but in that film the actors were not only successful, but also relaxed and free. Everything flowed. <br /><br /> I would not mind much if it sounded like characters from movies that talk about movie lines, or even play characters that speak lines of play, but here it sounds like movie characters (or even books) that speak lines of games. It&#39;s a weird mix of theater and cinema that just does not work. That does not mean that the movie is bad, it is not, it is often extremely entertaining. The best part is in the middle. <br /><br /> It&#39;s a scam movie: the new kid (in this case, the girl) Margaret Ford (Lindsay Crouse) gets involved in the sordid world. How she gets involved is: she is a psychiatrist and one of her patients, Billy is a compulsive player. She wants to help with her gambling debt, so she enters The House of Games, a dirty gambling room where scammers work in a back room. I admit that the configuration is quite unlikely. (Were you waiting for Crouse to come in? Were you waiting for her to write a check? Billy was in that? However, one of these questions is definitely answered at the end). <br /><br /> And from here the cons begin. I found that beginners, the little ones, are the most fun. We are getting a lesson in the art of scam as much as Crouse is. <br /><br /> We see the end coming, and then we did not see the second end come, and then the real ending that I did not see coming, but maybe it did. The ball keeps bouncing from one side to the other and, in the last scene of the film, we realize that the second Crouse entered The House of Games and found its true calling. <br /><br /> I will forgive the annoying opening, the improbable bits and the strange reading of lines because there are many good things here. If the first part of the movie seems stagy, stay with it. After the half hour, it really has an impulse. If you want a fun scam, then here she is. If you want Mamet, go see &quot;Glengarry Glen Ross&quot; again, James Foley did it better. <br /><br /> ***']
