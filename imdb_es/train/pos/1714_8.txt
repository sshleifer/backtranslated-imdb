When watching the movie, he was in a very good mood and this film is also light, but the end of the film is unexpected, which leaves a lasting memory in mind. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with Abhay and his profession of being. Witness during the marriage registration. Soha comes by marriage and her boyfriend does not, leaving Soha alone in the street, she can not go home and she has nothing to live with in this situation. Abahy turns out to be an assistant to her, that is. the basis of the story. <br /> <br /> The rest can only be seen and the end of the story is bitter, sweet that Abhay has to face, which keeps you on the edge of the seat. <br /> <br /> The dialogues and the music are good songs, they are good, the direction is good and, therefore, as in the script, you feel that the film is slow, but attending to the demand of the story , everything is fine. <br /> <br /> You can really see it, especially with a soft tone. I enjoyed this at home with coca and peanuts. My rating for this is 8/10
