An excellent series, masterfully acted and directed, but without love (they tell me) by Mr. Deighton and withdrawn by him after a single presentation. Now it can only be seen in private collections, and through the British Film Institute by special request. Very unfortunate, since Ian Holm's nuanced interpretation of the tired but determined Bernard Samson is excellent; One of his best performances. The cast, including young Amanda Donohoe and Hugh Fraser, are excellent. With Mel Martin playing the troubled and traitorous wife, and Michael Degen as mercurial Werner, the story positively symbolizes the tragic and fateful personal consequences of the big game.
