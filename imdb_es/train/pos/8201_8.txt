Sudden Impact tends to be treated as Eastwood's artistic failure at a point in his career in which he had established a good reputation as a director. Actually, the reason is not the film itself, but the attitude it takes towards the vigilantism that it seems to support. In some places, it is actually owed more to Death Wish than to the original Dirty Harry movie. One could argue if that is so, at the end of the day it is a film about guilt, justice and retribution. For me, at the end of the day it's more empathy than sympathy. However, in view of all these arguments, it is easy to overlook that the sudden impact is a very well made movie. Forget "Go punk, make my day's scene", that's iconic but not original. But look at the views of San Francisco taken from the air, approaching the city. The first 15 or 20 minutes are quite spectacular. Or take a look at the brilliant scene in which the character of Sondra Locke visits her sister with a mental illness in the hospital. Eastwood makes great use of the juxtaposition of faces. So, in general, Sudden Impact is a very visual film that really shows how mature Eastwood is as a director. And if I remember correctly, it was actually the first time that Eastwood put it on the screen, although in a debatable ideology action movie. Also, I think this is the first film directed by Eastwood. Although Eastwood has an enormous talent as a director, dramaturgy has always been his weak point (see Play Misty for me, Breezy, etc.) The space of the narrative makes the visual elements integrate well in the film and does not distract the attention of history. The only thing that is really annoying is the dog with farts.
