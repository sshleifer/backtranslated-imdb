The final season of Roseanne was a roller coaster of crazy people. This last episode does exactly what a previous comment says, tells us that no matter how much we think we knew the characters we did not know. Roseanne goes back to the first season and tells us that this show has been her interpretation of her life. She says in this final episode that she changed events and people as she sees fit. Scott was not really with Leon, but he existed. Mark and David married opposite wives in real life, and Dan died when she made him live. As the events occurred in her life, she changed them in her writing. We do not all wish we could do that. Not all of us have a moment in time when we would like to be able to use a draft and change it to our liking. This is what she did with the whole episode. And to another comment, I would say that I do not feel cheated, the family was real in my mind, it just changed the way the events in their lives happened. An A + that ends in an A + show!
