['Although some call it a &quot;Cuban paradisiacal cinema,&quot; the film is closer to How Green Was My Valley, a memory film mourning a lost innocence. The film intelligently avoids falling into a political trap of taking sides (in favor of Castro? Anti-Castro ?, focusing instead on the human frailty of the characters and the importance of the family). Mexican actress Diana Bracho, who plays Keitel&#39;s wife, a masterpiece full of references to classic films, from CASABLANCA to Chaplin&#39;s CITY LIGHTS Gael Garc√≠a Bernal plays a small role that is critical to the dramatic reward of history. Television director Georg Stanford Brown, in a rare return to acting (do you remember THE ROOKIES?), plays a vagrant who has no home and acts as a Greek choir, superbly.It is a shame that this movie, originally titled DREAMING OF JULIA, has been released in the United States by THINKfilm with the atrocious title of CUBAN BLOOD., Which has nothing to do with the film.']
