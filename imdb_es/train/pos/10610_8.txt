A young and sweet mountain man with a sad past (Henry Thomas) meets a girl abandoned in the woods and instantly falls in love with her. The elders of the city generally support him to support the child, although a local temptress (Cara Seymour) thinks little about the new family. A determined girl on a long walk and a sinister street vendor (David Strathairn in its most spooky form) have parallel stories that converge in a fateful way. This is a lovely piece of life in Ozarks in the same sense as "Where The Lillies Bloom" and "The Dollmaker". All three were filmed in those beautiful hills and covered the lives of simple-minded, simple-minded Americans. A minimum of strong language and short but marked violence make this vision of the family quite safe.
