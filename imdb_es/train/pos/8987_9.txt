I recently rented this document, I remembered hearing it on IMDb.com and being intrigued by the premise. I knew very little about any of these bands, but I remember hearing "Not If You Were The Last Junkie On Earth" by The Dandy Warhols a long time ago and I enjoyed it. That said, this is my perspective on the document: <br /> <br /> One thing that I found incredible about this movie is that it is not necessary to have any prior knowledge of any of these bands. The director (Ondi Timoner) does not waste time in attracting the public and familiarizing him with the people in this film. I quickly felt caught up in the lives of both Anton and Courtney, as well as their respective bands, The Brian Jonestown Massacre and The Dandy Warhols. I think that's part of what makes this document so good, and what makes Ondi Timoner a master documentary maker. <br /> <br /> I also loved how the "history" of these bands was told. Most of what you see is from the bands on tour. Both bands begin playing in small places and struggle to reach the recording industry. Throughout the film, each band strives to remain unique and uncontrolled by the norm. However, this is what makes the two bands similar and, therefore, the bright perspective of how two bands of a pen can go in such different directions. <br /> <br /> Basically, I would recommend this to ANYONE who likes cinema in general. . You do not need to have a particular love for documentaries, or any of the bands. Appreciation for music helps, but the music itself is a background of the love / hate relationship between the Brian Jonestown Massacre and The Dandy Warhols.
