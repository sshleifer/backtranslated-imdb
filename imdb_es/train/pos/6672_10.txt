I've seen Mystery Men being a little sticky in the press and with the general public (take the unforeseen vote, for example), but my general opinion is that Mystery Men is more fun than most movies, definitely more witty than most of the so-called comedy films and almost 'smart'. <br /> <br /> The cast is excellent; Greg Kinnear is excellent, as are Geoffrey Rush and Tom Waits. The Kinnear limousine scene with Ricky Jay is perfect as a "spoiled movie star" and gives his character the right balance of comic book quality and realism to make it work. <br /> <br /> I'll admit that the rhythm is a little off in some places, and the visual effects are certainly very striking, possibly to the detriment of further characterization, but at the end of the day, it's a high-profile movie concept: it's about the little moments "What's Up Tiger Lily?" - and there are so many great movies in this movie that it's worth watching them repeatedly.
