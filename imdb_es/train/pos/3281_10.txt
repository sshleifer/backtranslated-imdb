Who would have thought that a small film so dark could be so disturbing and moving? I'm really impressed It's a pity that more people have not seen it. I loved, as always, Hans Zimmer's score. And what a debut as a director of Bernard Rose! However, I wonder if I should call this a horror movie. One could easily argue that it is also a fantasy or a drama. Well, in any case, I love the interpretative potential that it has. Everything and everyone in Anna's dreams (played by Charlotte Burke) represent a real conflict in her life ... the house itself, the tree, Mark, the lighthouse, etc. It's the many details like these that make the movie so good. for repeated viewings. I hope to find another small film full of emotion and psychological meaning like this soon.
