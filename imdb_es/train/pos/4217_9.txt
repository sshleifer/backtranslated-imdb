It is always satisfying when a detective involves a case and the criminal is taken to the book. In this case the climax gives me even more pleasure. Seeing the smirk erased from Abigail Mitchell's face when she realizes that her victim has left a "deathbed testimony" that leaves no doubt about her guilt is very satisfying. <br /> <br /> Please understand: while I admire Ruth Gordon's performance, her character really * really * irritates me. She is selfish and demanding. She gets her way by staging a "little girl" act that is embarrassing for a woman her age. Worse still, he has now established himself as judge, jury and executioner against his dead niece's husband. <br /> <br /> When Columbo gets too close, she tries to baffle him by manipulating him into a fist. Speech before an audience of upper class women. Turn the tables perfectly to deliver a very warm and humane speech about the realities of police work. <br /> <br /> Nothing can distract Columbo from the pursuit of justice. Abby's final appeal to her good nature is rejected because she has too much self-esteem to not do her job well. Here is a situation that you can not get out of Mrs. Mitchell!
