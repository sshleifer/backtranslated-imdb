I've seen this movie more than 100-200 times, and I love it every time I see it. Yes, it can be very cheesy, but it is also very fun and enjoyable. The camp that is shown in the film is a real camp that I attended for 7 years and describes how the camp really is, a great place to spend the summer. All the people who have gone to the camp, have wanted to go to the camp or have sent a child to the camp should see this movie because it will bring wonderful memories for you and your children.
