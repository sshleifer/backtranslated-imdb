THE DEVIL GAME is my second attempt in a production by Joseph Sarno, and although I will say that it is much more pleasant than Swedish WILDCATS painfully boring and not very erotic, it is still a bit slow and not very explicit for my taste. <br /> <br /> This is centered around a group of vampires living in a castle, who want to resurrect their previously murdered "leader". To do it, the girls have to dance naked, kiss and sing strange things, and of course drink some blood too. When a doctor and her brother's car break up and they have to stop at the castle to stay, they provide the ideal blood bank for vampires in heat ... but they may not be as helpless as they seem ... <br /> THE DEVIL'S PLAYTHING is a good example of the exploitation laziness of the early 70's. A lot of nudity, including some complete and sordid frontal nuances, such as incest and, of course, the blood lesbo pacifier ... but these scenes are still quite docile by today's standards. Some very good women in this case, would have benefited from a more explicit sex, but I guess they can not have it all. It would also have benefited from a more intense violence / gore, since it is a vampire movie, but I think the purpose of THE DEVIL'S PLAYING was more to show skin, not blood. Still a bit slow, and the performance for the most part is absolutely wooden, but that is what is expected from something of this era and this budget. It is worth taking a look to exploit the fans; others may find it a bit boring for their liking. 7/10
