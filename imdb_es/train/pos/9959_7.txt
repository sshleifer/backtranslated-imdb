Well, if you're open enough to like Barber Shop, then you'll like this Canadian movie. <br /> <br /> If your mind is as closed as Fort Knox, then you will give it the current. score you have: 2.5. <br /> <br /> This is a movie for anyone who is prepared to watch films from outside their own racial terrains. He is attractive, he is faithful to life, on two or three occasions you lose the connections between the scenes, but many times, especially towards the end, you find a tear or two in your eyes and this simply because it is very frequent. it reflects what life can be. <br /> <br /> I like and recommend it to anyone with an open mind beyond traditional American cinema.
