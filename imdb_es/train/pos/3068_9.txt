It follows from reading the previous comments that this movie went directly to the cable. Well, I paid to see it in a theater, and I'm glad I did it because visually it was a surprising movie. Most of the adjustments seem to have been made in the early 60's (except for the shrink's office, which was dated in a different way), and if you leave Neve Campbell's sequences, the whole movie has an atmosphere of early 60 And the use of restaurants in the movie was fascinating. For a first director whose background, I think, is written, has a great eye. In the first ten minutes I felt that the plot lacked plausibility, so I simply suspended my disbelief and followed the ride. As for the performance and representation of father-son relationships, mother-son, husband-wife, father-son, the film was successful. William H. Macy, a pleasure to see it, seems to be filling the void left by the late Tony Perkins, if this and Magnolia are an indication. Tracey Ullman as the careless wife was quite moving, for me. It was a three-dimensional representation of a character often seen by society as two-dimensional. Of course, Donald Sutherland can add this to his collection of unforgettable portraits. The representation of the parents (Bain / Sutherland) reminded me, indirectly, the BUFFALO '66 by Vincent Gallo, although quite attenuated! I would definitely pay money to see a second movie by this director. He has the self-discipline of a director of the crime movie of the 50s (something that Fr. T. Anderson will never have!), However, he has a visual style and a way with actors that attracts attention.
