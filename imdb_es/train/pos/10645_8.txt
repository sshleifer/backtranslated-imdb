The manic desire of Adolf Hitler to impose his will on the rest of the world is the theme of this second in a series of seven parts of films produced by the US Department of War as an instructional tool for new soldiers entering. to the Armed Forces during World War II. Hitler's plan was methodical and well conceived, beginning with the conquest of Eastern Europe, expanding into the heart of Europe and then moving to the 'Island of the World' consisting of Europe, Asia and Africa. His final movement would be to reach across the oceans for the definitive conquest of America and the World. <br /> <br /> In 1935, Hitler ordered national conscription, since the rest of the country fell under his evil spell. The children of the primary school sang their praises, and the young Germans received training and indoctrination in military camps. Marching unopposed to Austria in 1938, Hitler continued to annex a strip of land bordering Germany and Czechoslovakia called Sudetenland. In 1939, Hitler took all of Czechoslovakia. Later in the year, the world was surprised to learn that Germany signed a non-aggression pact with its deadly enemy, Russia, a strategy to delay Hitler's military involvement on too many fronts. Immediately after, Germany invaded Poland, leading the conquest of Hitler to the Russian gate. He would take care of her later. <br /> <br /> It was during this period when Britain refused to oppose Hitler's impulse throughout Europe. Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain felt that he won a great victory for his country by accepting a treaty with Germany, in his infamous statement that says "Peace in our time." It did not turn out that way. <br /> <br /> The most fascinating information that was learned in this installment, at least for me, was provided by a small fragment of material from a German Hitler rally in the middle '30's. It was directed by an American of German origin following his example directly from the fatherland. The place - Madison Square Garden!
