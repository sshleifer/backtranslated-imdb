Honestly, I think that was the best version of the war of the worlds I've seen. It was fun, but it was also educational, I learned a lot about the movie and if I could, I would do it for that movie. My favorite part was when the soldiers died in a robot and another came right after him. In the last movie of the world war, I think it should have been more like the first and it would have been better. But anyway I give this movie 2 thumbs up. <br /> <br /> and if you want to make another movie like this one I will definitely see it. <br /> <br /> Thanks
