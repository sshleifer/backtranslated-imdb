this movie is awesome kind of It really says a lot, or a long time ago, but it's an awesome movie to see how stupid it is. High school is taken over by evil ms.togar who hates what all students love, rock & roll. riff randle get tickets for everyone for the Ramones show, and this movie reaches its peak with a takeover of the school that led to my riffle riffle and ramones. this movie has everything, a bad script, a questionable direction, bad actors (ie, clint howard & pj soles), an impressive soundtrack, a great sharpness, these elements and much more come together to make this what it is , a classic. <br /> <br /> note: during the live ramones set, note that the falling germs are at the front of the crowd. organized
