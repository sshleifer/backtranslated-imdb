This is the first review I wrote for IMDb so naked with me, but I captured this movie on HBO and I was glad to have seen it. Richard Gere is great in this movie as the passionate agent / detective who follows the rules to do the job. I think the story is great, and there is never a boring scene that slows the pace of the movie. Some parts of the movie that have to do with sex addicts with dementia are quite shocking, but if you've ever seen a crime movie like Se7en, you can handle the scenes without problems. <br /> <br /> So, in general, if you're looking for a good detective / suspense movie, ignore the low rating that this movie got on IMDb and definitely watch it.
