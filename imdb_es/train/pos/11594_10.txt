I just found the IMDb program and searched in this film, and I was moved by the comments of all the people who saw this movie as I saw it when I was 6 or more years old in 1967. I saw it before the Jungle Book , so I went Eagle Boy for a few hours and then Mowgli for next year. I burst into tears at the movies when the boy became the Eagle and I always wanted to see the movie again. When we got home we had a roast chicken dinner and they gave me the bone of desires and guess who I wanted to be? My father then said: 'I bet you wanted to be an Eagle' and, of course, we all know that the wishes are broken if someone guesses, so there are more tears and a bit of resentment to this day for not being able to fly. ..
