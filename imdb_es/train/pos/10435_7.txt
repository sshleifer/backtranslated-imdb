My watch arrived a little late, but I'm glad I saw this and the sequel together ... what makes me congratulate the creators of this film for giving such a pure and basic treatment to the idea of ​​romanticism ... and separate very marginally From the idea of ​​relationships! As much has already been written about the film, it would be appropriate to highlight some parts of the film that I personally loved. <br /> <br /> I think the point at which Jesse and Celine make false calls to their respective friends was a very clever way of telling each other what they had meant to each other through a trip that did not even take place. extended the 24 hours ... the curiosity of two people who think that the other has had an infallible impact on the other has been very intelligently treated with ... <br /> <br /> On the front of the plot, do That a romantic story works in a pure conversation is not an easy task to realize ... <br /> <br /> I believe in the romantic films of Such flavor, the characters are not clearly designed even in the mind of the writer and the director. What the actors reveal is what becomes of them ... right or wrong, even the bearers of the idea would find it difficult to justify ... becoming the character, the life that the actor has to go beyond the instructions and history ... here Both the actors do the right job! Kudos .. !!! and Before sunset is another feather that makes it even more beautiful!
