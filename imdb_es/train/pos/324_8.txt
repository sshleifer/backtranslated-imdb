I did not expect that I would like this movie as much as I did. I got it simply because I saw it on the list of the 25 most controversial films of all time. It did not look particularly great. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that it was one of the most ingenious movies in recent history. <br /> <br /> It is a twenty year old woman who wants to know everything. She stores all the information she collects in a huge file. She experiments with experience in sex, political activism and human relationships. Meanwhile, the film crew is shown making the film and we see their reactions to the story and to the others. Nudity, explicit sex and controversial politics prevented this film from showing itself in the United States while appealing for its seizure by Customs. The film is a narrative, but it is a documentary that shows us the world behind the scenes of the filmmakers during the narrative, with the fourth broken wall. This movie is the most direct possible way to make a movie I've seen. The film works predominantly as a time capsule of psychedelic events, the struggle for freedom and sexual liberation of the sixties. I like to think that it is much more than that. <br /> <br /> I did not think I'd like to waste time with the blue version of this movie, but I really believe it. This movie is a buried treasure. Give it a try.
