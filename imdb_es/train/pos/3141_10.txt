['Let&#39;s face it: the final season (# 8) was one of the worst in any program I&#39;ve ever enjoyed (mostly, I&#39;ve never found that dry periods last a whole season). But if you judge this program for the last season, of course it will look like inferior. That&#39;s a totally unfair assessment, because &quot;That &#39;70s Show&quot; was, in its day, a brilliant and hilarious comedy about a bygone era and how the people who lived there were not as different as we are in modern times. <br /><br /> Okay ... ignoring season 8. <br /><br /> Topher Grace plays Eric Forman, a geek in heat of a teenager with a perpetual love for Donna (Laura Prepon), the feminist girl next door. With his friends, Danny Masterson (Hyde), Mila Kunis (Jackie), Wilmer Valderrama (Fez) and even Ashton Kutcher (Kelso) give fantastic performances in (almost) all the episodes. The best is probably Fez, a foreign exchange student who is as mentally promiscuous as they get it. What country is it from? Try to find out! For another dimension of entertainment, Debra Jo Rupp and Kurtwood Smith are phenomenal like Eric&#39;s parents. Rupp, like Kitty, is formidable and sweet, kind of like Mrs. Brady meets Marie Barone, while Smith&#39;s Red exists mainly to scare everyone&#39;s pogees. Don Stark and Tanya Roberts play very well opposite each other like Donna&#39;s parents, the chauvinistic but cute Bob and the headbiter Midge. Tommy Chong has occasional appearances as Leo, a stoner who acts as a father figure to Hyde. <br /><br /> Apart from the anachronistic errors that appear quite frequently and the extraordinary lessons that sometimes come (and from that unfortunate final season), &quot;70&quot; is a fantastic show with amazing writing, precise direction and a feeling. Good vibes by clicking on each episode. Everyone is fine.']
