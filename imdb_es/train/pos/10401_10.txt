The words can barely describe it, so I'll be brief. "The Thief of Baghdad" was my favorite movie when I was a child, and it has never ceased to amaze me or enchant me. I loved this movie from the first moment I saw it, when I was a six year old boy who had started reading "The Arabian Nights". I remember going into the TV room in the middle of the battle of Sabu with the giant spider and being seduced instantly. <br /> <br /> Rarely has so much beauty, magic and wonder been captured in the film. Sabu and John Justin are excellent as the heroes that run, Conrad Veidt is completely charming as the villainous villain Jaffar, and Rex Ingram is a joy to see as the sardonic genius. Georges Perinal's photography is one of the best uses of Technicolor. One of the three accredited directors is Michael Powell, a filmmaker who has been legitimately announced by the critics, but which the public often overlooks for his notable films, such as "A Matter of Life and Death" (also known as "Stairway to Heaven ") and" The red shoes. " He is one of the true masters of the camera, along with David Lean, Akira Kurosawa and Orson Welles. <br /> <br /> As with all great works of art, the beauty of "The Baghdad Thief" is in detail. Each painting has its own magical charm. The story is never far behind, and the characters and their actions are always involved. Here is a movie that will never grow old.
