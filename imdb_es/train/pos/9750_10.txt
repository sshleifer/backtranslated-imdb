Yes, Giorgio, it's a feeling-good movie. A bit of romance, good music, beautiful scenery, comedy, (a great food fight), and a bit of bittersweet flavor are the ingredients of Yes, Giorgio. Any movie fan would enjoy this movie. Those who require massive special effects, should look elsewhere. Most of us need a little escape from time to time, and what better way to do it, than with a feast for the eyes, the ears and the heart? You must see it!
