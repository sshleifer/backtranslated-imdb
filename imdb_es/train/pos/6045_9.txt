I was also in the movie, but I do not know if they really put this scene. On the way back from a school trip (in 2005) we stopped at a service station at the same time as they made the movie, and they asked us (all of us) to run and shout. Come on! Free bird! We were around 10 years old, could someone who has seen the movie tell me if that part stayed in the movie? It would be great to know! I remember that I thought that the film had never been released, because it was another 2 and a half years before it was released. All your comments seem to be good, so I guess it was a pretty successful movie, I could buy it, but first I would like to know if I'm in it! : D thanks
