This is a beautiful movie. The true story of the bond between father and son. This is, by far, Tom Hanks at its best. Tom Hanks is really out of the box in this movie. Usually, he has nice guy papers. However, in this film, appears in this film as something rough, but still emerges with the smell of rose, even to the last scene, the murder of his character. The cast of this movie was well organized. I also love the part when there is total silence when the character of Tom Hanks shoots and kills all the men in Mr. Rooney's group. There is something creepy and deep, but there is no sound in that scene, just emotion. I love the appearance of John Rooney, the face of the character of Paul Newman when he realizes, even before seeing it, that it is the character of Tom Hanks who is taking revenge, and he knows that his destiny has arrived. The first time I saw this movie, I was impressed and I knew I had to go find the video, and since then I have added it to my collection of my favorite movies of all time. <br /> <br /> Tom Hanks is My favorite actor, so this movie has a special place in me.
