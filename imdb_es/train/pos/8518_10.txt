I found this movie at the local video store during its annual sidewalk sale. While scanning thousands of videos, hoping to find some cartoon movies for sale, I found this movie. I read the back of the movie and I knew it was God's hand at work for me to buy this movie. You see, I have a group of brothers of three adopted children (and soon they will be adopted) who live with my family. Immediately, my adopted children connected with the three children who star in the film. The film helped them better understand their own circumstances. For the first time, too, the oldest of the group of brothers (7 years old / woman) decided to tell me a little about their past and the trauma they had experienced. She has been fighting against the whole matter of trust. This is also the first time I had seen her cry. After watching the movie, I asked what it meant for a child to be adopted. She replied: "It means being happy." A must see for families who are raising children and are considering adoption. Certainly opened the lines of communication with us.
