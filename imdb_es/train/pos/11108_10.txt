Well ... easily my favorite TV series. Call me clich√© of itinerant mail, but include violence, mafia, sex, games of chance, drugs, etc. in a program and is already earning points in my book. Combine all that with a performance that surpasses anything you've seen on the small screen, add an address that fits the vintage type of cinema and, above all, writing that blows the mind (and a few brains to the end) ) and yourself a show that is going to be quite difficult to compete. <br /> <br /> Above all there are two actors, James Gandolfini as Tony Soprano, and Edie Falco as his wife Carmela ... as for Gandolfini, a way in which words can not be expressed fits into his , if you have not seen him as Tony you still see him now! <br /> <br /> I can go on and on and talk about each character in the show, the psychological brightness, the grip of scenes, etc., but I could not stop myself, so all I can say is that it's the only one show together with Seinfeld, that I can see again and again from beginning to end and end up enjoying, even More.
