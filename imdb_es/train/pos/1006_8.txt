The classic novel by Robert A. Heinlein, Starship Troopers, has been the subject of problems in recent years, in everything, in Paul Verhoeven's 1997 film, in a television series, in various games. But none of these, so to speak, has really captured the spirit of his novel. The games are generally not related, the television series was more like a spin off, and the less said about the Verhoeven movie, the better. Little is known, however, that in Japan, an animated adaptation had already been made, launched the year of Heinlein's death. And, believe it or not, despite its differences, this 6-part animated series is, in terms of the plot, the most faithful adaptation of the Heinlein classic. <br /> <br /> The most obvious advantage of this series is the presence of motorized armor exoskeletons, something we were deprived of in the Verhoeven movie. Like the book, the series focuses more on the characters and their relationships than on the action and space travel, although we see a good amount of each. While events happen differently than in the book, the sensation of the plot of the book is present. Rico and Carmen have a romantic entanglement, but it is a little more touched than in the book. While some may believe that the dialogue and character interaction are a bit inferior to the book (get a bit of anime treatment, but what did you expect?), But it is far superior to the movie. Heinlein's political views are simply eliminated, unlike the film, where they are invested. The big reward of the series, however, is the climatic battle in Klendathu between the soldiers and the bugs / aliens, which presents the kind of action of the motorized armor suits that we would like to have seen in a film version. <Br /> <br /> In general, I enjoyed this series because I wanted to see a vision closer to Heinlein's. And I think they did pretty well with this. If you can find this series, take a look.
