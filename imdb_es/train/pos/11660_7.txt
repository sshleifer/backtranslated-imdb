A beautiful piece of children's cinema buried in a world of archaic Celticism. Setting the history around the famous Book of Kels, it is believed that it was composed of monks from the small island of Iona, on the west coast of Scotland. <br /> <br /> Telling the story of a young apprentice of abbots who leaves in the forest in search of Crom-Cruic, the fierce headless horseman of pagan mythology. Hoping to recover a lost artefact. <br /> <br /> The true beauty of the film lies in its animation. Shaded cell in a bright and inspiring style of deep complexity that results in an appearance of less simplicity. Derived from the artistic style of Cartoon Network's brilliant 'Samurai Jack' series for its brilliant use of marks and depth of background, The Secret of Kels creates a constantly affective Celtic world that lives under the shadow of the Viking invasion. <br /> <The story can be intensely inaccurate and the life forms portrayed lack realism, but these facts are absolutely irrelevant when the film is set in a world of fantasy and Celtic-revivalist mysticism. The girl in the forest is a wonderful addition and, in my opinion, makes the image what it is, as it slides from branch to branch. Appearing and disappearing like a mysterious nymph with qualities that look like the legendary Cheshire Cat of Alice and Wonderland. <br /> <br /> The Secret of Kels is a real pleasure. For all genres, all ages, it is a lovely piece of family cinema. <br /> <br /> Do not expect to be impressed, but instead, you will be pleasantly impressed!
