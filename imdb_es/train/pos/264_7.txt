Hickory Dickory Dock was a good mystery of Poirot. I confess that I have not read the book, despite being an avid Agatha Christie fan. The adaptation is not without problems, there were moments when the humor and the brave attempts to do it well, were exaggerated a bit and the events that led to the final solution were hurried. I also thought that there were some slow moments so some of the mysteries felt quilted. However, I loved the way Hickory Dickory Dock filmed, it had a visual style very similar to that of the brilliant ABC Murders, and it really marked the atmosphere, with camera work and dark lighting. The darkest moments were somewhat creepy, this was helped by one of the most disturbing music scores in an adaptation of Poirot, perhaps not as disturbing as One Two Buckle My Shoe, which gave me nightmares. The plot is complex, with all the essential ingredients, although not as complicated as Buckle My Shoe, and somehow that's a good thing. The acting was very good, David Suchet is impeccable (I know I can not use this word forever, but I can not think of a better word to describe his performance in the series) as Poirot, and Phillip Jackson and Pauline Moran do justice. To its integral characters brilliantly. And the students had great personalities and they were well developed in general, particularly Damian Lewis as Leonard. In general, a solid mystery, but it is not among the best. 7.5 / 10 Bethany Cox
