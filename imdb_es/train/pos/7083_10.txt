A great addition to anyone's collection. <br /> <br /> 12 monkeys is a movie you do not see every day. It has excellent actors to accompany an excellent story. This is not a normal role for Bruce Willis, but he has the role as he has John McClane. <br /> <br /> The virus kills everyone on earth and leaves a few hundred survivors. History is not new, but history. adopts a new direction. <br /> <br /> A man (Bruce) is sent on time to get information about a virus that has eliminated most men. <br /> <br /> The actors in this were impressive. I must mention Brad Pitt, who was very funny when the mental patient James Cole (Bruce) is in a psychiatric hospital. <br /> <br /> The director did an incredible job of giving us a disturbing picture of a future devastated by a man-made virus. <br /> <br /> The animals seen in the world of the virus made it look like they run the world when humans are driven to underground facilities. <br /> <br /> This movie was excellent and I must see, and it is also essential. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it. <br /> <br /> 10/10
