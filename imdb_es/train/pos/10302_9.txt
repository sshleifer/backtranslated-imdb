This movie is the best movie that Jim Carrey has done. Carrey did not have his usual face doing things in this movie. I was funny and sad at the same time. Carrey played a reporter named Bruce Nolan. Nolan blames God (Morgan Freeman) for everything that goes wrong in his life. Then, God comes down from heaven and gives Bruce his powers. As I said before, Carrey did an excellent job. I also thought that Morgan Freeman and Jennifer Aniston were excellent as actors / supporting actresses. The plot was good because it had many points in the main point. This movie can be fun (Bruce's dog) as well as sad (the "break"). The script worked well, too. I'm glad they made a sequel to this movie. I rate this movie a 9/10.
