I saw this movie with a group of friends and although only two of us left the cinema thinking about how great it was, the others just laughed and commented how stupid it was. Well, that was because you should not take it so seriously, it's basically a movie that makes fun of horror movies and does a very good job ... It seems that there will also be another movie like this, umm ... Scary Movie ?? Well this is Australian, and original !!! Jessica Napier has an excellent performance and Sarah Kants has a bright and defined future in acting! I hope to see more of them. Molly Ringwald was a good move, and Kylie was an even better move. The Impossible Princess was the queen of the screen! I recommend watching this movie, since you will guess until the end the connection with Raffy, Hilary and the movie that was never finished 20 years ago.
