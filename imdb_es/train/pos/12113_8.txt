Usually, I get away from the television movies because of the many ways you know that television movies are five seconds in the picture. This caught my attention because of the unusual title and its somber and well-designed mood that is established from the beginning. While the ever-present rain confirmed my suspicions of a misplaced story (even if it was claimed that it was set in California, the film was largely filmed in a storm from Vancouver, BC), the dark and oppressive exterior perfectly complements the excellent performance of Olmos.
