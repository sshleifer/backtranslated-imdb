['Although the recent replay of a part of Homer&#39;s epic &quot;Troy&quot; with Brad Pitt was once entertaining, &quot;Iphigenia&quot; with the incandescent Irene Pappas is impressive. To unfold in a natural environment with Greek actors who speak their own language gives such authenticity. A casual encounter with this movie in one of DirecTV&#39;s many movie channels kept me interested despite my concentration problems. There is no brightness or &quot;bling&quot; in this movie, only a fabulously rich impeccable story told by actors so real that one feels they are spying on a real family in crisis. I think even Homer, if he really existed, would be proud of this. <br /><br /> JLH']
