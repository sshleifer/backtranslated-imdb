['Especially in a time when not much science fiction was filmed (1973), this is a fantastic vision of a future in which everything went wrong. Too many people, and nothing works. The only people who can live comfortably are the rich. It&#39;s set in New York in 2022 (I think), and it reminds you of your worst view of Calcutta. <br /><br /> I could appreciate the performance of Charlton Heston after seeing him in Touch of Evil, by Orson Welles. It was (maybe it is) able to portray a range of heroic or semi-heroic people. Here, he is torn between being a policeman who is just a little corrupt (taking away the rich rare food treats) and being totally corrupt (actively conduding evil). <br /><br /> The movie seems to take place at night, and the sweat drips from everyone, except in one of the rare air-conditioned apartments. Although I had not seen it before, I knew the famous ending (which will not be revealed here), but the end is certainly announced. <br /><br /> Great scenes with Edward G. Robinson: go to the council (formed by Jewish elders with strong accents, so it seems), where the truth is revealed. And then go to the Thanatopsis to review. <br /><br /> Gritty, dystopian science fiction pre-Star Wars.']
