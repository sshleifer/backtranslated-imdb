Dumbland is not for everyone. In fact, Dumbland might not be for anyone, except Lynch, and that's what makes it fun and a collective caricature. Violent? Yes. Blasphemy? Yes. Absurd? Yes. A piece of garbage? Never. Dumbland is a wonderful image of some Americans who do not have brains and beat their wife and children for fun. From Mexico I can say that I love it! My favorite episodes are: 1- My teeth are bleeding, all the noise and violence make me want to scream and get behind my bed. 2- Get the stick! Yes, baby, take it and learn a lesson: some people will never be grateful for your actions. 3- Ants. The most Lynch episode of all, music, surrealism and a very sweet revenge ...
