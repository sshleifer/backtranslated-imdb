Interestingly, this version of OPEN YOUR EYES is more mature and more nuanced. Helped in retrospect, Crowe's script is much tighter and more complete than Amenabar's original. The Spanish filmmaker should get credit for thinking about history first, but there is no doubt that Crowe has improved it, even if it is a little bit. Note that you have no idea what lead did in OPEN YOUR EYES, but you know almost everything about lead in VANILLA SKY. That's what I mean by more "developed".
