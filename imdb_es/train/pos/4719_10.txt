This movie is the reason why I found this website. I could not find this movie anywhere else! I am very happy to have found you here! We've seen it on television before and we desperately wanted to find it and buy it and have several friends interested in buying it. Another poster commented that it was boring, although I must say that it is NOT. Especially if you are a horse, you will love this movie. The horses are impressive, well trained and the movie is well done. Without a doubt, it is one that we will buy for our DVD library for home. We will recommend it to our friends. The bond between man and horse in this film was very inspiring and made you want to spend more time with your horses. This is certainly a movie that we will see several times.
