The beautiful story of Stardust is written by Neil Gaiman (writer of MirrorMask) and is really a good story. I think it would attract any fan of Labyrinth, Princess Bride or 10th Kingdom, but it's totally unique and stands out on its own. And I feel that the film adaptation of this story has a much better ending than what was presented in the original novel by Neil Gaiman. I will not spoil it for you. <br /> <br /> The main character, Tristan (Tristran in the novel), is the son of a mortal and a fairy slave held by a witch in the realm of fairies. The story begins in a city near a wall that separates the magical world from the human world. When there is a shooting star, Tristan promises to recover it for a girl he is in love with. Ignore that the star has taken the form of a girl in the world of fairies and that there are others behind it too. Three old witches who want to use their hearts to be young again, and some princes who fight. <br /> <br /> It's a very good story. It has humor and magic and beautiful, surreal scenes and visuals. It is charming and I feel it can be seen by children and adults of all ages. It is simply magical. It's a true classic fairy tale, like the one I had not seen in movies since the eighties.
