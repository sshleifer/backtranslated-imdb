I come to Pinjar from a completely different background to that of most other reviewers who have posted here. I am relatively new in Bollywood films and I was born and raised in the United States. So I do not have a broad base to compare Pinjar with other Indian movies. Fortunately, no comparison is needed. <br /> <br /> Pinjar stands alone as nothing more than a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> In one line I can say that Pinjar is one of the most important. Movies to leave any studio anywhere and anytime. On a massive appeal scale, * could * have been the Indian equivalent of "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" if it had been properly promoted in the US. UU This could very well have been the movie that put Bollywood on the American map. The American public going to the movies has a long love story with "Gone With the Wind," and although Pinjar does not borrow that argument, there are some passing similarities. No less important than the whopping (by US standards) 183 minutes long. <br /> <br /> In the sandy context of the India-Pakistan partition in 1947-48 it is a convincing human drama of a young man A woman imprisoned by circumstances and involved in problems that she did not have the hand to create. Located in an untenable position, somehow manages to not only survive, but also to grow and even flourish. <br /> <br /> If the story lacks in any way, it's in the exhibition. The growth of Puro (the protagonist) as a person would be better illustrated, at least for Western audiences who are not familiar with Indian culture, if the "background story" of his character was more developed in the first part of the film. But that would have extended a movie from 3 hours to 3 1/2 hours or even more. Because not a single minute of the film is wasted, and nothing that managed to get out of the edition could be cut for the sake of time. Better that the audience have to complete something that came before leaving aside what is left. <br /> <br /> I could use many words to describe Pinjar: "touching", "disturbing", "convincing", "heartbreaking" comes to mind immediately. But "elevate" is perhaps as appropriate as any of those. Any story that points out the indomitable ability of the human spirit against the worst odds should be considered as such. And the triumph of Puro, although possibly not immediately evident to those around her, is no less than inspiring. Just for the strength of the story, I can not recommend this movie enough. <br /> <br /> Equally inspiring is the performance of Puro de Urmila Matondkar. Too often overlooked in the middle of the youngest and newest group of actresses, Urmila has the unique ability to offer a completely credible character in whatever role she plays. She is not limited to acting as part of Puro, but gives life to the character. The selection of Manoj Bajpai as Rashid was inspired. He manages something that very few heroes of Indian cinema can: subtlety. His mastery of expression and nuance is essential for the role. It brings more threat to the first part of the film with its penetrating gaze than all the troublemakers armed with combined swords. <br /> <br /> If you only see a Bollywood movie in your life, do it Pinjar.
