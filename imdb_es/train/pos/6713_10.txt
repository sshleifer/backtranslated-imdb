I liked this TV show because it was something that a girl who is on her sixteenth birthday learns that she is a witch and that she lives with her aunts in the house and that both are witches as well. Well, this took a few weeks to get used to. When he used his powers for the first time, it was very funny because he turned his enemy into a pineapple. He had to return the time and repeat a day. This series is really great and it's a typical teen series, but it was sold out when she moved from her house to an apartment with her fellow college friends and then it got boring and I stopped seeing her. He loved his aunts, they were very funny. And the other one was really luxurious. She loved Valerie and hated Libby, Sabrina's enemy, she was ugly.
