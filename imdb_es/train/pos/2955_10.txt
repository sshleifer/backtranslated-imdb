There is a certain charm that I have always found when discovering the great (semi) unknown film. These discoveries have almost always been dramatic films: in my experience, unknown science fiction, action and horror are unknown for very, very good reasons. I found "High Tide" in a video at a junkyard, mixed with countless dozens of different quality tapes. Of course, that is the only place where I would find it, since it is not yet on DVD. <br /> <br /> While I was watching Judy Davis (as Lillie) throughout this movie, I was somewhat sure that I was watching a great undiscovered performance. Yes, I had previously seen Davis in several small parts, and a leading role in "A Passage to India." But, although it was excellent in the film mentioned above, "High Tide" is a completely different animal. Since I recently saw Gillian Armstrong's film, "Charlotte Gray," I was very aware of the type of actress that impresses her. Davis draws much more than a passing resemblance to Cate Blanchett, both in his manner and in his sensibility. <br /> <br /> The performance of Judy Davis is impressive, I can not say enough about that. She shares an incredible relationship on screen with the young Claudia Karvan (as Ally), the other great actress of this film. There is a lot of drama and quiet humanity that you share together, whose details I will not presume to reveal here (see for yourself!). There is too good in "High tide" to cover in a single revision. In fact, I would not mind, the movie speaks well enough by itself. In conclusion, I would like to congratulate the screenwriter Laura Jones for her amazing dialogue, the director Gillian Armstrong for her understanding of the actors, and the great Russell Boyd for his brilliant and discreet cinematography (see his work in "Tender Mercies").
