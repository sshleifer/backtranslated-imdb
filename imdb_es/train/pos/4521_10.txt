Julie Waters is always wonderful, but Adrian Pasdar is a positive revelation in this ironic comedy about a transvestite who can not repress his obsession and the changes he experiences when they discover him. It infallibly avoids vulgar and scandalous jokes for genuine ingenuity and true intuition, and has an absolute ball while doing it. A very nice comedy, discreet and pleasant.
