All good films "inspire" some film of direct video copy. I was afraid that "Gladiator" was not really a good movie, because I had not seen any film that remotely resembled something Roman on the shelves of new releases for months. Then I saw the last offer of Full Moon, Demonicus. I'm a fan of Full Moon Moon, and Blood Dolls, but I've never seen one of his puppet movies that did not kill. Anyway ... <br /> <br /> Demonicus tells what happens to a group of campers in the mountains of the Alps. James, one of the campers, finds a cave with old gladiator artifacts and feels compelled to remove a helmet from a corpse and try it. He becomes possessed and, like the demonic gladiator Tyrant, he is forced to kill his friends to revive the corpse, which is the true Tyrant. <br /> <br /> Of course, like many Full Moon movies, this has little or nothing. budget. Sometimes the editing and management were so unprofessional that I would swear I was watching the Blair Witch Project. The attempts to cut limbs and heads remind me of a Monty Python sketch. The weapons, although apparently real, seem really plastic. Literally, it seems that this was filmed by a group of friends with a digital camcorder for a weekend. Of course, there is nothing wrong with this type of shooting, just do not rent this waiting for a technical masterpiece. It seems that there were also research attempts for the script, because, although Tyrannus does not really act like a gladiator until the end, at least he speaks Latin. <br /> <br /> Putting all the garbage aside, I really enjoyed this movie. Maybe not as much as a murderous puppet movie, but the Full Moon is still delivered! The only thing that disappointed me was that there was not a Full Moon Video Zone at the end!
