I'm a jerk for movies like this. Movies that give you back and allow you to relive your childhood. I am an adult now and I have many responsibilities such as a mortgage, children, dogs, a wife and many others. I enjoy my life, but it is not as innocent and carefree as when I was twelve years old. Mike Binder's Indian summer knows it and explores it as if he were twelve years old. It brings you back to a time when life was simpler and much more fun. It brings you back to a time when worrying about your first kiss and asking if you could finish the marathon at the camp were important issues. Indian Summer is a fantastic movie and should be seen at least once a year so you can relax and laugh ... and remember. <br /> <br /> Movie stars Kevin Pollak, Bill Paxton, Diane Lane and Matt Craven (to name a few) as childhood friends who have been summoned back to Camp Tamakwa by their former Chief Camp Counselor, Uncle Lou. Uncle Lou is perfectly interpreted by Alan Arkin. He is a type of person who is the patriarch of the group. He also knows everything and embraces the true spirit of a father figure and someone who understands the simple things in life. He finds it difficult to relate to the children of today who need a Walkman that makes their ears ring when they are in a place of immense beauty like Tamakwa. This is a camp that has elk wandering around the camp, leaving changing colors that God gave them and water for what the eye can see. Uncle Lou longs for the days of yesteryear and asks his former campers to return to the camp to see that one of them will take over the camp. While they are all together again, we can see their trials and tribulations and perhaps a new love may arise between them. <br /> <br /> When the adults return to the camp, it does not take long before they act like the children again as the typical jokes of the field are played again. They take the toilet paper from the stalls, put toothpaste in sleeping bags, etc. All this is done hilariously and with actors like Pollak and Paxton, they are very funny things. <br /> <br /> But beyond hilarity, we can explore some very real adult emotions that anyone can relate to. In one of my favorite scenes, Kevin Pollak and Elizabeth Perkins have a view of a bay where they used to go canoeing when they were children. Pollak can not forget how small everything looks and Perkins finally tells him that the bay did not get smaller, it just got bigger. Do not hammer the point at home, but do it subtly. We all grow, we all move forward and, unfortunately, we can not live like we did 20 years ago. The more things change, the more they stay the same. <br /> <br /> Indian Summer is a character-based film and is beautifully written by Mike Binder, who actually attended Camp Camp Tamakwa, (like Sam Raimi, who played Stick in the movie) and are his vivid and loving memories of their experiences that feed the movie. There are many touching scenes and also many hilarious ones. Both are perfect. <br /> <br /> I love this movie. I love everything and it's a true hidden gem. <br /> <br /> 10/10
