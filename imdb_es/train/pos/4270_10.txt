Ko to tamo peva is the best comedy of all time. Believe me, I saw many movies and comedies, but tell me which one makes you smile every time you see it. But the truth is that the humor in this comedy is special. It is caratherisic for Serbian. And the whole old republic of Yugoslavia knows it very well! So I think the rest of the audience (for example: In Europe) can not enjoy it that much. Because the subtitles ruin the hole. But at least they should try! Yes, it's ironic! This is the best movie in Serbian history and the world does not understand it! :-) If you have the opportunity to see it, it did not explode well!
