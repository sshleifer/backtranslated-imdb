I think this movie is a masterpiece, but it cost me at least 4 or 5 times to see it, to realize how fantastic this movie was. First, it describes a face of World War II that we do not normally see in Hollywood movies. In particular, the German soldiers, the army and the Nazi government are more "humanized". One of the things that impressed me most was the mention, at the end of the film, of a murder that happened in a forest in the last 20 years ... that forest is the place where the final chapters of Berlin Alexanderplatz take place: those are the forests where Reinhold kills Mieze. Another track for those who like the details, is the representation of the doors. Fassbinder is obsessed with the changes in people every time they cross a door or a door opens. Many doors are shown on the screen, open and closed. And the characters change in their personality, their acts, etc. at any time that happens. Have you noticed that?
