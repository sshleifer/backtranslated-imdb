"Hare Conditioned" by Chuck Jones is a fast-paced and often hilarious caricature. Facing Bugs Bunny against a strange manager of a yellow leather apartment store who wants to have it full, 'Hare Conditioned' makes the most of its multi-use environment. The pursuit takes Bugs and his pursuer through a variety of departments, leading to a gag-inspired emergence that quickly emerges from various departments that carry all the clothing associated with that part of the store. However, this great joke is surpassed by a truly inspired sequence that involves elevators in which Bugs, disguised as an elevator boy, tricks the store manager to relentlessly climb or descend the elevators at the wrong time. . It is a brilliant climatic piece that unfortunately gives way to a final gag not very funny. By then, however, 'Hare Conditioned' has left its mark as one of the great chase movies, brimming with wild energy. As Bugs was becoming more refined in some of the other cartoons of this period, 'Hare Conditioned' proved that he could still be as attractive as a more anarchic character.
