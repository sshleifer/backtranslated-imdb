It is ironic that during the 1950s, when Douglas Sirk had his biggest success in terms of audience appeal, he was virtually ignored by critics. However, he is now seen as a director of formidable intellect who achieved his best work in melodrama. <br /> <br /> "Written in the Wind" is the fall of a Texas oil dynasty surrounded by a worthless reputation, alcoholism and nymphomania? Is it about the twisted and fatal connections between sex, power and money ... <br /> <br /> Stack draws a convincing portrait of a tormented drunk destroyed by frustration, arrogance, jealousy, madness and some deep insecurities? ? <br /> <br /> Dorothy Malone is successful as an attractive woman with an excessive sexual appetite, degrading herself for Hudson and other members of the city? His best phrase: "I'm dirty." In a frantic scene, we see her trembling, shaking and sweating at a provocative mambo? In another weeping only about an oil derrick model on his father's desk, symbol of excessive wealth and male tyranny. <br /> <br /> The frenetic atmosphere becomes pleasant and intensified by the magnificent use of Sirk colors and lights. , and the careful use of mirrors ??
