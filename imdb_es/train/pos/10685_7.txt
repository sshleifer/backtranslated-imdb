This movie has a clear story, which is quite unusual for the musical genre. "Cats", "Phantom of the Opera", and other musicals by Andrew Lloyd Webber can be considered metaphorical, since they use literary works as a framework. The story of "Biarkan Bintang Menari" (BBM) touches the core of human relations, especially that of the Indonesians. Although the film was based on a "supposedly" fairy tale, it is actually a fantasy of the "child" in Indonesian adults. The dance sequences are not perfect, but the songs represent how the Indonesians express themselves. I believe that the choreographer should explore the form of Indonesian dancing, by not discouraging the fact that the development of Indonesian dance tends to be more westernized. The dance sequences seem awkward in some way and are not synchronized with the songs and / or the music. However, I still love this film and consider it a new wave of Indonesian film genres that I hope to improve in the future.
