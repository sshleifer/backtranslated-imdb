Spoilers! Classic 70's sex trash! The Swedish girl (Helga) was what made this movie so great. It was beautiful, but what really impressed me was how sexual it was. She exuded massive amounts of sexuality throughout the film. Her best scenes were when she, er, stimulated herself. Every time she was on the screen, I was paralyzed. <br /> <br /> In addition, Dr. Julia (sister of the foolish men in the film) was very interesting visually. Although most 12-year-old girls have bigger breasts than Julia, I knew how to use what little I had and her scenes (especially the scenes with the silk blouse and the black skirt) also caught my attention without flinching. You also loved the great scene of madness where the bats stripped their nekkid; I do not know if I've ever seen anything more ridiculous but sexy at the same time. Classic things!
