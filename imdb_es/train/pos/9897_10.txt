Okay, I'm sorry, but I loved this movie. I love the whole 80s genre of this kind of movies, because you do not see many like this anymore! I want to ask all of you who say that this movie is just a scam, or a cheesy imitation, what is it imitating? I've never seen another movie like this, well, no horror either. <br /> <br /> Basically it's the popular group at school, who likes to make everyone live hell, so they decided to get involved in this. nerdy guy named marty He turns fatal when he really feels hurt by one of his little jokes. <br /> <br /> So, it's like 10 years later, and the group of friends that hurt Marty started receiving high school reunion letters. But ... they are the only ones who receive them! So they go back to the old school, and one by one they are impressed by ....... Yes, they probably know what happens! <br /> <br /> The only part that disappointed me was the end. It could have been left, or thought better. <br /> <br /> I think you should try, and try not to be critical! <br /> <br /> ~ * ~ CupidGrl ~ * ~
