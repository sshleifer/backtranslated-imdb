Let Braik make a good show. Finally, he and Zorak are living their own lives outside Spac Ghost Coast To Coast. I have to say that I love these two shows very much. They are completely what Adult Swim started. Brak got big with an album that came out in the year 2000. It may not have been platinum, but his show was very popular with thousands of people who love Adult Swims shows. I have to say that of all Adult Swim programs without an argument, this has to be the one that has never done the most plot. That's why I like it so much, it's a classic in the history of Adult Swim. I think this is a great show, if you do not like it. Hey, there were tons who hated it and tons who loved it.
