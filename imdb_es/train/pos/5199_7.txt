This is not only a great African-American classic comedy, but also one of the great classic works of the American cult. I recently purchased the edition of the Rudy Ray Moore collection. If you love karate movies and old school black comedies, this is for you! They do not make movies like these anymore. All my family is fond of movies, so this site is a great help to resolve many debates. I'm deployed in Iraq right now. This helps me to be connected with the world that I know in the states. Thanks IMDb. I recommend this site to all my friends. Dolemite rules! Do not just take my word, check it yourself. Ten lines is a lot to comment on a movie, I think, but if you focus, I'm in favor!
