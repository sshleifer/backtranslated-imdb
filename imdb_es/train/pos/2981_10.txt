Why the fuck is this movie so low? I've seen this movie more than 25 times, I know EVERY line of this movie. It is obvious that I love this movie. Trey Parker and Matt Stone (creators of South Park and the new puppet masterpiece Team America) star Joe Cooper, or Coop "Airman" Cooper, and Doug Remer, or "Sir Swish." They are mainly known as Coop and Remer throughout the film. Just when the film begins, it reminds us of the corrupt and money-hungry world of sports that are overpaid, even inventing one called "Townsell". I must quote this part of the film, since it is true with some sporting beginnings: "And after playing for New England, San Diego, Huston, Saint Louis, one year for the Arganauts of Toronto, plus one season as the best in the Desert Inn, I'm happy to finally play here in the beautiful city of Miami. " Your agent is leaning over: "Minnesota." Let's not forget this important piece of the movie. So it starts that Coop and Remer are at a high school reunion party and they realize they are still nothing while they talk to their former classmates. Outside, they create the BASEketball sport after being challenged by what were probably the heroes of high school basketball. After embarrassing them, the sport becomes professional in about a year. During this time, they manage to recruit their third teammate, Squeak, which is actually a day after they invent the game. As the film continues, we discover that Coop, Remer and Squeak are the only virtuous heroes of the sport that remain. The story continues with the blackmail, the cheerleaders of Milwaukee Beers and the absurd humor that will make you cry for more. Look at it, it's hilarious.
