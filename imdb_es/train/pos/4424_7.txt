As incredible as it sounds, Gojoe is a samurai action movie inspired by anime and Hong Kong with a pacifist message. This ankle of the film is effectively portrayed through the protagonist (a great work of interpretation performed by Daisuke Ryu), an assassin turned monk-benk√≠. Benkei has sworn he will never kill again, but he still takes the sword to fight what he believes is an invasion of demons ... <br /> <br /> Gojoe is a difficult movie to rate. The visual images are incredibly elaborate and beautiful, but they use too many tricks (camera in circles and high speed units, expressionist shots, colors of leeches, digital effects, etc.), so the end result is somewhat exhausting. That said, the beginning and end of the film are elegant and powerful at the same time. If only the director Sogo Ishii would have been wise enough not to abuse his bag of tricks. <br /> <br /> Another problem with Gojoe is the amount of violence. For a film with such a violent message, Gojoe spends too much energy and time on the screen to represent the endless battle scenes. Furthermore, the way in which violence is shown is always on the verge of being self-indulgent; In fact, a shower of blood against the night sky seems to be one of the images of the firm. Luckily, Ishii is wise enough to show the ugly and tragic side of violence. However, it seems that Ishii is not sure if he is making a traditional action movie or a deeply moral allegory. The public can not be sure of this either until the end of the film. The powerful (though cynical) ending is what saves Gojoe; It clearly emphasizes that this film is more than just a gore-fest.
