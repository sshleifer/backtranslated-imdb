I really liked that movie. I thought it would be easy to see and easy to forget. I ran after seeing this to buy the DVD, obviously not easily forgotten! <br /> <br /> The script is brilliant and the casting could not be more perfect. Each character has its moment, and I laughed heartily throughout this movie, the comic moment was perfect. <br /> <br />
