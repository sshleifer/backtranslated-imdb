This is the best and most original show seen in years. The more I see him, the more I fall in love with him. The cast is excellent, the writing is great. Personally I like all the characters. However, there is a favorite character for everyone, as there is a good mix of personalities and origins as in real life. I think ABC has done a bad service to the writers, actors and the potential audience of this program, to cancel so quickly and not publicize it enough, or give it a real chance to get followers. There are so few programs that I see since most of the television is horrible. This show in my opinion was up to my favorites, Anatomy of the Grays and Brothers and Sisters. In fact, I think the same audience for the Brothers and the Sisters would love this show if they knew. Why do the losing programs always get so much extra time and the winning programs with great potential are always discarded immediately? I'm so sick of reality shows that I do not see any of them. It was so refreshing to have a new idea for a show and then hire excellent actors, this show had many promises. The recent episode was the best so far, since everyone has really started to participate and make the show so real. Please see this program in the ABC video and let ABC know that you want to recover this program. PLEASE SIGN THE ONLINE PETITION TO ABC: http://www.PetitionOnline.com/gh1215/petition.html
