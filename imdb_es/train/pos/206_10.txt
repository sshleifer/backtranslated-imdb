I'm 14, so you probably think I've never heard of George Burns or Walter Matthau or someone like that. You're wrong I heard that George Burns was in this movie and he won an Academy Award for it. I've been a fan of George Burns since I was ten years old. I watched the movie Oh, God recently and I loved it. This was also very impressive. George Burns did a great job. So did Walter Matthau (this is the first time I've seen him perform). And even though they had very small roles, Phyllis Diller and Steve Allen did a good job. That special they were filming would have been great if it had really been done. Let me tell you, if you're a George Burns or Walter Matthau fan, you should see this movie right away!
