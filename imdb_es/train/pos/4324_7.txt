You do not need to read this review. <br /> <br /> A previous review, conducted by Seattle pninson, has already identified all the major deficiencies of this production. I can only expand on its basic arguments. <br /> <br /> Bleak House was a relatively late Dickens novel and is much darker than its previous work. This is taken too literally by the director, Ross Devenish, who accumulates too much in the dark and fog. When Ada, Rick and Esther appear, half an hour after the opening episode, it's a relief to be in the light of day for the first time. In some of the murky scenes it was difficult to see what was really on my TV screen. I saw everything in one day, beginning in the middle of the afternoon. As the daylight faded, this became a minor problem, but I have a pretty good TV and I have never encountered this problem at any time of the day before. <br /> <br /> The rhythm is very deliberate (ie slow). I'm sure this was intensive, but it's exaggerated. There are numerous shots of people walking through the mud and gloom of Victorian London that stay longer than necessary to establish the atmosphere and atmosphere. A good editor could probably take several minutes of each fifty-minute episode, without losing a line of dialogue, just slightly cropping each of these scenes. <br /> <br /> I do not want to exaggerate these two problems. Soon you adjust to the aspect and rhythm of this production. The most important issue is that he does not always tell the story very effectively. The first Dickens novels are as long as Bleak House, but they are not so intricately drawn. For example, I recently re-read Nicholas Nickleby because I was intrigued to see how Douglas McGrath put an 800-page book into his two-hour movie. The answer is simple: the book is full of stuffing. McGrath cut large swaths of the novel while retaining all the essential elements of the story. This would not be possible with Bleak House. <br /> <br /> This production needs its seven hours. Probably, it needs even more time, because many elements of its complicated plot are not clear enough, or well managed, as they should be. A few random examples will illustrate the problems. <br /> <br /> The maid, Rosa, appears out of nowhere with no record, so Lady Dedlock's bond with her is largely unmotivated. <br /> <br /> The acquiescence of Sergeant George In the Tulkinhorn claim, a sign of Horton's writing is somewhat false. <br /> <br /> It is not sufficiently clear that Esther is really in love with Woodcourt when she agrees to marry John Jarndyce. It is also not clear that they have agreed not to announce their commitment, or why. <br /> <br /> The secret marriage of Ada and Rick is omitted. In an episode they are simply lovers, in the next, people suddenly refer to them as husband and wife. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Rouncewell only appears at a late stage in history and Sargeant George's departure from his family remains unexplained, as are the means by which they discover it. <br /> <br /> Tulkinhorn's dedication to maintaining the honor and respectability of the Dedlock family is underestimated, so his motive for chasing Lady Dedlock is darker than he needs to be. <br /> <br /> The participation of brick makers with Tom and (later) Lady Dedlock is somewhat opaque. <br /> <br /> It is not obvious that Guppy renews his offer to Esther because she The scars of smallpox have almost disappeared. <br /> <br /> This is just a selection: there are others. They are not major problems and the main thrust of the story is clear enough. However, they are minor irritations that detract from their power: they should not have to be confused with small points in the plot. However, there are more important structural problems that weaken history in its later stages. <br /> <br /> The whole Tulkinhorn murder affair has been dismissed. Bucket immediately points to Hortense as a suspect, which undermines the suspense of Sergeant George's situation and the importance of finding Mrs. Rouncewell. It also diminishes the impact of the secondary plot in which the suspicion is cast on Lady Dedlock and weakens the scene in which Hortense is unmasked in front of Sir Lester. <br /> <br /> A more serious problem is that the murder, his investigation and the subsequent search for Lady Dedlock dominate the story for more than an hour, during which time we lose sight of the other main plot: the legal case and its effect on Rick. Their poor finances, their awkwardness on the part of Vholes and Skimpole, Ada's desperation, her declining health, etc., remain in suspense throughout an episode. This may be how Dickens wrote the book (I have not read it for years), but a good script should make the different lines of the plot move together. <br /> <br /> Finally, Smallweed's role in the story is so diminished. Which is almost superfluous. His discovery of the new will, which triggers the final phase of history, is also discarded. It happens outside the screen. <br /> <br /> Despite all this, it is still a very good production. Many of the performances are outstanding. The individual scenes are beautifully done. His accumulated sense of tragedy is very powerful. I would still recommend it as a magnificent adaptation of a great book, if it had not been for the 2005 production. In fact, I probably would not be aware of its shortcomings if I had not seen how Andrew Davies did better. I have been critical of Davies Jane Austen's adaptations, but I must admit that he really knows how to tame Dickens's extensive books. <br /> <br /> This is an awesome and exciting drama and it's worth seven hours of anyone's time. However, its probable fate should be considered primarily as a cross-reference to the almost definitive version of 2005.
