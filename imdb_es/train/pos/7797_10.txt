"Ruby in Paradise" is a beautiful story of maturity about a young woman, Ruby Lee Gissing, who escapes from her asphyxiating roots to become herself. Although the main character is played artistically by the beautiful Ashley Judd, probably in her first role in the film, although she feels very proud, the emphasis is not on becoming "someone", at least on the next Madonna (either the mother Jesus or the singer, hungry and hungry for attention). <br /> <br /> Instead, he emphasizes the following instincts and shows himself introspective about them, to become the ideal and adult self. NOTE: This is not an action movie! He uses an occasional voice-over narration (by Mrs. Judd) as he writes in his journal, and oh, I see that I just lost the male half of the readers. But be patient with this beautiful film, where we learn that one's happiness can be discovered in ... oh, I do not know, carrying water and chopping wood. <br /> <br /> Actor / director / writer Todd Field, who played Nick Nightingale in "Eyes Wide Shut," stars Ruby Lee's noble love interest, one that helps her heal her idea of ​​relationships implanted from youth. <br /> <br /> But even his character is not the answer for Ruby Lee: There is no external hero imposed on her. The final message is that we are responsible for ourselves. The writer / director Victor Núñez, who also wrote / directed "Ulee's Gold", did an incredible job showing a young woman growing in herself, facing the old challenges of good and evil along the way. <br /> <br /> The cast of support is also stellar, and the music used, especially the cuts of the singer Sam Phillips (whom I hear is the wife of T. Bone Burnett), is correct, especially "Trying to cling to the Earth. " "Now, when I hear the first chords of that song, the tears come out of my eyes, Pavlovian and unexpected, without being sure if it's the music or the indelible connection to the calm and charming message of power of the film. <br /> This film is highly recommended for any young person who tries to find their way in. For any woman of any age, it is a must! The drawback: It is NOT on DVD, except in Spanish. (However, we learned that It is legal to make a copy of a VHS version, which can be easily found online.My beloved husband found someone with a copy of VHS and got a copy on DVD for me.) Although this treasure of a movie once When it appears in the air? In an indie channel, usually? You can not count on that when you need it most as a tonic to soothe the pressures of the world.So buy a copy for you. <br /> <br / > This movie should have a r important breakthrough, and I would, if I were the Queen of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> - Figgy Jones
