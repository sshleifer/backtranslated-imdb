The technique of De Palma had reached its high maturity at the time of this film, which is a wonderful showcase of its classical techniques, although, unfortunately, as in many of the films written by De Palma himself, the story serves the goal more than to the interests of presenting an emotionally compelling story. <br /> <br /> The story begins with a LOCA scene in which Angie Dickinson masturbates in a shower while watching her husband. Then they grab her and rape her while her husband stays nearby, without realizing it, and everything is revealed to be Angie's fantasy, since her husband pumps her without thinking about her. She has a short scene with her son, a dead bell for Harry Potter, which concludes with a joke that "will tell the grandmother that he is playing with his Peter". Then he goes to his therapy session, where he complains about his dead marriage, before trying to seduce his therapist, Michael Caine. He refuses, and she is hurt and feels unattractive and dissatisfied. <br /> <br /> Then a roughness of almost 22 minutes without words begins which is perhaps the highlight of the film. Among the many things that De Palma extracted from Hitchcock is the understanding of cinema as a purely visual means of telling stories. and in the typical style of De Palma, it becomes a way to show his formidable ability. The problem, for me, is that in this case one begins to feel that the scenes are unnecessarily prolonged simply to show more of the director's skill. <br /> <br /> The sequence begins with Angie in an art museum. Observe strangers, all involved in sexual or family activities, and then begin to fall in love with a man sitting next to him. De Palma very cleverly tells an extremely complicated narrative without a single word about the attraction, the embarrassment, the withdrawal of Angie and, finally, find and present the stranger in the back of a taxi, all set for a wonderfully exuberant score. from Pino Donaggio, who also scored Carrie. <br /> <br /> In the second part of the sequence, Angie has slept with the boy and gets up to go back to her husband. Once again, De Palma gets a ton of narrative without uttering a word of dialogue, since Angie realizes that she does not have her panties, that her husband is already at home and no doubt wonders where she is, that she has probably contracted a venereal disease. , and that she has lost her engagement ring somewhere in the confusion. Everything is very admirable, but one begins to feel a little nervous as we are forced to do things like take a long elevator ride from the seventh floor and then go back up, almost in real time. <br /> <br /> ... Spoilers from now on! When Angie reaches the seventh floor again, she is killed by a large woman with blond hair. The woman pushes her away until she reaches the ground floor, when the door opens and Nancy Allen sees her there. There is a wonderful slow motion sequence when Nancy arrives at the elevator, Angie approaches her and the killer's sword is held to cut Nancy's hands. Then follow some electrifying shots as Nancy looks up and sees the killer in the convex mirror of the elevators. Everything is fine, and by the time we have a new dialogue, you think; "Woah, it was only 22 minutes in a row of purely visual narrative!" Or maybe not, but I do. <br /> <br /> A young Dennis Franz has a large part as a tough New York detective who prefers everyone else to do their job for him. Interview with Michael Caine, making the outrageous implication (although it happens as a commonplace) that Angie WANTS to kill her. Angie's son is also there, and he hooks up with Nancy, and they set out to spy on Caine's therapist and find out who the killer is. <br /> <br /> Once again, there is a strong relationship with a Hitchcock movie. , in this case Psycho (just like Obsession is a reworking of Vertigo). There is a woman who is supposed to understand that she is secretly a bitch, who dies in the first 30 minutes in a closed space, in this case an elevator instead of a shower. Then, the relatives of the deceased carry out an investigation, which reveals that the murderer is a man who dresses like a woman to kill. De Palma even launches a doctor at the end that explains the psychology of the whole affair. <br /> <br /> It's very interesting, but at the same time a viewer can start to feel a little nervous, and that is my main reservation about this movie. It is definitely essential to see and exhibit some of the best De Palma sets, but the feeling that the story is running in a solid third place behind the need for De Palma to show up and his somewhat unseemly sexual fantasies make it difficult to look back on this. wholeheartedly. <br /> <br /> --- Take a look at other comments on my bad and cheesy movie website, Cinema de Merde, cinemademerde.com
