This film is one of the very few Indian films, which would never fade with the passage of time, nor will its bewitching appeal diminish, even as Indian cinema transforms into the abyss of artificial-style pop culture, while the oriented extras towards the exercise they take to improve the PT songs of the movie style. <br /> <br /> The cinematography talks about the excellent skills of Josef Werching that accentuate the monumental and cinematographic effect of the film in its entirety. <br /> <br /> Gone are the days of A Great Cinema, when each scene had to be cropped many times and taken again before finalizing it, while paying meticulous attention to the elaboration and editing of the scenes. Some of her moving scenes are full of sublime emotional intensity, as in the case where Meena Kumari refuses to say "YES" as an approval for Nikah (marriage link) and climbs the hill while going crazy in a traumatized frenzy. At this moment, Raj Kumar follows her, and a strong gale of wind blew Kumari's veil and on Kumar's legs ........ <br /> <br /> Kamal Amrohi will always be remembered with Words of Gold in the annals of the history of Indian cinema to try to complete this film in a record setting of 12 years. He had to manage the filming of some of the vital songs without the close-ups of Meena, because Meena Kumari, the lady in the lead role, was sick and struggled for her life in early 1971.
