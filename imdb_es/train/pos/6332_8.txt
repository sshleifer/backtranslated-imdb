This movie is good for TV. I like it because I'm a big fan of disaster films, although this is a family movie. The precision in the film of the book is half and half. They had the names of the right characters, but in the book there was no storm chaser, the scene of the car involving the Hatch family fleeing the tornado was not in the book. Involved Dan Hatch and his friend riding with a police officer on their way to the police station for their safety. and in the book, Dan and his friend are 12 years old. That is all I can think. Overall, this was a good movie, although it could have been a bit more accurate for the book. Did you know that the book was based on a true story of a series of tornadoes that devastated a small city in Nebraska in 1980?
