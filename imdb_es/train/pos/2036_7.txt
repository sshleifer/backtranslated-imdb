- LITTLE SPOILER HERE! - <br /> <br /> When I looked at the "Creep" votes today, I was surprised by the number of IMDb users who rated this movie "1". I wonder: what do people expect from this type of movie? Are there so many people watching a movie without knowing anything about it? <br /> <br /> "Creep" is a HORROR movie and it's pretty good. This means automatically: it has an absurd story full of holes, scandalous dangers and simple characters on one side only. So, why complain? Just take some popcorn and coke, feel comfortable in your seat and then ... ... enjoy the fear of dying! The first 60 minutes, when there is nothing but Kate and a lonely subway station, are incredibly frightening. There is suspense and fear in every corner of the screen and you will give a few jerks just because of the sudden sound of a neon lamp flashing in the back of you. (In my opinion, the sound editor did the best job in this movie). <br /> <br /> When Kate meets her pursuer, the quality of the film falls but it still does not turn into a bad movie. The second part of the film is not scary at all, but the bloody effects are well done and the story is pretty well developed. (... as long as you keep in mind that it's a horror movie you're watching, and not the Discovery Channel!) So, if you want to make yourself a very, very frightening hour. Just look at the first hour of "Creep" and then exit the cinema or turn on the TV. You know the rest of the story, right? The bad guy will die and Kate will be the only survivor. But even if you watch this movie until the end, you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> ... and if you want to take the anxiety to the next level, do what I did after watching this movie: Leave the cinema in the dark night, go to the next metro station and take the last one train home ...
