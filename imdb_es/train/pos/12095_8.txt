When the American writer Edgar Allan Poe visits London, he is approached by British journalist Alan Foster, who becomes the target of a peculiar bet. Not believing Poe's claim that all his macabre stories have been based on real experience, Foster accepts a bet from Poe and his friend Sir Thomas Blackwood that he can not spend a whole night in the enchanted castle of Blackwood. Once installed in the abandoned castle, Foster discovers that he is not alone, as he is approached by several beautiful women and handsome men, and a doctor of metaphysics, who explains that they are all lost souls, damn to repeat the stories of their deaths on The anniversary of their deaths! The first time I saw this glorious piece of classic horror, I was fascinated all the time. I found the movie really spooky and at the same time sad. Babs Steele is undeniably beautiful. The musical score makes the atmosphere twice as terrifying. The topless scene threw me into a loop, since I did not expect it. It seems that Synapse did a great job with improving the image, because this movie looks great for its age, and it's the Uncut International version, to boot. This is the movie responsible for starting a collection of Babs Steele and Klaus Kinski.
