['Moonwalker probably is not the movie to see if you&#39;re not a fan of Michael Jackson. I&#39;m a big fan and I enjoyed most of the movie, the ending was not fantastic, but the first 50 minutes were, if you&#39;re a fan. <br /><br /> Personally I think that the first 50 minutes can be seen many times again. The dance in each video is impressive, the fantastic music to listen and the entertaining dialogue. <br /><br /> It includes many of his best Bad videos and excerpts from his previous videos. It also includes some images of live concerts. <br /><br /> If you are a big fan of Michael Jackson, this is a must, if you are not a fan or do not like Michael Jackson, be very clear. <br /><br /> 9/10']
