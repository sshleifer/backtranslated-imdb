Basically, this movie is one of those weird movies you hate and you think the borders of suicide are the best you can do instead of having to sit for two hours. Or, as in my case, you see it as a success of Kult, one of those movies in which the humor, the plot, the acting, are actually very hidden, but for those of us who are willing to go and look for him, trusting well in the director. The reward is: U laugh your A .. of !! The fact that U has to find the things mentioned above actually makes the movie even funnier, because it gives the impression that the director is not even aware of how funny his movie is, which does not seem likely and there lies intelligence. at the head of this magnificent project called: Spaced Invaders !!
