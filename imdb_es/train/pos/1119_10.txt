Sandra Bernhard, "Without You, I'm Nothing", the film released in 1990, followed in the footsteps of her stage production off-Broadway in 1988 ... to what she and others refer to in the film as her "successful series of a woman". "<br /> <br /> There were several changes in monologues and one-line phrases, and the movie version visually reevaluates the story, taking Sandra out of a fabulous existence as a successful theater artist in New York , during what she calls her "summer superstar", to an illusory, almost desperate existence in her home in Los Angeles - her fictional manager in the film refers to "going back to her roots, to ... luxurious clubs dinners like the parisian room. "<br /> <br /> There is a point that needs to be made here: Sandra tries to appeal her liberal world view and her sometimes hard critique of American pop culture to an audience that does not see her completely. predominantly black, trying to relate their ideas when all these people seem to want is "Shashonna", a stripper similar to Madonna and even then, with Shashonna dancing drum rhythms that resemble those of "Like a Virgin", not There's a lot to be said for the audience to enjoy the show The scene in the club throughout the film is drier than a bone A fun scene to capture is that of a resounding man from the audience who helps Shashonna to get rid of the pants. <br /> <br /> But, if she is going down, Sandra is doing it with style and strength, transmitting everything, from trust to puncture ... Vulnerability ... to the point where she is naked ( literally), beg He accepted and still somehow still swimming in the pool of his own transparent stardom. His representations of interactions with people like Calvin Klein, Jerry Lewis, Bianca Jagger, Ralph Lauren and (what we are led to believe) is that Warren Beatty is fictitious and hilarious. <br /> <br /> Sandra begins her show at its most uncomfortable moment, performing a quiet but bewildering rendition of Nina Simone's song "Four Women" as she dressed in a mufti and other African attire, singing lines like "my skin is black "," my hair is shaggy "and" they call me something sweet ". <br /> <br /> Resurrect and celebrate the ghosts of the art of the underworld in a tremendously funny description of the frantic property auction for Andy Warhol: "Let Andy have the wisdom and sensitivity in the hours and hours of work and work that was included in the product of India ... that have had the luck to take advantage of everything that happened in Santa Fe ". <br /> <br /> Exposes about the excess of Hollywood, comforting an anguished friend, then rebuked him, saying: "Sir, if it's about Ishtar, I'm getting up right now and I left your life forever because she's too self-indulgent even for me! "<br /> <br /> Sandra illustrates the expectations of women in the age of feminism. Dressed as a Cosmo girl, Sandra retells her fantasy as a child to become an executive secretary and marry her boss. Finally, he concludes with relief: "I will never be a statistic, nor I. I am less than 35 years old and I am going to get married!". <br /> <br /> Sandra praises the openness of sexuality in society: "When it touches you at night, does it feel good or does it feel real? I say it feels real ... real MIGHTY". <br /> <br /> Finally, she cries out for a progressive change. American society channels the greats of the Patrick Cowley and Sylvester disco and proclaims: "Eventually everyone will have fun!" <br /> <br /> All this comes in the form of dazzling, wonderful but wonderful cabaret performances of songs written and originated by Billy Paul. , Burt Bacharach, Hank Williams and Laura Nyro, to name a few. At the same time, the idealized and fictional incarnation of Sandra, her self-generated mirror image, floats around the city, a beautiful black model in loose robe and tight bustiers who read the Kabala, study chemistry and listen to rap music from the NWA. <br /> <br /> In Without You I'm Nothing, Sandra Bernhard explores the emotions and the existences that, until then, she had only played as a regular guest on Late Night With David Letterman. His almost infantile enthusiasm for the shock, exhibited throughout the 80s, is discarded before a more subtle charm, and his confidence in materialism and the American celebrity is refreshing. This approach to comedy would change Sandra's direction forever and would mark the most mature and nicest artist to come. <br /> <br /> If you like subtle humor to the point of getting involved in internal jokes about glamor, celebrity, sex, loneliness. , despair and superficial expressions of love and kinship, this movie will keep you in stitches. It may not be to be fun in all areas. Maybe it's a bit unsettling or even maudlin for some. But consider the emptiness of the world that Sandra paints for you, and you will understand how funny and brilliant she really is. <br /> <br /> But look Without you I am nothing with a friend "in knowledge" because it is definitely more fun that way. Before you know it, you two will exchange beards with Sandra and confuse hell with everyone else.
