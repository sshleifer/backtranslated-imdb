This sensational short film explores the potential of animation through a world of playful or horrible images, but always powerful. Cats ride and drink from an aquatic elephant, a circus with a bird that has consumed the sky and pigs that eat their own fried meat, that's just the beginning.

In addition, the DVD includes a surprising commentary by the director, who, given the extremely sober dialogue, only improves the visualization. The commentary gives some interpretations of the scenes, but also provides invaluable quotes about the elaboration of Cat Soup, in the line of: "well, the artists asked what we should do in this scene, but I did not know it, so it's hard to say why it turned out like it did "(by the way, that's a bad paraphrase).
