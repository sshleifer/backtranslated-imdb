"Hollywood North" is a euphemism for the film industry, since they traveled to Canada to make films because of the tax deductions and the cheaper costs in a civilized city like Toronto, in this case, later in Vancouver. Peter O'Brian, the director, probably saw many of the invaders in California that this film seems to be the right way to deal with the personalities that come trying to capitalize on the economy that Canada presented. <br /> <br /> It goes without saying that "Moon Lantern", the successful novel written by a Canadian author, becomes "Flight to Bogota", which has nothing to do with the original film. Michael Baytes, a great egoist who is obsessed with what is happening in Iran, is offered the main part, which becomes a disaster. <br /> <br /> The movie seems to be saying that too many chefs have spoiled the broth, which seems to be the case with the final product, which is saved by its producer, Bobby Myers. With the help of Sandy Ryan, who has been shooting a documentary of the film that was filmed in Toronto, parts of the film became a cohesive film at last. <br /> <br /> The filming process is hilarious, and acting, in general, is good.
