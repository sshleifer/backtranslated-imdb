I was so entertained throughout this insightful documentary, and I waited a while for this to come through the pipes (my local video channel), and it was worth waiting for. I like a good piece of documentary / special interest, but this was definitely a sincere, honest and nostalgic feeling, if you will, to look back on the lives of teenagers. A child's imagination is fascinating, and that's where a great story begins. Rent it or buy it if you like a good documentary, fun and fun. Mr. Stein and the company have definitely come a long way from the neighborhood productions of video game camcorders, and the "gay-rings" that turn people into gays at a single glance. They all seem to be quite successful in their respectful fields, and it was good to know that they are still good friends. The DVD has some additional advances for other good documentaries, and presents several of Darren's most notable productions, including Crazy News.
