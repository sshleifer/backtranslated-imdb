I have not read the novel, or anything by Kurt Vonnegut, but now I intend to begin. This catches you from the first frame, and does not let go until the final credits begin to roll. Taking places you do not expect, the plot is interesting in everything. The rhythm is correct, nothing lasts too long, and this does a perfect job of balancing unexpected twists and allows the viewer to process what we have seen. It is well told and well thought out. I have never seen a movie with which I feel I can compare this in particular. It is intense and exciting, as well as fun and sad. The performance is excellent, Nolte shines absolutely, Goodman demonstrates once again that he does not have to laugh, and Lee and Arkin are fascinating. I could go on, really ... no role is about less than stellar performance. The editing and cinematography are wonderful, and all the images are great, with a couple of unforgettable and surprising. I will look for other films directed by Keith Gordon, as well as the other two apparently related to this, through the author of the books. There is a scene of sexuality, and a lot of disturbing and disturbing content in this. I recommend it to anyone who appreciates it; It's not nice 8/10
