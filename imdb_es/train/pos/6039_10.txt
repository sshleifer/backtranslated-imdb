['He was lucky to be an extra in this great movie and I loved every minute of the filming. I went to the premiere in London and had a great talk with Phil, Peter, Martin and Jon, as did my wife. Fantastic after the party too. Then, a few weeks later, they traveled to the cinema with members of our bicycle club. What a brilliant movie, it deserves to be up there with all the great motorcyclist films. Now we have the DVD Sue, my wife can not have enough children. Get a little club stick that seems to think that I am now a movie star, well, you can only dream. I think they&#39;re just jealous. The only drawback of the first part of the shoot was the weather, the rain, the rain and more rain, but we were in Wales. I hope there is a follow-up, so keep me informed Jon. Danny Beck']
