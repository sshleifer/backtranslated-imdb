This movie is an amazing riot of non-stop laughter that incorporates all the usual ingredients of a Dawid Dhawan comedy: awkward heroes, supporting characters buffoons, dolls made for heroines, unpleasant villains, jokes, choreography, choreography and a small dose of action. . <br /> <br /> Amitabh Bachchan and Govinda have double roles of cops and swindlers. The heroine of Amitabh the policeman is Ramya Krishnan and Raveena is opposite Govinda the policeman. The heroines are mere objects of red color as usual. Scammers do not have heroines. Paresh Rawal carries out his act of villain in DAUD (he also played a similar gift in KHOOBSURAT). Asrani shines in a brief paper. Perform a replay of his famous act "Angrezon ke zamaane ke Jailer" in SHOLAY. <br /> <br /> Govinda is impeccable as always, like a ruthless and good-humored policeman Pyaare Mohan and a swindler like Chhote Miyaan. He imitates the Bihari style of Hindi-speaking with hilarious results. Amitabh Bachchan, believe it or not, pales in comparison to him. But still AB is fine. Madhuri Dixit makes a cameo like herself in the song "Makhna". She dances like the wind. <br /> <br /> The music of Viju Shah is incredible. Check out "Kisi Disco Mein Jaayen", "Makhna" and the title track. <br /> <br /> Do not look for any LOGIC since it is a comedy and the script is completely convenient. Only enjoy yourself.
