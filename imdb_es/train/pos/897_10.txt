['What can I say, I have grown up seeing Hum Saath Saath Hain, Hum Aapke Hain Koun and Maine Pyar Kiya. Soraj has always been different. Movies are part of our lives in evolutionary times. Soraj creates something that is hard to find. Love and family coexistence, loving and great. Vivah is a trip for a couple that is organizing a marriage that becomes an arrangement and loves marriage. Shahid has done a good job. Anupamji as always bright. Amrita Rao resigned differently although I felt that somehow the other for me does not fit into that role. We have seen it in Ishk Vishk and Ab ke baras, and Main ho in Na. So leave a different role in which she is not. She has been excellent in Main ho in Na and ishk vishk, but she may have put little more on paper. Anyway, great work of Barjatya. This film rejuvenates the values we forget. Sweet movie of the year. Good music and lyrics. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s a new version, but anyway a brilliant story that is original. Soraj&#39;s films have been brilliant at all times, so we always expect something different from him. Great job for the entire cast of the crew and everyone. Charming family movie to enjoy with your parents, brothers, friends and loved ones. I give it 10 out of 10.']
