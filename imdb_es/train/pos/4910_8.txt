This very good movie crackles with tension. The risks are, of course, high: will the police and Widmark, the public health doctor, stop offenders who do not know they are carriers of pests before a large-scale epidemic is unleashed? But the elements of the smaller plot introduce tension in each scene: between Widmark and the captain of the police, between the bad guys played by Palance and Mostel, between Palance and a dying and plague-ridden man whom Palance erroneously believes is the subject of a persecution because he smuggled it into a valuable product, between Widmark and his wife, and with the underlying question of whether the public is better informed informing them of the danger or hiding the situation to avoid a full-scale panic. The film is beautifully filmed by Kazan, in extraordinarily well-choreographed long takes in New Orleans, and ends in an impressive climax, where Palance flees like a rat of his pursuers, through the docks and warehouses of the city. The commentary is excellent, probably the best I've heard, which includes cinematography, framing and lighting of shots, production design, the casting of non-professional actors in small roles and the ironies and parallels in the plot, such as Un Perspicacious seminar on the cinematographic techniques of 1950 and the black cinema in general. Watch it once to enjoy the movie on its own and, if you're interested in making movies, a second time with the comment to learn.
