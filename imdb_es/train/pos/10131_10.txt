In the first episode of Friends, which aired on September 22, 1994, "The One Where Monica Gets A Roommate", a song is played while Rachel sits in the window towards the end of the show, the line being played is : "If I ever need to hold" ... Does anyone know if the artist is singing or the title of the song? It seems like it's a great song ... I'd love to get a copy of it. Thanks for the help. I am looking for the album / cd that is on to be able to buy it. <br /> <br /> I have the programs that are available to buy and I enjoy this program over and over again. He seemed to be credible ... thank you for the hours of entertainment he has provided over the years.
