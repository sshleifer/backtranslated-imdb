When I was a child it was the time of Lex Barker as Tarzan. I often heard from older people that Johnny Weissmuller "was" Tarzan and we would not understand why, since I saw a couple of the last Weismuller films in the character and I thought he was out of shape. It was not after many years that I met "Tarzan and his companion", and then I understood. Weismuller is fit in this image and has the robust presence and appearance that the demands of the characters have not yet been matched by other Tarzans such as Barker, Gordon Scott, Jock Mahoney, Denny Miller, Miles O'Keefe and Cristopher Lambert. <br /> <br /> As for this movie, I was also surprised by the sensual presence of the beautiful Maureen O'Sullivan, a strong, selfish, active and "uninhibited" woman, like Jane well ahead of the times in that the film was made (Tarzan pushes she is naked in a pond while having fun, one of the explorers kisses her by surprise and although she does not kiss him back, somehow she let him do it for a moment and does not give much importance ); such behaviors were unthinkable with the "Janes" that would come, such as Brenda Joyce, Vanessa Brown, Virginia Huston or Dorothy Hart, all of them playing vulnerable vulnerable women, so it is hard to believe that they could survive in a hostile place like the African jungle . <br /> <br /> The brilliant character of O'Sullivan's character steals the spectacle of Tarzan himself, except of course when it comes to action and Weismuller takes the initiative easily; The combination is perfect. Another highlight of the film is the secondary role of Cheeta and not as a main character, as in the latest photos of Tarzan, where he often saves the day. <br /> <br /> "Tarzan and his partner" stand out as an excellent product of its kind (Tarzan films) and perhaps the best one, although I must admit that I also enjoyed "Tarzan's Greatest Adventure" (1959) made with a higher budget and a solid supporting cast (and, even though Gordon Scott is simply acceptable in the lead role with his too perfect physical appearance "all gym" that does not fit a rustic monkey man). <br /> <br /> Good for Jane and her partner!
