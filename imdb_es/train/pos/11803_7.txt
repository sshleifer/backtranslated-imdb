"Sasquatch Hunters" was not really as bad as I thought. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Traveling to the forest, Rangers Charles Landon, (Kevin O'Connor) Roger Gordon, (Matt Latimore) Brian Stratton (David Zelina) Spencer Combs, (Rick Holland) and his sister Janet, (Stacey Branscombe) accompany Dr. Helen Gilbert, (Amy Shelton-White), their boss, Dr. Ethan Edwards, Gary Sturm) and their assistant Louise Keaton, (Juliana Dever) to find the site of some reputed bones found in the area. When they camp, the team discovers a giant cemetery and more strange bones litter the area. When the group members begin to disappear, they begin to wander through the forest to safety. It was discovered that a Sasquatch is behind the murders, and the team comes together to survive. <br /> <br /> The good news: this was not as bad as I thought it would be. The movie really starts to gain some steam around the midpoint, when the creature attacks. That is a masterful series of scenes, since the whole group is subject to attacks by the creature, and the suspense throughout the execution is extremely high. The forested area is milked more properly during these parts, which increases the tension and asks when a single person who wanders through the forest will have his due. It also spreads quite liberally throughout the film the effective use of grunts and roars off the screen that are not truly mundane. They really add a lot to make this part so scary, like the other times you hear the growl. It's quite effective, and it works well. It's good enough that the back of the movie accelerates, since it comes out pretty good on a high note of action. A scene, especially the one I feel, should point to a special scene in the first visualization. While a man runs through the forest from the creature, he sees the expedition that has been searching for it. Raising his hands to cry for help, the second to announce his presence is that they attacked him from nothing and killed him hastily. I was surprised and actually gave a little jump on the first visualization. <br /> <br /> The bad news: there were only a couple of things to complain about here, and one is a usual complaint. The horrible creature here is mainly composed of a horrible CGI, which made it seem totally ridiculous and destroys all the credibility that could have had. The threat air evoked by the opening of the film almost shoots out the window when the creature appears on the screen. It's so annoying that it's a pity that a little more work has not been put into it. I have complained a lot about this, and it is something that really should be eliminated, since it does not seem so realistic and is quite false. Another big one is the one that kills off screen here. Very often in the film a person is seized and then torn off, and then finds the body bloody. It is quite aggravating when the deaths look nice and juicy afterwards. Otherwise, I really do not have many problems with this, since everything else that is usually criticized about this really did not bother me, but it is aimed at others beyond this. <br /> <br /> The final verdict: I liked this one a bit, but it's still not the best Sasquatch movie. It's not supposed to be taken seriously, and if it looks that way, it's actually nice. Fans of these films should take a look at this, and those who like the Characteristics of the Science Fiction Creatures can also find some good things here. <br /> <br /> Rating R: Graphic language, Violence and some graphic corpses
