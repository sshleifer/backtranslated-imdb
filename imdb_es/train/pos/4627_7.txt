['If you are going to put a play inside the walls of the prison, why not go for the best playwright William Shakespeare? And if you are going to choose your cast from a large number of criminals who serve long sentences for the most heinous crimes, you can be sure that there will be enough time for rehearsals. In a Kentucky correctional facility, a brave project like this one was carried out with surprising results. This film shows how everything was done ... the casting ... the rehearsals ... the ensemble and the costumes ... and the final presentation of Shakespeare&#39;s play &quot;The Tempest&quot;. It had not occurred to me before, but there is an analogy between the stage of the work and the correctional prison. In the work, the characters destroyed by the ship are confined in an island without contact with the outside world. Life in prison is also very similar to that. <br /><br /> With a simple back drop painted from a surrounding seascape, the characters in a variety of more pleasing costumes bellow out of their lines an audience of approval, may not be what Shakespeare intended but with good heart and sincerity for sure. <br /><br /> More interesting than the work itself were the small cameos of each man behind his character. One inmate saw the work as a lesson of forgiveness and another as a redemption of his sins. It was quite exciting to see the men wipe a tear when they talked about murder, shooting and strangulation. One had the feeling that everyone would like to turn back the clock and reconsider their brutal actions. However (as someone said) the past was past, and the present was the beginning of a new future. At least the work gave temporary relief from the depressing thoughts of past events. <br /><br /> Prison authorities should be applauded for allowing the work to be carried out. Such an event would put Kentucky on the map and, hopefully, other prisons could follow their good example. It seems to me that everyone benefits ... not only from the Kentucky prison, but also from the prisoners who need to find new confidence and self-esteem and be prepared for the day they are released on probation.']
