A woman, Mujar (Marta Belengur) enters a restaurant one morning at &: 35, not knowing that a terrorist has kidnapped people in said restaurant and is making them act a musical number in this strange but fascinating short film, which I only saw . finding it in the DVD of the equally fascinating "Timecrimes" of the director / writer. It had a pretty catchy song and somehow it made me smile despite the overall grim plot of the short film. I'm glad I found it (I did not know it would be an extra when I rented the DVD) and I would not hesitate to recommend it to all my friends. <br /> <br /> My Grade A-
