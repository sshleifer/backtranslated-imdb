In fact, this is one of those movies that you would have to give 7.5. The fact is; As has already been said, it is very fun. Wonderfully atmospheric. Askey, in fact, considers it exaggerated, but it is a great vehicle for him, just like Oh, Mr. Porter is for Will. If you like the old movies and trains of Dark House, then this is definitely for you. <br /> <br /> Oddly enough, it's the kind of movie you want to see over and over again. It is friendly and charming in a endearing way with all the nostalgic references that made a great meal in times of war. The "strange" groups of characters simply confront each other as they do in many other British films typical of the war. It would have been wonderful to have seen this movie if it had been recorded by Ealing Studios. A real pity that the 1931 original has not survived intact.
