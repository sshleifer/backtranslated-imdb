The first word that comes to mind after watching this movie is "beauty". Beauty is everywhere, in the game of the actors (Andie is excellent as always), in well-designed shots and in the idea of ​​the red line of the authors: Love. <br /> <br /> I think Kenny's character is the only target. Stain on these three women, otherwise boring and predictable. Their interaction makes Andie's character as entertaining as possible. When he left, it became clear that we really can not appreciate and maintain our inner beliefs and our sacred desires. <br /> <br /> The fact that Andie successfully recovers from this loss is not bad, instead, it shows that life prevails in any way, even in this small British village, which is perfectly displayed. <br /> <br /> Another reason why I love this movie is that it is so British in every way, everything that houses, "queer" and accents :))). And Andie is again doing an excellent job! It's a pity that this movie has had such low ratings. 10 out of ten!
