I work in a library and I hoped that I would like this movie when it came out 5 years ago. Well, I really liked Parker Posey (she's a wonderful actress) and Omar Townsend was really cute as her boyfriend (she could not act, but when you look like him, why?) But the movie was bad. It was not funny or cute or much of anything. Posey kept the film afloat with her energy. But she learned the Dewey Decimal OVERNIGHT system and then saved tons of books to the music. Come on! I also had a problem with the way she looked when she became a full-fledged librarian at the end (hair in a bun, glasses, no sense of humor). Can we leave that stereotype, please? It's worth visiting Posey and Townsend, but that's it. The television series was much better.
