['&quot;Kolchak&quot; was a television series that really did not fit into any category. Part horror, part comedy, some social conscience, and what we have is something I think people were not prepared for. It really is a shame, since I started watching these programs on the Chiller network (I never saw the originals), I realized how different and interesting it really was. <br /><br /> Starring Darren Mcgavin as Kolchak, a reporter for the International News Service, and Simon Oakland as his always angry boss, Tony Vincenzo, the show followed the exploits of a Chicago news reporter who most of the time became part of the story . he searched the windy city for the modern day creepies that hit at night. The underlying charm of Macgavin really sets the show apart. A somewhat silly guy, who always wears the same suit, you can not help but love him. His jokes are great, and the coming and going between him and the skeptical editor, Oakland, are downright funny. <br /><br /> The stories are for the most part pretty good, and the acting is very good. The 70s were not a great period for special effects, and the program suffers for it, but if you suspend disbelief, what you have is a fun series that was ahead of its time.']
