This was great. When I saw the Japanese version for the first time, it was probably the most terrifying movie I had ever seen. It was not blood or guts, it was creepy, atmospheric and frightening. When the ghost mother lent on the bed in the Japanese version, I almost had a heart attack ... I was worried that the American version would be diluted, and that Buffy would remove the dark and creepy nuances of the original version. I should not have been worried. The creators of this film wisely kept the same Japanese people who were involved with the original film at hand, and gave the same man the direction of the film. They also placed it in Japan in the same place, in the same house. In fact, the Japanese director took the trouble to redo the same movie he had in the original, the only difference was the casting of American actors. That became a benefit by adding the element of "Strangers in a strange land" to the general horror. Not only were they being chased by an absolutely frightening and implacable ghost, but they were also trapped in a completely foreign land, having difficulty integrating into society. It just added to the general anxiety incorporated in the movie and I thought it was an excellent touch. <br /> <br /> Buffy actually does a very good job. He looks vulnerable and is capable of transmitting his fear well. There are none of the clever comments that are so common in American horror films, or a line that undermines the darkness and general horror of the characters' situation. In fact, it was easily as good as the ring that I also enjoyed a lot. I hope that the future of American horror will follow more closely the New Wave of Japanese horror that began with the incredible success of Ringu. We are finally getting movies that can actually be classified as "Horror"! 8/10
