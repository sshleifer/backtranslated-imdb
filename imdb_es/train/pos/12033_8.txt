When I was flipping through the TV Guide, and I found "Twisted Desire" in the movies section, I read its description. Three words caught my attention "Melissa Joan Hart" ... It seems to me that her role in "Sabrina: The Teenage Witch" is absolutely vile, I hate that kind of programs, so I was thinking that I was going to be a boring old man, love story starring her ... Little did I know. <br /> <br /> It finally started on TV, I had my bucket ready in case I was going to throw up for its cheese flavor or its soppiness, you know what I mean. At first, you think that she is just a nice, ordinary girl who is in love, but who has bad parents. Then, when you discover that she has manipulated her boyfriend to kill his parents, so that he can be with his true love, you are like "Whoa". You just do not expect this kind of role for that type of actress. She played her role very well in my opinion, I never expected that she could act like a bitch, and voil√†, she did it perfectly! Congratulations to her, the movie was very good, I would definitely see her again and recommend her to others.
