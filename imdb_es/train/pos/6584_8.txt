['Doyle had never wanted to resuscitate Holmes from his joint death with Professor Moriarty in THE ADVENTURE OF THE FINAL PROBLEM. However, financial considerations made him want (in 1901) to write THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, which is still considered his best novel by Holmes and possibly his best novel. But it was a &quot;memory&quot; of the great detective, written before his death. Only a greater clamor from his audience led Doyle to completely resurrect Holmes in THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE, published in 1905. <br /><br /> It&#39;s not that the new short stories (and the latest novel) are really bad. Maybe three of the stories are really terrible, but even the terrible ones are very readable. Several of the latter (such as THE ADVENTURE OF THE SOLITARY CYCLIST) are really very good. But the inequality of production (particularly after the stories in HIS ULTIMATE ARC (1917)) becomes increasingly evident. Repeat lines of past history, and show really negative aspects of Holmes. In the story THE ADVENTURE OF THE THREE GABLES Holmes shows mocking sarcasm to a character of African descent. <br /><br /> SPOILER COMING SOON <br /><br /> THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON deals with Holmes trying to recover compromising letters from Milverton, a highly successful blackmailer. It is an interesting example of how Doyle could make a highly readable story with a minimum plot, since there is little real detective work in history. Holmes is hired to try to negotiate with Milverton regarding the purchase of the cards, but to recover them no matter what! Milverton proves not only that he is unwilling to consider a smaller amount for the papers, but is prepared to protect himself from Holmes&#39;s attempt to search his person. Later, we learn that Holmes has gone into the house of Milverton to fall in love with a maid in disguise. In the end, Holmes goes with Watson to steal the house from Milverton. He and Watson are in the house when they discover that Milverton is waiting for a new business in his studio (someone with information that Milverton can use). Occurring carefully, Holmes and Watson observe how a woman enters, who happens to be a victim of collateral damage from Milverton&#39;s past activities, and who kills the blackmailer. Holmes and Watson can set fire to the collection of compromised documents of Milverton before fleeing the house and then discover (by themselves) the identity of the woman. The police (under Lestrade) do not discover who are the two mysterious men who ran from the house of Milverton, and are so disgusted by the activities of Milverton (who could never bring anything home) that it is obvious that the murder will never be solved . <br /><br /> The story is not one of the fascinating ones with the work of real detective involved as THE SPECKLED BAND ADVENTURE or PLATA BLAZE. It&#39;s a story about mood and belated action: will it be the problem that Holmes and Watson will get the papers or will they be captured by Milverton? It is not one of the best stories, but it is in most of the stories as very well told and interesting. <br /><br /> At the time he wrote CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON, Conan Doyle had experience with the police in relation to his activities at times as a highly respected amateur detective / crusader. An artist was found murdered in his studio in London, and Conan Doyle began writing his opinions on how the murder was committed. Then he stopped, apparently warned by his friends at Scotland Yard that the murder was not necessary to investigate. The victim had been homosexual and the police were sure that it was the dispute of a lover who had gone terribly wrong. For the sake of the victim&#39;s family (this was in 1905) Doyle stopped caring about the case. Then, he was aware that sometimes the British police behaved in moderation on matters that did not seem to justify their full investigation, such as Lestrade&#39;s restriction on whoever killed the villain Milverton in history. <br /><br /> Given the description of the story, it could have been counted in the normal version of one hour of the series. But the teleplay for THE MASTER BLACKMAILER spent some time showing the horrible dilemma faced by the victims of Milverton (in Victorian / Edwardian England). We see a young and promising aristocratic army officer commit suicide when faced with a homosexual exposure due to the extravagant demands of Milverton, all at the beginning of the teleplay game. And it&#39;s not just homosexuals. Men and women of good repute in heterosexual marriages could be tainted by discovering illegitimate children or past indiscreet relationships. In fact, in history, the woman who kills Milverton is avenging the destruction of her husband (a prominent nobleman) destroyed by the blackmailer. <br /><br /> Milverton is well played in his most poisonous folly by that excellent actor Robert Hardy, who even when confronted with the unexpected fury he has unleashed is not affected by anything (it seems that in a moment you will see the angry woman outside your home ). Brett and Hardwicke do quite well in their roles as Holmes and Watson, as expected. <br /><br /> How serious was the loss of character by rumor or innuendo in 1905? In 1898, one of the heroes of several imperial wars, and the leader of the last victorious charge in the battle of Omdurman that destroyed the Mahdist army (see FOUR FEATHERS) was Sir Hector MacDonald. He was governor of Ceylon in 1903 when suddenly, he unexpectedly resigned. Sir Hector returned to London and shot himself in a hotel while waiting for some kind of audience. It was later learned that &quot;Fighting Mac&quot;, often considered the most popular army commander in Britain, had been surprised by having arrangements to sleep with native children. Milverton would have devoured him very quickly ... or his real-life counterparts would have done it.']
