Okay, Soldier is not as deep or meaningful as Blade Runner or with a budget as big as Terminator 2, but overall I found it quite nice. <br /> <br /> The fact that Kurt Russell remained in character without speaking or being virtually emotionless made the moments when his humanity broke through all the most moving. His description of restricted emotional development seemed more moving than that of Arnie in the T movies (and before receiving comments, yes, I know that Arnie was a cyborg and that Kurt was human, but the premise of both films was the same) . <Br /> <br /> Then, for the film itself, a reasonable cast from the United States and the United Kingdom is able to develop this little story. I'm not really sure if Gary Busey and his two officers were bad or good, so I could not decide if I liked them or not. The colony was a bit more realistic, neither a malicious group of hicks who love the peace / gullible / cowardly that are eliminated from the first moment, nor a group of aggressive paranoid subversive terrorists about the extraterrestrials and between them. <br /> <br /> Kurt Russell is good and, unlike other comments, I do not think this has a negative impact on his career (unlike maybe Escape from LA, the sequels are such fickle creatures!). Sean Pertwee has truly prided his late father on continuing the noble family sci-fi lineage. And the rest of the cast helped develop this pathetic band of people who make the most of a bad situation and do not do it so badly. <br /> <br /> If you see this on your TV show, I would recommend giving it a try. . I do not think you're disappointed.
