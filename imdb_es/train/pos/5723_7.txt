So, being a big fan of horror movies, it's been a while since I saw one that really made me jump (or shake me nervously). <br /> <br /> I will definitely get this on DVD when the time comes. outside ... much better than the ring. What I do not understand is that so many people we talked to after the movie thought it was horrible, well, if that's what you think, then, I know ... I know what I liked and it takes a good amount for that I feel really scared, so I must say it's worth seeing. <br /> <br /> Now, you may be disappointed in the story if you need everything in a clean and tidy line. because the plot goes back a bit to help build the story (I think if it was shown in chronological order, it would have ruined the whole thing). <br /> <br /> I'm really glad that this movie had very little bloody mess ... maybe the rest of the writers in your studio and Whashaveyous will realize that you do not have to splash the red stuff all over the set to scare people.
