An absolute classic! The management is impeccable, the performance is simply excellent. The words fall short for this great work. The most definitive film about Mumbai police. This film has passed the test of time. <br /> <br /> Om Puri gives a stellar performance, Smita Patil no less. All the actors have done everything possible and movie careers have thrilled you at all times. This film shakes your whole being and forces you to rethink about many problems that our society faces. <br /> <br /> This is the story of a cop (Om Puri) who starts his career as an honest man, but ultimately degenerates into a killer. The first attempt in Bollywood to get behind the scenes and expose the depressing truth about the Mumbai cops. Congratulations to Nihalani !! <br /> <br /> After this film, a series of Bollywood films that exposed the nexus between the police and politicians was premiered. Therefore, this movie was really a trendsetter. This trend dominated the Hindi film scene for more than a decade. <br /> <br /> This movie was a moderate blockbuster. <br /> <br /> A must for the most demanding movie fanatics.
