Okay, first of all I received this movie as a Christmas present, so it was FREE! FIRST - This movie was meant to be in stereoscopic 3D. It's for the most part, but when the protagonist is in her car, the movie falls in 2D! What!!?!?! It's not that difficult to shoot in a car !!! SECOND - The story is not very good. There are many bad things in it. <br /> <br /> THIRD: Why are all the deaths showing at the beginning of the movie! He made the movie suck every time someone was going to be killed !!! Look at it to laugh, but do not waste time buying. You just have to download it or something cheap.
