['Shakespeare Behind Bars was the most amazing and charming movie I&#39;ve seen all year. This is a prison program, somewhere in California, if I remember correctly, where the inmates have rehearsed and performed a different Shakespeare play every year for the past 14 years. The film follows its production of &quot;The Tempest&quot; from the launch to the presentation, and in the process we learn some rather surprising things about these men, who are waiting for the most serious crimes. The truth is stranger than fiction: if someone tried to adapt this story to a fiction movie, the public would never buy it, but knowing that it is real makes it impressive to see it, literally; I gasped loudly when I learned of a crime committed by a specially gifted criminal. It&#39;s like a crazy episode of Oz, and more entertaining because the characters and their strange stories are real.']
