I do not think most of us tend to apply the term "must-see" to action movies, but I was very impressed by how good this film was and deservedly received the "must-see" stamp from me. <Br /> <br /> Mandy, played by Shannon Lee (daughter of the late great Bruce Lee and sister of the late Brandon Lee) is recruited by Martin, a professional thief to help carry out a museum diamond heist for a criminal syndicate, and be generously rewarded for it. Little do they know that another couple of thieves (Lucy and Tommy, a pair of lovers), whom Mandy and Martin previously rejected to enter the deal, also plan to steal the diamond. <br /> <br /> How each pair of thieves plans the robbery is an emotion to see. Things go wrong, since Martin and Mandy, unknowingly, are one step behind Lucy and Tommy. <br /> <br /> You will find yourself encouraging these thieves when they discover that they need each other to stay alive in the crime syndicate, who are not happy that the diamond is not in their hands. <br /> <br /> Action fans will not be disappointed, as there is a good deal of combat with guns, martial arts and hand-to-hand combat. sequences. <br /> <br /> What is surprising is that not only the action is what this movie takes, but the romance and the laughs (and I do not mean your typical one-line phrases that prevail in action movies ) what sneaks up . <br /> <br /> It is not easy to encourage the bad guys, but we can see the human side of these thieves and the chemistry they develop. <br /> <br /> A great movie and one NOT to miss! <br /> <br /> 9 of 10
