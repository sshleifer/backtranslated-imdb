The film is very complete in what it is, keeping one continually interested in the flashbacks of childhood and growing up with such a strange father, and mingling with the tails of serial murder, one simply can not go wrong. The plot itself, the story and the essence of the film, is entertaining. It's the kind of story with which the director (Bill Paxton) could do a lot, and in this case, he really did a lot with it. <br /> <br /> From start to finish, you keep anticipating more. and more about what is happening and where the film is going, and the creativity behind this story is first class. I felt as if this movie was done exquisitely from beginning to end, and one of those rare gems that seemed to be without any boring calm: the action flows clearly, quickly and tightly from one scene to another. <br /> <br /> Show how far people can go: to do those horrible things to their loved ones, and to do such acts of evil, in the name of 'God' when they are disillusioned as in this case. Sometimes it is also interesting in its' turns and acquires the concept of morality as a whole. <br /> <br /> In general, this is the type of film that one easily overlooks, but I would recommend that you do not do the same. And to see this movie, it's really worth it.
