['SPOILERS CONTAINED TO CARRY OUT AN OBSERVATION. <br /><br /> Twenty years after 1984, this movie talks a lot about Prince&#39;s future in the music industry. <br /><br /> There is a scene that perfectly sums up Prince&#39;s musical output of the last 10 years, which is that if you remove the two best songs from his last 10 albums, you would have a fantastic album! <br /><br /> The scene plays like this. Prince rushes to his dressing room after playing a song and the owner of the club enters the locker room to give Prince some thanks for his fall from grace during the 90&#39;s and publish albums that only the most hardcore fans could tolerate and Support your art. <br /><br /> Owner of the club: &quot;You are not packing them as before, the only person who digs your music is yourself!&quot; <br /><br /> Spooky eh! How about the musical underlining that makes Prince even more evil when he hits Apollonia in two separate scenes? It gave me chills that this was not the only scene that women mistreated in this movie. <br /><br /> I am in favor of the comedy combats between Morris Day and Jerome Benton, since these two stole all the scenes they were in. But what was the funny thing about throwing a woman in the trash? That was just unpleasant! The other unpleasant part was the chalk outline of Prince&#39;s father on the floor carefully provided by the Minnieapolis police, which makes Prince even more crazy! FANTASTIC!! <br /><br /> Purple Rain is an entertaining film in general, since it is the soundtrack of Prince songs that increases its value by 110%. But, again, the film gives us another theory about Prince and his music, since the movie tells us that Prince&#39;s biggest song in the movie is written by Wendy, Lisa and Princes&#39; wife, and the father of the musical! <br /><br /> Prince and the filmmakers are trying to tell us that Prince stole all his best songs from his father after finding his parents&#39; music sheets of written songs? Maybe that&#39;s why Prince started running out of steam during the 90&#39;s because he ran out of ideas from his parents? ........... Hmmmm ...']
