After having seen Deliverance, movies like Pulp Fiction do not seem so extreme. Maybe, by today's standards of blood and bullets, it does not seem so nervous, but if you think that this was in 1972 and that the movie has a truly sinister core, then it makes you think differently. <br /> <br /> When I started watching this movie, nothing seemed really unusual until I got to the "Dueling Banjos" scene. In that scene, the brutality and edge of this movie is truly visible. As I watched Drew (Ronny Cox, Robocop) confront a seemingly challenged young man, he really shows how unsettling these films can be. When you think that the boy has a small banjo, which he probably could have done by hand, compared to Drew's beautiful and expensive guitar, you really discover how out of his territory the four men are. <br /> <br /> As the plot progresses, it is very credible and never extends beyond its limits. But what really sets this film apart, about four businessmen who get more than they expected in a canoe trip, is that director John Boorman (Excalibur) breaks all the characters with simple caricatures or stereotypes. So as the film is filled with horror and suspense, I really cared about the four men and what would happen to them. <br /> <br /> The performance is universally excellent. With Jon Voight (Midnight Cowboy, Enemy of the State) and Burt Reynolds (Boogie Nights, Striptease) leading the big cast. Jon Voight probably makes the most difficult part of everything in this movie and that is making his transformation from a family man to a warrior very credible. Unlike Reynolds, whose character is a warrior from the beginning, the character of Voight is transformed throughout the film. Ned Beatty (Life) is also good in an extremely difficult role, come to be raped by a hillbilly, while Ronny Cox becomes a credible performance. <br /> <br /> One thing that really made this film powerful for me is that the villains were as terrifying as any I had ever seen. Bill Mckinney and Herbert "Cowboy" Coward were excellent and extremely frightening as those on the hill. <br /> <br /> In general, Deliverance was excellent and I suggest it to everyone, except people with weak stomachs and children. 10/10.
