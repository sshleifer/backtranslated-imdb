This show is a great history story. It has everything from slavery, the way they were treated, religion, the ways in which the Jews were hidden, the inquisition, the belief in the African Orisha gods, the way they treated women, including daughters. Even to homosexuality. The way the characters are intertwined and that Violante, that character saddens me. She is so desperate to be loved that she destroys all those around her. I'm so happy that they decided to relaunch it for television. again. Although I would love to see the unedited version. Xica has become my heroine. I admire the way she uses her power to help all those who seek her. I love all the characters and I have discovered that now they can relate to many people in this century. I wait for my Xica every night. It would be great to double it in English so that Americans can love it too.
