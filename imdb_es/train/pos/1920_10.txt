['Paul Hennessy and his wife, Cate, must deal with their two teenage daughters and their strange son ... But after the premature death of John Ritter, the show became more about how to deal with the loss of a loved one ... <br /><br /> I found this program, going through the channels one afternoon and I have to say that I was laughing until my ribs ached, simply because of the variety of characters; the ingenious lines and the situation in which Paul would be dealing mainly with his daughters ... From then on, I caught the rest of the program when I was free and I have to say that the writing was very good ... But then I read about The death of John Ritter ... Shortly after I observed &#39;Goodbye&#39; part 2 and I must say that I was almost crying, watching the emotions of the characters, losing a loved one ... How Rory hits a wall with anger and frustration. ... How does Cate deal with having to sleep alone in her bed ... Briget and Kerry talk about what they should have done? <br /><br /> But the show goes ahead, bringing along Jim Egan and CJ Barnes, who laugh, while Cate&#39;s father tries to protect his family and gives Rory &quot;talks about men&quot; ... But the real gem is CJ ... who is absolutely hilarious as the wild cousin. <br /><br /> It will always be John Ritter&#39;s masterpiece.']
