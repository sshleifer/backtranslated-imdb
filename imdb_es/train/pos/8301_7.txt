Gary Busey is the main character, Frank "Bulletproof" McBain, his reckless rebel and standard problem policeman who earned his nickname because no matter how many bullets he takes (38 and continues), he never stops chasing the bad guys. <Br /> <br /> When a vanguard US tank nicknamed "Thunderblast" is driven across the border into Mexico, it is captured by revolutionaries / terrorists led by General Brogado (Rene Enríquez) and Colonel Libio Kartiff (Henry Silva), who is aligned. With the Russian villains. The Army personnel involved remain as prisoners, the main one of them, Devon Shepard (Darlanne Fluegel), who is McBain's ex-girlfriend. McBain is then recruited by the Army for a rescue mission. <br /> <br /> It is possible that Busey does not have the physical presence of, for example, someone like Schwarzenegger, who would have been another appropriate leader for a film of this type, but an explosion as a sure type of himself that It's quick with the jokes. Fluegel is a great female protagonist; She not only looks incredibly sexy, but also makes her a good action girl. Enríquez, Silva, Juan Fernández and the always welcome William Smith (as a Russian student) are detestable scandals in the classic tradition of action movies. The cast of support is quite full of actors of known and reliable characters: L.Q. Jones, R.G. Armstrong, Thalmus Rasulala, Lincoln Kilpatrick, Mills Watson, Luke Askew, Danny Trejo and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa. <br /> <br /> T.L. Lankford and B.J. Goldman supplied the script, based on a story by Lankford and the veteran director of B, Fred Olen Ray. It is the kind of script in which you only know that writers have their tongue on their cheeks: they know that their material is absurd and corny, and they simply have fun throwing credibility out the window. Veteran action director Steve Carver keeps him moving and offers a respectable amount of shots, explosions and general chaos. <br /> <br /> "Bulletproof" is a lot of fun for the action aficionado who does not mind turning off his brain from time to time and just enjoying a generous variety of violence and humor. <br /> <br /> 7/10
