The Tattooed Stranger was another of those rare B movies that BBC2 screened at Christmas / New Year 2005-2006. See also They Live By Night and The Brighton Strangler. <br /> <br /> In this, a man walking his dog in Central Park finds an abandoned car and discovers a dead woman inside. They shot him and the police then tried to identify her with just one tattoo as the main clue. After being identified, the murderer is discovered and is shot at the end of the shooting. <br /> <br /> Most of this movie was filmed in a place in New York and its surroundings, so we can see some areas of the city. We do not normally see, especially in the back streets. <br /> <br /> Most of the unknowns are in the cast, with John Miles earning maximum billing. <br /> <br /> It's worth looking for The Tattooed Stranger. Excellent but quite dark. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 stars out of 5.
