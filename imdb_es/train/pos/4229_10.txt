Do not waste your time reading my review. Get out and see this amazingly good episode, which could well be the best Columbo ever written! Ruth Gordon is perfectly cataloged as the intriguing and charming mystery writer who murders her son-in-law to avenge the murder of her daughter. Columbo is his usual self wrinkled, dazed and much smarter than he seems, and this particular installment presents fantastic chemistry between Gordon and Falk. Ironically, this was not written by the announced creators Levinson or Link, but it is possibly Columbo's most dense, most original and loaded story plot. Absolutely satisfactory in almost all departments and brimming with ingenious and ingenious thoughts and dialogues. The truly unexpected and inventive climax surpasses everything. 10/10 ... search this one on Netflix!
