I have also gone through a very painful personal loss (Twice) and this movie shows very well the heartrending reality of that experience, Life out of balance, nothing makes sense, well intentioned relatives, etc ... <br /> <br /> It was nice to see Ally again. She is one of my favorite movie actors of all time. <br /> <br /> I laughed and cried as the story unfolds. Great story and cast. Well done!
