This movie is visually stunning. Who cares if he can act or not. Each scene is a work of art composed and captured by John Derek. The locations, the scenographies and the costumes work perfectly to convey what is found in a love story composed of beauty, youth and wealth. In a way I would like to see this movie as a tribute to the story of John and Bo Derek. And ... this comment would not be complete without mentioning the role of Anthony Quinn as father, mentor, lover and his representation of a man, of men, lost in a bygone era when men were men. Some of us find courage in strength and direction wrapped in a confidence that contributes to a sense of trust, restraint and security. Yes, they do not make men like that anymore! But, then, how often do you find women who become like Bo Derek?
