I had the privilege of having seen some fragments of the original Aardman presentation of this show in the United Kingdom. It was always fun and always fun. None of the charms has been lost in translation, it is as recent as the people interviewed, whether some of them are written or not, as has been rumored, is irrelevant. It is always entertaining. <br /> <br /> The animations of Aardman show a great imagination in the characters used for each voice, the only aspect that I probably like the most about the show and its concept (the hostility between the pandas, the porcupines that talk about the fear). of needles, the simian painting). Regular customers also grow in you, like Maryland horse and donkey teens, most married couples (parrots, insects and cats, for example) and the childish voice character, and I've really come to dig the ferret! Monday has finally become a day to look forward to.
