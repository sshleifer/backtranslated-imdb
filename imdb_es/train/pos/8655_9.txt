"Kalifornia" is one of my favorite movies of all time, and could easily be labeled one of the best psychological thrillers of the 90s. The film has a very elegant surface, but behind it there are many honest and disturbing representations of homicidal maniacs and the terrible violence they inflict on others. One of the strongest aspects of the film is its performance, Brad Pitt is surprisingly great as a trailer psycho called Early. Pitt potrays his terrifying character almost without problems. Juliette Lewis is equally good at playing her naive girlfriend, her innocence is almost heartbreaking. "Kalifornia" has a very simple plan, which progresses steadily and slowly for about an hour, but suddenly plunges into a heart-wrenching series of murders, while Pitt unleashes his psychotic personality. There are many shocking scenes, and everything is mounted in a climax that will chase you for days. "Kalifonia" is a film that should really be seen to see how you can be a human being, and not only for its violence and gore.
