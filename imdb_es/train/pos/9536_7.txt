A disturbed and graphically bloody Japanese film about small beings that take people and turn them into necroborg-zombie-type machines that are hit and chopped together so that the winner can eat the loser. In the middle of this, a couple of lovers get infected. <br /> <br /> The horror comedy (?) Technically excellent is only for those with strong stomachs while blood and body parts are going to fly. Good taste prevents me from describing what happens here, but let's say it's pretty scary. If you like this kind of thing with several steps above the thin content, watch this movie. Personally, I usually do not enjoy movies like this in anything, but in the way they get sick and become clumsy. Here I was intrigued enough to be able to suggest it to people I know who like really bloody movies. It is also a film with enough details that I want to see again from now on that I know what was happening. Revealed at the end: I want to go back and see what I did not understand. There is a strange internal logic in these films. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 people who like blood and cut limbs, is a zero or, more precisely, an alert to run and hide for everyone else.
