['Recently, on cable television, the film begins with a disclaimer that moves away from any cooperation of real-life people; which in itself is an attraction for the eyes. However, the script and the performance of the main characters are excellent and I found myself absorbed in everything. Due in large part to the clear, thoughtful and interesting dialogue. The film is about a meeting in a day between two real-life musical &quot;legends&quot; that were previously composed together, then separated. The film captures the essence of their lives and philosophies, in a story that offers an explanation of their initial &quot;division&quot;. What is so impressive is that the actors give such realistic representations of the characters they play, failures and everything, that at least this viewer was left believing that he was witnessing a true event in almost every detail. The great ability of this work is that with a clever writing and a good performance, basically a film about &quot;two of us&quot; talking can be an excellent image. Worth at least 8 out of 10.']
