['Having been expelled from the house and the theater by the suffocating heat, I could not have been happier. The Road to Perdition, directed by Sam Mendes (American Beauty), is destined to become one of the best films of all time. Maybe I&#39;m getting old; Maybe I just saw the same themes recycled again and again. But this movie is in fact different. <br /><br /> The story begins with the young Michael Sullivan Jr. looking out to sea, contemplating the duality of his father&#39;s legacy: one of the best men he has ever lived, one of the most evil. This duality meanders throughout the film. The story revolves around crime boss John Rooney (Paul Newman) and Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks), the young man Rooney once took and who now serves as his personal &quot;Angel of Death&quot;. Rooney is tied to his own son&#39;s blood, but bound by love and loyalty to Michael. The young Michael Jr., intrigued by the stories he reads, escapes in his father&#39;s car one night while dad goes to &quot;work&quot; with Connor Rooney, heir to the family &quot;business&quot;. Connor lets the situation get out of control, and what was meant to be just a warning becomes murder. Presented by Michael Jr. Upon discovering that the young Michael has seen what he should not have seen, the plan is set in motion as conflicting loyalties collide. Soon, Michael Sr. is running away with his small son, pursued by hitman Harlen &quot;The Reporter&quot; Maguire (Jude Law). <br /><br /> I will not reveal more details to avoid possible spoilers. However, I strongly encourage viewers to examine the many dualities presented in the film: Problems between parents and children (Michael Sr and Jr., John Rooney and son Connor), between the world at home and the world in &quot; work &quot;, between good and evil, between those who pretend to be men of God and those who really are, between&quot; clean &quot;and&quot; dirty &quot;money, between the city of Doom and Perdition as hell. And on the way, savor the visual brilliance of the director of photography Conrad L. Hall (9 nominations, 2 oscars to the best photography): rain that comes out of the fins, shots through mirrors (especially in swinging doors), flashes of tommy-gun from the shadows, without any sound. Hall, 75, has not only given us the best film product of his career, but Paul Newman, 77, offers one of his best performances. <br /><br /> Yes ... I may be getting old. But I&#39;ve seen a lot ... and this is fresh and invigorating. The Road to Perdition presents a lasting and loving tribute to the genre of gangsters, to the films of the 1940s, to the dark figures of comics that lurk in the dark, to villains and heroes, to American cinema in general. Go see it!']
