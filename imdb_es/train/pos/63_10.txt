This movie is so misunderstood that it's not even funny. If you think about seeing this for the shots ... stay clear. It deals with the effects and trauma survivors must endure. Even detectives are looking for the answer we all do ... WHY? Fantastic performance of the two main ladies to see how people we ignore are affected by the same things that we are affected. Yes, the language is hard at times, but it adapts well to the characters. There are some loose ends to the left or no answer, but all movies have these. The main issues are addressed and this film makes an important statement about how we all adults feel after such important incidents. Highly recommended for teenagers and adults.
