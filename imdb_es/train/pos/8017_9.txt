This time, the hen Kermit, Fozzie, Miss Piggy, Scooter, Rowlf, The Electric Mayhem, Gonzo and Camilla are out of college and star in a musical they try to play on Broadway. After failing miserably to make it happen, they all separated and took separate paths. I love the characters and the cameos. The songs in the film are "Together Again", "Look at Me, Here I am", "Saying Goodbye", "And I'm Always Love You", "Rat Jazz" and "He will make me happy". "Frank Oz directs this film in an excellent way and all the actors do a great job acting as if the Muppets were real, look at it, 91 minutes, Rating G. My rating: A.
