There are moments in the movie that are so terrible, that your teeth hurt. But knowing that it only took a few weeks for the Code to make the movies innocuous and nondescript, Paramount hastened to put this into production before the innuendoes and jokes went out of style. Vanities is so horribly anti feminine that it's delicious. As Kitty Carlisle sings, women are shown with price tags that insult a prostitute in the Bronx. They arise from the clams (nudge, nudge, wink, wink) in positions of absolute submission. Minions of the law, so stupid that they can not find the door, can look at their skirts and laugh. The choir girls with bare breasts feel uncomfortable in giant cactus (Could they be a source of hallucinogens, perhaps?) While listening to "Sweet Marijuana" and watching how blood falls on the chest of a Korean. <br /> <br /> Sure, Carl Brisson learned his lines phonetically and does not seem to have any idea what he's saying. But it's worth it, since Norma steals the show while nobody looks at it. <br /> <br /> Taking a moment of this fragile fluff seriously does not take into account the point of the whole exercise. Watch it with a founding member of NOW and get ready to justify all the Hollywood machismo between body shots. <br /> <br /> By the way, Toby Wing is the icing on the cake. And Duke Ellington does not hurt either. <br /> <br /> A must wander through Memory Lane.
