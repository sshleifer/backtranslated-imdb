I saw this as a previous viewer by accident, I've seen it twice now. I enjoyed it very much, without silly provocative messages just fun, good songs, good characters and just a good movie. Highly recommended for those of us who like to enjoy movies and not dissect them. Great fun for the whole family. here. I did not realize that Rosie Alvarez is played by Vanessa Williams, she is excellent and very sensual. The songs like One Boy and One last Kiss are really nice to listen and take your feet so that Jason Alexander is the complete contrast with his character in Pretty Woman and is very good. Tyne Daley still stays in my mind of Cagney and Lacey, and her voice and accent still have that memory. In general, I loved it and will look to buy it if it is available
