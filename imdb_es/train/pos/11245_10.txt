The first time I saw "Breaking Glass" in 1980, I thought it would be one of the "Movie Classics". This movie is a great look at the music industry with a large cast of artists. This is a movie that should be in everyone's collection and anyone who wants to enter the music industry. I can not wait for it to be available on DVD.
