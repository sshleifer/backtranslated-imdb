It's been about 50 years since a movie about romance and mysticism was made. The only two films I can think of are "Enchanted April" (1992) and "The Enchanted Cottage" (1945). Both films use wonderful actors, not stars. In both films, all the actors gave their best romantic performances. <br /> <br /> "Abril Encantado" is about four English women after the First World War who are dissatisfied with their lives and find happiness in Italy while on vacation. Is incredible. "Abril Encantado" was made in 1992. It stands out as a nice classic.
