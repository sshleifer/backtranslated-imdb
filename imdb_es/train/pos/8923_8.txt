['The Blob is a classic science fiction movie from the 1950s. You probably know the story: two teenagers (Steve McQueen and Aneta Corsaut) see a meteor hitting the ground, and when they go to look for it, they meet an old man with a stranger ... drop stuck to his arm. They take it to the doctor&#39;s office and then they go to find out what happened. From there, the stain spreads, eating everyone in its path. The special effects are fun as the story. There are many great touches, like the policeman playing chess on the radio with a policeman in another district. It is not a masterpiece, but it has a special place in its genre. Steve McQueen is very good. 8/10.']
