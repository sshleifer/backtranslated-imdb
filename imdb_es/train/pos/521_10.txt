This is probably one of the most original love stories I've seen for years, especially for a war-based movie (briefly). Basically it is a story based on two worlds, one obviously real and one fictional, but the filmmakers say at the beginning that it is only a coincidence if it is a real place. Anyway, Peter Carter (the great David Niven) was going to crash on a plane, spoke with June (the planet of the apes, Kim Hunter) before rescuing and saying that he loved her. He was destined to die for jumping without a parachute, but somehow he survived, and now he is seeing and loving June in the flesh. This other place, like a sky, is unhappy because he survived and was destined to come to his world, so they send the French Driver 71 (Marius Goring) to persuade him to go, but obviously he is in love. Peter suggests that he must appeal to keep his life in the court of the other world, this is granted. Obviously, love prevails when the two lovers announce that they will die for each other, June even offers to take her place! Also starring Robert Coote as Bob Trubshawe, Kathleen Byron as An Angel, a brief (then unknown) Lord Sir Richard Attenborough as An English Pilot and Abraham Sofaer as The Judge / The Surgeon. David Niven was number 36 in The 50 Greatest British Actors, the film was number 86 in The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers for the happy ending, it was number 47 in The 100 Greatest War Films, it was number 46 in The 50 Greatest British Films , and it was number 59 in The 100 Best Movies. Exceptional!
