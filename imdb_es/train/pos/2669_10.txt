['This tale set in the outskirts of Wellington, New Zealand (Tawa -home of the renowned Tawa College) is the first feature of McCarten. <br /><br /> With a contemporary New Zealand flavor, Via Satellite abounds in absolutely fun situations that take place in the family context (adult). At the same time he manages to invoke intense emotions of sadness and despair. <br /><br /> One of the most moving and fun films of the year, you can not miss it!']
