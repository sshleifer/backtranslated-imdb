['Så som i himmelen, the warm heart of Kay Pollak in 2004 / As in heaven, it contains all the stereotypes of Swedish humanity and inhumanity, but manages to please the crowd. It contains a lot of ammunition for cynical critics, continuity error detectors and for detractors of saccharin, although it manages to represent the colors of life in a small community in an evocative way. The film also covers the whole gamut of proverbial messages about &quot;finding one&#39;s own voice&quot; and &quot;simply doing it in spite of fear&quot;, without completely eliminating the bulk of the throats of cynics. <br /><br /> Your success in pleasing the crowd comes from two facts. First, the small films about strangers that bring new life to rural Christian communities offer ample scope for exposing hypocrisy and, at the same time, allow repressed characters to come out of their shirts. The same year and with a similar Swedish breeze, the Queen of the Sheba Pearls did it, and the Babette Festival also comes to mind. Secondly, any film about small communities that confront the whole world will play a human chord in our increasingly individual / self-focused and impersonal world. The structural similarity of this film with people like The Full Monty, Brassed Off, Calendar Girls and On a Clear Day shows its indebtedness with the formula. But it&#39;s still a living formula, and this seems to be because people need films of positive messages that evoke a sense of community almost in spite of themselves. <br /><br /> The unknown is the master Daniel Daréus burned in a search for self-rediscovery. The city he visits, or rather revisits, is, without the knowledge of the inhabitants of the city, the place of his childhood. He was ruthlessly hounded by classmates here, allegedly because he was a sensitive musician with no aspiration to drive a truck. Here, he takes the job of cantor / choir director, despite the usual suspicions of artists and outsiders. The place is, of course, populated by a wide range of recognizable types whose arcs of characters can be predicted: the girl with blond hair and broken heart, so beautiful that she almost shines; the local businessman who rings on the cell phone; the woman whose beauty is lost in the middle of domestic abuse; the staunch pastor and his less austere wife, who at first seem taken from Ingmar Bergman. Also present: jealous, tense spinster (Siv) (check); geriatric whose soul still sings (see); elderly couple who may have repressed their wishes from daycare (check); obese person whose function is to point out that we should not laugh and say &quot;fat&quot; (mark); Child with intellectual disability who demonstrates being able to sing a good &#39;A&#39; (check). <br /><br /> However, Pollak&#39;s film is not entirely warm. It deviates from the subgenre &#39;let&#39;s put on a show despite setbacks and moral opposition&#39;. It contains violence and an ending that could well be a metaphor of dying after reaching creative nirvana. The violence of the film is mainly a function of male anger and repression, but it never delves into why the bully of the school who becomes a puncher is like that. Similarly, the shepherd of the small town adheres so closely to the moralistic and superpressing stereotype that he wears a black suit, that his secret indulgence in girls&#39; magazines is not surprising. Their repressions and hypocrisies are there, hanging without relation to the psychological reality. Perhaps the inexplicable photograph of a child, perhaps a lost son, glimpsed once over his shoulder, keeps the secret. <br /><br /> Perhaps these orifices are functions of the edition, like several inconsistencies and failures of continuity that can be detected, like the inexplicable reappearance of Siv in the chorus (twice) after the moralistic outbursts. In fact, none of the hooks in the film last a long time and all seem resolved within a scene. Apart from some uncomfortable love scenes, the 127 minutes of the film are rarely prolonged, but there is a feeling that things may have remained on the floor of the cutting room. <br /><br /> The film remains solid for three stars despite the holes that can be opened. This is simply because in a world of technology-focused films and a materialistic self-search, any vision of the human community is, in the end, welcome for anyone, even cynics.']
