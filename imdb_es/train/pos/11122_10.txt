When we started watching this series on cable, I had no idea how addictive it would be. Even when you hate a character, you hold back because they are very well developed, you can almost understand why they react to frustration, fear, greed or temptation the way they do. It's almost as if the viewer is experiencing one of Christopher's learning curves. <br /> <br /> I can not understand why Adriana would endure Christopher's abuse towards her, verbally, physically and emotionally, but I just have to read. The newspaper to see how many women can and tolerate such behavior. Carmella has a dream house, an endless supply of expensive things, but I'm sure she would leave him for a loving and faithful husband, or maybe not. That's why I see it. <br /> <br /> No matter how many times you see an episode, you can find something that you missed the first five times. We even see episodes out of sequence (see season 1 at night with announcements, but all the language, A & E with censored language, repetitions in the movie network): every time they are, we are there. Now we have been totally spoiled. <br /> <br /> I also love Malaprop. "A white tuna around my neck" is my favorite of Johnny Boy. When these jewels have entered into the vocabulary of our family, it is a sign that I must obtain a life. I will do it when the series ends, and I have compiled all the DVDs and put the collection in my will.
