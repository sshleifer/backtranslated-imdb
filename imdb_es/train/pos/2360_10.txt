He felt that he was very balanced in showing what Jehovah's Witnesses have done to protect American liberties. He also showed the strong faith of two families who were witnesses of first generation. I also appreciated how it was shown how becoming a Jehovah's Witness affects family members who are not witnesses and how difficult it is for them to accept the fact that they do not celebrate holidays, the sad thing is that families that are not Witnesses do not intend to invite their witness family to family dinners / visits or give them gifts at any other time other than holidays or birthdays. When it comes to medical care, witnesses want and expect a high level of medical care, what people forget is that blood transfusions allow medical care and careless surgeries, while bloodless treatments make the medical team be highly qualified and trained, what would you prefer to treat your loved ones? I highly recommend this video!
