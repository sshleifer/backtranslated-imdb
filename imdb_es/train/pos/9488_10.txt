Very memorable, intelligent and suspenseful film by one of the true geniuses of French films, the formidable Henri Verneuil. The plot is an exact parallel to the JFK murder, and it takes place in a fictional non-descriptive country. The film, both visual and plot, is clear. Taken with meticulous precision, follow Henry Volnay, the prosecutor who is responsible for unraveling the blow. In many ways, it is a very disturbing film, not only because of the cold and analytical precision of its commentary on the so-called inner workings of the modern state. The atmosphere and the characters are completely credible, and Verneuil left nothing to chance in his plot. On another level, this relatively little-known film only had a 15-year lead over Oliver Stone, who was hailed by the movie "JFK," an inferior movie in many areas, the least of which is credibility ... <br /> <br /> It is a masterpiece, any film lover should see it, preferably in its original French version with subs.
