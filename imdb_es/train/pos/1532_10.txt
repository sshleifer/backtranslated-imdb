This, like Murder She Wrote, is one of those programs, which after a stressful day at school, I sit in front of the TV and watch. Why? Because I really enjoy it, and it's a shame that it's no longer in the air. Dick Van Dyke is amazing when Dr. Mark Sloan, a doctor turned detective, who with his son, solves murders. He is joined by a cast of support largely unknown but very competent, namely, his real-life son, Barry Van Dyke. Victoria Rowell is also good, but I noticed that each series changes her hairstyle. I also liked Scott Baio and Charlie Schlatter, but I particularly loved Michael Tucci as Norman, and I was surprised how he suddenly disappeared. This show is so entertaining, with great guest stars, sometimes it's a bit obvious, like Colombo, but in each episode, there's always something to laugh about. In conclusion, a great series, with two thumbs up and a 10/10. Bethany Cox
