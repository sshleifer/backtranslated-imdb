First, let's start with the negative points: 1) There are HUGE, huge gaps in the story line and the questions that are posed that will not get anywhere; 2) The film is not for all people, so the discourteous viewers will become uneasy and start barking during the movie. <br /> <br /> Point two above is important because the movie is very calm. In a theater of older type (like the one I visited), you can hear the reel through the projector sometimes. I loved that. The film does not keep you busy with music, or with the effects: it allows you to reflect on what is happening. <br /> <br /> There is a lack of rhythm that generates a fascinating and absolutely pleasant atmosphere. The same kind of atmosphere generated by Stanley Kubrick in Eyes Wide Shut. Not for all people. <br /> <br /> I would recommend it to film fans, since the film work is incredible. Those who base their appreciation of a film solely on history will be completely disappointed. It's the kind of story you have to create the links in your mind afterwards. (My version is pretty good, but probably off the track!) If you're going to watch the movie, there's a very interesting part: when the two cops are talking to each other from their cell phones. An ultra-cool sound effect that really puts you in the moment. Congratulations to the person who thought of doing this.
