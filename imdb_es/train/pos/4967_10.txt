This film is a must for all people who enjoy football as an art. What surprises first of this film about a soccer world cup is the way it was filmed. In addition to following the game as a TV broadcast, there are generous images dedicated to following individual players in the games. This brings forward the emotions and situations that these men go through when they try to achieve glory. Today's TV broadcasting style, so different from that of 1986, is still inferior in quality compared to this movie. <br /> <br /> Players are not the only stars. The audience, the referees, the journalists covering the matches and the environment itself play a central role in the development of what is now history. In this movie you can see how all these factors play together in a very explicit way. In that sense, today's TV broadcasting style has not yet reached this level of quality, although now it is much closer than before. <br /> <br /> There are several outstanding players: Maradona (Argentina), Elkjaer and Laudrup (Denmark). ), Francescoli (Uruguay), Platini (France), Lineker (England), Rummenigge (Germany), Butrague # o (Spain), Sócrates (Brazil) and Sánchez (Mexico). <br /> <br /> This movie is not a collection of the best soccer movements of Mexico 1986, although most of them are well covered. Throughout the film, there is an emphasis on the presentation of various aspects of the game and the competition depending on the progress of these players and teams, even at the cost of skipping the relevant plays of the games. This is what makes this movie so interesting and unique. <br /> <br /> Due to what happened due to the referees during Mexico 1986, many of the comments about this film and the world cup are very skewed by Maradona. Many of these comments do not take into account that there is an arbitrator and two line judges, who are as human as the players and that all the errors mentioned above make mistakes in one way or another. The rules of football do not allow referees to use TV-based reps to make decisions, so for the most part referees have to decide what they perceive. As a consequence, referees play an active role in the development of a game. His influence can be seen in several parts of this film. <br /> <br /> The sequel to the 1990 World Cup, compared to this one, is only a source of bitter disappointment. Much of this stems from the fact that he became too involved in the game, while this film tells things from a more distant and impartial point of view.
