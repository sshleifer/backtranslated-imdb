The best show since Seinfeld. She is really very funny. His total egocentrism, the huge homosexual neighbors, the games in songs or cartoons, make this the coolest program on television. One of the few shows I want to see. The scene with the wise old black woman in the pharmacy ("Oh, wait, now that you are close, you look old", she puts her face to face with her finger and moves away hahaha), the overdose of cough syrup, sleep with God, everything is so funny or so stupid that it is very funny. The weak points of the program are his sister and the policeman, just because they are too normal! I really can not wait until the next show, something I have not felt for any show in a long time.
