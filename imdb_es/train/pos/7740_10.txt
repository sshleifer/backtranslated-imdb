It is rare that one encounters a film as impeccable as this one. It's really one of the best structured and best structured movies I've seen. Each line of dialogue can be interpreted in several ways, in relation to each of the three main characters differently. The film weaves an intrinsic network of motivations and double crosses that catch you and refuse to let go. Add to this that the slow-burning romance between Kevin and Faye is as touching as anything that has been committed to celluloid and has the ingredients for a perfect movie. It exposes the romance of films like "Titanic" like the clich√©s that are hackneyed. If you are looking for a movie to watch while folding clothes, it is not like that. You have to commit to this movie. You can not have a conversation while running in and out of the room. This movie demands your attention. Treat him with the respect he deserves and you will get a lot from him. Unless you think "Titanic" is the best movie in history.
