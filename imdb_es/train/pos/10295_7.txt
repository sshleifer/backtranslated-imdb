Ok, so it's not a masterpiece like the Godfather, but it does not have to be. The only purpose of this film is to make the viewer laugh several times. If it can make the viewer laugh a lot of times, it has served its purpose. I laughed out loud and left with a smile. I feel like I have the value of my money.
