In general, I totally agree with the Ebert review. In a way, I feel like I should not even be commenting, since it's a veterinarian movie and I'm not a veterinarian (I was a registration agent). The flaw is that Martha is very underdeveloped and does not act consistently. I suppose Stephen Metcalfe is a veterinarian and devoted very little time to planning his character.
