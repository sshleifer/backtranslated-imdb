['The film begins with a group of children at the reform school and focuses on a boy named &#39;Gabe&#39;, who has apparently worked hard to get his parole. Gabe and his sister move to a new neighborhood to start over again and soon Gabe meets the Dead End Kids. The children in this movie are little punks, but they are much less antisocial than in previous movies and, in the end, they are well-meaning punks. However, in this neighborhood there are also some criminals who are committing insurance fraud through arson and see Gabe as a convenient scapegoat. After all, he had gone to school to reform and no one would believe he was innocent once he was locked up. Then, when Gabe is about to be sent back to &quot;The Big House,&quot; it&#39;s up to the rest of the gang to save him and expose the real thieves. <br /><br /> The &quot;Dead End Kids&quot; appeared in several Warner Brothers films in the late 1930s and the films were generally very good (particularly ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES). However, after the contracts of the boys expired, they went to Monogram Studios and the films, to put it in a charitable way, were very weak and formal, with Huntz Hall and Leo Gorcey being practically the whole show and the group went on to called &quot;The Bowery Boys&quot;. Because ANGELS WASHED ITS FACES they had excellent writing and production values. And Hall and Gorcey were not constantly assaulting the camera, it&#39;s a pretty good movie, and you almost get a score of 7 (it&#39;s REAL). In fact, while this is not a great film aesthetically, it&#39;s very fun to watch, so I&#39;ll give it a 7! Sure, it was a bit weird, particularly towards the end when the children take the law into their own hands and Reagan ignores the Bill of Rights, but it was also quite entertaining. The Dead End Kids are doing their best performances and Ronald Reagan and Ann Sheridan provided excellent support. Of course, this part of the movie was illogical and impossible, but somehow it was still fun and quite charming, so if you can suspend disbelief, it works fine.']
