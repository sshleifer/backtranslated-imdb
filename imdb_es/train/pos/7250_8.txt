The first time I read the book, when I was a teenager, I saw a movie late one night. About a year ago I reviewed it in IMDb and did not discover available copies. Then I connected to the web and found a site that offers War Films, so I'm glad I did, I asked for a copy, I lay back and I could confirm why I wanted to see it again. <br /> <br /> In my opinion to really enjoy the movie, I suggest you read a copy of the book and then watch the movie. The book is no longer printed, but I tracked a copy through E-bay, author Alan White was a paratrooper / commando during World War II who participated in disparate clandestine operations and this was his first book. It is written by someone who knows and this fact I think gives authenticity to books and movies. I have not given ten ten to the movie just because of the nature of the end of the movie, not as good as the book. There are also a couple of arguments that differ from the book, which is strange, since the book is not about the nature of war on a large scale, but about the individual in war. The film illustrates this exceptionally well. I have the copy of the book for my son to read and then the film for him to see, in that order. <br /> <br /> If you can trace it in the book and in the movie, it's definitely worth it. And I just wish I was more available to read and see, one of my best war movies, ever!
