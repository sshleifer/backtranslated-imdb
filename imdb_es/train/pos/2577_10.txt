My father grew up and grew up watching George Reeves as Superman, and when he was little he had episodes on VHS and he allowed me to see them including this movie (transmitting them to the family, if he wishes), and I loved it. <Br /> <br /> Clark Kent and Lois Lane are sent to a small town with an oil mine and from the mine radioactive mole men emerge and the aim of the city is supposed to be deadly and it's up to Superman to stop this chaos. <br /> <br /> It's so wonderful and fun to watch. Special effects and old-style sound: the crew achieved such beauty with so little technology. George Reeves was my hero when I was a child, and now I am 16 years old, it only shows how timeless and classic these adventures are.
