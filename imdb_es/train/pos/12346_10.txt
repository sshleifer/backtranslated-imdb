This is a very fine and poetic story. Beautiful landscape Magnificent musical score. I was twice in Japan last year and the movie gave me this typical Japanese feeling. The movement of the camera is excellent, as well as the actors. Deepen your feelings without becoming melodramatic. The Japanese are very sensitive and kind and everything is very well put on the screen here. The director is playing excellent with clear and bright colors and shows the audience that it is also possible to allow them to enjoy a movie with subtle and fine details. Once you've seen this movie, you'll want to see more of the same director. It's a movie that feels very good and I can only recommend it to everyone.
