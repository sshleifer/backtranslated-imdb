The great and underestimated Marion Davies shows her stuff in this late silent comedy (1928) that also shows the wonderful William Haines. Davies plays a trick of Georgia that crashes in Hollywood with the help of Haines. They appear in cheap comedies until Marion is "discovered" and becomes a great dramatic star. A great labyrinth about hollywood and its pretensions. Davies and Haines are a wonderful team (too bad they never did a talkie together) and the guest fliers like Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, John Gilbert, Elinor Glynn and Marion Davies (must see is) are a scream. A must for any movie buff or anyone interested in the still defamed Marion Davies!
