You play as B.J. Blazkowicz, a tough guy from the US secret agent's soldier. UU Who is sent to discover the Nazi secret and change the course of the Second World War. That means everything, from leaving a Nazi dungeon to thwarting Hitler's war machine and even the FÃ¼hrer himself. <br /> <br /> This is possibly the most influential game of its time. That's because it literally inspired the obsession. Many games existed at that time and even more than today, but from time to time you get a true captor. This is one of them. Like Tetris before and more recently GTA III in 2002. Yes, Doom is better in almost every respect, but the shots that were heard around the world that led to one of the biggest tides in the game were caused by B.J. Blazkowicz. The space marine, Duke Nukem, Max Payne, Serious Sam, John Mullins, JC Denton, Agent 47, Gordon Freeman and other legions owe their existence to the ID guys. Either directly or, in most cases, indirectly, but still do it. <br /> <br /> Even with its old look, very old graphics, super simple gameplay (this is really a game, the games are now on the edge of the "level experience") and highly rectangular levels, the reach of the Six episodes provides a lot of fun. Especially discovering those secrets with treasures and a chaingun in them. <br /> <br /> Also: "Stop!" *explosion! explosion! bang! * "AARRRGH !!!" never ages --- 8/10 <br /> <br /> Voluntarily rated PC-13 for "deep butchery". However, it is exceptionally docile compared to what the games have today.
