I remember that I had a pretty low regard for a company like this when it was launched for the first time. James "Not Jim" Belushi, a hammy actress and a cheesy title in a John Hughes formula. You could not have paid me to see it 15 years ago. But I got stuck watching it while wasting a Sunday afternoon, and it hits me on a couple of levels. The fairy tale (part Pretty Woman, part reverse Pretty Woman), the very vulnerable, Elizabeth_Perkins_in_Miracle_On_42nd_Street, as the performance of Kelly Lynch, escapism. Above all, gently pull some very beautiful strings. It's hard enough not to fall into history, fall in love with Kelly Lynch, identify with James Belushi, dislike the stiff boyfriend of the bad boy and laugh at Curley Sue's lines. It has all the ups and downs, with a happy ending and the kind of message you want to hear. Go ahead, waste your time in this movie, it's worth it.
