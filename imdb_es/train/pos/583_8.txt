In a small town in Montana two brothers grow up. One of them is Norman (Craig Sheffer), the other is Paul (Brad Pitt). His father is Reverend Maclean and they grow up with their lessons that have to do with religion and the lessons of fly fishing. In this film, fly fishing represents life, a little. <br /> <br /> The story is good and keeps your attention, although in some moments you need a bit of action. Probably the film has these moments because it is not really about the events that happen, but about the message. Some things happen however. Norman goes to Dartmouth to study. After six years, he returns and gets involved with a pretty girl named Jessie (Emily Lloyd) and is invited to teach in Chicago. Paul has become a reporter and is known as the "fishing reporter". He is famous and seems to have a good life, but he drinks too much and plays too much. <br /> <br /> The film is very well directed, it has a good score and all the actors are good. The most beautiful thing about this movie is cinematography. The mountains, the forests and the river look very beautiful. If the movie was only made for these things, it was good enough to see it. Fortunately, there is more.
