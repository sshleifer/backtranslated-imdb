A few years ago, a friend received a video from Michael Mann's movie "Heat" from one of his other friends. After we finished that movie, and we were about to stop, we saw that there is another movie right after, it lasts on the envelope of the cassette that the owner did not write it. However, we were all glued to our seats for their distinctive opening, which lacked credits. <br /> <br /> About two hours later, I sat there thinking: how is it possible that I have not heard about this masterpiece before? .. <br /> <br /> This movie was Europe. Lars von Trier awakened the black cinema of deconstructed and dead reality with intentionally obvious scenes, but there was often a disquieting similarity with the postwar German photographs I saw. And then the complicated cuts! <br /> <br /> History itself is a difficult moral odyssey that does not have a happy ending. A young American pacifist of German descent comes to post-war Germany, with the intention of doing something good to pay for the bombs that his compatriots launched. But mostly it meets distrust and self-destructive challenge. He hires Zentropa, a company of cars to eat and sleep (inspired by Mitropa), whose owner is one of the Nazi collaborators that the occupants bleach. Our hero falls in love with his daughter, who later becomes a member of the Nazi terrorists of the werewolf, werewolf. When he no longer understands the world (or only the Europeans), in his fury, a railway bridge explodes underneath a train he has just saved. <br /> <br /> As a final note, for a historical correction: in In the real world, the werewolf was nowhere as important as the film implies, they were mostly a final blow to Nazi propaganda. After an SS unit assassinated the commander of Aachen, occupied by the allies, two months before the capitulation, the Nazis announced the creation of entire legions of saboteurs and terrorists who will be ready to fight behind the lines, the Man Wolf. But only a few hundred of the majority of Hitler's youth received some form of training, and while two or three times they were deployed to assassinate suspected communists or forced foreigners in the Bavarian villages to imprint a lasting fear on the inhabitants, with the death of Hitler and the end of the war. It fell apart. <br /> <br /> However, the propaganda of the werewolf had a profound effect on the occupants. They feared the werewolf everywhere, they suspected that he was behind a serious accident, but without exception another cause was found later (ignored by some recent pseudohistorians). For example, when a gas pipeline exploded at the Bremen police headquarters bombed, or when the Soviet military commander was killed in a motorcycle accident in Berlin. The effect was stronger in the Soviets, who arrested tens of thousands (mostly children!) 'Preventively' on suspicion of being a werewolf, and closed them in prison camps where many of them died.
