Deanna Durbin, Nan Gray and Barbara Read are "Three Smart Girls" in this Universal film of 1936, which presents Deanna Durbin to the cinema audience. It also stars Ray Milland, Mischa Auer, Charles Winninger, John King, Binnie Barnes and Alice Brady. It is a sweet story about three young women, who now live in Switzerland with their divorced mother, who hear that their father (Winninger) is getting married again. Having not seen him in 10 years and knowing that his mother still loves him, they boarded a ship to America, with the help of the housekeeper / nanny, determined to stop the wedding. Realizing that the intention, called "Precious" (Barnes) is nothing more than a gold seeker aided and abetted by her mother (Brady), they arrange for her to be presented to a rich Count. This is arranged by the accountant of his father (King). The man who chooses is a full-time drunkard (Auer), but the girls confuse him with a real rich earl (Milland). What a mess. <br /> <br /> This is a lovely movie, not cloying or too sweet at all, with some good performances, particularly from Auer, Milland, Barnes and Brady. The girls are pretty and they all do a good job. The emphasis, of course, is on the young Durbin, who is a natural actress and a beautifully trained singer. In fact, his youthful voice is much more uniform than it would be in adulthood: he has no problems with high notes, as he did later because he put too much weight on the middle voice. She sings a charming "Il Bacio" at a police station. <br /> <br /> One of the best things about the movie is seeing the father, played by Charles Winninger, not loving his children nearby, until he sees them. and get to know them. Barnes, like the gold prospector, is not that young, but the mother of the girls looks up, so the conclusion is probably that the older man seeks his youth with a younger, glamorous woman. In fact, he finds the young man he was looking for in his daughters. <br /> <br /> Universal gives Durbin the big build of stars here, she has the last chance in the movie. Ray Milland at this point was still paying his dues, and it's probably a surprise even for movie fans how young and attractive he is. <br /> <br /> Very entertaining and, of course, this led to a sequel and a great success. stardom for Deanna.
