"The Groove Tube" was one of only two films by Ken Shapiro, and the other one was "Modern Problems". This is just a large-scale parody of television. Aside from Shapiro, who apparently did not do anything after "Modern Problems," the film also stars Chevy Chase's cousin Henry Winkler, Richard Belzer. The three cast members (plus some other people in smaller roles) appear in several skits. One of the funniest is that of Chase in a geritol commercial, in which he describes medicine as the strips of his wife, and ends when she fucks him. There is also a pornographic news program, an irritating cooking show and the epic story of some drug dealers. <br /> <br /> Anyway, all this is a real problem. In my opinion, the three best TV impersonation movies are this, plus "Tunnelvision" and "Kentucky Fried Movie" (although it could also include "The Truman Show"). Really funny. <br /> <br /> I wonder what will have become of Ken Shapiro.
