An actor with problems finds that the best way to break into Hollywood is to start defeating the competition. But what makes Break a Leg a real gem is the sardonic look at the existence of the (and not so) Los Angeles actor who fights. It takes us to that world with irony and ingenuity without effort. He also has a refined appearance and a very skilful direction under Monika Mitchell. Break a Leg is one of those rare independent films that does not compromise their production values ​​at any level. The writing is tight, the dialogue first class. Cassini is an actor actor, and the role really shows his talents. The climactic scene between him and Rene Garcia is an instant classic, and it can become one of the most entertaining Hollywood scenes of all time. I saw it in an advanced projection, and everyone in the audience laughed uncontrollably and talked about it later.
