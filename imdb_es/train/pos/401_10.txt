I just returned from Hong Kong on my summer vacation and saw the Legend of ZU. I thought I was kicking * s! He was so creative and unique. It's Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon with much less drama. Even if some thought there were too many special effects (yes, of course!), You can not complain about the cast. Zhang Ziyi and Cecilia Cheung are doing very well! The Legend of ZU ..... kicks * s !!!!!!!!
