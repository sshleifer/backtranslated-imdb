This really fun movie has a cast of characters, almost all the voluptuous middle-aged women in Hollywood and a touching and funny love story. The Capomezza and the Malacici are rivals in an Italian neighborhood of New York. They are also at opposite ends of the flavor scale. Their children are chosen for the main roles of a production of the Romeo and Juliet church. Naturally, they fall in love. On the stage! The chaos and confusion that this causes, while the parents fight between them and their children, is presented to us in the context of the magnificent house without taste of Capomezza, and of its weddings attended with a magnificent flavor. <br /> <br /> In addition to the four exaggerated parents and charming young lovers, the characters include a vaguely wise priest, a simple-speaking grandmother, a lady waving a wand and transmitting the spiritual advice she receives from a medium called Blessed Roscoe, a Motel with beds in the shape of a car's back seat, and two pigeons. There is not a visual gag or a slash line that does not click on this fast-paced movie. <br /> <br /> Even the last names of the two families are part of the fun. "Capomezza" could be interpreted as "low eyebrows", and "Malacici" could mean "stuck snobs". <br /> <br /> If you are sensitive to Italian stereotypes, you may not like this movie. If Bette Midler embarrasses you, you may not like it, because all the women in this movie make Bette Midler look like Martha Stewart. The rest of us must love him!
