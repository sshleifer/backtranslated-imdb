I am anime. I've been in this long before it becomes a national phenomenon; He loved Ranma before most people knew what Dragonball Z was. And just so you know I'm not bragging about myself, let me tell you this: of all the cheer I've seen, Castle in the Sky is by far one of the best. It is obvious that people say that Spirited Away is the best, but I really do not agree. Most people only know that movie because it's an Acedmy Award; This is not an exaggeration: I showed the princess Mononoke and Castle in the Sky to people who had only seen Spirited Away, and they agree that the last two are the superiors at three. Personally, I had never thought that something could compare with the princess Mononoke, until finally I saw the castle in the sky. I still think the prior is the better of the two, but Castle in the Sky is easily on par with him; In many ways, the castle has major elements that Mononoke was missing. In any case, if you've only seen Spirited Away, and you think that's Miyazaki's best movie, get ready to shake your land.
