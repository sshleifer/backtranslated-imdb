Kubrick once again demonstrated his brilliance, now in a horror and suspense film based on Stephen King's book titled in the same way. Jack Torrance is a man of about forty, married, with a son and with a past of problems and alcoholism. The Overlook Hotel in Colorado suspends the service during the winter due to its extreme weather, and there is a well paid job for the person who takes care of the facilities during those five months; and Torrance, who was looking to become a writer, found it perfect. But, the manager informed Torrance about the loneliness in this place during the winter, potentially dangerous, and told him that a caregiver in the past went crazy and murdered his family. Even before they arrived, his son Danny, who has a kind of imaginary friend that illuminates him in the future (bright), knew that the place was not good and he did not want to go. Once they settled into the hotel, things started well, but in a month, Jack began to act strangely, irritated and depressed. At this point, we know that something is going to happen, but we do not know when and how. Terrifying things happen, like the appearance of two twins talking to Danny and someone who attacked him violently. You are not alone in this place. Later, Jack started seeing other people and immediately felt good about them, as if they were his family; among them the famous psychotic caregiver, Delbert Grady. Grady tells Torrance that he must kill his family because they are "intruders" at the hotel. Obeying this order, Jack went for the goal and many of the most terrifying things I've seen happen here. The end is spectacular and the spectators will remain interested and surprised until the last minute.
