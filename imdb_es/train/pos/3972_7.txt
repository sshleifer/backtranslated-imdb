In the G-Men tradition, The House On 92nd Street, The Street With No Name, now comes The FBI Story, one of those carefully supervised films that showed the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the best possible way. Although the director, J. Edgar Hoover, is 48 years old, he will not be shown in any other type of light. <br /> <br /> Don Whitehead's book on which this film is based is a direct story of the office. from its founding in 1907 until about the time the movie The FBI Story came out. Sometimes it is important to remember that there was an FBI before J. Edgar Hoover headed it. Part of that time is also covered in the movie. <br /> <br /> But Warner Brothers was not making a documentary for the FBI to become the fictional character of John 'Chip' Hardesty. Hardesty, played by James Stewart, is an FBI career man who graduated from law school and, instead of going to practice, took a job in the office in the early 1920s. <br /> <br /> In real life, the Bureau was headed by William J. Private Detective Agency of Burns of the Burns. In fact, it was a very political operation then as shown in the film. Burns was on the periphery of the scandals of the Harding administration. When Hoover was appointed in 1924 to incorporate professional law enforcement techniques and rigorous standards of competence, he did. <br /> <br /> Through the Hardesty family, which is Stewart and his wife Vera Miles, we see how the history of the FBI unfolds. In addition, we see much of his personal family history that is fully integrated into the history of the FBI. Stewart and Miles are undoubtedly a totally American couple. We follow the FBI through some of the cases in which Stewart is involved, arresting members of the Ku Klux Klan, a plot to assassinate oil-rich Indians, overthrowing the notorious criminals of the thirties, their involvement in arresting supporters Nazis in World War II and against the Communists. espionage in the Cold War. <br /> <br /> There is a kind of prologue in which Stewart tells a class at the FBI Academy before entering the history of the office, since it is intertwined with his. That implies a bomb placed on an airline by a son who bought many life insurance for his mother before the flight. Nick Adams will give you the opportunity to be the author and the story is sadly relevant today. <br /> <br /> Of course, if The FBI Story was written and produced today, it would reflect something different and not so American. Still, the FBI has a story to tell and in no way is negative. <br /> <br /> The history of the FBI is not one of Jimmy Stewart's best films, but it's the first I saw with my favorite actor in it so he has a special fondness for me. If the whole FBI was formed by Jimmy Stewarts, I would feel much better about it. There is also a good performance of Murray Hamilton as his friend and fellow agent who was killed in a shootout with Baby Face Nelson. <br /> <br /> Vera Miles not only married Stewart, in fact, she married the FBI as the movie proves it. It is dated mostly, but still has a good and interesting story to tell.
