Following my Finnish experience for a little over a week, I would say that this film describes the nature of Finnish society very accurately. Especially the phenomenon of the young couple with a baby who has serious problems is very familiar to me, since I witnessed exactly the same in person when I was in Finland. The relationships and problems of the people, the fragility of the marriage institution, the culture of drinking, unemployment and the problem of rising money, all are very well expressed, without any subjectivity or exaggeration. <br /> <br /> There are some points in the movie that are not necessarily easy to understand and link together, but the overall picture is rewarding. Not every one of the stories is exciting or profound, but as mentioned above, the general panorama does not stop offering the sensation of "real life" and captivate the spectator. It turns out that I think of a moment of calm: What is happening in the lives of all these people on the street? Well, this is what is happening. Movies like this are good for feeding your imaginative power. It would be safe to assume that this film could be applied to life in many countries, but it especially reflects Finland as it is, and very well. <br /> <br /> A comment on the performance: be the fan of Finland. I am the cinema, I have never seen any of these actors in any other film, but I found the performance in this show right next to the general perfection. It may not be a masterpiece, but it is a very good attempt by the entire crew. I will be attentive to the future releases of the director and the cast. <br /> <br /> 7.5 / 10
