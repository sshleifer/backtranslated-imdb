Has anyone been able to buy this movie? My uncle "Hutch" was a real pilot (not a reel) who was seen throwing his wings in the air and then snatching them with his fist when he received the wings of his pilot. <br /> <br /> It's only on the screen for a few seconds, but my family would love to have the movie. He was killed in a dog fight in Italy, he was only 24 at the time. Do we know the movie studio that did it? <br /> <br /> Or has anyone seen it in a video store, like Blockbuster? I would like complete catalogs of these old movies to be available, since it is very cheap to make DVDs these days. <br /> <br /> Send me an email to nfny40@yahoo.com if you know where I can buy a copy. Thank you.
