This first film has its flaws: a predictable plot and some too extensive scenes of dubious relevance, but it already clearly demonstrates Hitchcock's mastery of editing and the use of powerful images. He is also one of the most expressionist stylists of his films; note, for example, the strange distortions he uses during the party sequence and the frequent echoes of both the title and the plot in the images. <br /> <br /> Its core, however, remains the final match, which is still among the most exciting examples of cinematic boxing. Although you know that the hero has to win, it becomes quite credible that he will lose, and the movement of his wife from the corner of the champion to him, motivating the final reward of the plot, is very well related to the progress of the game. The chronometer inserts do exactly what they should; You can almost hear the ticking (although this is a silent movie, the images often have a surprisingly auditory feel). The rhythm becomes amazingly fast, and the spectator is swept up in the emotion and brutality of both the combat and the sexual jealousy that underlies it. <br /> <br /> The only DVD release I'm familiar with is the Laserlight. a company in the public domain. As with every silent Hitchcock they have released, they have joined several musical selections, mostly orchestral, to action. The editing of sound is often neglected and the sound quality varies widely, but it seems that genuine attention has been paid to most of the real options, and the music that accompanies the final game works extremely well; it is unlikely that this sequence is better accompanied by what is here. <br /> <br /> This is a much more impressive movie than its current darkness suggests. He deserves an honorable place in both Hitchcock's canon and the slender list of boxing movies that are worthwhile.
