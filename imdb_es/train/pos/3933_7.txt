The problem with portraying a real-life individual is that the performance may be good, but it still does not work if the audience does not believe that the actor is portraying the person. That is the main problem with "Young Mr. Lincoln:" Henry Fonda offers an excellent performance, but it was hard for me to believe that Abraham Lincoln was as soft as Fonda interprets it. <br /> <br /> This is essentially a drama at the court with a young Abraham Licoln at the forefront. Whether this was a true story or not, I do not know, but if it is not, then why tell him he uses Lincoln as the central character? It does not matter, however. In the movie, Lincoln is defending two young men accused of murder. <br /> <br /> There really is not much in the movie, and as a result, it seems pretty empty. I wanted more history and development of the character. The movie lasts 100 minutes, but you do not feel like it. There are some small scenes that show Lincoln and the flourishing relationship with Mary Todd, but they seem superficial. <br /> <br /> The acting is good in general, but as I said, Fonda's performance works like a character, but not Abraham. Lincoln I just do not think the real Lincoln was so smooth. It is true that he has a great voice when he needs it, such as when he convinces a group of drunken lynchers to allow the defendant to be tried, but Fonda plays Lincoln too humbly. However, the other performances are solid, especially Alice Brady as Abigail Clay, the mother of the defendant. She is a good lady for whom we can really feel. Simple and uneducated, but very sweet; We can see why Lincoln wanted to help her. <br /> <br /> John Ford seems to think of this movie as an epic, and at the time of its release, it probably was. But even then, there simply is not enough material to present it as such. <br /> <br /> It's a nice watch, but not a classic one.
