Gojoe is part of a new wave of Japanese cinema, taking very creative directors, editors and photographers and working on historical themes, what the Japanese call "period pieces". Gojoe is extremely creative in terms of color, photography and editing. Brilliant, even. The new wave of Japanese samurai movies allows you to take a look at the traditional beliefs about shamanism, demons and occult powers that were certainly part of their ancient culture, but that were not really explored in the samosai epics of Kurosawa, or the Zaitochi series. Another good example of this genre is Onmyoji (2001). I would place the director Sogo Ichii as one of the most interesting and creative Japanese directors of the new wave. Other recent pieces from the Japanese era that I would highly recommend include Twilight Samurai (2002) by Yomada and Zatoichi: The Blind Swordsman (2003) by Shintaro Katsu.
