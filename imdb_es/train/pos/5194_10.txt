This is one of my favorite martial arts movies from Hong Kong. It is one of John Woo's first films and one of the few traditional martial arts films he directed. You can see his influences working with Chang Cheh in this movie. The action is good, the fight choreography is conducted by Fong Hak On, who appears as one of the bad guys in the movie. It stars Wei Pei from "Five Venoms" and a host of familiar faces for fans of the Golden Harvest and Shaw Brothers productions. The line of the story is interesting, there are some decent plot twists and the construction of the characters and their relationships to each other is done intelligently. This movie has only had a VHS release in the United Kingdom. Media Asia has released a DVD of Region 3 and there are DVD versions available in the US. UU The film is lovely to see in its original language or in its English-dubbed version. I recommend this movie.
