There is not much to be done in this story, just two men who employ very different ways of handling memories of Vietnam. But what has no premise, it more than compensates for acting and realism. It is a quiet film about the bonds of friendship and shared experience. We even have romance (not free, just another very real piece of this story). Worth seeing.
