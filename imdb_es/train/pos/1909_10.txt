Originally I saw 8 simple rules on the Disney channel of the UK for the first series and I was completely hooked. When they did not show him anymore, he was upset, but then abc 1 sat down in the second series. I did not think I would start another series after reading that John Ritter had died. However, the second series was not surprising. The latest series has returned to its old and excellent standard. I hope they continue to produce more programs soon, although I was able to watch each program thousands of times. Kaley Couco is my favorite character as the Bridget airhead and he also has an incredible performance in Charmed. Rory is also good, he also shares my name and my grandfather. I'll keep watching until it's over, until I hope it's still as fun as ever.
