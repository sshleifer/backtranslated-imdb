"The Lion King" is undoubtedly my favorite Disney movie of all time, so I thought maybe I should give the sequels a chance and I did. Lion King 1 1/2 was pretty good and had good laughs and fun with Timon and Pumba. The only problem is that sometimes I feel that explanations are not needed because they can create holes in the plot and only the feeling of wanting their own explanation. Well, I would recommend this movie to Lion King fans or just one night with the family. It's a funny movie with the same laughs and adorable characters as the first one. So, hopefully, I'll get the same with the third installment of the Lion King series. Sit and just think of Hakuna Matata! This means without worries! <br /> <br /> 8/10
