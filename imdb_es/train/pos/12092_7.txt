['I remember seeing this for the first time in the 70s when it aired on nightly television. I was really scared. But then, I was a teenager in those days, not as tired of movies as I am now. <br /><br /> CASTLE OF BLOOD (also known as: DANSE MACABRE) is a good example of the Italian horror genre of the 60s, along with BLACK SUNDAY (1960) by Mario Bava, CURSE OF THE LIVING MAD (aka: KILL BABY KILL) (1966) and NIGHTMARE CASTLE by Mario Caiano (1965). If you want a spooky environment along with good writing, then also check out these. I also qualify them along with those early Poe films that Roger Corman was doing during the same period. <br /><br /> I saw the new Synapse DVD that was taken from a French print and is a big improvement over the old scan and scan print that was doing the rounds on TV over the years. Add a couple of minutes of dialogue (in French) that do not really add much to the movie in its entirety, but it&#39;s good to see it complete, without cuts. Unfortunately, the DVD does not offer additional extras beyond the images of the film. <br /><br /> I noticed that in the opening scene there was a bang when I saw the man with the smoke effects that was next to the camera reflecting in the glass of the door of the inn. I guess the editors did not understand it at the time, or maybe they did not care, but it&#39;s something I did not notice the first time. Those are the wonders of the DVD. You have the opportunity to see all the faults, errors and details that were not evident the first time. But it does not matter. <br /><br /> But it does not matter, you still get a 7 on the imdb meter <br /><br />']
