['Ghosts That Still Walk is one of those movies that catch you and do not let you go until the end, especially when you see it as a child. When you see the film as an adult, you must admit that it is not really that scary, but the story is very fascinating and contains a lot of great mysterious scenes (especially those of the spooky mummy). <br /><br /> One of the best scenes in the movie is without a doubt the scene with Grandpa and Grandma in their new RV; The scene with the rocks is very exciting and quite terrifying. Also the scenes in which the main character discovers his mother&#39;s secret are quite terrifying. <br /><br /> Well, the acting in the movie is not that good and the movie sometimes seems a bit boring, but overall, Ghosts That Still Walk is fun. Too bad that only a few people saw this movie, this movie really deserves better. I just want to say: Mr. Flocker, you did a good job! And for all the Hollywood producers out there; If you want to remake a movie, remake it!']
