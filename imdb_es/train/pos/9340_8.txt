** Possible Spoiler *** Adam Sandler is usually typecast in Comedy, but in "Reign", he offers a deeply moving performance. While there are people who showed Courage in front of September 11, 2001, Sandler plays Fineman, a widower who feels lonely. and "lost in his own world". Johnson (Cheadle), a practicing dentist, meets his former friend of the College (Sandler) and wants to catch up with "The old days". We see, as in Rain Man (Dustin Hoffman), Fineman. He also gets emotional and withdraws in stressful situations. Ancient music seems to be a comfortable and "psychological" crutch for him to lean on. <br /> <br /> Johnson seeks, at Fineman, a certain pleasure and ease that is missing in his family. He also feels unhappy and dissatisfied in his work. In the same case, he also wants to make sure that his friend does not fall into social "cracks". I came out of this film, with a different and more comprehensive perspective. Compassion for grieving families.
