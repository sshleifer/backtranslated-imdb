This is a unique and unusual little western, made mostly original due to its history that revolves around a unique and superior Winchester 1873 rifle, and all those who pose it at one point or another of the film. <Br /> <br /> It's mostly a very entertaining movie to watch, but not without being a true western too. The film was made in a style typical of the 40s and 50s of Western genre cinema, so that lovers of the genre should not be rejected for their unusual main premise. <br /> <br /> Because the rifle is Being the main device of the plot of the film, allows the story to follow multiple characters throughout the film, which are all connected, of course, and the story complete the circle at the end. Without that, this movie would have been quite complicated to watch, since the story often jumps from the dangerous occasion to the other, with constantly different characters involved. Quite surprising how they even managed to put Wyatt Earp in all this. But in reality it is not a criticism. I liked that the film and its history were original and how the film seemed to move from one event to another. It gave the movie a bit of adventure and entertainment sensation. <br /> <br /> It's also a really great movie. I liked the setup that the film used and it seems quite surprising that this is really the first western of director Anthony Mann. Fortunately, he would continue directing more westerns later, which often would also star James Stewart in the main lead. <br /> <br /> It was a pretty bold choice to choose James Stewart as the main character. He is one of the softest and most educated actors of appearance and performance, so to choose him as a hard gunman seems a strange choice. But Stewart is surprisingly convincing as a tough guy and shows how versatile and really capable as an actor really was. <br /> <br /> He also has other amazing actors in the movie, who often do not connect with this genre. Shelley Winters plays the female lead and then the well-known actors Rock Hudson and Tony Curtis appear in some small roles. <br /> <br /> A true western with lots of action and entertainment. <br /> <br /> 8/10
