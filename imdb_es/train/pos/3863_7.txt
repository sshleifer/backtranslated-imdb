This is an interesting series that takes people from real life (Jesse James, John Wesley Hardin, etc.) ... and dramatizes part of their real story with a character from the continuum that participates in that story. Railroad Detective "Matt Clark": takes part in tracking down the famous outlaws of the Old West in stories that, at least in part, are based on true accounts. In that sense, it's almost a series of anthology, and as another person pointed out, this strange structure raises some conflicts in the timeline with real events, but it's a fun series with a lot of action to satisfy an audience of years 50 who suffers from Western hunger. It still holds up pretty well 55 years later. Clark cuts a powerful figure in his western team while facing some of the worst bad guys in history. And his girlfriend, Frankie, is a plate. If you are a fan of the west, be sure to check it out if you have the opportunity.
