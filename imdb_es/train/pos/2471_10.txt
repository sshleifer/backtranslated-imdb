I had never read Shakespeare's Hamlet before I saw it, but I had a Shakespeare book with me and I could follow the dialogue through it. My opinion about the film may be partially skewed since I had never read the play, but they let me get caught up in the movie. Undoubtedly, Shakespeare is one of the best writers who have ever lived and the story of Hamlet is definitely one of his best achievements. <br /> <br /> But now to the movie ... <br /> <br /> I discovered that all the actors in the film had a firm understanding of what they were saying and, therefore, could articulate it quite well . Leonardo in Romeo and Juliet is nothing compared to Kenneth Branagh and the King. What I liked about this was that it worked very well as "MOVIE" and not as a work you are studying. It is not necessary to be rich with Shakespeare to relate to everything that the Misery village has to go through. I would recommend this movie to a wide audience. <br /> <br /> It's my two cents.
