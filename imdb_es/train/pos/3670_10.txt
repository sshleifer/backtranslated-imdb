I rented this movie on DVD without knowing what to expect, and when I am about to study film in Canada in all places, I will certainly mention it in class. <br /> <br /> The story, centered around the probably most unfortunate film crew in film history, is written brilliantly and talented actors manage to deliver every word game on time. <br /> <br /> If you can not just laugh during "Hollywood North" I suggest seeing a psychiatrist right away, you may have serious problems. <br /> <br /> Besides the wonderful script, I also noticed the great chemistry between the actors Deborah Kara Unger and Matthew Modine, where do they really act? Jennifer Tilly (playing an actress hilariously bad) and Martin Landau, also presented a very bold but fun performance. <br /> <br /> Great movie, even better cast.
