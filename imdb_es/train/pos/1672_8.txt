['The case of the tail of the Scorpion is a giallo of great style directed by Sergio Martino, who seems to be a master of the giallo in second place, only behind Dario Argento. <br /><br /> Ernesto Gastaldi wrote this fabulous murder mystery, quite complex but ultimately very satisfying and entertaining. It also makes sense in the end, a great advantage, because it is not always the case of these giallo, as they tend to increase credibility with their infinite false leads and definitive solutions. Here, the less you know about the plot, the better. <br /><br /> The trademarks of Pure Giallo presented here are beautiful photography, catchy music, beautiful women (Anita Strindberg is a goddess), brutal murders, black-gloved assassins and explicit sex scenes, to name a few. <br /><br /> In most cases it has acted decently, Goerge Hilton is generally mild and others do it quite well. Martino heads with a sure hand, keeps things tight and atmospheric with some amazing pieces. <br /><br /> If you are a fan of giallo, this is a must see. If you like well written thrillers and suspense thrillers in general, this is highly recommended.']
