I saw this movie at the Santa Barbara Film Festival, and there was not a dry eye in the house. It's amazing to see not only what a great person, Darius, is, but also how admirable the rest of the team is and at such an early age. <br /> <br /> It also made me think how disgusting MTV was, and how they were given the opportunity to get involved and inspire in a positive way, they refused. It shows you if you really care about youth and its viewers. <br /> <br /> It's a wonderful and moving real story ... take your paper handkerchiefs but it's great to see how today's youth can take care of and be inspired. be.
