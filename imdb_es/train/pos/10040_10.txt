For me, personally, this movie is among my four best of all time. Without exceptions. James Cameron has shown again and again that he is a master narrator. Through films such as Aliens, The Abyss and both Terminators, it is clear that he was a brilliant and confident director in terms of action and science fiction. He sees a story and adds a strange quality to the film. But the Titanic is very different from its other strokes of brilliance. The film is exceptionally moving and leaves room for surprises, plot developments and interesting character developments in a story that everyone knows. The story of the famous traveler who sinks on her maiden voyage is a legend, so the challenge was that Cameron made a truthful, interesting and entertaining film about it. The performance is wonderful because Leonardo DiCaprio, who plays Jack and Kate Winslet, who plays Rose, becomes superstars overnight with the release of this film and in most of the films I'm annoyed that the characters secondary do not have much to do, but in this film itself more intentional because, as an old Rose (Gloria Stuart) tells his story, it is clear that it is only the story of Rose and Jack, nobody else. Emotionally it is completely satisfying and you can not leave your eye dry in a theater or at home. Music has become iconic and legendary. It is the best soundtrack of the composer James Horner and evokes a lot of the film and the audience. The song after so long has become annoying, but I still appreciate it for the phenomenon that it is and this movie is. Only one problem, the usual problem of James Cameron, is the dialogue that is memorable, but in a bad way, since it is pretty corny at some points, but all that aside. James Cameron has delivered a masterpiece and a romantic epic that takes you on a journey of your life. My heart will not continue from this.
