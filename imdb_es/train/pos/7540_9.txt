I enjoyed this movie very much. I've always been a fan of Whoopi Goldberg and this film just emphasizes it. She plays a housewife in an African-American family that is moving forward in the social chain due to the success of the husband (Danny Glover) as a lawyer. She moves to a completely white neighborhood where people are friendly, but a little clumsy towards her. The various events that arise during the course of the film provoke some laughter, but mostly attract other emotions. This movie is not so much a comedy as a drama. I give it a strong 8/10. I recommend that you catch him on television or rent him soon.
