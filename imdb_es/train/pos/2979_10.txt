There really is not much to say about this movie ... it's crass, but fun. <br /> <br /> Diagram of the plot (From IMDB) <br /> <br /> _____________________________________ <br /> <br /> Two losers from Milwaukee, Coop & Remer (Parker & Stone), invent a new basketball game, using the rules of baseball. When the game becomes a great success, along with the help of a billionaire, they form the Baseketball Professional League, where everyone receives the same pay and no team can change cities. The Coop & Remer team, Milwaukee Beers, is the only team that is in the way of major rule changes that the owner of the Dallas Felons (Vaughn) wants to institute. <br /> <br /> _____________________________________ <br /> <br /> The acting is pretty good, since there are not many big stars in this movie. Although I'm not a big fan of 'Southpark', Parker and Stone do a good job in their first real movie. <br /> <br /> There are so many funny moments in this movie that I can not come close to naming them all. It never really stops, and they do not try to put a bit of drama to make it more serious. <br /> <br /> And my favorite aspect of this movie: the soundtrack. It's great. I especially like "Take me on" and "Beer" by Reel Big Fish. Very underestimated. <br /> <br /> In general, a raw movie, but extremely funny. 10/10 <br /> <br /> James "Black Wolf" Johnston
