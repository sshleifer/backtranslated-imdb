Lost has something interesting for everyone. You can say a lot about this series, and it has been said a lot, so I will not be the person to explain it to you again. Just read the people who loved you and you will know why you want to see it. The good thing about this series is that it is totally new. There are not many movies, and even less, series based on the subject of suspense, but Lost is up to the subject with pride. It is about the inexplicable and if combined with an exotic location, nice plot twists, an excellent cast and a good format (present and past combined in individual episodes), will have a series in which each episode is a story. Own but part of a larger narrative. You want to have all the ideas of the characters, you want to see the big picture and know where the writers are going. The result of that is that it is a series that does not let you go. On a more skeptical note, the series suffered a bit in season 2, probably due to its own success. It is well known that Lost was originally written only for one season and when the success was overwhelming, the writers were also overwhelmed. In my opinion, they made the mistake of adding even more mysteries and at a higher rate in season 2, then to solve the (or at least partially) those of season 1. At the end of season 2, you ended up with a big blur. of secrets, twists in the plot and inexplicable phenomena, but there is much that the viewer can take. The difference between season 2 and 3 however was huge. Season 3 delivered many ideas, to partially replace them with new questions. And that is exactly how they should write; You want to go from one turn to another of the plot, not get a tsunami of secrets scattered everywhere and then collect some to explain to the spectators. They got it in season 3 and they bring us a promising future series for season 4. It's good to see that a format so different from a series can be so hugely popular.
