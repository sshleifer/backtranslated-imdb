I remember seeing this movie when I was about 7 years old; and at the moment I was surprised. I had seen a violent movie before, but I never saw a movie with the consequences and reality of violence. This film not only shows this, but also shows how people can change their lives and choose happiness. What this film did and the failure was not to make the truth. Crash tried to show how racism was bad (and Crash actually had a built-in anti-social bias) and to do so from a morally superior position. The Grand Canyon came to things from such a raw and real perspective that it really ends up in a terrain higher than the accident. Especially when the endings are compared. The end of the accident is this supposedly clean little ending that links everything. While the Grand Canyon simply ends with a quiet note, where you know that nothing will change much in the character's life, but that is because life also continues, there is no proper end. No matter how good it is ... you're bad. There is no end of one chapter to start another.
