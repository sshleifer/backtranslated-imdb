I saw this recently on a cable channel. The movie is great; It is one of the few musicals that I have seen that does not move away from light and darkness. It portrays something of the splendor of the time along with much of the misery. Some of the dance sequences of the scheduled piece are happening so much, I did not know where to look next. One day I'll go and see this on the big screen, just to see what's going on. But what really elevates this to another level is the performance of Oliver Reed as Bill Sykes. Not only is he a completely cruel and threatening man, but there is something else, some internal demons. It gave me the impression that if you pushed him into a corner, he was capable of anything. It was almost as if Sykes's character was on the verge of madness, waiting for the trigger. I've seen Bill Sykes by Robert Newton from the 1948 film, and I thought it was "just" a bad egg, but Oliver Reed's performance intimidated me in my own living room.
