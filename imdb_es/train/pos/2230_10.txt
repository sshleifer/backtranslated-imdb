I've been searching for the name of this movie for years. I was 14 when I think it was aired on television in 1983. The only thing I can remember is that it was a teenage girl, who survived a plane crash and survived the Amazon. I remember that people were looking for her (her family) and that she knew how to take care of herself; She tells the story and I vividly remember that she knew there were insects under her skin. I do not remember much more about this movie, and I want to see it again, if this is the same, and if any of you has a copy, could you send me an email to horsecoach4hire@hotmail.com? I'd be curious to get a copy to see if it's actually the same movie I remember. It was aired on Thanksgiving Day (USA). In 1983, I was going through my own problems and this movie really blew me away. Thanks in advance!
