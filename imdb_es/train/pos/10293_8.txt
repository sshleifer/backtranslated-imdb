['&#39;Bruce Almighty&#39; will sweep the Academy Awards with a record 14 Oscar awards! It will surpass &#39;Titanic&#39; as the highest grossing film of all time! The intelligence of Jim Carrey will be at such a supreme level that he will announce his presidential candidacy for the White House playoffs in 2004. Almighty then! These fantasies of greatness would only transpire if the filmmakers (including Carrey) possessed the powers of God. That same premise is the primary ingredient in Carrey&#39;s new laughing riot &quot;Bruce Almighty.&quot; Carrey plays Bruce Nolan, a television reporter who is so obsessed with being the main presenter who claims that God has total guilt for his own setbacks. God, played heavenly by Morgan Freeman, gives Bruce the &quot;Gift of God&quot; (his powers) to challenge him if he can do God&#39;s work better. Obviously, Bruce &quot;caresses&quot; himself with his new blessed faculties and uses them selfishly. Carrey is back in his usual almighty comic form in &#39;Bruce Almighty&#39;. Jennifer Aniston was not &quot;miserable&quot; as Bruce&#39;s girlfriend. However, my main congratulations are to Director Tom Shadyac for not letting the dog leave the house for # 2, and to show us the funniest bath scene of all time. &#39;Bruce Almighty&#39; is not the deepest Carrey film, but it&#39;s still an exhibition of &#39;almighty&#39; carreyismo. **** Good']
