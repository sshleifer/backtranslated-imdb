OK, then the FX are not high budget. But this story is based on real events. Not something released to make a couple of rich actors, even richer ones! Like most movies that are based on books, there are some things that just do not fit. Only a couple of people have declared that this movie was based on real events, not an imitation as most people think it is! This movie is in no way related to TWISTER! In addition to the two films, it's about tornadoes. <br /> <br /> For those of you who have problems with the science of tornadoes and the storms in the movie, there are a couple of things to remember ... The "night of the tornadoes" was on 3 June 1980. So this movie premiered 16 years after the real events. Try to think how far storm research has progressed at that time. It happened in a bigger city; Grand Island, Nebraska is the third largest city in the state. Although the film calls the city something else, and says it is a small city.
