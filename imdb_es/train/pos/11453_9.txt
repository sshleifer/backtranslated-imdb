The filmmaker inhaled the art of Andy Goldsworthy, his search for closeness to land and water, and his sense of proportion, and so gently, so beautifully, he filmed it again for the rest of us. "Rivers and Tides" loves Goldsworthy's work and joins him as a visual concert of time and human presence in a world that flows, a world that hides its power in plain sight. Watch this movie!
