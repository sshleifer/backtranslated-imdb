Hoyos is an awesome movie. I love it a lot and it's one of my favorite movies. It is one of the few films produced by Disney that is not corny. The holes are usually a very cool moving image. I would like Disney to make more pictures like this one. Holes is, in fact, a rare breed of Disney blinking shows that is great. Do not get the wrong idea, I do not mean Disney, but most things are aimed at children and it IS NOT GOOD. Children deserve to have their entertainment too. But Disney has been guilty of trying to attract the teen audience and they usually fail. But not with the holes. It's the kind of movie that anyone of any age can see and enjoy, and not once does he think it's corny. Actually, it's the kind of film that even many young hoods can enjoy, since there are characters with whom they can relate. <br /> <br /> Holes does a good job of being a mix of good family entertainment, but not being too cheesy and living a little to the limit. I hope Disney takes more risks and makes more cutting-edge movies like this one.
