Being a fan of the first Lion King, I definitely expected this movie, but I knew there really was no way I could be as good as the original. I know that many Disney fans distrust the direct movies to the video, since I also have mixed feelings. <br /> <br /> While watching The Lion King 1½, I tried to discover what my own experience would be. The point of view was with regard to this movie. Am I going to be such a devotee of The Lion King that I will be a niche in certain scenes, or am I just going to accept this movie as another look at the story of The Lion King? Most of the time, I found myself hugging the latter. <br /> <br /> The Lion King 1½ definitely has its cute and funny moments. Timon and Pumbaa stole the show in the first film and definitely deserved a film focused on them. People love these characters! My favorite parts of the film include the montage of Timon and Pumba taking care of the young Simba and the surprise ending with some great cameos. <br /> <br /> I could have done it without many of the jokes about the bathroom, as the real reason why everyone bowed to baby Simba at the beginning of Lion King 1. I guess this kind of jokes are for Younger (which, after all, is the target audience.) I do not think many kids are really concerned about Disney's profit margin directly.) -a-video movies.) <br /> <br /> However, I will say that I was a bit upset when they were directly linked in scenes from the original movie to this movie. I am too familiar with the original that these scenes stood out like sore thumbs. Something would be different with the music or the voices that would distract me. <br /> <br /> As for the music, it was not that bad, but do not expect any classic from this movie to come. At least LK2 had the beautiful ballad, "Love will find a way". As for voice work, it was well done in this movie. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella did a great job as always, and even the new cast members, the classic comic actor Jerry Stiller and Julie Kavner (better known as Marge Simpson), also did a great job. You can even enjoy these wonderful voice talents even more by visiting Virtual Safari on Disc 2 of the DVD. This feature is definitely very funny !! <br /> <br /> So, overall, The Lion King 1½ is not a perfect movie, but it's cute and entertaining. I think many Lion King fans will enjoy it and appreciate it for what it is: a fun and joyful look at the Lion King masterpiece from the perspective of our fun friends. <br /> <br /> My IMDb rating: 7/10. My Yahoo! Grade: B (Good)
