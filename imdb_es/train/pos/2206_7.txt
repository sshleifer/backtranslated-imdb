Do not believe in all the negative reviews that this movie receives. Yes, it's cheap. Yes, the blood is laughable. And, yes, the performance is sub-par. However, this is an example of a textbook from an early slasher movie, and if that is your "thing" (it's mine!), Then you'll enjoy it. There are enough positive aspects of this movie to more than compensate for the drawbacks. On the one hand, the score of a Christopher Young then unknown is very creepy and perfectly accentuates the violence. The ending is a welcome break from the predictable optimistic endings of most movies. And last but not least, the stage is what the movie did for me. The creators of this movie could have done a much better job of "dressing" the set to make it more credible as a college dorm. However, if you can ignore this defect, the configuration is excellent. Four schools alone in a huge abandoned building and condemned waiting to be torn down ... is a possibility. When you see it, allow your imagination to do some of the work and you can enjoy this movie as much as I do.
