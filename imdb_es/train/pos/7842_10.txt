So in the middle of the season, I got so caught up in school and my activities that I did not realize that the program had been canceled halfway, which is crap. <br /> <br /> I think the followers of this program should write fox and ask them to at least finish filming so that the season can be released on DVD later. Maybe then you will see how many people were disappointed that the program did not survive its first season. <br /> <br /> I loved the program and I expected it every Thursday after the CO. Can you imagine my disappointment when I came back to try to watch the program and discover that it had disappeared? Needless to say, I'm not very happy with the fox right now. even more after discovering that NO ENDINGING WAS FINALIZED. I mean, if you're going to work on a project, at least finish it to see what happens. A half-filmed show is like a half-done car, it's pretty useless. fox, shoot the damn end and give some of the fans of the program a bit of peace.
