This film was a fascinating look at the Creole culture and society that few African-Americans know. My two children are products of a paternal grandmother whose father was a member of the gens de couleur libre and a black-skinned woman whose parents were former slaves. He was married outside and against his culture and was separated from his entire family, except for one sister who felt sorry for the situation of his brothers; The raising of 8 children during the Great Depression of 1929; providing food to the family whenever he could. Of course, she helped this family clandestinely out of fear of her own communication. My daughter was fascinated by the movie. We have made it part of our library.
