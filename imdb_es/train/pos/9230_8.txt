There is so much that can be said about this movie. It is not your typical nunsploitation. Of course, there is nudity and sex with nuns, but that is almost incidental to the story. <br /> <br /> It is set in fifteenth century Italy, at the time of the martyrdom of 800 Christians in Otranto. The battle between Muslims and Christians occupies a good part of the film. It was interesting when they all fled from the Muslim hordes, that the mother superior asked: "Why do they fear the Muslims, they will do nothing of what the Christians have done to them?" Certainly, there was enough torture on both sides. <br /> <br /> Sister Flavia (Florinda Bolkan) is sent to a convent for challenging her father. In the process, she witnesses and supports many things: the union of a stallion, the rape of a local woman by a new duke, the torture of a nun who was defeated during a visit to the Tarantula Sect and a beating when she ran with a Jew. The torture was particularly frightening, as hot wax was poured on the nun and her nipples were cut off. <br /> <br /> Sister Flavia is forced to keep getting into trouble while questioning the society dominated by the men in which she lives. . He even asks Jesus why the father, the son and the holy spirit are all men. <br /> <br /> Finally, he joins the leader of the Muslims as his mistress and loot the convent. This is where you see more meat than you can enjoy at the same time. But, the tragedy is to come. He manages to demand a sweet revenge on everyone, including the duke and his father, but finds that the Muslim lover treats her exactly the same. She is a woman and that is all there is. <br /> <br /> I will not describe what the holy men of the church did to this heretic at the end, but it predates the torture of Saw or Hostel. for decades. <br /> <br /> The fans of the nun will be satisfied with the goodies, but movie lovers will find plenty of meat to digest.
