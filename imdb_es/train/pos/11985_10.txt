['I&#39;m only 11 years old, but I discovered Full House when I was about five years old and I watched her constantly until I turned seven. Then I grew up and thought that Full House could wait and that I had &quot;more important&quot; things to do. In addition, there was also the fact that my younger brother, who saw him faithfully with me during those two years, began to dislike him thinking that he was too &quot;feminine&quot;. <br /><br /> Then I realized that every afternoon at five o&#39;clock was the 23rd and once again I became addicted to him. Full House has made me laugh and cry. It made me realize how beautiful it would be if our world were like the world of Full House plus a mother. I&#39;ve heard people say that Full House is corny and incredible. But look at the big picture: three girls whose mother was killed by a drunk driver. The sisters fight and make their feelings feel hurt. The three men who live with the girls can enter into disputes at times. What is more real than that? <br /><br /> In any case, the show has elevated me when I am below and it has elevated me even more when I thought I was at the point of complete happiness. I&#39;ve screamed like a hyena on the show and I&#39;ve acquired a massive obsession with Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen. (Of course, Hilary Duff has now taken that place, but they were literally the cutest babies I&#39;ve ever seen, they are great actresses and they seem to be very nice people).']
