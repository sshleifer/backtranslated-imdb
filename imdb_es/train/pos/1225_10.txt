Does anyone know where or how can I get a copy of this movie? I've been looking for too much time, someone helps! In 1997, my friends and I were extras in this Long Island-based movie, and we never really got to see it. :( <br /> <br /> I was hoping I could find a copy in some way so I could finally check it out and share it with the girls ... Is there someone out there who knows where to get a copy of this, so ... I can stop going crazy (Also, it does not matter if it's in VHS format, I'm still in the ice age.) If you, or someone you know, has a copy of this movie, please help me, I'd be willing to pay for a good copy !
