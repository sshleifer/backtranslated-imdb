An excellent output of Martino, this is a lively and pleasant giallo with excellent performances of the attractive cast and mainly the two protagonists, George Hilton and Anita Strindberg. <br /> <br /> For me, the puzzle of a plot is so intricate and confusing that it simply sits and enjoys instead of trying to anticipate. Just when it seems that everything is solved, we have again a new series of turns, nice turns, it must be said. <br /> <br /> Sexy with a lot of bloody kills this is a well-paced movie with London, Athens and Greece. Coastal locations. A super finale on the rocks of the Aegean surrounds things and everyone had a lot of fun.
