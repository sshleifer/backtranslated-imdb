As romantic comedies go, this was a beautiful and winning. I thought that the writing could have been stronger to build a bit better the final connection, but that is not a great starting point. But, Amanda Detmer and Scott Wolf give good presentations and are as lovely as ever. These are two of my favorite actors, and I was glad to see them chosen as romantic protagonists. I hope to see you in more projects soon. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie will not change your life, but it is sweet, warm and winning. It is not bad to be at all.
