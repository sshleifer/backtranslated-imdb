What I loved about the screen adaptation of The Stone Angel is that it stayed so true to the novel! Great movie! As an avid reader, the worst thing about film adaptations is that the book is somehow lost in translation. It can be said that the Stone Angel team was careful not to let this happen with this movie. <br /> <br /> Ellen Burstyn was an excellent choice for the role of Hagar and is definitely a superstar of the film. However, I think the Canadian actress (Christine Horne), chosen to play Hagar in her younger years, also did an amazing job that deserves great praise. I have not seen any of Horne's previous works, but I will definitely look for him after seeing his Stone Angel performance. <br /> <br /> I heard that the Canadian premiere of The Stone Angel will take place in spring or summer. 2008. I can not wait to see it on the big screen again!
