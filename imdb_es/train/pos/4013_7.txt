In the initial scene, the eye patch worn by the desperado named Hawkeye has a soft forehead, but when he follows Johnny into town, he is shown a patched eye scar. That is just one of the many failures of continuity in this avant-garde 'spaghetti' Western, but instead of detracting from the image, it adds a special flavor to the procedures. <br /> <br /> Another happens when Sanchez turns in his three dead. bodies, they have to be examined by their identities: "You can not imagine how many false corpses we have in our city." Immediately after, Carradine (Lawrence Dobkin) appears to collect his reward with only a sign in hand. <br /> <br /> As for the film's director, Johnny Yuma (Mark Damon), he alternately appears with his sleeve on his right and left hip throughout the movie after swapping Carradine's belts after the fight at the bar. Johnny goes to San Margo at the request of his uncle, but will have to avenge his death at the hands of the deceptive wife Samantha (Rosalba Neri) and his brother conspirator Pedro (Louis Vanner). It takes some time to get there, but it's a fun trip with one of the best recorded music scores. As for the fight in the living room, I loved the sound effects of kung fu every time I connected a punch. <br /> <br /> Do you mind some more exaggerations of the story? After the duel with Pedro the first time, Johnny cleans a small amount of blood from his lip that manages to stain Pedro's entire face. Similarly, when Pedro strikes Pepe later in the film, he does not cut it, but when Johnny arrives, Pepe's face is covered in blood. <br /> <br /> "Johnny Yuma" is probably one of the best of the genre that does not have Clint Eastwood in it. Like Johnny, Mark Damon is a reasonably adequate support but without the boiling exterior. Carradine seemed to be a replacement for the mandatory character of Lee Van Cleef, without being a totally bad guy. At first, the exchange of identity between Carradine and Johnny did not seem to make sense, but everything was united when the movie ended. You knew that each henchman would end up getting what was his due; the marking time for each one was part of the anticipation. <br /> <br /> In case you're wondering, the title hero has nothing to do with Nick Adams' character from the western television classic "The Rebel." In this movie, Johnny got his name from a shooting he had in Yuma once. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the most unique element in the story had to do with the way he related things to the evil Samantha who played the role. strings behind the scenes throughout. After shooting Carradine, she is forced to retreat before Johnny can take revenge. Still alive, it seems that Carradine tries to shoot him and fails, but Johnny and Sanchez do not take long to track her in the dessert where she died without water. Carradine pointed to his canteen.
