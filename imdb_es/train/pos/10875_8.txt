Australia's first slasher movie hits the screen with a pop. And a stab. And a slice. And a scream or two. And a lot of blood, scares, false leads and lots of laughter. <br /> <br /> In fact, there are many first Cut that surround: it is the first script of Dave Warner that takes place, although it has several other optional ones. or in negotiation; is the first major film by the director and former Hoodoo Guru Kimble Rendall; And it is also the first film for producer Martin Fabinyi. And for a group of guys who get on tiptoe in this genre for the first time, they sure know what they're doing. <br /> <br /> Cut tells the story of a group of Australian film students who hear about a slasher movie, Hot Blooded, which was never finished because its director, Hilary (Kylie Minogue), was killed by the actor who plays the psycho killer in the movie. <br /> <br /> Despite his teacher (who was assistant director the night Hilary died) warning them that every time someone tries to start production of Hot Blooded, someone dies, the director Raffy (Jessica Napier) and producer Hester (Sarah Kants) decide to go ahead and complete the film. They formed a crew and made the original star, Vanessa Turnbill (Molly Ringwald), return to Australia, in fact, to the original location, to complete Hot Blooded. 14 years after the shot, it went out. <br /> <br /> Of course, since it is a slasher movie, does a large amount of bloodshed occur? A lot of time with lots of laughs, some good scars and an Australian soundtrack. Cut shows that Australia can make a good horror movie for the mass market as well as Hollywood. <br /> <br /> It's a finely crafted film, with excellent special effects, a tense argument and a killer: Scarman. Welcome to the ranks of Michael, Jason and Freddy.
