Jeremy Northam's characterization of the stuttering, modest manners of Morgan Sullivan's book, and seeing him release fragments of his true identity under the influence of a single malt Scot and under the spell of the presence of Lucy Liu, is brilliant and a joy to see. Offering him a cigarette at the bar is an old habit, done without thinking or even asking, and he gets lost in his face, neck and lips. No matter the brainwashing, love has a way of persevering. Nor can love be "brainwashed" with any of his two false wives. In gradual stages, he begins to dispense with his lenses, to walk and speak differently and even his face looks different as the film progresses. The music is fantastic, hypnotic, sexy and, sometimes, adequate to drive. The extensive use of black and white and gray tones makes it almost a "black cinema" of science fiction in the tradition of many classic thrillers. I would have liked to have seen more vulnerability in the representation of Lucy Liu, every time she sees him in his various states, the man he loves and for whom he is carrying out a mission based on blind faith, a certain restricted vulnerability and flashes of genuine sympathy and the worry would have made it a one-dimensional performance on his part. She is no match for Northam's talents, but overall I enjoyed this movie a lot and would love to know other scripts written by the same author.
