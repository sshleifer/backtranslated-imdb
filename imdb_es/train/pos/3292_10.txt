Paperhouse is the most moving and moving film I've ever seen. Often classified as a "horror movie", I think this is a serious mistake. Some journalist once called it "The nightmare of the person who thinks of Elm street" and, although I accept the logic of its conclusion, I can not help but think that it is a badly deserved and misleading label. Those who can only see the horror are really missing out and only serve to show that they really are not thinking at all. <br /> <br /> In fact, just trying to classify this wonderful job is probably a bad idea. Put simply, Paperhouse is perfect in every exquisite detail and will always have a special place in my heart. As someone wiser than I once said, "the movie hits you on a completely emotional level," which may help explain why my comments are so effusively strident. To be honest, I do not apologize for this, so if you think my words are too saccharine for your taste, stop reading them because there is more to come. <br /> <br /> It is very rare to find a film that you have in your heart is the pain and anguish of childhood and the struggle to overcome the terrible feelings of isolation and loneliness that can overwhelm us completely in this fragile moment of our lives. Even more unusual is finding children actors who can really play their roles with the sensitivity and intelligence necessary to make everything work. In Charlotte Burke and Elliott Spiers we had an inspired piece of casting and the lasting impact of Paperhouse is largely due to his ability to portray the melancholy and alienation of childhood (often overlooked) in a perfect and convincing way. <br /> <br /> And yet, these two bright young stars seemed to have escaped from the studies and somehow had vanished. <br /> <br /> Add to all this an incredibly talented director (Bernard Rose), imaginative cinematography and the most beautiful and disturbing soundtrack you can hear and you can start to get an idea of ​​why I feel so much affection and affinity for this movie that no amount of words can express. <br /> <br />
