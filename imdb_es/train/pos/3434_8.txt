['If the Australian Post Office ever needed a promotional film for recruitment, this is the case. This is one of those movies whose heart is in the right place and you can see it again and again. Miranda&#39;s performance is poignant, as it shows an aspect of Australia that many Europeans can not imagine, since it can be cold, wet and gloomy, like anywhere else and like anywhere else, the important thing is the people around it. . The characters in the film are warm and welcoming and make the prospect of a career become a &quot;dead letter office&quot; a thought to consider. Miranda has gone to make bigger movies, but I hope she always keeps a thought in for this.']
