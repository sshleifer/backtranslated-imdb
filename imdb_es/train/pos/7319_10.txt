Halloween is the story of a child who was misunderstood as a child. He brings his problems to his older sister, whom he murders at the beginning of the film. This is just the beginning of what will come from Michael Myers. <br /> <br /> Donald Pleasance plays the doctor who has been studying Myers for years. He knows that something is different in him, something mysteriously bad. This evil will not be contained, and can not be stopped. <br /> <br /> After escaping from an institution, Myers traces her younger sister. If he kills her, he can end up with the problems of this misunderstood boy. But he seems to have trouble ending up with his sister, as other people get in the way. He manages to get them out while still looking for the girl he needs. <br /> <br /> There have been many of those horror movies involving teenagers that were cut into pieces by a masked or frightening killer. But this started everything, more or less. If you think about it, most of those horror movies that we all remember are those that have Freddy Kruger or Jason chasing half-naked girls. Well, if it were not for Halloween, those characters would not have stalked our dreams when we were kids. <br /> <br /> Halloween director John Carpenter took full advantage of the horror films of the 1950s and combined everything he knew in a movie that scared many people in the late 1970s. The film consolidated him as a director to watch and also began the career of Jamie Lee Curtis, who plays the girl who is being harassed by the masked assassin. <br /> <br /> This movie may seem clich√© today, but back then there was not much out there like this. It has been copied and copied, but Halloween will always remain the teen horror movie par excellence. It still makes you shiver to hear the exciting music of Carpenter as we watch another victim chase down that mysterious Michael Myers.
