"Life hits us in the face ... we should try to keep ourselves beautiful" <br /> <br /> Debut movie of one of the best Belgian artists (singing songs), Tom Barman. A long-awaited film and --- happy joy happy joy for the Flemish cinema --- it's really worth seeing, and a promising job! It takes us to the life of 8 main characters who live on a Friday and a night. The title says a lot about how we spend time with them: we float like they do at the Friday night party, where they are a bit. <br /> <br /> His rhythmic style is very 'thought'. Excellent use of music Sometimes it takes the upper hand to the images and then you feel its power. Gainsbourg! QOTSA! The party scene (20 minutes?) Is an exciting visual experience due to the way it was filmed. It really keeps you with him while he's in a small place with a lot of people organizing a big party ... so hard to record. <br /> <br /> Thanks, Menij√®r Barman for making this film daring These, already some years ago, the poor times of the Flemish cinematography. You have made my day!
