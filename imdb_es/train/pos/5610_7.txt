Roman Polanski masterfully directs this type of variation on the same theme as Repulsion. I can not imagine that there is an honest spectator who can not recognize the good director at Le Locataire, but both parts of the diptych may not be entirely satisfactory to most people, including myself. <br /> <br /> Polanski is very good at making us feel the inner torture of his characters (Deneuve in Repulsion and himself in Le Locataire), starting with a certain lack of confidence in himself to gradually become a psychological concern that it will eventually become an irreversible physical discomfort. The terrible experience shared between the characters and the audience is very different from the fear and tension of the horror films, since there is no tangible supernatural element here. While horror films allow some kind of catharsis (whether cheap or more elaborate), Polanski sadistically tortures us and, if in his last work the black humor is permanent, we are more nervous than on the edge of our seats. <br /> <br /> The suspense, the horror, all this is a matter of playing with the expectations of the audience (alternatively deceiving and fulfilling them), not literally with the nerves of the people. In my book, Rosemary's Baby is a much greater achievement because paranoia and simple rationality are in constant struggle: the story is about a couple moving in a strange place, while we are forced to identify with a single character. Also, if the fantasy elements are in the mind of the hero, the situation is more uncomfortable because we, the spectators, are forced to judge him, reject him while we have been masterfully attracted ("paint and attract") to be him.
