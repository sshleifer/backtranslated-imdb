This is a very rare and probably the least known film of Shirley Temple, since it is not found in any of its collections. The reason why it probably is because it does not have a happy ending, unlike all its other movies. musical, although it makes a song called 'The world owes me life'. The film was made in 1934 and originally in black and white, the version I have is in color and on VHS, I would say that they have done a good job, since the color seems realistic, unlike what Laurel's colored films would say and Hardy, who are terrible. The movie is good for its age and the story has no date. I'm surprised that nobody tried to do it. make a remake Sometimes the movie is a bit too interesting as some of the scenes with Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard seem really dragged, in some scenes it seems that it takes fifteen minutes to say what they could have said in five. Do not get discouraged because this movie has some really good moments, especially when {Jerry} Ga Cooper stole a necklace and hid it in Shirley's teddy bear. The tension and the slowness increase in their actions, {while at the same time their daughter is singing for an audience in another room} is very well directed. Gary and Caroles get nervous Facial expressions when put under scrutiny are also very good. In all this is a good movie from the early 30's, accept it for your age.
