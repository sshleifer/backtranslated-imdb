I liked the movie. Some of the action scenes were very interesting, tense and well done. I especially liked the opening scene that had a semi truck. A very tense action scene that seemed well done. <br /> <br /> Some of the transition scenes were filmed in interesting ways, such as time lapse photography, unusual colors or interesting angles. Also the movie is fun is several parts. I also liked how the villain was portrayed. I would give the movie an 8 out of 10.
