I was given the opportunity to see this 1926 movie in a superbly restored theater that was once part of the extensive chain of Paramount vaudeville houses. This Paramount has a organ of "Mighty Wurlitzer" also superbly restored, which was used to accompany the silent films of the day. <br /> <br /> We were fortunate that Dennis James, a key figure in the international rebirth of silent films at the Mighty Wurlitzer, acted appropriately. Music and thematic compositions adjusted to the action of the film. The print was an almost perfect digital copy of the rapidly decomposing nitrate negative and the whole experience was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to see a silent movie as it was meant to be seen. <br /> <br /> This was the first American film of Greta Garbo. He was only 20 years old, but he already had 6 Swedish films in his repertoire. <br /> <br /> It's a bit ironic that this is a silent movie about an opera star; Although the Mighty Wurlitzer contributed greatly to the staging, it was necessary to leave much to the imagination. <br /> <br /> Are modern audiences, for the most part, not understanding silent films? Acting was different then, with expansive gestures and broad facial expressions. So audiences laugh at inappropriate times? the performance is seen as "hammy" and exaggerated? but it was simply the style of the period. <br /> <br /> Garbo, with all his subtlety, did much to start the new era of acting: I could say more with a half-closed eye and the volumes could be read in a downward glance or a simple shrinking shoulders She exemplifies the truth that "an image is worth a thousand words". <br /> <br /> Although this is the first American film by Garbo, it is quite obvious that the studio knew what they had in their hands: this was the realization of MGM films in is the best The sets and costumes were magnificent . Special effects ?? What by today's standards are quite weak? They were still electrifying and amazing. <br /> <br /> The script by Vicente Blasco Ibáñez (from the novel by Entre Naranjos) seems to be tailor-made for Garbo; shows their strengths, magnifies their assets and there is no problem of annoying language with which to deal: a Swedish actress can play a Spanish temptress without any suspension of disbelief on our part. <br /> <br /> His co-star was MGM Response to Rudolph Valentino: Ricardo Cortez. He does an admirable job and did something that few romantic stars of the day would have done in a movie: allow himself to look unattractive, look silly and grow old without grace. <br /> <br /> There are some pretty good parts of character that are more than adequately acted? Especially when considering the power that was Garbo. Among them Lucien Littlefield stand out as "Cupido" and Martha Mattox as "Doña Bernarda Brull". <br /> <br /> This is when the extraordinary director of photography, William H. Daniels, met Garbo. They continued doing 20 movies together. (He was the director of photography in 157 films and his career spanned five decades!) He was able to capture her ethereal beauty and it was her photography that was responsible for the nickname for which she became known: The Divine Garbo. Without her magnificent skills, she would not have been the success she had. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie is a very rare opportunity: if you ever have the chance, do not miss it.
