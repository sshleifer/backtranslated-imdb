['I see many people in this site wishing that AG comes out on DVD. Well, I bought it on DVD. (From Borders, no less!) While it&#39;s great to have this fantastic show on a boxed DVD, it bothers me that they have added very few in the way of &quot;extra&quot; (A comment from the director of Shaun Cassidy in the Pilot episode) and the episodes are shown in the same order in which they were broadcast on TV. The missing episodes that were never shown before running on the Sci Fi channel are in the box as a whole, but they are in the final DVD. If you buy the DVD set, get the actual order to see them and you will be happier. (You will need to swap DVDs in and out of your player to see them in order, but you will be glad you did). <br /><br /> S']
