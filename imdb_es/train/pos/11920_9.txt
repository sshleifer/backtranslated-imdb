Christopher Lloyd is funny and really credible as "Al the head angel". This movie is much better than the first, but it has great special effects that the first one did not have, as well as a much better plot and writing. <br /> <br /> Well, it was written for children, but adults do. As fun as children do. Tony Danza does a very realistic job in his role, but this is NOT a Taxi meeting. <br /> <br /> Danny Glover is really good and he even seems to be very human in his emotions, besides showing some acting talent. for a change, a pleasant change. <br /> <br /> Look at least once; It's worth the effort to catch it.
