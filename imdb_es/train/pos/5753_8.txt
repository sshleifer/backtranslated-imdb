*** 1/2 Out of ***** Although I'm not concerned about the fact that this is a bent English version, as some reviewers have mentioned, it should be noted, since it seems to reside in many native Quebecois hearts. However, this was a girl movie of which I was a fervent admirer; Considering that it was now made for children, I rate it on a relative basis. The story is of children on winter vacations who build an impressive fort of snow, and they fight for control with weapons such as snowballs and other concoctions, such as idle hands and free time equal to winter holiday lessons. If I had children, this is definitely a movie I would try to interest them in, since Snow Fort captivated me when I was young, and I think even today's children would agree, although with Pixar and all the computer animation, maybe yes. I'm outdated and I do not realize it. In addition, the message of the film is wonderfully allegorical and positive, for children (and adults alike).
