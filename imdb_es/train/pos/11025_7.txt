Cliffhanger is a decent action crime adventure with some flaws from director Renny Harlin, who admires making this film about an expert climber who is kidnapped with a friend by a gang of dangerous criminals in the search for money-laden cases. Stolen. The Rocky Mountains. Sylvester Stallone is impressive as Gabe Walker, the expert climber, especially in the action / fight sequences, but some of them are definitely in line with the unrealistic. For the sake of the movie, although I'm willing to suspend my disbelief. The rest of the cast that includes John Lithgow, Michael Rooker, Janine Turner, Rex Linn, Caroline Goodall and Leon are respectable as the supporting characters of the film. The action / fight sequences are well executed, but as mentioned before, some are not very realistic, no matter how difficult you are. However, the sequences for climbing are very well done, because instead of doing the whole movie in a studio somewhere, the places they chose felt very real and the views of the mountain ranges of Ariel are wonderful and they give a touch of reality to the movie. Deaths are inventive, while others are somewhat predictable. The villains are solid, but it would have been better if they had focused on a more central one instead of having many of them. The pace of the film was a bit slow, but the good overcomes the bad in this case. If you are a big Harlins or Stallone fan, chances are you enjoy this one too. In general, Cliffhanger has character development with enough action, drama, suspense, excitement, emotion and good performances from the cast that make this movie worthwhile.
