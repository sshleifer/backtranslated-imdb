This is a movie that can make you want to see it again. Especially, I liked the way it ended. I did not see the end, but when Laws was not surprised the first time, you suspect he will come back again. <br /> <br /> The story is exciting and could have been more psychological, but I understand that history was necessary to capture the viewer and action was necessary for that. <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe that Michael Jr. could be as seemingly immobile as his younger brother and his mother, so impressed. But, I can appreciate that the game of the scene really could not get our attention there because it had a better story to tell. <br /> <br /> Some have complained that Hanks was a gangster. I think that is not justified. If her character had been more difficult, she would not have minded if her son pulled a trigger or not. <br /> <br /> Eight stars for this. Although it was released in 2002, I saw it for the first time yesterday on DVD.
