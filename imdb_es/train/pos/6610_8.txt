In 2054 Paris, Avalon, a computer-generated system, controls the city and when a young girl is kidnapped, Detective Karas (Craig) must go against Avalon to find her. <br /> <br /> Renaissance is a splendid combination of films mixed with a futuristic conceptual narrative that illuminates the screen in a stunning mansion with a black thematic ideology and conceptual montages that should delight many. <br /> <br /> Pixar are the masters of animation. His numerous Oscar-winning films are endless, from the charming Toy Story to the disconcerting Wall-E, so any company or director has a real challenge to knock them down. However, Renaissance is not a film aimed at young audiences, and like Persepolis in 2007, it offers a solid and mature approach to the genre of animation to make an older and more challenging film for its older generation. <br /> <br /> In 2005, Robert Rodriguez released a stunning Sinir brilliant Sin City that shook all the use of the green screen with a splendid balance of filming in black and white with the odd color and a year later, Christian Volckman took a similar approach with this equally visually masterful blow of filmmaking. <br /> <br /> Volckman's image is a complete animation, but it does not seem realistic in most cases: 1 hour and 40 minutes of execution time. The faces of the characters are well represented and, in particular, this film has to be the best for the use of shadow. The fact that we never know if it is day or night is irrelevant when we simply look at the stone faces while the shadows mingle in their expressions. It is almost an intelligent use of the pathetic fallacy, and it is also finely directed. <br /> <br /> For anyone who has seen Persepolis, he will have come to the conclusion that it is one of the finest directed animations that has been projected for the simple one. but the highly conceptual artistic style of Marjane Satrapi <br /> <br /> Renaissance also agrees with that image and in many cases competes with stronger graphics and a darker tone to reflect the mood. A particular scene when Karas appears in the dark is beautifully filmed. <br /> <br /> The narrative revolves around a stubborn and meddlesome political government that watches over all citizens. The functioning of Paris is due to the mysterious Avalon, which we do not see enough to obtain an essence of its true domain. Renaissance controls the narrative around the attempts of a policeman tired of rescuing the mysterious woman, and then we see that the tired and bored police of Craig tries a rescue while fighting with other elements. There are many things that are wrong with the scripts, not to mention that the tired and exasperated routine of police is now old, but there is a lot of adrenaline and jokes between characters to keep it alive until a wonderful and surprising shot is produced in the last couple of stages.
