Aileen Gonsalves, my girlfriend, is in this movie playing a secretary in the bank of the main character. She has a lovely scene with Roshan Seth in a restaurant. There is more information on his website at> Having expressed my personal interest in the film, I must say that I think it is a beautiful film: moving, funny and beautifully filmed.
