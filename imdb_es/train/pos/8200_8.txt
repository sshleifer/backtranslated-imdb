Clint Eastwood has definitely produced better films than this one, but this one does not embarrass him. Dirty Harry gets everybody's attention and, unless you want to see a romance, there's no reason why you do not like it. It's great because it's dirty, it's great because it kills without thinking much, it's perfect because it receives the bullet in the heart and a hero because he does not care. <br /> <br /> For what I have. seen in films in which Eastwood acts, the main role character always captivates the audience. In White Hunter Black heart, he is the crazy director, in "in the Line of Fire" he is the "Old 'a", while here he is the "almost" unemployed in his work, that is, he does the work for himself same. Nobody cares that he cares about his superiors, who practically send him on vacation. <br /> <br /> Based on a rape victim, this film is promising for all viewers of the "nonsensical" movie. The movie has nothing that moves away from the central plot. However, what makes it slightly inferior to Eastwood's best films is that, although the main role character is captivating the plot, it is not, since it is too obvious from the start. It is not a movie that will make you sit in a place without moving. Also, there are too many people much dirtier than Dirty Harry.
