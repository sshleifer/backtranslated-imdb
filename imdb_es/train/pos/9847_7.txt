I had fun watching this movie ... despite the feeling I had most of the time, that this movie was almost copying Monsters Inc. There are some things that are extremely similar between the two, the relationship between an animal / monster and a small child, other animals that try to break that relationship, etc. I found that throughout the entire film, for me. <br /> <br /> However, one of the redeeming features is Scrat :) Very, very funny character, even if it does not help at all :)
