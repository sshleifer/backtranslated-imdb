For anyone who has judged others at the first meeting, this is the perfect tutorial on the depth of character. The grumpy old woman has a soft and thoughtful heart, and needs new friends. The fleeting lady, insecure, "ditsy" who makes inappropriate and uncomfortable comments, sees deeply in her soul and has pure love for all. The cold, prim, proper and careless wife has a passion for simmering that could overflow at any time, taking into account the correct configuration. The perfect beauty: rich, sweet, festive, pursued by crowds, wants peace, tranquility and love without possessiveness. <br /> <br /> By taking the time to look beyond the surface, you will find treasures in everyday life, from the least expected sources. All that is needed is patience and a touch of charm.
