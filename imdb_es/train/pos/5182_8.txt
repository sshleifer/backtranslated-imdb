A quiet film, sweet and beautifully nostalgic about how to confront old friends and the environment of your youth with all the memories, problems and sorrows of the present with you. A movie that makes you feel good. All the ingredients are here: old jelousy, rivalry, friendship and loyalty. Mischief, nighttime raids on the refrigerator and all the other fun things we all remember from our summer camps. All the characters have the opportunity for a week to experience this again, since the former camp leader is now retiring and wants to meet the children of the camp's golden years. All of them are now in their thirties and in the middle of their careers.
