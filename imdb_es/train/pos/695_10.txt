This movie attracts you and hooks you to keep your eyes on the screen. The writer / director is brilliant with the narrative parts and the use of creative and interesting camera angles and perspectives that add to the grip he will have on you. Insomniac's Nightmare is original and refreshingly different from any other movie you've seen. Is it a dream or reality? This indie will make you discuss the twists and turns you take through the conscious and the subconscious. It has a strange touch with its dark interpretations of illusions. Dominic Monaghan really became insomnia. He is a great actor who is not hard with his eyes either! He really poured out his whole being in this role. From the story to the way it is taken, this indie is one of my favorites. I highly recommend it and I look forward to seeing more of this creative / innovative writer / director / cinematographer!
