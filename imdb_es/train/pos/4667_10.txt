I recently found this movie on VHS after searching for it for several years, I was not disappointed. It gets better every time I see it. Peter Ustinov stars and co-writes the original script (nominated for an Academy Award). Other stars you've heard about are Karl Malden, Bob Newhart and Cesar Romero. Ustinov plays an accountant / embezzler, recently freed from the infamous English prison Wormwood Scrubs (which he had embezzled from the headquarters of the Conservative Party, selected because he is a liberal). Immediately he starts looking for a new employer that he can embezzle and discovers that computers are the wave of the future. Engineer socially in a men's club in London and learn the identity of the best computer experts in the city, steals the identity of a Caesar Smith, who just left the city to South America to devote to his love for collecting moths in the nature. . He makes his way to Ta-Can-Co, an American conglomerate headed by Carlton Klemper (Karl Malden). Klemper hires Smith and shows him around the computer center, especially his security feature consisting of a blinking blue light. Ustinov asks the computer how to cancel its security and the computer says, "Disconnect the blue light." Using piracy techniques from 30 years in the future, Ustinov bursts into the system and programs the computer to generate written checks to several fake companies. The scheme begins to crumble when Klemper's assistant, Willard G. Gnatpole (Bob Newhart) notices the amount of business that it seems that Ta-Can-Co is transacting with the Ustinov scam companies. With the help of his secretary Patty Terwilliger (Maggie Smith), Ustinov manages to avoid prosecution and lives happily ever after. To tell him how he would ruin this very funny, romantic, intelligent and ahead of his time image.
