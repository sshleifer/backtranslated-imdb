['I liked almost all the movies in the Dirty Harry series, except the one that I think is entitled &quot;Enforcer&quot;. &quot;Deadpool&quot; was also a bit weak in some areas, but I still enjoyed it. This is one of my favorites of the series, and nothing more for the great line of &quot;Go ahead, make my day&quot;. This also presents an interesting plot, although familiar, of someone who is killing those who have done it wrong. Just think of &quot;Magnum Force&quot; with less mystery about who is behind the murders and you will have your plan. Of course, there is a little more than that, as this has a very nice final showdown in an amusement park. He also presents Dirty Harry receiving a bulldog as a gift and tripping Sandra Locke into a rather comical scene. The only question that remains is why Clint Eastwood had to have the rather mediocre actress Sandra Locke in many of her films. She reduces the score one point at a time, even when in general the movie is nice to me. Of course, it&#39;s not so bad here, but your character could have been much better for someone else. Another problem with this movie and other Dirty Harry movies, sometimes almost look like gun ads. I like weapons as much as the next person, but do we really need scenes from him that explain the different strengths of his new weapon and how many bullets does it contain? Still, very good entry into the Dirty Harry movie series.']
