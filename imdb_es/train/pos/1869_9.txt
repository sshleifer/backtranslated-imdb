['The story of Antwone Fisher about child neglect and abuse is an inspiration to all of us who witness or even experience the plight of foster children. Abandoned by a troubled mother, Antwone has never met her father. Growing up with &quot;church-going&quot; abusers who use the &quot;n-word&quot; not only to intimidate and hurt, but also as a term of endearment, as a young man witnessing how his best friend is killed in an assault , lasting racial insults and being molested while serving in the Navy, Antwone&#39;s anger slowly becomes a positive power when he is advised by a Navy psychiatrist, and a love enters his life. <br /><br /> The scene in which Antwone meets his biological mother is one of the most powerful moments of the film. Surprised by the unexpected confrontation, the woman listens in silence to hear the young man tell him how he has lived a life without crime, drug addictions, parents on the left and on the right, all in spite of their totally adverse circumstances. <br /><br /> If that scene was not powerful enough, the next one takes it home (and opens the floodgates): a reception to welcome Antwone home; dozens of smiling faces and open arms announcing that HE is part of this great family. <br /><br /> One of the messages emitted by this wonderful film is that there are many sincere and well-meaning people who work to help orphans and unwanted children. Even if some of the homes and administrators do not care and seem to be selfish, many give it their all. The character who found the &quot;file&quot; of Antwone once he revealed the circumstances of his birth is one of those &quot;bright lights&quot; in the darkness of the system. <br /><br /> The DVD includes a track in French, several subtitle options, as well as additional features and information on foster care. <br /><br /> As Clevelander I appreciated the images of the location. No matter where you are from, this autobiographical gem will move you deeply.']
