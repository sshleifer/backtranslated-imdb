Sports movies have never been my thing, but a small handful of them work for me. The best are those that focus less on the sport and more on the character, such as Raging Bull, the Wrestler and Girlfight. This is a great directorial debut for Karyn Kusama, and an excellent first performance for Michelle Rodriguez. Girlfight feels that it is realistic and involving, that is enough to make it a memorable film. <br /> <br /> The plot is quite close. Diana Guzman is in her fourth year of high school, but due to her fights in the hall, she is close to being expelled. As a possible means to unleash his anger, he enrolls in boxing classes at the club where his brother is training (at his father's will). <br /> <br /> Over the course of ninety minutes, viewers see something extraordinary Diana almost literally changes from a girl to a woman. We see it both in her body and in her behavior, especially when one of the guys at the club feels attracted to her and she gets into that. There is not a bad scene or a lame / artificial moment in the movie. The only mistake I would say could be corrected is that one of the secondary points ends in what seems like an unfinished note. Apart from that, Girlfight is a great movie.
