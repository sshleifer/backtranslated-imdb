"Cinco d√≠as" is cataloged as something special, a criminal drama that consists of a series of episodes, each set on a particular day of a police investigation. But, in fact, this element of the story turns out to be quite less significant than originally thought, since the fact that the action in each episode is limited to 24 hours is barely perceptible, and very little distinguishes the program from much others. crime stories. In fact, one almost can not stop making comparisons with the last 'Prime Suspect', since one of the secondary plots focuses on a single and cynical female police approaching retirement: and it's not just Helen's absence Look at what makes the comparisons unfavorable. . There is a lot of manipulative and over emotive music and a set of characters apparently designed so that each one is sympathetic in some sense, in another suspect. And it is possible to guess who is the culprit long before the end, not by the internal dynamics of the story, but by the construction of the drama as a whole: certain things must be true, to justify the way in which the series is focused. in certain characters at certain times. Despite these failures, the series grew on me: in the end, I was quite caught up. But it is a sad sign that the BBC, which once did the style of 'The Singing Detective', boasted of "arguably the best drama of the year": because there is little real originality here, and the claim reveals a lack of Ambition that is terribly disappointing. 'Five days' is really not junk; but it is a formula, and one would expect that the best that the BBC had to offer was something a little more innovative and fresh.
