Right now I'm in front of the television, looking at Casomai. It is changing, evolving or better ... returning. Start with a wedding of the two protagonists where their love story is told. After everything changes, a child is born and all the rest usually happens as a couple. It is not a special film because it speaks of a normal couple, and normality is the center of this film. He does not want to show us something in particular, there's nothing new, it's just a normal love story, the story of a couple, and being normal becomes different from the rest. It is also a flickering film, everything is short, each scene is long only a few seconds. It is a reported story, many things are known because friends and parents talk about it, and their opinion is fundamental, opinions create history and destroy it. It is a simple story of a couple, as I said, but it is not boring, it only shows a couple, it should be all that is known, it is, but I am sure that each one of you will want to know what happened, so no forget to look at the end!
