This is a movie to feel good, about a person's dreams and the impulse or push to realize them. It is a beautiful and inspiring movie. Why do some people have to try to find flaws in every movie that comes out, especially the good ones? Dennis Quaid offers solid good performance in this true story of Jim Morris, a science teacher and high school baseball coach who is pushed by his team to take one more shot at a professional baseball career. With an excellent cast of support, including Brian Cox, as the former Navy officer who has missed many of his son's achievements without his support. It was good to see him as something more than a villain in a movie. If I have a complaint with this movie is this: do not let Royce Applegate re-sign the national anthem. <br /> <br /> Seriously, this movie belongs to that handful of great baseball movies like "Field of Dreams" and "The Natural". It qualifies two thumbs up and a great "well done".
