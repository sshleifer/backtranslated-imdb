A lovely soft comic jewel, until the last five minutes, which degenerated into a farce of British TV. The last five minutes cost him 2 points in my qualification.

Many good bits to savor, such as the tense eternity we all spend waiting for the bank's approval after the employee has slipped the credit card ... has become more spicy when we are not, very sure that the card does not It is at maximum.
