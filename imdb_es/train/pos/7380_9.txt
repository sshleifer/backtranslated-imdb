The three main characters are very well represented, especially Anisio by the rock musician turned actor for the first time Paulo Miklos. He is extremely convincing as the low-class intruder / invader. The film shows very well the snowball effect of getting involved in increasingly shady businesses, the contrast and the similarities between the lower and higher classes. How everyone gets carried away by greed and ambition. 9-9.5 out of 10.
