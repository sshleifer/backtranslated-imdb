I found this movie on TV and I could not turn it off. Peter Sellers plays a nasty guy who falls in love with an extremely warm and pretty Goldie Hawn (who would not like that?). The way in which Goldie's character is maintained from the beginning of the film to the end is not traditional even today. This movie gave me a different angle in human relationships and I also found it very funny. The role of Peter Sellers was difficult to sell, but I think he does it well.
