Cult classics are almost impossible to predict. Who could guess that Vision Quest, Fight Club and 2001: A Space Oddysey, films that were criticized by critics and the public at the time of their release, would become immensely popular? Like many of the IMDB members, I consider myself an expert in movies. Unlike most of those who hated Envy (evidenced by a grim index of 4.4), I thought Envy was one of the funniest movies of the last decade. <br /> <br /> The plot of the movie is ridiculous. The dialogue is not intelligent, the scenes have little continuity and the script seems to have been written by a fourth grade student. But that's exactly why the movie is so hilarious. You see, to appreciate the accidental genius of Envy, you have to enjoy the movie from an ironically relaxed point of view. <br /> <br /> Why do I love Envy? Because the movie is bad to the point that it becomes good. This is the recipe for a cult classic, and Envy definitely fits perfectly.
