I was surprised by the low rating that this movie got from the spectators. I saw him one night on television and he arrived at the place; Actually I think it was in 1989 when it first appeared. However, I remember it quite well, with a nice twist or two, and an interesting environment in a wind farm. Michael Pollard looks pretty sleazy for his role, which pretty much sums up the early unfulfilled promise of his career, and everyone else plays it quite right. I definitely recommend it as a rental, although some of the issues, which may have seemed a bit restless in 1989, may now seem docile, which is a shame, considering that contemporary "restlessness" is often used as a marketing tool necessary something like clamoring just to get attention.
