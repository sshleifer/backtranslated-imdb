The first mystery is to guess what the original Welles film was like. That makes it a real adventure: see an incomplete skeleton and use the forensic film analysis, imagine the beautiful woman who once supported. <br /> <br /> If you do, you will see and experience one of the best movies. mysteries never As the mysteries advance, the narrative is quite ordinary: a simple distraction, a jealous husband like red herring. <br /> <br /> What is quite miraculous is Welles' location of the story in an artificial eye to see a dark and multifaceted world. . The first real noir, but even darker. It is not an obviously twisted world, unless you think about the camera. What we can see firsthand is that someone is creating a vocabulary that would later become common. <br /> <br /> For the whole celebration, Kane was a success because of the great drama and the story. The eye of the camera was shocking, but experimental. Welles would go from there to explore the narrative mystery and Shakespeare's self-reference with this eye. Othello and MacBeth are beginning in this period, and I consider them part of a single vision with this. <br /> <br /> The feeling of noir here is based on the idea that people are not in charge of their lives, even a little, they are manipulated by random factors in the environment. So in telling this story, Welles has to turn the environment into a character. Several characters as suspects in the mystery. <br /> <br /> Thus we have the famous illumination, the blocking and the angles that we know (and since then we have seen innumerable times). And we have deliberately closed sets: the park, the yacht, the picnic area, the aquarium, the pier, the audience room, the Chinese theater and the funhouse. I am sure that what the barbarians cut off was a lot of "external" narratives that do not deal with the character, but with these strange environments. <br /> <br /> My own solution to the mystery is that the house of fun did it, Among the other environments of characters introduced as suspects. In other words, the manipulation of Black Irish (which we know from the notes and a scene that he wrote in the union was an aspiring novelist) was not a force of human conspiracy (the park or the civilized version, the court) nor the nature . (The picnic or the civilized version, the aquarium). <br /> <br /> Instead, it was a matter of the gods' deliberate whimsy for fun. This is, of course, a reference to what Welles is doing: subjecting these people (including himself) through hell on our own whim, a matter highlighted by the Peking opera with doped Welles. And, of course, take to the house of fun, where the environment intermingles directly with perception. <br /> <br /> More information on self-reference: surely there is a conscious comment about your relationship with your future wife. But I think there is a strong subconscious comment about his own mockery of the environment in which he worked, the study environment. Surely Welles was so fucked up, and in the same way, as his character. And that fucker took the form of the murder of this movie, leaving the rotten corpse mentioned at the beginning of this comment. <br /> <br /> The poor Rita that comes from China ties the whole thing, the Chinese theater, the Rape expected from above, the loss of the woman. Investment in the environment beyond everything.
