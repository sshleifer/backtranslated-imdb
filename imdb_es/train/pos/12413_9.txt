Story of a poorly executed prisoner who corners the prison in which he was electrocuted and kills random prisoners while waiting to take revenge on the man who stopped him. <br /> <br /> Viggo Mortensen is great, and the acting is pretty good in general. Lane Smith is deliciously evil as the guilty director. In addition, this film has great blood, including death by mummification with barbed wire.
