['I could not look away from this movie when it appeared on the cable. The dialogue and the costumes are of a quality that is more easily associated with soft-core pornography. In this case, the convenient plot serves as a vehicle not for sex, but for serial tricks with nunchuks. (Maybe for sex too, but not on Indian television, anyway). <br /><br /> Not being a fan of the genre, I could not locate Jeff Wincott and had no clues to look for. Only once Brigitte Nielsen changed her futuristic nurse&#39;s cap (what a mayor!) Because of the fading of the top we remembered from Beverly Hills Cop II, I got positive identification with her. <br /><br /> This film will undoubtedly entertain any admirer of haute couture of the early 90s or the nod of Paul Verhoeven. Can we add a gender label for &quot;so bad, is it good&quot;?']
