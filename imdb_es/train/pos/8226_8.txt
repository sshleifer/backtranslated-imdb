['We are talking about a low-budget film, and it is understandable that there are some weaknesses (there are no spoilers: a sudden explosives expert and a nonsensical alcoholic); but in general, the story keeps you interested, most of the characters are nice and there are some original situations. <br /><br /> I really like movies that surprise you with some people that are not what they want you to believe and then they turn and spin the plot ... I applaud this in that. <br /><br /> If you know what I mean, try to see also &quot;Nine Queens&quot; (Nine Queens), a film from Argentina.']
