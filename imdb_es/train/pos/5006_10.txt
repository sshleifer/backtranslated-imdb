I remember having tripped over this special while navigating the canal in 1965. I had never heard of Barbra before. When the program ended, I thought: "This is probably the best on television that I will see in my life." 42 years later, that has been fulfilled. There is still nothing so surprising, as honest as the talent that was shown here. You can talk about all the super stars you want, this is the most superlative of all! <br /> <br /> Whatever you want, she can do it. Comedy, pathos, seductive seduction, ballads, Barbra is an authentic storyteller. His ability to achieve everything he tries is legendary. But this special was done at the beginning and helped create the legend in which he quickly became. Despite having grown so much in such a short time, she has fulfilled the promise, revealing more of her talents as she progressed. But everyone is here from the beginning. You will not be disappointed to see this.
