Martin Sheen, Michelle Phillips, Stuart Margolin and the late Vic Morrow are the human stars of this film about a young man looking for answers about his brother's death. Mr. Sheen, Mr. Margolin and Mr. Morrow perform top-level roles in their respective roles; Ms. Phillips has the slightly less enviable task of trying to spice up a movie made for television (twenty-five years ago), by providing "sexual interest" in a film that otherwise does not have sex. The real star, however, is the "California Child"; a 1934 Ford Coupe, taken from "Jake" Jacobs, placed before a camera and trained that will leave the spectator panting, panting and holding the edge of the seat with a breathless expectation. <br /> <br /> The action scenes are spectacular (although part of the dialogue is a bit lacking) which makes the fun of a night is excellent. This is how all "car movies" should be done. <br /> <br /> Try to capture this in the late movies channel; It's worth losing the dream.
