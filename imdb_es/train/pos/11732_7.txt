OK, I saw this in theaters when it came out and I do not know why. I have not seen it since, but I ended up on this page because I found myself thinking about this movie, once again, I do not know why. But the fact that I remember it says a lot. <br /> <br /> Comedy is difficult, much more difficult than any drama. Doing it right makes it seem easy, but doing it wrong ... is there anything worse than bad comedy? Steve Martin, pay attention, you're falling into this category again for some reason. <br /> <br /> Elvira Mistress Of The Dark must have done well for me to remember this movie with love. Done at a rapid pace, with tongue in cheek and knowing that it is not the history of Philadelphia, it entertains from beginning to end. Brain Donors is another that fits perfectly in this category (without most of the free jokes). <br /> <br /> A point of discussion: the end. It seems that the writers / directors had no idea how to finish a comedy. The end tries to be a love story, undermining in some way the peculiar and rapid dialogue until that moment. Then there is the "tassle" scene. While this has to be seen (male opinion), it is so exaggerated and out of place that it is like a shock. A new version was needed for the end. <br /> <br /> This is not a comedy genius like Spinal Tap or The Producers or The Holy Grail. But if you do not try to dissect it and just let the puns and silly fun go to you, you'll laugh, I guarantee it.
