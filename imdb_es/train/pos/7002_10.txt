Once again, Will Smith delivers a film about a man with the weight of the world on his shoulders and his crusade to correct his mistakes in a way that touches even the most hardened of hearts! The writer Grant Nieporte and the Italian director Gabriele Muccino came together and created a masterpiece that I highly recommend buying and keeping in his movie collection, as he will never tire of seeing / feeling this movie. I have the highest respect for Will Smith, since not only is he a brilliant actor, but one can say he has a genuine love for people and life that undoubtedly made him perfect for the character (the IRS agent). Ben Thomas) who played in this movie. You will feel your pain and anger, the frustrations over your love for Emily, played by Rosario Dawson, who, by the way, was fantastic as always. I found myself falling in love with the fact that his characters were falling in love. Woody Harrelson also stars in this first class movie. I find it very difficult to write this review without revealing key points of the plot ... All I can say is: Look at it and, when you do, make sure you do not have anything to interrupt you, pick up the phone, sit down and get ready to start to try to unravel the mysterious life and past of the IRS agent Ben Thomas ... ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡
