Elegant, moody, innovative blood bath driven by revenge. Also cheesy, of course, and sporadically very cheesy. It reminded me a lot of The Big Heat because it has the revenge plan set up exactly for the same event, and the girl approaches the good guy's side due to the same bad boy's bad behavior. It is sad that there is no Gloria Grahame, but it is so fantastic that it is Alain Delon and not Glenn Ford. Could there be someone as beautiful as Alain spinning around in a cashmere sweater and a raincoat? However, it is totally hard and cold. Nowadays, nobody can touch it, although I suppose that someone like Jude Law could try it. Difficult for any girl to look good with him. The music was funky and perfect, and there were several excellent car chases (and those are not usually my cup of tea), especially one that is not in the woods. People also knew their sentences creatively and bloody, for example, in a junkyard. But beyond the cheese, the environment in general was affecting and retired by experts. More creativity, emotion and freshness in that "forgotten" movie than most of what I've seen lately.
