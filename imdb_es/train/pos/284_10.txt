The only season that has just premiered here in Australia, I thought it was absolutely brilliant! I love! All the lines of the story are so good! and it's a much more realistic view of today's adolescent and family life. however, he still maintained strong family values ​​of staying together and being together for each other. His problems were real and they really attracted you to the show. The show is basically about this family called 'The Days' and their lives. the family consisted of Abby Day (mom), Jack Day (dad), Natalie Day (sports daughter), Cooper Day (son outside) and Nathan Day (child genius son). every episode a day of his life, with coopers perspective on things along it. I loved cooperating his vision through the show was just great. He was by far my favorite character. ended with so many things that could have continued, I'm really sad because there was not another season. It was a great show that I will miss.
