With this theme, it is very easy to take cheap photos. You know, the guy with the hairy legs trying to look like Marilyn Monroe. Not here. Adrian Pasdar does an excellent job of making Gerald a REAL person, someone you care deeply about, and as a result you feel because of his difficult situation in trying to live like Gerald and Geraldine. Not only that, but like Geraldine, it looks good! And the chemistry between him and Julie Walters is electric. These are two characters who feel love for each other, and manifests even when they simply look over the breakfast table. Even the line of potentially corny sub-stories of corporate acquisitions is credible, and in the end you're cheering! At least I did!
