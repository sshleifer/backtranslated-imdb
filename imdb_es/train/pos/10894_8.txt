I had some reservations about this movie, I thought it would be the usual bill: a film about Christmas. Being in the middle of a heat wave at the end of June, we decided to try it anyway, maybe we'll see some snow. <br /> <br /> This movie turned out to be one laugh after another. Ben Affleck was credible in his character, but the true star of this is James Gandofini. He delivered his lines with real wit about him and made a great "father". <br /> <br /> If you want to spend a nice couple of hours, definitely check out this one.
