The inhabitants of Manhattan apartments have to endure all kinds of inconveniences. The worst is the lack of closet space! Some people who eat out all the time use their stoves and dishwashers as storage places because the cupboards are already full! <br /> <br /> Melvin Frank and Norman Panama, a large comedy writing team from that era, saw the potential in Eric Hodgins' novel, whose hero, Jim Blandings, can not stand the overcrowded apartment where he and his wife Muriel and his two daughters must share. <br /> <br /> Jim Blandings, a Madison Ave. Executive, has had it! When you see a life ad in Connecticut, you decide to take a look. Obviously, an owner for the first time, Jim is tricked by a real estate agent to buy the ruined house that an unscrupulous agent takes to inspect. This is just the beginning of your problems. <br /> <br /> Anything that could be wrong, goes wrong. The architect is asked to come up with a plan that does not work for the new house, after the original is razed. As one problem leads to another, more money is needed, and whatever the original cost, it ends with an inflated price that Jim could not pay. <br /> <br /> The movie is funny because of the Three principles in it. Cary Grant was an actor who clearly understood the character he played and took full advantage of Jim Blandings. Myrna Loy, was a charming actress who always acted effectively against Mr. Grant. The third character, Bill Cole, an old boyfriend of Myrna, turned into a lawyer for the Blandings, is soft and elegant, as played by Melvin Douglas. One of the Blandings girls, Joan, is played by Sharyn Moffett, who looked a lot like Eva Marie Saint. The great Louise Beavers plays Gussie, but she does not have much to do. <br /> <br /> James Wong Howe photographed the film with love, who clearly knew what to do to make this movie look much better. The H.C. Potter is light and successful in this film that will delight fans of classic comedies.
