At first I did not like it very much, although I did. They did not include the third generation of Trueba, the love between Blanca and Pedro was not well explained and some actors were very different from what he had imagined. <br /> <br /> Later I realized that, if the film had been more loyal to the book, it would have been like five hours long, and it would be a bit tedious. Now I like it a lot, because my favorite characters are there as I portrayed them. Clara really looks like a live angel, and her introduction to the story at the beginning of the movie was fantastic, loyal and short. Glenn Close is Ferula. I imagined it that way, but not crying the whole thing. Esteban is finding enough. I never liked his character and, although I was interested, I hated him a lot, especially when I hit Clara. As in the book, the last part is the most exciting, and it also has a real story. <br /> <br /> The movie is really good, especially considering it was a gringo movie based on a Latin American. book. It's amazing how many famous stars there are, do not you think?
