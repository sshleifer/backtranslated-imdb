['Magnificent and unforgettable, surprisingly atmospheric and brilliantly performed by all. <br /><br /> I really can not understand what kind of people are exploring this masterpiece and giving the preponderance of votes as 8 (and nine more!) <br /><br /> This, along with Grapes of Wrath, is the best John Ford movie. I would say that Long Voyage Home is the next on the line, although quite behind. <br /><br /> Score: 10. Deserves a 12.']
