This is a great short. I think every voice is made by Jason Steele. (although you can only say if you've heard your normal voice, so do not worry if they sound the same, they do not). Its duration is about 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> Edward the spatula is fighting the war against the spoons and encounters some strange people. In fact, everyone he knows seems crazy enough. <br /> <br /> "edward!" "General Peterson, we have to take him to a medical unit!" "No, I'm not going to do it Edward." "Do not talk like that, I'm sure you'll be fine." "I'm a Goner Edward, and you know it, before I go" "Yes?" "Can I just have ... a kiss?" "Umm no." "Come on, just one, little one, peck on the lips?" "I'm leaving now, sir." <br /> <br /> There will soon be a movie. the date for that is September, but it will probably be rejected.
