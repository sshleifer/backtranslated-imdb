Kurosawa weaves a story that has a cast of characters as diverse as any Shakespeare drama, and the acting is true to the story, with each star playing its role as part of the larger story. It is moving, fun and intriguing everywhere. The development of the character is almost perfect, the cinematography is vivid and attractive, and the story attracts you. <br /> <br /> I would like to say that the "samurai fanatics" and the obsessed with the dynastic of the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries The stories of Japan can dismiss this film as the best work of Kurosawa. It may not be the best, but even at its worst, Kurosawa is better than many of the best. This story is based so much on elevating the mundane life of ordinary people in a time of great changes, which is timeless, despite being set in a not too distant past. <br /> <br /> I would recommend it wholeheartedly. to any film fan, and especially to those who are likely to continue reading the novel on which the film is based.
