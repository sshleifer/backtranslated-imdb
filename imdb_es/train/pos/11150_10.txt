I sat down to watch "Midnight Cowboy" thinking it would be another overrated movie from the '60 / '70. Some of my favorite movies come from the 70s, in the same sense as "Midnight Cowboy" ("Taxi Driver", "Mean Streets", "Panic in Needle Park", etc.) but there are many, many overrated as Good, They have earned a solid reputation among critics for being innovative. Unfortunately, the vast majority of them do not resist so well today. Somehow I feel this way for "Easy Rider". (Although, also, it is one of my favorites). <br /> <br /> Therefore, I did not expect much from "Midnight Cowboy" but I got a lot back. It is a moving story, well done and well told with some of the best performances of all time. Dustin Hoffman, like Enrico "Ratso" Rizzo, gives one of his best results: he's a little funny at times (he sounds like a cartoon character when he speaks, maybe because of the Lenny / "Simpsons" connection), but Hoffman is completely convincing . Half of the movie's budget went to his salary, as he was becoming an important star in Hollywood. In front of him is Jon Voight, second in the bill, as Joe Buck, the "cowboy" who travels north to the Big Apple with the hope of becoming a prostitute. Soon his naive ways get him in trouble and he is paired with a crippled cripple named "Ratso" who offers to become Joe's "manager" for a certain percentage of profits. <br /> <br /> The movie is quite long At two hours but it never seems really long. Some films tend to crawl, especially some of those that were made in the 70s because (as has been said in "Easy Riders, Raging Bulls") the directors were the stars of the movies in the 70s and occasionally got a little too much in love of your material, spending too much time examining characters / scenes / etc. That's not important. Almost the only scene I felt was too long and unnecessary was the drug festival: it makes the film look extremely outdated (similar to the drug odyssey in "Easy Rider") and it really hurts your flow because it is not necessary. <Br /> <br /> Apart from that, "Midnight Cowboy" is an almost perfect movie. I was pleasantly surprised. It has its flaws (the flashbacks are a little sticky and never used as well as they could have been, for example) and some of the scenes are a bit uncomfortable (like the gay movie sequence) but you can handle their content "Midnight Cowboy "It's a really great movie, an inflexible examination of street life in the late '60s and early' 70s. It's a depressing movie, yes, and by today's standards it may seem a little outdated and heavy on the liberal perspective of "life is horrible, etc." ... but I still love it and in particular the extremely touching ending will stay with me for a long, long time. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended. One of the best films of the 70s. (It was released technically at the end of 1969, but it would still categorize it as a movie from the 1970s. It also won the Oscar for Best Film, being the first and only film with a classification X who did it, later R was re-evaluated on appeal.) <br /> <br /> 4.5 / 5
