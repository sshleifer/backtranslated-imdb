It's always nice to see Angela Bassett play a role where she can really sink her teeth. Sometimes she is intense, funny and even sexy in her role as Lena, a "colored" woman forced to build a house on a desolate mud bank just outside of Cape Town, South Africa. Danny Glover is also good in a not entirely comprehensive role as his partner, Boesman. Willie Jonah offers a performance with fine nuances as the stranger who discovers the new living room of Boesman and Lena. It is not often that you have the opportunity to watch a smart movie about mature themes. Although based on a play, the late director John Berry (who also directed Claudine) opens the material by having the film shot in widescreen cinemascope format. It also keeps things visually interesting through the creative blockade of the actors and by showing us the things that are only mentioned in the work. Like Diahann Carroll in Claudine, John Berry may have directed Angela Bassett to an Academy Award nomination. This is definitely a movie that is worth looking for.
