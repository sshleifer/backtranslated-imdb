This movie has everything you want from an action movie. Explosions, shootings, bad and worse. It's fun to see James Belushi using his humor to get out of the problems he's gotten into since he stole $ 12 million from the big boss "The Skipper." This sounds cheesy, of course it is. I had a lot of fun watching this movie, it's much better than all the DVD junk that is made today, if you can get over the absurd plot, then you will discover that this movie has quite a few surprises in it, I could argue that the turns are predictable. of this movie does not give you too much time, think too much about them, which is a blessing, since this movie is not about revealing the definitive turnaround, that moment, only the title is a bit misleading and that could be the reason why that so many people hated this movie, they probably expected a movie about mobsters instead of some scammers crossing each other.
