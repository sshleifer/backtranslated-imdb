This was the best movie I've seen about bulimia. It came to the exact place that bulimia really is and how it is not always about being thin and dieting. It showed how people with bulimia tend to think about things like their vision of life, friends and themselves. The best phrase and the part that really shows what the problem with bulimia is is when Beth says, "It's not about you!" That line really showed a lot about the character and others with the same problem. It was shown that people with bulimia do not have this problem because of anything that has to do with someone else. It has to do with them and only with them. It shows that it is time to talk about the person with the problem instead of putting all the attention on themselves. He showed that Beth needed attention at that moment and that she needed her mother's attention at that moment as much as possible.
