This movie is very good! The acting is fine, with an excellent casting of Corbin Bernsen as the perfectionist dentist who is scared and tortures his patients. At first he sees his wife with the man in the pool, and then he goes crazy. He also takes revenge on his wife and the man in the pool, next to the patients who torture. The most special effects are also beautiful, although some are really fake (like a pierced tongue, which has been put on for 1 night outdoors and which is still red in the morning). But the scenes of torture are absolutely well done. Although this movie has the weak point that it is very slow; there are sometimes extremely boring parts between the heavy parts. But for the real horror / thriller-fan this is a watch that must be seen!
