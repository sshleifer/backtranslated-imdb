This film stands out from the vast majority of romantic film comedies. It is virtually impeccable! Writing, acting, production design, humor and pathos are wonderful. Even music, from Dean Martin to La Boheme, is captivating and charming! <br /> <br /> Each character is particularly charming and memorable, from the protagonists played by Cher and Nicolas Cage, to the many supporting roles: - Olympia Dukakis, Vincent Gardenia, John Mahoney, Danny Aiello, even Grandpa with your dog pack! Each of these artists, plus Norman Jewison as Director, performs above their normal quality in this joint work. For several of the actors, this was one of the main initial exhibitions in the cinema, so the casting is also exceptional, and we have many current acting powers whose careers were altered by their effectiveness in this film. <br /> <br /> I have seen this movie several times until the end, which can sometimes substantially deflate the impact of a movie. More revealing, some years ago I realized that every time I navigated the channel through a scene from this movie, any scene, the scene was compelling and beautifully designed. There are so many amazing and memorable scenes in the original encounter between the characters of Cher and Nicolas Cage, where Cage tells his story of pain; Vincent Gardenia discovered with his lover in the opera, amid the splendor generated by his business of plumbing in a gold mine; Olympia Dukakis scolded John Mahoney for talking to his student about the classic line on relationships with co-workers: "Do not go where you eat!"; Danny Aiello next to the bed of his dying mother; Nicolas Cage "taking" Cher as the outburst of an aria rises in the background! <br /> <br /> Of course, there are many great romantic comedies, including Sabrina (both versions, but especially the original by Audrey Hepburn / Humphrey Bogart / William Holden); When Harry met Sally; Apartment. <br /> <br /> Nothing is the same as Moonstruck!
