A typical Clausen movie, but again not typical. Clausen writes, directs and plays one of the leading roles. This is really a great movie about normal people who live a normal life trying to do their best. The 4 main actors were fantastic. <br /> <br /> Fritz Helmut was convincing. You think he really is sick. <br /> <br /> Sonja Richter plays a nurse who is really an actor, but it turns out that she is the best nurse to take care of the old man. <br /> <We all have problems and those where nobody believes end up being happy. But nothing good comes easy, they have to fight to earn their life and their love.
