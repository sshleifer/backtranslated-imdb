WINCHESTER 73 is the story of a man (Jimmy Stewart) obsessed with recovering his prized possession, a repetitive rifle manufactured by Winchester. The rifle keeps changing hands, and Stewart follows it stubbornly. This B & W effort in 1950 by Anthony Mann is more of a crime movie than a traditional western, and cowboys often look more like modern gangsters than outdated cowboys. Shelley Winters plays a woman of questionable virtue who goes to a ranch with a man (Charles Drake) with whom she can marry. She ends up falling in love with Stewart, but not before she passes a little. Winters is the most complex character in a movie full of unusual characters. Look out for a young Dan Dureyea as a crazy killer and Tony Curtis in a very small role. Will Geer, one unfortunately misunderstood, plays Wyatt Earp.
