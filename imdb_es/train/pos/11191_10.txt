This terrifying and rather bloody adaptation of the great novel by Stephen King features outstanding central performances by Dale Midkiff, Fred Gwynne (who sadly died a few years ago) and Denise Crosby and some really horrifying gore effects. Director Mary Lambert has a wonderful sense of visual style, and she manages to make this one of the few versions of King's work that is not only worth seeing, but also genuinely disconcerting. The representation of the zombie boy Gage (Miko Hughes, later in "New Nightmare") is equally remarkable, as what could have become a laughable character, becomes threatening and spooky. As for the people, who think that this is not scary, look at it only in the dark (eventually with your delicate girlfriend) and I guarantee that "Pet Sematary" will crawl out. Some horror movies like this one or "The Massacre of the Texas Chainsaw" should not be seen as a group. Recommended for terror fans!
