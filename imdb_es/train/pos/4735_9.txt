Yesterday I saw the new version edited and modified and I loved it. Then I went home and saw it with subtitles and I loved it. I'm ready to see it again. <br /> <br /> I am an imbecile for the secret identity of good manners and what could be more moderate than a pacifist librarian? The scenes in which he reveals his superpowers to his friends or forget to be meek are my favorites. <br /> <br /> Of course, the martial arts are impressive. There's really not much I can say about them if you're familiar with the HK style. However, if it is not ... we stopped the playback briefly and Walker, Texas Ranger was on. We realized that after each stroke there was a cut. Not in Black Mask. <br /> <br />
