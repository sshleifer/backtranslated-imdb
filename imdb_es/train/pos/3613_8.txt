['When &quot;Girlfight&quot; came out, the critics praised it, but I could not see it. I finally saw it when it was published on video and I understand the enthusiastic reviews. <br /><br /> The film opens in a high school in the middle of a ghetto. We quickly introduced the student Diana Guzm√°n (Michelle Rodriguez). She has a wicked expression on her face, and any idea about Diana that we can derive from this expression soon corroborates when she quarrels. When Diana gets in trouble for this, we find her father, an aggressive guy in his own right; clearly we can not totally blame Diana for her attitude. <br /><br /> But then the film really starts, when a new thought germinates in Diana&#39;s mind: boxing as a way to escape from this grim existence. His older brother has already entered boxing, but it is very likely that his father will not approve. Only Diana herself can decide what to do. <br /><br /> Only in the first few minutes, I realized that I expected a movie that was not Hollywood, but the brief appearance of John Sayles in a supporting role confirmed it. Even before they get to the boxing scenes, you feel that they are hitting your face when you see the ugly life that Diana lives. And when they finally get to the main story of the movie, there&#39;s no turning back. <br /><br /> In short, I definitely recommend this movie. I admit that using boxing as a means to show someone trying to do something for himself has been a kind of cliche in the cinema for many years (&quot;Rocky&quot;, &quot;Million Dollar Baby&quot;), but I still think so. A great job with that here. In fact, this may have brought the genus to its apex. Really good. Pity that Michelle Rodriguez has been lost in Hollywood movies after this.']
