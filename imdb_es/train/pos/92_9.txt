This is not an art movie, it's the main entertainment. <br /> <br /> Many beautiful people, t & a, and action. I found it very entertaining. It's not supposed to be intellectually stimulating, it's a fun movie to watch! Jesse and Chace are also fun, which is just a sauce. Definitely worth renting. <br /> <br /> So, in summary, I recommend that you visit it for some entertainment on Friday evenings with the children or even with your girl (if she likes to see other girls put it on!) <br /> <br /> The villains are good too. Vinnie, Corey Large, the hatian type of Heroes. Very unpleasant villains.
