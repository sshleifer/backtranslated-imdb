['Another reason to watch this lovely movie is Florence Rice. Florence who? That was my first reaction since the opening credits were published on the screen. I soon discovered who Florence Rice was, a true beauty that turns into a simply wonderful performance. As everyone does in this piece of joint grip. As of 1939, it&#39;s a different time, but that&#39;s where the charm lies. It transports you to another world. It starts as a light comedy but then it becomes very serious. Florence Rice covers the whole range of heroine comedian. She is absolutely charming, at the same time strong, vulnerable, evolving from a girl to a woman. Look at your facial expressions at the end of the movie. He made over forty films, and I&#39;m going to look for the other thirty-nine. Alan Marshal is in the Flynn / Gable mode and proves to be a perfect match for Florence. Buddy Ebsen and Una Merkel provide great comedy moments, but the real star is Florence Rice. Fans of 30&#39;s / 40&#39;s movies, do not miss it!']
