"Fraidy Cat," the fourth of these cartoons, is good. At least I like it, so I'm surprised that mixed reviews are being received. <br /> <br /> This is more a macabre story than fun, although it has its moments of comedy. The atmosphere is dark and spooky. Suspense is another strong element here. As for humor, it's mostly dark humor. <br /> <br /> In this short film, Tom listens to a spooky radio show at night and is absolutely terrified because it is about ghosts, something he believes. While Tom is scared to death, Jerry is watching everything and can not help laughing all the time. In fact, Jerry quickly finds a way to torture him more and more. With the help of a white shirt and a vacuum cleaner, it creates a great "ghost". <br /> <br /> Tom lives the most terrifying experience of his entire life. Although Jerry scares Tom without a good reason, the way the story is done ends up being fun. Also, once again, there is no violence here because this is one of Tom & Jerry's oldest cartoons. However, I do not understand that the joke in Tom 9's lives is almost absorbed by the vacuum cleaner. <br /> <br /> When Tom finally discovers that it was all Jerry's plan and that Jerry mocked him, Jerry is "stuck with his hand in the cookie jar" (deserves to be discovered). However, Tom shows incredible patience before reacting. He looks angrily at Jerry for about a minute. The funny thing is that Jerry invites Tom to laugh with him and it takes about half a minute to realize that Tom is looking at him with a very serious face. Jerry tries to be funny, but Tom does not laugh. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a different, peculiar and remarkable experience from Tom & Jerry.
