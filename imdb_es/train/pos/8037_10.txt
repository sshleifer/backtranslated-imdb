"One shot, one murder, no exceptions." A must if you like marines or snipers. Two big thumbs up! Great general story, excellent camera work, good drama, action, details and more. Pretty close to the real thing. But this is not a movie to decompose and select editing faults. This is to sit down and have a good 99 minutes. The plot has some depth, but this movie is not really about making you think. It's about enjoying the lifestyle and action of snipers. Sniper 2 and 3 are pretty good follow-ups, but the first is still the best movie in general. Tom Berenger does a great job playing his character and showing the hidden side of the sniper's life. The plain of dealing with all death. Must be seen for sniper fanatics.
