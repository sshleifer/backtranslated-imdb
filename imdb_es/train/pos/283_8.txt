"The Days" is a typical family drama with a small detail: you must relate to the emotions of the character in all possible ways so you can really appreciate the show. <br /> <br /> [Possible spoilers for those who are unaware of the program] <br /> <br /> The story, obviously, for all the people who have seen the program, is the world of Cooper's Day , the son of the middle of the family. He records his days with his family and hopes to become a rich and famous writer someday for his observations. His family includes a mother, a father, a perfect sister and a little genius brother. The first episode, which will seem a bit stupid since John Scott Shepard created this situation, both the sister and the mother become pregnant. That is the first situation that the writer hits. Then the father leaves his job at the law firm. The youngest child receives a panic attack. The middle child fights with the sister's boyfriend. This is all in one day's work. <br /> <br /> [/ Spoilers] <br /> <br /> I admire this show. I do not know. It's a bit seedy but I like it. First I thought that the camera work was a scam, but then I got used to it and started to like it. I liked the quiet conversations in a dark light. I liked the intimate feeling of the show. I liked the low budget style. I liked the performance. I admire the story. Then I feel like a second season of The Days. Little by little I became a fan of him when the episode of 6 episodes of ABC came to an end. It's a very good show and it does not look like The OC. The two have nothing in common. So I hope the fans stop comparing them. <br /> <br /> And if you can relate to Abby, Jack, Natalie, Cooper or even Nate, you'll like this show. Much.
