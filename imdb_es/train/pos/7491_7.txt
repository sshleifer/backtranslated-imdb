['Years ago, I found a copy of this movie for a dollar or two. In many ways, this is quite appropriate, since when it was made in 1933, it was really a film made at a low cost by the study &quot;would pour out of poverty&quot;, Majestic. However, although the film is rather derivative, STILL worth seeing it and offers some surprises. <br /><br /> The story is very, very familiar, since in some Germanic cities, people are upset by the recent deaths that seem to be the work of vampires. Adding to this familiarity is Dwight Frye. He played Renfield in Dracula, and here he is very, very similar, although he plays a much more harmless freak. In this case, he is obsessed with his favorite bats and people start to blame him for the deaths. The film does a good job of providing some &quot;false clues&quot; (ie, false clues) and although it does not take a genius to discover that Frye may not be responsible, WHO and WHY are interesting and make it VERY different from the average horror movie. Also, although the production had little money to talk about, it still had some good actors of the day, Lionel Atwill and Melvin Douglas, and also used Universal Studios sets at night (when they finished filming per day). . As a result, the film looks pretty good in general, although I also thought that, as usual, Fay Wray was terrible, I thought it did not significantly affect the film. I have seen her in more movies than most people in IMDb and I have noticed that her characters have no depth: she always seems to be chosen as the &quot;lady who screams&quot; and offers few novelties in each movie. <br /><br /> In general, for fans of old horror movies, this is excellent and worth seeing. For people who are NOT fans of the genre, it is likely to be fairly easy to jump.']
