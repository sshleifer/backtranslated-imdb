BASEketball is a really fun movie. David Zucker manages to make us laugh again, in a really silly, but sometimes intelligent comedy. <br /> <br /> The 2 creators of South Park, the main actors of this film, play very well Surprisingly good in reality, but this is the first time I see them as actors. The movie often reminds me of South Park, one of my favorite shows. <br /> <br /> It's a really good and funny movie, so do not miss it. <br /> <br /> Rate: 7.5 out of 10
