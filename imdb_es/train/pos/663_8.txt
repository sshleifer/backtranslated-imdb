I've seen this episode more often than any other episode of TFTC, it's that nice. And it's pretty scary, but all in a good macabre fun. A woman kills her second husband, but encounters a problem when a maniac escaped with an irregular ragged Santa Claus decides to visit her and her young daughter at that precise moment. Mary Traynor, who I remember remembering from SNL or some other television comedy show, is the evil wife, and Larry Drake plays the lunatic in Santa's dirty suit. I had forgotten that Drake played Santa over the years. Your Santa is an unstoppable and sometimes quite frightening force. You can probably guess how Santa finally enters the house. The episode is played by laughter, but sometimes it can also be quite intense.
