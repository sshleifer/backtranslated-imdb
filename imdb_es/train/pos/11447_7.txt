This movie is probably for you. He had a general meditative quality from music, to beautiful photography, and hearing things often clich√© about the life that Andy Goldsworthy would say while working or between shots. If you are familiar with Buddhism, that is the kind of meaning I got from this movie. The impermanence of life, the beauty of nature, the interconnectedness of all things, etc. However, what I did not understand, confused me and, finally, forced me to leave unfinished (I saw more than an hour) was the redundancy of the whole thing. Just discover fragments of why he has been entrusted, and how he can even afford to live this kind of work. The work of art comes alive but everything that talks without conclusions leads to a dead end.
