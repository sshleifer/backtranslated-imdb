At first, it looked like a boring comedy like The Odd Couple, but when I came in it turned out to be a very funny movie. Basically, the former forgotten comedians Willy Clark (Golden Globe winner, BAFTA and Oscar nominee Walter Matthau) and Al Lewis (Oscar winner and Gold Glove nominee George Burns) were a great comedy duo, and they met to revive the hospital sketch. for a television show. Willy's nephew, Ben Clark (Golden Globe winner Richard Benjamin) is confident that they can meet again without feeling bad for each other, how wrong he is. They can not take all the time, both are forgetful, especially during the conversation, but eventually they do. Also starring Lee Meredith as a nurse in Sketch (Miss McIntosh), Carol DeLuise as Mrs. Doris Green, Al's daughter, Rosetta LeNoire as Odessa, Willy's nurse and Muppets of F. Murray Abraham of Space as a Mechanic. I think the best line of the film is that Burns mentions that Matthau called him "a bastard son of a bitch". He was nominated for the Oscars for Best Art Direction Set Decoration and Best Writing, Screenplay adapted from other material, was nominated for BAFTA for Best Screenplay, and won the Best Motion Picture - Musical / Golden Globe Comedy, and was nominated a Better script. Very well!
