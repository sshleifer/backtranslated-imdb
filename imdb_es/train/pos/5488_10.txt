A case of being in the right place at the right time. What a fascinating movie. It is easy to see why Chavez is so popular among his people. He does things. He is accessible. And it's also easy to see why the West hates it so much. He has control over the resources of his country and returns the benefits to the people. Especially the poor. And it's easy to see how TV stations can represent confusing images to put in the case. Like the war in Iraq, or the war on terrorism. Or those WMD that are missing. Or how about the axis of evil. People need to wake up. And get different points of view. Stop the neoconservatives ruling the world Go see this movie with an open mind. And make your own mind. So I suggest you see the work of Aaron Russo: America: Freedom to Fascism. It is not the people of America the problem. It's the government.
