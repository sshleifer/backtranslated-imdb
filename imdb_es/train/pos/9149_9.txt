I had never seen Richard Thomas play a bad guy. I was not sure I wanted it this way. And I was not sure I could do it. But this amazed me. It sent chills down my spine and made me look more closely at the people on the street. The movie is fascinating and fast-paced. Bruce Davison is convincing, but all he can really play is a good guy. The real talent here is Thomas. The ending was a bit clumsy, but maybe that's how real people would fight ... If you're a Thomas fan, you MUST see him here at his best while being bad!
