It is very very funny. You know, how is supposed to be a comedy. It also looks very, very good, like a Hollywood Spectacular should be. So, what else do you want? Howz about a very good Sally Fields. She is much better here than anything else she has ever seen her, and she looks very good. This movie is all you need to understand why it is a star. Those eyes! Like a silent movie star, but better. In fact, everyone's eyes are so good. I used to pretend to be a bad soap opera actor with my girlfriend. We would do that thing in which you see yourself very quickly from one eye to the other of your partner. They do not do that at all on Soap Dish. Cool. The eyes have it! (sorry) <br /> <br /> There are so many fabulous performances, it's fun to wait for each of them to reappear. A full workshop is underway with Kevin Kline on how to act in a very subtle way. I have it? If it is too good. So is Robert Downey, Jr., who has since made a brief career in the interpretation of Slick, Slimy Executive. Cathy Moriarity, although not the most talented actress, is so charismatic and fascinating, especially when she is angry. And even Whoopi Goldberg is decent, its natural timing here gives Zing a bit of flat delivery. Okay, no, Whoopi Bashing, I'm listening. <br /> <br /> And then, there's the hair. Soap Dish was made at the end of BIG Hair Eighties, so the ridiculous doos are like a great character in themselves. They get bigger and dumb, just like you did. Yes, we have photos. <br /> <br /> Soap Dish is better than I thought it would be, better than I wanted it to be. I'm fed up with the movies that tell me I should worry about semi-gifted, superficial and egocentric egomaniacs, that is. Telenovela actors. Soap Dish seems happy just for making me laugh at them. Thank you.
