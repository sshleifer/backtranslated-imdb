The Russian Emigrant Director in Hollywood in 1928 (William Powell) is presenting his epic on the Russian Revolution, and hires a former former Tsarist General (Emil Jannings) to play the general of the film, and the two revive the drama and the memory of the woman they shared (Evelyn Brent), 11 years earlier. <br /> <br /> As much as I try, I feel it is difficult to warm up to "The Last Command" for all its virtues. 'The Docks of New York' was undoubtedly a great movie, and 'Underworld' is a movie I've always been eager to see, but 'The Last Command' is quite heavy. The premise is fascinating, but the treatment really makes the script come alive, except in the sequences set in Hollywood, which represent the wide range of employable extras and the machinations of a large film production with cutting edge technology. <br /> <br /> Emil Jannings is, as expected, a wonderful Russian general, who marvelously distinguishes the former general traumatized and decrepit, plunged into his misery, and the vigorous and cordial officer of yesteryear. <br /> <br /> The ending is excellent and it's worth the wait, but to get there you should be prepared to get bored sometimes.
