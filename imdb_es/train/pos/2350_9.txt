For my part, I have thoroughly enjoyed every episode of Pushing Daisies this season, and I hope that the writers' strike does not brutally end the beginnings of a very good show. Ned is a cake maker who owns a restaurant in the city center and has a secret talent. Emmerson is a private investigator with his own unique quirks as his love for weaving. Charlotte (Chuck) is Ned's childhood friend who was once dead, but is no longer a child. Olive is the jealous but kind-hearted waitress. Oh, and add the dog. Jim Dale brings all the characters together with his wonderful narration of the show. Chuck, Ned and Emmerson along with Olive and, occasionally, the dog solve multiple murder mysteries with the help of Ned's special gift of giving life back to the dead. The show is fun, clean and romantic in a very nice and good-hearted way, and I would recommend it to anyone.
