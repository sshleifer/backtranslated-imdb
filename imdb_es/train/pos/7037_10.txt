This is a brilliant political satire. It is no wonder why it was largely ignored in the United States: it exposes our murderous foreign policy for what it really is. <br /> <br /> Another good movie from this era, Rendition, was also totally dismissed simply because it was shown accurately. , that the United States is a war machine bent on torturing, killing and maiming civilians in their search for total world domination. <br /> <br /> An intelligent plot, good acting, some great stars (John Cusack, Ben Kingsley, Marisa Tomei somebody?) And some scenes of hilarity should have made this movie a success. Unfortunately, Americans do not like to hear the truth about themselves, especially when they are accomplices in mass murder.
