['One of the best pieces of television drama of the last decade. Throughout the five hours, perceptions and sympathies are constantly challenged as you explore many facets of modern British society. David Morrisey is, as always, brilliant. At first, it appears as a heavy hand copper in conflict with the heroine, but then proves to be intelligent and loving, while working with her to discover the truth. I&#39;ve never seen Surrane Jones before. I think she comes from the world of telenovelas. Her performance was magnificent, as she maintains her humor and composure as she tries to balance the demands of the case and the stress of caring for her mother. I could go on and talk about every member of the cast that contributes to this magnificent drama, but their efforts would mean little without a script so absorbing that it constantly challenges their assumptions about any of the characters. It is programs like this that restore faith in television drama, and at the same time make it almost impossible to settle for most of the garbage that increasingly fills the airwaves.']
