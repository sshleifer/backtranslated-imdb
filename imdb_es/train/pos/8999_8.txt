This movie does not make any pretentious effort to hide its true genre: a Campy B movie. You will be told at the beginning the definition of campy. I should also have given the meaning of cheese adjective. But the two come together in this movie in ways that make you go, "Hmmmmm ... that's so stupid!" and then you laugh. For example, there is a scene in "16th Century Japan," which shows a pair of samurai walking in the foreground of a temple. At the bottom of the temple, there are several tourists who look in the distance with sneakers and shorts. Hmmmm ... hahahah! I could not stop laughing. And the performance goes from decent, to bearable, to my Lord, but that's what makes it fun. You will see some decent actors and then you will find others that are really terrible. Although I have to ramble a bit because I've seen Stephanie Sanchez in several works and she is amazing. His airtime in the movie was quite short, however. I have also seen Bryan Yamasaki in several plays on the islands during my visits and he is also better at theater than in this movie. Anyway, it's an entertaining movie, if you have nothing to do on a weekday night.
