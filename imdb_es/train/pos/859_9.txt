It is very rare to find a movie that offers a plot that can not be solved at any time. Surprises throughout the delight. <br /> <br /> However, a couple of things that I could not understand at all is that here you have the main female character that plays "the good, hard-working girl" and yet, in the end it ends. Be an antisocial risk taker. However, that was not enough for me not to like it, but it did pause me. <br /> <br /> The other thing I could not get was the old man who was being dragged by the police at the end of the movie. I never knew who he was or what his problems were. If anyone has any ideas, I would like to hear what could be. <br /> <br /> The movie was exciting and fun at all times and it always left me guessing. A lot worth seeing.
