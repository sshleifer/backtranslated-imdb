The documentary begins in 1986 in the city of New York, where the black and Hispanic drag queens have "balls". That's where they dress as they like, show their stuff in front of an audience and get voted. We know many of the members and we see how they hold together and support each other. As one man says to another: "You have three blows against you, you are black, gay and drag queen." These are people who (unfortunately) are not accepted in society, only in dances. There they can be who they want and what they want and be accepted. Then the film is cut three years later (1989) and you see how things have changed (tragically for some). <br /> <br /> It sounds depressing but it is not. Most of the people interviewed are actually very funny and they take a lot of humor out of their situations. They are very aware of their position in society and accept it with humor, just as they should. We discovered that everyone lives in "houses" managed by several "mothers" and that they help each other. The sense of community in this film is fascinating. <br /> <br /> When this movie came out in 1990, it was controversial and a great success. He won the Best Documentary Awards at numerous festivals, but was never nominated for an Academy Award. His reason was that "the black and Hispanic queens are not material of the Academy". Fascinating, is not it? Homophobia and racism all together. <br /> <br /> Seen today, it's still a great movie, and a period piece. It is no longer like that, the NY they show does not exist anymore. The balls still remain, but not in the spirit that we see here. Trawling has also become more "accepted" in society (for better or for worse). And I heard that the houses are gone too. That is a bit sad. I would like to know where these characters are now, I know that two died of AIDS but I have no idea of ​​the others. And what happened to that 13 and 15 year old child shown? <br /> <br /> However, it is a unique documentary in its class: fascinating, fun and fascinating. You have to see all the way! A definitive 10. Where is the DVD?
