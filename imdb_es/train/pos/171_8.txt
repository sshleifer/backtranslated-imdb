I do not agree with anyone who can dismiss this movie as "just" entertainment. Immediately after the carefree and roaring 20 years, during the first days of the Great Depression, Dance, Fools, Dance is at your heart a serious warning, with a clear message about the best way to endure these difficult times. However, this fast paced and plot movie is far from a boring morality story. <br /> <br /> In the 1930s, Hollywood had the ability to produce an entertaining * and * enlightening audience to please others. All without losing a frame of the movie. Dance, Fools, Dance - one of * four * films directed by Harry Beaumont in 1931 - barely lasts 80 minutes, but his characters are well developed, his story never seems rushed and, despite his many twists in the plot, the audience He never stays behind. <br /> <br /> With the sole exception of Lester Vail as Bob Townsend's flabby interest, the supporting cast is uniformly strong. They highlight William Bakewell as Crawford's brother, Cliff Edwards (better known as Jiminy Cricket's voice) as reporter Bert Scranton, and Clark Gable in an early supporting role as gangster Jake Luva. <br /> <br /> But this is Joan Crawford's movie, and she absolutely shines on it. Made when he was only 27 years old, this lesser known version of Crawford will probably be unrecognizable to those who are more familiar with his later work. However, here is a proof that long before taking home an Oscar for Mildred Pierce, Crawford was a star in the true sense of the word, a great actress with the charisma of taking a picture for herself. <br /> <br /> Score: TEN EIGHT
