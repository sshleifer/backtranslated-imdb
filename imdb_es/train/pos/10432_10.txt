I must admit that at the beginning, I was a bit reluctant to watch this movie. I thought it was this stupid little romantic movie about a French woman who is on an American's train and decides to visit Vienna with him. I was not really happy with this kind of script, as I kept believing it was just a movie. Still, I saw it! And I was amazed ... "Before Sunrise" is one of the few films that dare to speak in a rather philosophical way, wondering about the fact that at the time of our birth, we are condemned to death, or that it is a The central idea is the fact that a couple must rest together for eternity, or that we, humans, can sometimes afford to live in fairy tales. <br /> <br /> The end was chosen beautifully (we do not know if they will meet again in six months, at six o'clock, at the Vienna station); In our optimism, we sincerely hope so. The actors acted in a very good way, so I started to believe that I could live a love story like this myself.
