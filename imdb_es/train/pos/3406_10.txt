In terms of visual beauty this movie is exceptional! I had no idea that Technicolor left so early. Although I did not like the ending, the whole movie is fantastic and makes me want to be in North Africa. The cast is excellent and Marlene Dietrich is a great asset and, of course, she is very attractive and I loved her in this movie. Basil Rathbone is also perfect in this movie. I could not ignore the stage and the scenarios ... The hotel, the palm trees, the desert, everything is there ... the legionaries also bring a feeling of "Beau Geste" to the film. They certainly do not make movies like these anymore. Do not miss seeing this classic!
