Or at least one of the best. I think this is a very funny and very good game for the N64. Bowser is up to his usual scams (yes, it's a silly word, but the only one I can think of) and Mario must stop it again. This game is very fun to play and fills me with nostalgia. The only bad thing about this is the graphics, which are terrible by today's standards, but everything else is pretty good (especially the little mini-games that you can unlock). It's the second best N64 game (the first one is the Day of Conker's Bad Skin) that I recommend to any Mario fan, or any fan of platform games. Beat the mediocre Super Mario Sunshine any day. <br /> <br /> 9/10 or: A
