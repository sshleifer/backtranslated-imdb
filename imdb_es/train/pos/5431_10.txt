I've seen this movie many times and every time I see it I can not stop entertaining myself. Gunga Din is one of those classic movies made in the Golden Years of Hollywood when the actors themselves had to attract the audience to a movie without relying on fantastic special effects and man-made "monsters" to take a scene. The charisma and camaraderie displayed by Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. is superb and very entertaining to watch. The attitude of the tongue and cheek in which the three actors play their roles works beautifully and perfectly. Some might consider it "corny", but I consider it "classic" in the cinema and acting at its best. Seeing this film, one must remember that Europe was involved in a war with Germany and the audience went to the cinema to escape the horrors of war and to be entertained and taken to a place where people were bigger than life and He did heroic deeds and good always would overcome evil. Gunga Din accomplishes this perfectly by letting the audience laugh and with the actors during their heartbreaking adventures. In short, it's a classic movie that does not take itself too seriously and does not want the audience to do it.
