['A boy and a girl are chased by a local warrior because the boy killed (by accident) the father of the warriors (or whoever he was). And they travel through the nature of the most disheveled areas of Africa. <br /><br /> The acting in this movie is not so good (except for that elephant child). But it is a very good adventure and it is not very censored, there is some blood, flesh and nudes (which lighten the film a bit). <br /><br /> I give this movie a 7 for its image of African nature and its action.']
