['Lloyd Bridges as Mike Nelson and his ship were all the stars of this series. What made it so good for me when I saw it was the real feeling of going underwater. The show exhibits a youth energy energy for underwater exploration that is contagious. <br /><br /> The show was educational and showed the viewer things about scuba diving from someone who seemed to be an accomplished professional, Mike Nelson. There were excellent shows, and the show always seemed to be well produced. Of course, the drama in the scripts sometimes reaches the same notes in more than one episode, but each program is its own with any other program produced during this era, the childhood of American television.']
