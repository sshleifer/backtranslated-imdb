A strange, ingenious and wonderful representation of family life! The writer Andrew Marshall has written something that is funny, preposterous, and sometimes terrifying! Yes, do not be fooled by the happy melody and bubbling 2point4 characters for children; The show has a dark side, and sometimes it can be quite chilling. And that's what's good about the program, it's not just a simplistic situation comedy in which each character is a 2D comic device (the case of My Family). Instead, the characters are completely rounded individuals that show the roller coaster full of human emotions. Dark moments from time to time, such as the fact that he supposedly obsesses with a curse and that Ben wakes up in a strange town, are two examples of the show that takes a surreal, dark turn, which helps to add a bit of depth. Of course, the show is also incredibly fun and guaranteed to make you smile. It is a real pity that Eureka Video has stopped releasing this golden comic on DVD. Veoh.com is your last hope to get episodes that can not be seen in stores.
