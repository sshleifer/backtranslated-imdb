I'm not sure that this comment contains a real spoiler, but I'm playing it safe, so do not read this if you have not seen the movie. <br /> <br /> I love this movie, and the same goes for everyone I work with, and that's the point. I spent a large part of my working life in the cinema, without being an actor. These people are the main heroes of this film: the addicts to the legend, the detonators, the directors in the air, the lighters and the writers, the people in the costumes, etc., and everything is told from their point of view, at least to a great degree. Most actors are crazy and self-absorbed to the point of absurdity, which is what this film falsifies so well, but you must have worked with the actors to recognize that this movie is a real-life drama ! Possible spoiler alert: in a big scene, the two protagonists, both actors, are _discussing_ how_discussing something personal, something completely 'off screen', with another actor, and begin to invent lines, rehearse them and criticize them. the performance of each one. <br /> <br /> Ever since this movie appeared, what it was, '91, it has become fashionable to do this, especially on television. But almost nobody has done so well.
