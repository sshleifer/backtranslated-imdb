I loved the movie, but as everyone said, there were some fragments that were not sufficiently developed. I personally thought that the girls were very insipid before they got to jail; Of course, they were supposed to be innocent American girls, but still ... I felt they lacked the bond that best friends are supposed to have. For example, in the montage in which they are seen, the way they held up for photography was very clumsy. <br /> <br /> Then, there are some parts that were very ambiguous. I think you understand quite well that the Danish character did not, but I can see how that can be confusing. Also, why did the camera stop at Manat with a very grim expression after he put the bags in the trunk of his taxi? I thought I was suggesting something, but it turned out to be nothing. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, the movie was great. I cried when Claire Danes took the blame; she is a GREAT actress. <br /> <br /> Also, I wanted to see that malicious Thai prisoner kick her ass. Talk about lack of closure ...
