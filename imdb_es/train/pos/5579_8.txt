I had never heard of this movie until I found it by accident while browsing IMDB. I saw that he had received many frightful criticisms that contained very colorful expletives about how much he stank. Of course this meant that I had to see it. I was pleasantly surprised since Whipped is actually a good movie. I saw him with a group of friends and we laughed more than we had seen in many recent Hollywood comedies. This is an independent film and, as such, portrays its theme (sex and dating) without the usual Hollywood fake. I clearly suspect that people's opinion about this movie will depend a lot on their life experience. If you have never gone out or gone out a lot, you will not get this movie because you will not have met people like these characters. If so, you will recognize many of the situations described here comically. The ending was also good, since it did not show women as unreal romantic, helpless and virgin in contrast to many Hollywood movies.
