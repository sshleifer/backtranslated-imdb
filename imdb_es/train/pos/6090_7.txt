Envy is not as fun as I thought at first, but after some of the criticisms I read, I found it was much more fun than people gave it support, now it's not a joke or a minute like Zoolander or Dodgeball. but ben stiller and jack black work well with each other and christopher walken is as good as ever, so the story is about the character of jack black inventing a spray that makes dog pooh disappear, obviously ben does not want to be part of it, but when the product produces jack black rich ben stiller begins to see envy, it is not good in any way and both ben stiller and jack black have more fun and better movies to their credit, but if you are a fan of one of the two I recommend it , since it is a fun and funny movie. I laughed a couple of times, since a big fan of ben stiller id has to say that this is even less fun but a lot of fun, give him a watch
