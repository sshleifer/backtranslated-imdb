"Ardh Satya" is one of the best films ever made in Indian cinema. Directed by the great director Govind Nihalani, this is the most successful Hard Hitting Parallel Cinema, which also proved to be a commercial success. Even today, Ardh Satya is an inspiration to all the principal directors of India. <br /> <br /> The film tells the real-life scenario of the Mumbai police of the 70s. Unlike any police from other cities in India, the Mumbai police covers a different system. Govind Nihalani creates a very practical Outout with the real-life approach of Mumbai Police Environment. <br /> <br /> Among several police officers and colleagues, the film describes the story of Anand Velankar, a young, hot-blooded policeman from a poor family. His father is a stern police officer. Anand himself suffers the ideologies and incidences of his father's atrocities on his mother. Anand's approach to immediate action against crime is an inert desire for his own job satisfaction. The film is here turned into an argument in which Anand's constant efforts against crime are trampled on by his superiors. This leads to frustrations, since you can not achieve the desired job satisfaction. As a result of the frustrations, his anger is expressed with excessive violence in the detention rooms and bars, which also makes him an alcoholic. <br /> <br /> The Spirit within him is still alive, as he constantly fights against the system. He is aware of the Metro system, where the police and politicians are inertly associated until the end. Your commitment to unethical practice is negative. Finally it is suspended. <br /> <br /> Management is a masterpiece and a hard core. One of the best memorable scenes is when Anand bursts into the house of gangster Rama Shetty to arrest him, followed by a brief conversation that is fantastic. In many scenes, the film has moments to lift hair. <br /> <br /> The practical approach to Script is a big blow. Alcoholism, corruption, political influence, courage, deception are an integral part of the Mumbai police, even today. These aspects are treated brilliantly. <br /> <br /> Finally, the films belong to the program One man, Om Puri, which portrays Anand Velankar through all his emotions in an absolutely brilliant way.
