Bette Midler shows her talent and beauty in "Diva Las Vegas". I am delighted to have recorded it and I can watch it whenever I want. She has what it takes to keep a captive audience. Your voice is as beautiful as ever and will really impress you. The highlight of the show was his singing "Stay With Me" from his 1979 movie "The Rose". You can feel the emotion in the song and you will end up with goosebumps. The program will leave you with the need to go out and rent a Bette Midler movie or go to the nearest music store and buy one of Bette Midler's albums.
