This is a family movie, which for some people is an automatic shutdown. It seems that too many people do not want to see films that are not loaded with arms and legs, gratuitous violence and enough insults to fill the New York phone book. This movie is not one of those. It's a clich√©, it's a formula, but it's also fun. It does not ask you to think, it does not demand that you accept the film as reality. It just does what a good movie should do, which is to voluntarily suspend disbelief for two hours and enjoy the adventure. The cast is good, but not excellent. As another commentator pointed out, John Williams' sound score was, as always, excellent. And the fact that much of the film was filmed in Huntsville in the real space camp made it even more credible. <br /> <br /> It was ironic that the original release of the film was delayed for some months due to the Challenger Shuttle disaster, which may have played an important role in its original theatrical opening, but the film has finally helped Enfoca the dreams of many young people towards space and the possibilities that are found in it. So sit down with your children and get ready to enjoy.
