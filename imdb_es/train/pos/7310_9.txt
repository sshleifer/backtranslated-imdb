There is no doubt that Halloween is by far one of the best films, not only in its genre but also abroad. I love movies. The creepy atmosphere like the general one in which it could happen here makes it frightening to think. It is also possible to imagine it. If you were ever in this situation, what would you do? This is a movie that I enjoy watching, especially in the Halloween season. John Carpenter is a very professional director. I love many of his other films, but there's no doubt that his best-known film is the movie Halloween. Oh, and if you're thinking about watching the Rob Zombie remake, it's not. It sucks and a true Halloween fan would like the 1978 version of John Carpenter. Michael Myers is one of the coolest killers. in any movie, and it's very well known. Therefore, go see this masterpiece that you will really like.
