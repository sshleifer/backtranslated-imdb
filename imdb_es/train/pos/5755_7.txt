This is a pretty strange movie. It is presented as a film of exploitation with exaggerated violence and unrealistic situations, but unusual because it is built around rural characters at war with each other, in opposition to an 'other' invader. <br /> <br /> The film is an excessive stereotype of Vietnam veterans, in a long line of films portraying veterans of that war as dangerous psychopaths. Kris Kristofferson's last line is "I have not lost a war yet," as he meets his demise after discovering a long road of murder and destruction, including the city police chief and his brother's girlfriend in a particularly chilling scene. However, Kristofferson is an actor good enough and charismatic enough to take this villain with surprising depth. Vincent is clearly the golden boy, but with enough intensity over his clean-cut goodness. The film bears some resemblance to the plot of Winchester 73, where Jimmy Stewart tries to tolerate a criminal brother until he is forced to act against him. <br /> <br /> The film has B-movie grade action, although the presence of Kristofferson, Vincent, a beautiful Victoria Director and Bernadette Peters give her a grade A lineup. <br /> <br /> I give it a 7 for being a vision lost in the American psyche of post-Vietnam / pre-Reagan introspection, paranoia, and confusion, and a film industry that was willing to address those issues at that time. <br /> <br /> Seen on the EAST channel, a large network that continues to play many old movies from the 70s to the 90s, regardless of the political tendency.
