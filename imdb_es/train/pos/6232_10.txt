One of the best films of Fred Astaire and Giner Rogers. Great music by Irving Berlin. The solid support of Randolph Scott, Harriet Nelson, Lucille Ball, Betty Grable, Frank Jenks and Astrid Allwyn. <br /> <br /> The great songs include "Let Yourself Go", "Let's Face the Music" and "Putting All My Eggs in a Basket". The last song is presented by Astaire playing a jazz piano and then a nice dance with Rogers. Rogers also sings "Let Yourself Go" with Grable among backup singers. <br /> <br /> Harriet Nelson (then Hilliard) sings two beautiful songs and plays Rogers' sister. "Get Thee Behind Me" is a song that stays with you for days. She also sings "But where are you?" Fast and fast-paced, this entry in the Astaire-Rogers series is one of the best. The classic and surprisingly beautiful ending, "Let's face music and dance" is among the best known of its numbers. Rogers wears one of the great dresses of film history ... a shimmering number of sequins that rotates around his legs while dancing (hemming) and also looks slightly. Just beautiful. This is the number that Steve Martin and Bernadette Peters recreated in Pennies from Heaven. <br /> <br /> Randolph Scott seems a strange choice as Astaire's friend, but he also appeared in his Roberta with Irene Dunne. Luckily, he does not try to sing or dance. It seems that Grable and Ball would have had larger parts in 1936 but they have some scenes and have little impact. Allwyn has the most important role, but it's just fine. <br /> <br /> Rogers has one of his best solo numbers in the series with "Let Yourself Go" ... Jazzy and thumping, it's a great song. <Br /> <br /> Fun to the end, although I got tired of "We joined the Navy" after the third time ...
