I'm not sure you can call this an anti-war movie, it shows war at an elite level. These are elite troops who know what they are doing and take pride in it. Even when they are pacifists, they still enjoy the level of skill and defeating their enemies, even if it goes against being a pacifist. The films are slow and quite calm, and in many aspects they are rather tame that the war films, still more by the current standards, there are no body parts that fly away like in modern movies. However, it is brutal in other ways, since you see killing on a personal level. This is more a movie of a thinking man. Once you start looking you do not want to miss anything. The thoughts of the men in the film and their interactions, is what the film is about, not the fight itself or a great exciting story. This is perhaps called a war triller. <br /> <br /> If you are in the ability of war, if you like to read or watch programs about the SAS and others, YOU WANT TO SEE THIS MOVIE !!!!! <br /> <br /> The comparable films are The Hill (1965) with Sean Connery, 49th Parallel (1941) with a star cast, The Naked and the Dead (1958) with Cliff Robertson. All are unusual in their own way and show war on a personal level. Enjoy!
