['Saturday, June 3, 6:30 pm The Neptune. <br /><br /> Monday, June 5, 4:30 pm The Neptune. <br /><br /> Few celebrations of ethnic and cultural identity are as successful as Carlos Saura&#39;s brilliant interpretation of the masterpiece Iberia Suite by Isaac Albeniz. As he approaches his centennial, Saura gathered a wealth of unprecedented talent from the Spanish performing arts community to create this love song par excellence in his home country. The twelve &quot;impressions&quot; of the suite are presented without narrative in raw environments, which allows the power of each performance to explode before the camera of Saura. The creative use of large floors and mirrors, moved by the whole, combined with screens, shadows, fire, rain and rear projection add glorious dramatic effects to the varied selections of songs, dances and instrumental performances. Albeniz&#39;s photographs reappear throughout the program, connecting the passion of music with its great creator. Saura encompasses all Spaniards on stage, from the beautiful elegance of the elderly flamenco dancers in traditional costumes to the children who dance cheerfully with their instructors.']
