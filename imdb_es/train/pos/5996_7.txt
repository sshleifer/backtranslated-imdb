Again and again, I have stated that if people do not want remakes or sequels to be made, they should stop watching them and venture into the independent film world. However, having said that, the last time I saw an independent film I myself should have been easily six months ago. So here is a review for an indie that caught my attention on YouTube; the Cure. <br /> <br /> Immediately, it can be said that the film focuses on a cutting-edge film that is telegraphed in the use of extreme approaches, scopophilia and quick editing. He is proud of his appearance, and he has the right to be. For the most part it is a small piece very well composed, except for an inexcusable lack by the rule of 180 degrees and a comically bad shooting effect, which is a phenomenon that seems to be THE calling card for self-funded projects. <br /> <Even so, despite these amateur mistakes, most of the shots are really a pleasure to watch. We are presented with a good use of accessories and locations, a good visual performance and a fluid and very atmospheric edition, which is more recommendable since it is definitely something that you will not see very often in a YouTube presentation. The plot is fragmented and, although the basic premise is quite simple, some may find it difficult to follow exactly what is happening, but what we are seeing here is an avant-garde narrative at work; You really can not expect a simple three-act structure and, if you do, you may not be ready for this kind of movie. <br /> <br /> In the event that, unfortunately, the movie is not ready, the sound is disappointing. What you will hear is a distorted voiceover that often sounds disingenuous and, what is worse, is the continuous background music, which goes through minimal changes and does not add much to anything. So much attention is paid to the visual elements that the audio, frankly, sounds careless, and this becomes really evident when you realize that you have just missed four sentences of the narrative and you have to go back to catch what escaped you . <Br /> <br /> Then, give him a watch, but do it with the sound off. <br /> <br /> Last thought; Did anyone else remember the cover of the novel "Last Human" by Doug Naylor's Red Dwarf at the beginning of the movie? If you have the book, you know what I want to say.
