There is nothing more pleasant for me than a story of suspense or suspense that keeps you guessing how everything will end. And that's precisely what happens in DEATHTRAP, based on a creepy work by Ira Levin ("Rosemary's baby"). <br /> <br /> And in it, MICHAEL CAINE and CHRISTOPHER REEVE do the kind of trick that Caine and Laurence Olivier did in SLEUTH, with almost the same skill and enigmas that have existed in that extraordinarily intelligent work . <br /> <br /> But because it is meant to scare you, surprise you and keep guessing As for the result, it is difficult to write a review about the plot. Let's say that what we know at the beginning is all you have to know about the movie for the present. MICHAEL CAINE is an incredibly jealous dramatist whose latest work has failed miserably. When a young aspiring writer CHRISTOPHER REEVE sends him the manuscript of his work, Caine realizes that passing it as his own would solve all his problems and regain his reputation. <br /> <br /> As of that moment, it is a question of fun and games for the public as the story of Ira Levin unravels, managing to overtake Agatha Christie by the number of turns. <br /> <br /> Caine and Reeve face each other brilliantly, each of which brings a certain dynamic tension to the story, as well as some humorous touches that come from a script that links drama to humor. <br /> <br /> Summing up: It's worth seeing, but not everyone is happy with the ending.
