I am not a regular commentator on this website, but seeing how underestimated this film is, I strive to write some comments and comments about it. I had fun watching this movie, maybe because Cat is everything I would like to be, I will not publish spoilers or reveal arguments, but there are things that really seemed incredible to me, the way she manipulates people is so divine. This is a very underestimated movie, I have no arguments here, I generally enjoy and then I talk a little about that, when you go to the movies it's for fun, and I really enjoyed the 1h53 that I stayed in the dark room. A must visit again and again until the delight fades. Let's try not to be so critical about it. Thank you for reading.
