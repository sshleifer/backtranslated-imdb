It's a good show, and I find it funny. Finally the bad guys of Latin stereo have finished! Thank you Mr. LÃ³pez! I love this program, and I started seeing it about three months ago. The whole concept about a Latino family television show really surprised me. I'm surprised that Latinos finally have a good chance to be on television. This show is probably one of the best I've seen, it's fun, comforting, delicate and enjoyable.
