What was around 1939 that helped produce so many excellent Hollywood movies? Well, whatever it is, magic can also be found in this Columbia image. It's a forgotten long-distance comedy that Turner Classic Movies has begun to show. (The book of films of Maltin does not contain it). In almost every department, Amazing Mr. Williams is a gem. <br /> <br /> It's the story of a top-notch police detective who can never find the time to marry his intended. When the wedding bells are about to ring, they call him to the scene of a murder. The lady in question has to learn the hard way not only to enjoy the persecution of criminals, but also to belong to the police force. There are many laughs in the process. <br /> <br /> Melvyn Douglas proved once again that he had few partners in light comedy. Joan Blondell was at the peak of her career and is a delight. Edward Brophy and Donald McBride are very funny. <br /> <br /> The movie goes on a bit, but who cares? Screwball comedies are always capable of entertaining, and this movie belongs to the best.
