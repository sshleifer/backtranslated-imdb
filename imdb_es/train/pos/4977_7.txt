So many educational films are nothing but nightmares to numb the mind, saved only by the fact that "MST3K" mocks them ("Why study industrial arts?" Comes to mind). "Hemo the Magnificent" is pretty well done. It is about the blood, the heart and the circulatory system. I admit that I do not remember any of that, but he does a good job explaining everything, keeping it serious but entertaining. I suppose you can always count on June Foray (the most famous voice of Rocky the Squirrel, who plays with a deer here). <br /> <br /> Since "Hemo the Magnificent" itself can be difficult to find, probably the best place to see it is in "Gremlins": a class is watching it while a gremlin is forming.
