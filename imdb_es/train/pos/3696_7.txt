Although I live in Minnesota, I have been studying in France lately and I found this strange movie jewel. <br /> <br /> This movie was amazing, to say the least. A creative and unique film, the different directors lent something different to their interpretation of love in the City of Light. The first instinct is to try to fit each of these little stories into a general story, as can be done with Love Actually of 2003. This attempt, however, makes the magic of each individual segment obsolete. When taken with the naked eye, with each of the short segments taken as their own individual movie, the love stories together give a beautiful message. <br /> <br /> The movie is surprisingly strange at times, often to the point of confusion - and each individual segment can be hard to follow. Still, for an observer who pays close attention to each of the segments, the short lines of the plot become clear after a short time. The confusion is almost intriguing; it keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting for what will come next. Leave the viewer wondering "Does that really just happen?" however, it also leaves them satisfied that, indeed, it has happened. It is the kind of film in which the viewer, when leaving the cinema, can not decide if he loved or hated it. The initial reaction is to go and see it again and again, just to see how these individual lives blend into a cinematic masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The interesting decision to make the film multilingual is adding something to the spectrum of people it can relate to. It adds to the reality of the film: here, American tourists speak English, French Parisians, etc. The amount of people covered by the film leads to an understanding of the international language of love. <br /> <br /> From sickness to the supernatural, the love of parents to the love of spouses, this film covers all the bases of romantic narrative. In a beautiful and peculiar way, each unique event somehow falls into place to tell a story: that of all types, sizes, nationalities and forms of love.
