Having seen Peter O'Toole's version recently, I was ready to be impressed by the intelligent writing in this version. Little time is devoted to the struggle, which I prefer. Instead, we are shown all the underlying motives of French and English politicians and priests (who had in Normandy) who killed her. Even the worst hypocrite of them all, the archbishop, leaves us with the idea that "of course, she was innocent, the innocents have always had to suffer for the ambitions of the powerful." She had no idea what she was saying, no idea of ​​the implications of blasphemy or going against the church ... Without being educated, I had no idea what the church's position was on such matters. " <br /> <br /> Preminger was faithful to the myths surrounding his death, and I appreciated the preview on the tape that showed the flames rising and burning. Why? They used jets of gas in the film, and 2 of them were stopped. Suddenly, the pressure of the air blew the stoppage and the flames leapt straight at her. Fortunately for her, they did not have to repeat the shot, since it was SO realistic: IT WAS burned !! A very traumatic introduction for an Iowa girl to her new acting career. <br /> <br /> John Gielgud excelled. He is the English politician who is orchestrating the show. It also points out that once you sentence someone to death, you do not want to be around to see them die. I could give up his "duty" next time ... it's not that such delicacies bother the soul of our future president. We Christians, even the most anti-Semitic, have no problem resorting to the Old Testament when it comes to capital punishment, even though it was nullified by the words of Jesus. Carry out public executions like this girl. Smelling the burnt flesh could lead us to respectable people to the senses of our souls. <br /> <br /> The only 'selection' I have about this film is that it does not show us why the priest who has been insisting so firmly on his burning becomes so suddenly repentant, even to the point of madness. There should have been more expansion of his character, more dialogue, since the sudden "regain meaning" does not make sense. <br /> <br /> And, whether Graham Greene does this deliberately or not, St. Joan is a little rich woman so sure of herself that almost, but not quite, she is glad that she knew her best moment. And, when she rejected her life in prison, for some reason, I thought of Anne Sexton, the poet who accused Sylvia Plath of "stealing her death" when she committed suicide ... knowing that such action guarantees immortality. You have to ask! <br /> <br /> If there was ever a good example of obsessive thinking and compartments adjusted to logic, this is one. Saint Joan should have become a Buddhist and silence the "voices in her mind".
