I grew up watching Full House when I was a kid. I stopped seeing it for years, but about two weeks ago I saw it again. Now my children watch the show and they love seeing it too. My children can not believe that DJ, in the program, and I have the same age. <br /> <br /> I really love the program, because it is a program that you can watch with your family. It has good teachings that your children can learn from. Also, there is no drugs and violence in him. In addition, when children, in the program, have a problem, they can always ask their family for help. That is the message that children should receive from television today, go to your family to ask for help, not drugs. Children should see more shows like Full House instead of half the disaster on television today. <br /> <br /> I also love the program because it makes you laugh and it's realistic. He talks about real-life problems and family matters. There is always a lesson you can learn from the program. <br /> <br /> I vote the program a 10.
