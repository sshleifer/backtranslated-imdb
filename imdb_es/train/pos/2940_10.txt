The first time I came to Delirious, I only heard it. I listened to all the comedy and I never laughed so much in my life. Eddie's ability to paint hilarious images in our mind and make a great imitation is captivating. When I finally saw him perform this act, he had to have it. The performance of Eddie Murphy in Delirious demonstrates his genius! Being the new millennium, his acts in 1983 are as fun today as they were then. My parents loved it as much as teenagers and I (at eighteen) love it too. From that moment on, I had to watch other Murphy movies, like Coming To America and Harlem Nights. There will not be another comedian like Eddie.
