Paul was totally scammed by someone about the most important thing he did to Dave. It's the same story, although not so fun. <br /> <br /> Paul told me this morning about the scene where Sammy David sings the hostel's new national anthem. He arrived in Brazil after a long flight from Las Vegas, three planes, car trip to the set, etc. Was hit. He could barely stop himself, he had to use a cane. he was staying in a trailer the size of my bathroom. <br /> <br /> I did not know I could do it. Then he saw the crowd of 6000 extras, he paid $ 7. He came alive and filmed that scene for two hours. It was magnificent, then it almost collapsed. <br /> <br /> Paul is a great guy, although very liberal. a true talent
