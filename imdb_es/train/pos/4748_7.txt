History would never win prizes, but that's not what it is about ... the script was entertaining and suspenseful enough to leave room for the incredibly choreographed fighting scenes. Who needs a story with fights like that? Actually, it's worth looking just for that reason. IF you can handle the gore, of which there is A LOT ... none of that is realistic enough to be difficult to see. I gave him a 7.
