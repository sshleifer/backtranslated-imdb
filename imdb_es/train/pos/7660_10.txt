This film is nothing less than a dark and gritty masterpiece. It may be partial, since the era of apartheid is an area that I have always felt. But I would say it is on par with Cry Freedom and Cry the Beloved Country. Unfortunately, until a few days ago, I had never heard of this movie. Inside is one of the most underrated movies of all time, probably because it was a small film company, I had never heard of it before. Eric Stoltz, one of my favorite actors anyway, is believable and dramatic, Nigel Hawthorne plays his evil role well. Do not look for humor in this movie, there is none. It's real, wild and sandy until the end, and for the sensitive ones, I'd say they bring a box of tissues. But movies as great as these make you wonder, why is it that the best movies often do not know each other?
