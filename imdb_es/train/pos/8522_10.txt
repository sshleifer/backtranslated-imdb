I found this program very late at night, and I tried it. It's a refreshing change from the other types of things that show up late at night, if it captures my direction. Their simplicity of values ​​and the sweetness of hearts remind me of the way friendships were like children. It's something that I enjoy every time I find it (which is weird, maybe I should check the listings!) ... and the tension between Joe and Nick is very nice. Like any good girl movie, you really get emotionally involved in the characters. Well, Louisa May Alcott keeps inspiring good stories :) So apparently I have to complete 10 lines of text so that my opinion is valid, so I guess I'll tell you a little more. The children are played by talented actors and actresses, and the scenarios are charming and full of nature, another thing that is not seen much on television. I hope everyone tries. I recognize and I am fully aware that it is nonsense, but it is a good heart. As I said before, it's refreshing.
