I think the comments about the show being cheesy are a bit exaggerated. When a person comes to watch a television program, what does he do? It is to enjoy watching a program, unless it is a critic or a person who analyzes a story. But most of us are not and we watch the shows to relax and enjoy. FULL HOUSE is an ideal program to watch after a heavy day in the office / school. It makes you laugh and it's not just humor. <br /> <br /> Yes, the Tanner family is a perfect family, a perfectly hypothetical family. If any of these families existed in the real world, it would be a role model for us. But this is a television show, and not a real family, and there is nothing wrong with representing a hypothetical family on television. The very fact that the program can last so long shows us that people enjoyed watching it, regardless of the comments made later. <br /> <br /> Another positive point of the program is that any person of any age will not only enjoy watching it, but it would remove a message no matter how childish. These conversations of Jesse with Michelle are extremely moving, if one does not consider it childish. <br /> <br /> In general, I would say that after watching all the Full House shows, there is a satisfaction in your heart that is rarely present after many other shows.
