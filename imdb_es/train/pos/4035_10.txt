In a word ... incredible. <br /> <br /> At first I was not very interested in seeing Pinjar since I thought that this would be another film that would be sorry for the partition and show biases towards India and Pakistan. I was totally wrong Pinjar is a moving, emotional and intelligent film without any visible flaws. He persecuted me after seeing him. It remained in my mind for so long; The themes, the pain, the loss, the emotion, everything was so real. <br /> <br /> This is truly a masterpiece that is rarely seen in Bollywood today. He has no prejudices or prejudices and has given the partition a human history. Here, no country is represented as good or bad. There are evil Indians, evil Pakistanis and good Indians and Pakistanis. The cinematography is excellent and the music is melodious, meaningful (thanks to Gulzar sahib) and fascinating. Everything about the movie was incredible ... and the performance left me breathless. All were cast perfectly. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in seeing an intellectually and genuinely wonderful movie ... look no further. This movie gives everything. I recommend it with all my heart. INCREDIBLE can not describe how excellent it is.
