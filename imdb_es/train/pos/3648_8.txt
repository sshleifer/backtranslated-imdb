"Pandora's Clock" is an exciting suspense / suspense that is a cross between a virus movie and a disaster movie. This film, which aired on two parts on NBC in its debut in 1996, is about an airplane flight that gets infected with a virus when one of the passengers simply carries this disease. The US government UU Debate on whether the plane should be destroyed or not, while the pilot (Richard Dean Anderson) and a virus expert (Daphne Zuniga) try to solve something to avoid the disaster. I'm not really a big fan of TV movies and miniseries, but I liked the "Pandora Clock". It is an exciting journey. Jane Leeves ("Frasier" of television), Robert Loggia and Edward Herrmann (as President) also star. <br /> <br /> *** (out of four)
