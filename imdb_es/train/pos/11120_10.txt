['Wow. I LOVED the whole series and I was surprised by the comments of people who thought it ended badly. Maybe it faded a bit in seasons 4 and 5, while it stayed better than anything else on television. But 6 and particularly 6b were beautiful permutations on the themes developed in the first three most muscular seasons. <br /><br /> 6B began with such somber humor and Janice&#39;s insight into the anguish of the family, that line full of condemnation for knowing Tony&#39;s inclination to sit and stare. Anyone who has missed the implications of that for the rest of the series does not know Tony. Melfi&#39;s discomfort with psychiatric study and his references to the sociopath&#39;s self-deceptive sentimentality for pets and animals goes back to the first episodes of the series, for example, with Tony&#39;s panic attack on the ducks that come out of your pool and it resonates with Phil&#39;s wave. goodbye &quot;line to his grandchildren before the final episode knockout (not to get into Chase&#39;s dark mood). <br /><br /> I could go on and on, but I&#39;ll just add that I thought about the final show, starting with the initial varieties of Vanilla Fudge to provide the ironic gloom (&quot;You Keep Me Hangin &#39;On&quot;) to the terminal moments where Tony fades. returning to complacency with his family in tow or explosions such as AJ&#39;s SUV or Phil&#39;s head were, absolutely, absolutely PERFECT. The best television in history. <br /><br /> Quite well in a dying medium that pathologically provides the &quot;jack-off fantasies&quot; that AJ mocks (and then in which he quickly collapses). A tip of the pork pie to Mr. Chase.']
