Despite the excellent progress of Vanilla Sky, I expected the film to disappoint me because I had heard that it had not received good reviews. However, I left the cinema completely amazed at how good Vanilla Sky is. <br /> <br /> There was no bad performance in the whole movie, each character is believable. The romantic moments between the character of Cruise, David Aames and the character of Cruz, Sophia are realistic and intimate (probably due to the fact that they were a future real life couple). <br /> <br /> Vanilla Sky's plot will confuse you in the last third of the movie and there's very little chance you'll guess the ending. However, the ends are tied to the end, leaving you with a strange mixture of feelings consisting of sadness, shock and empathy for David Aames. <br /> <br /> The film is intellectual and you should pay attention at all times. This is not so difficult because most likely you are attracted to the movie and do not take your eyes off the screen for a second. <br /> <br /> I usually leave theaters completely forgetting about the subject. The movie that I just saw. But Vanilla Sky still remains in my mind days after seeing it. I recommend it to anyone who wants a change of simple and superficial films.
