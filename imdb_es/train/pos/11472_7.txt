As a fan of deepening the phenomenon of school shootings, this film had an interesting and different approach to the idea. Presented as a series of video recordings made by the two men with problems (I can not refer to people who kill as children or adolescents), the months of preparation lead to a zero day (the code name for the day they will attack) What the film is about To present the situation from the opposite end of the gun. It seems an intention to portray the pain they suffer, but focuses on the literal preparation. The problem is that little in terms of emotion is delivered directly. The only point at which the emotion became overwhelming was the end, as expected. But before this point, it's never really clear why they plan this. We are told the obligatory story that they made fun, but the movie also seems to contradict this. Without ruining the film, it is easy to say that it was a great attempt and it had equally good intentions, but it falls short due to a careless movie. The whole direction is amateur, to promote the concept of home video, but the story and continuity are weak. The film seems to want the audience to decide a lot, but neither does it provide the information for such an event. The ending is abrupt, and it does not seem to end all that the movie started.
