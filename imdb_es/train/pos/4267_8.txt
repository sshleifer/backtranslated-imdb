During a celebration of Kurt Weill in Brooklyn, WHERE ARE WE GOING FROM HERE? Finally it was unearthed for a projection. It is surprising that a moving image, from any era, that has Weill-Gershwin collaborations may be missing from the screens. The score is high, and a CD of the material, with Gershwin and Weill, only highlights its merits, which are considerable. Yes, the movie has its problems, but the score is not one of them. Ratoff is not in his element as the director of this musical fantasy, and Fred MacMurray can not understand the material. Then, too, the 'modern' segment is written weakly. BUT the fantasy elements take the film to a high level, as do the work of the two beautiful and outstanding ladies, Joan Leslie and June Haver. Both have the charm that this type of work desperately needs to work. As a greeting from the Second World War to the history of our country, although in a frame "never was", the film has its place in the musical history of Hollywood and should be available for all to see and find their considerable merits.
