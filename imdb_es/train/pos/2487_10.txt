['I must say that, seeing Hamlet from a student&#39;s perspective, Brannagh&#39;s version of Hamlet is by far the best. Your dedication to staying true to the original text must be applauded. It helps the game come alive on the screen and makes it easier for people who hold the text while they watch it, as we did while studying it, to follow and analyze the text. <br /><br /> One of the things I&#39;ve heard criticized many times is the casting of the main Hollywood names in the play. I find that this helps viewers recognize characters more easily, rather than having actors who look and sound the same as they help in the confusion normally associated with Shakespeare. <br /><br /> In addition, his flashbacks help clear up many ambiguities in the text. For example, how far really the relationship between Hamlet and Ophelia and why Fortinbras was in the castle at the end. In general, this version not only contains some brilliant interpretations of actors that both know as Shakespeare. It is presented in a way that one does not have to be a Ph.D in English literature to understand and enjoy it.']
