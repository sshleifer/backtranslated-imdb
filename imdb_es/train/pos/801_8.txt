I guess JEDI is now considered chronologically as the "last" entry in the popular saga, and it's a very good one, as are several of these. I liked how this sequel took off directly after THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, and I appreciated the maturity of Luke Skywalker as a character (and also Mark Hamill, as an actor). After hearing so many negative things about the Ewoks, they were not so bad. I enjoyed the thrilling chase inside the forest and I felt that there was a lot of emotion well done in this chapter. The ending (with some new additions, I suppose?) Successfully weaves the 6 chapters into a wonderful fantasy story. I know that many true Star Wars fans hated George Lucas for the changes he made to the original movies, but as a newbie in these movies it's quite late and do not miss what he did not know, I think he made these 6 movies work. perfectly as a whole entity. Oh, and, err ... Carrie Fisher looked pretty delicious in her little outfit.
