I enjoyed this movie. He was cheerful, charming and very colorful. You can see that MGM was showing Technicolor. There are hardly any colors that do not appear in this movie. Each scene is completely full. The choreography was great. Gene Kelly is wonderful. He is so talented. The dance numbers in this movie are perfectly executed and perfectly designed. He understands that dances can tell the story as much as anything else. The last section of the film, the sequence of the great dance, is very impressive. What makes this film so special is the music of Gershwin. Few American composers have had a better gift for the melody. I really like the music of Gershwin. It's lovely Ira Gershwin is definitely one of the best letter writers. He is so witty and charming. This was a very entertaining movie.
