I saw this movie waiting for what I got: good science fiction cowboy material. What really surprised me was that Kurt Russell did a great job with an extremely limited role. <br /> <br /> Imagine trying to act under these two restrictions: you almost do not have dialogue, and because you are playing at an obstacle, military robot, you can not show emotions by using facial expressions! Howzat? Something like asking a diva to make a large aria while gagged and taped. Despite being handcuffed verbally and expressly, Russell achieves an incredible characterization. Your robot becomes human, despite limitations. Great job! <br /> <br /> As usual, Jason Isaacs assures that he will go down in history as a great photographer of the consummate villain, the one you would love to see drawn and dismembered. Connie Nielsen was sweet, gentle, motherly and beautiful. I'm not sure how much of my impression is based on her performance and how much of her physical beauty, but it was hard to take my eyes off her. Unfortunately, Gary Busey's role was too small and limited. <br /> <br /> Much of the plot is pretty standard, with a lot of weaknesses, but since it has a sci-fi comic feel, I do not see what's wrong with some weaknesses. At the end of the story, the good boy wins, and the appreciative audience receives great emotional satisfaction. Yes! <br /> <br /> The kind of feeb that thinks Russell did not do a good acting job is the same kind of feeb that was missed all the way.
