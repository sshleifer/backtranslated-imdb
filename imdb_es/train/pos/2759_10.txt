The number of times I've had tears in my eyes when I watch a movie are few. And there's only one time I really cried and that's when I saw this movie. This movie has some kliches, but I really do not care. I cry even as I write this and I have not seen it for quite some time. It is perfectly acted and all production values ​​are good, but what really matters is the simple and wonderful message. We all know it in our hearts, but it is not always easy to remember that the only thing that really matters in life is LOVE in all its forms. Only when we love are we truly alive. I know what sounds sentimental to me and I promise that I am not like that in general. I'm pretty cynical. This movie has generated stronger feelings of sadness and happiness in me than in any other movie and probably will always be the first movie I recommend that others see.
