Gédéon and Jules Naudet wanted to shoot a documentary about the novice firefighters of New York City. What they got was the only film filmed inside the World Trade Center on September 11. <br /> <br /> Having previously worked with James Hanlon's stairs company, Jules went with the captain to inspect and repair a gas leak, while Gédéon stayed at the fire station in case something interesting happen A plane flying low over the City distracted Jules, and he aimed the camera up, seconds before the plane crashed into Tower One. <br /> <br /> Jules asked the captain to follow him up the towers. The first thing he saw was two people on fire, something he refused to film. He stayed in place for the next few hours, filming the reactions of the firemen and others who were there. <br /> <br /> The Naudet brothers took great care not to make the film too violent, grotesque and bloody. But the language of the firemen is a little rough, and the CBS showed a lot of balls in the air without censorship. The Naudet brothers mixed images they filmed with individual interviews so that the firemen could explain their thoughts and emotions at particular moments of the crisis. <br /> <br /> Unlike a similar title movie, most of the money from DVD sales goes to charities related to September 11. Very well done, emotional, moving and completely devoid of political propaganda, it is the best documentary of the type to date.
