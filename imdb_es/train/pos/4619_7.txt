First of all, I'm a big fan of 80's movies, and Jennifer Conelly too. So yesterday, I went into a local used books / movies store and found a copy on VHS. I read the back and it sounded good and for $ 3.99, it was a good offer. So I took it home and put it in the VCR. What a sweet movie! At my age now, I relate more to movies like About Last Night or St. Elmo's Fire, but I still remember what it was like to be 15/16 and be in love with an older boy, etc. We all have those little crushes when we are younger And if it does not work, we are disconsolate and we think we will never get over it. But of course yes. Many times. It's that kind of sweet quality that I really got out of this movie. The feeling of "Oooh, I remember when something like that happened to me ..." is all that. The characters are interesting and well developed. I recommend it to anyone who likes 80's movies, particularly teen movies, or for anyone who wants to come back and remember a simpler moment in their lives.
