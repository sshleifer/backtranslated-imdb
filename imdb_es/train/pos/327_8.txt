I have read a comment that labeled this movie as "junk" and "a waste of time" <br /> <br />. I think this person got his political clothes a bit too much <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> I just rented the new Criterion DVDs in yellow and blue. <br /> <br /> These films, although they are not big, at least have become <br /> <br /> historical interest in what refers to the so-called "radical student" <br /> <br /> political-social movement "of the late twentieth century. '60. <br /> <br /> I had not seen any of the photos and, for its notorious reputation, <br /> <br /> expected some real pornography (there is none). There are frontal <br /> <br /> nudity (including male frontal nudity still verboten (automatic <br /> <br /> NC-17 - the Orwellian-X) in the United States.But I did not expect the films <br> /> <br /> democratic socialist message on his face. <br /> <br /> Although it tends to simplistic, I thought that occasionally he made his points well <br /> <br /> his points.Occcasionally, both films had I laughed out loud <br /> <br /> and the director's comment made it clear that there was a parody <br /> <br /> in the movie, especially the supp osedly "pornographic" sex <br /> < The first of these scenes is very realistic, the leading couple is clumsy, inept, funny and endearing in their first copulation scene. <br /> <br /> The second , which caused the most complaints, has faked <br /> <br /> cunnilingus and fellatio.And the last one is the end of an angry quarrel, <br /> <br /> that is credible. <br /> <br /> The extras include u an informative introduction to the film, <br /> <br /> interview with the original US distributor and his lawyer, <br /> <br /> excerpts from the trial testimony in the United States and a "newspaper" comment <br /> <br /> of the director in some scenes. <br /> <br /> This is the movie that "blue noses" would not leave in peace and led to <br /> <br /> the "central core interest without value of social redemption" <br /> <br / > which, fortunately, still stands. <br /> <br /> Those who have an interest in the peculiarities of history will find this a necessity <br /> <br /> see.
