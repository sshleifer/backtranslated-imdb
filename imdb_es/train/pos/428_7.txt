Two women, fed up with their controlling husbands, take a vacation in Italy for a month with two other very different women. They return full of energy and energy in this wonderful little film by Merchant - Ivory. <br /> <br /> A great stage and the location is not bad either. Seriously, a very good piece of the 7 out of 10 period.
