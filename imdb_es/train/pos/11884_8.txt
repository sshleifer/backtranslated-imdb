I found this movie as a fascinating study of a family in crisis. When Leo, the eldest, announces that he is HIV +, the reactions of the family members alone and among them were touching and yet strange. <br /> <br /> I have never seen a family as physically demonstrative as this; not one that can shout at each other. I did not understand why the family felt that the younger ones could not deal with the news, but once that happened, it seemed like a moving movie. <br /> <br />
