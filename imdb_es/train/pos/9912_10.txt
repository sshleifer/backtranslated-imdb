Absolutely wonderful drama and Ros is top notch ... I recommend this movie. His performance, in my opinion, was material of the Academy Award! The only really sad fact here is that Universal has not worried that this movie has been available in any video format, either on tape or DVD. They are ignoring a VERY good movie. But Universal has little regard for its DVD library, which is sad. If you have the chance to see this somewhere (I'm not sure why it rarely runs on the cable), look at it! I will not go into the story because I think that most people prefer to have an opinion about the film, and many "critics" spend hours writing about the story, which is available anywhere. <br /> <br /> to 10!
