I enjoyed this movie very much. Tobey Maguire gives an incredible performance as Jake. He has to be one of the best actors I've seen. And I was surprised that there were so many humorous lines throughout the film. He was also extremely good at this, although he had never before seen him launch a comic line. The movie involves you with the characters and it really makes you wonder what will become of them all. I did not know what to expect from Jewel's performance, but I think she did quite well. Many exciting scenes. A good walk I am absolutely a fan of Maguire. Take a look at the rules of the cider house. One of the best times of all time.
