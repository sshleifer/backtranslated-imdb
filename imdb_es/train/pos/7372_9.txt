"This is not a love song" is a brilliant example of the persecution genre, which many people believe has an underlying meaning. The love between the two main characters can be more than fraternal. I think Heaton is in love with Spike, but Spike is too naive to see this. <br /> <br /> I really feel that this is portrayed with scenes such as backspace and letter writing sequences. Heaton shows great intimacy towards Spike. With intense facial expressions and how much care is taken to write the name of Spike at the top of his letters. <br /> <br /> One thing I've noticed when seeing external criticism is that when the movie has been scheduled, the critic seems not to have fully understood the film, since they have not even mentioned the possibility that Heaton has sexual feelings by Spike. I also have the feeling that some of the critics have not recognized him, when he uses phrases like: "Who is Heaton? What are you doing with a retard like Spike?" This person, however, may have hit the nail on the head with his comment. Spike shows remarkable signs of having A.D.D, although I do not think this person has noticed this, since he seems to be using the word "delay" as a derogatory term. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed this movie. Although it is not for the faint of heart. The film is highly based on the character, after filming to the end there is much more than dialogue between the two antiheroes. Unless you're used to watching movies so deep and gritty, stay well away.
