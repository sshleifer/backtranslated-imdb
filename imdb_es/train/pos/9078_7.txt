In general, the plot was much better than I expected. The hint of laughter was a bit annoying at times and tended to hinder; however, there were enough real laughs in this episode to make up for it. My biggest surprise was finding some of the best lines and situations were not shown in the trailers. Spade, in particular, was not presented in the best way in previous promotions, but his character is quite well in the pilot. There are enough goodies to please almost everyone and all normal characters seem to be up to the task ahead. Now, if the writers can live up to what they have started.
