I saw Dick Tracy when he was very young. I did not know who the actors were, and I did not know that the movie would be different from the way it was previewed. Although I sure loved it. <br /> <br /> Warren Beatty plays detective Dick Tracy from the 1930s who fights against the city's biggest mob bosses. This time, Big Boy Caprice (Al Pacino) has killed a very powerful man and is willing to take over the city with his girlfriend singer, Breathless Mahoney (Madonna), who has his eye on Tracy. It gets even worse because a new criminal is invading and the worst part is: this criminal has no face. He or she is very unknown. In addition, the famous villains have returned from the comic collection. <br /> <br /> I thought this movie was very colorful and creative. It was entertaining and fun to watch, especially as a child. Warren Beaty was like James Bond in the 1930s, the way he played Dick Tracy. <br /> <br /> The cast of the film includes: Charlie Korsmo, Glenn Headly, William Forsythe, Dustin Hoffman, James Caan, Ed O 'Ross, Tommy Lee Jones, Mandy Patinkin, Charles Durning. More more! <br /> <br /> Dick Tracy is a movie for all ages and it is a fun movie for a family to enjoy. Take my word for it.
