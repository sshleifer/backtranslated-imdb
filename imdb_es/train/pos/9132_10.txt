I will begin by relating my first encounter with Prince's music. It was in a bar, on my 39th birthday and a girl danced with her arms crossed until "1999" playing on the speakers. I asked people, who is this singer? They told me it was the prince. It was so good that it distracted me from a beautiful topless dancer. Later, I started listening to other Prince songs and really "digging" them. When Purple Rain came out, I still knew very little about this companion from Minnesotan. The movie struck me. Instantly I became the number one fan of Prince of the "War Baby" generation. Later, I discovered that one of my cousins ​​was his secretary, and she got me, and my nephew, in a V.I.P. Prince at the concert where we sit next to his mother ... how cool is that! Returning to the subject in question, I agree with Siskel and Ebert, who called Purple Rain an instant classic. I've seen it more than 17 times and I love it. I thought Prince's performance was fine, Apollonia struggled a bit, but overall the performance was fine. John Gielgud was not available to play 'The Kid', so Prince took the role. The film is visually impressive, with a brilliant rhythm (it never slows down) and is directed in a tremendous way. I classify it among the best musical films of all time. The last time I saw it was after a gap of about 7 years and it still worked. I am very proud of my compatriot minnesotano Prince Rogers Nelson and I would love to tell him personally. He walked right in front of me during the mentioned concert and said: "Hi" to my nephew, but not to me. He was chatting with his mother. I was a little crushed, but it's still number 1 with me.
