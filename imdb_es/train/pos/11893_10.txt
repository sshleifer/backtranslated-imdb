The next two seasons of this original series were less than lackluster. The disastrous reorganization of the last few seasons contributed to its short lifespan of three seasons. Maybe if the plug were disconnected after the first season, I would have won a cult following. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, the first season was really hilarious! Ingenious, intelligent with excellent writing, it was promising. The excellent product of the first season had the right ingredients: characters / actors, history and so on. Also, a comedy about a paparazzi reporter was original. Nora and her colleagues "photographers" in sight, night after night, day after day for exclusive. <br /> <br /> Many things do not make sense to me. Like this program and another one of my favorites: Gross Pointe never "did" it. If only the first seasons of Naked Truth and Grosse Pointe were released on DVD, please someone out there ?!
