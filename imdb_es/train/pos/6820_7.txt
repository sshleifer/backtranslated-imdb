The movie was much better than the other reviewer said. It's a good family movie. It has a funny fantasy aspect of some time travel. The story revolves around a 14-year-old girl who accidentally finds a way to travel back in time in the old elevator of her apartment building. Of course, nobody believes her when she tries to explain her disappearances. Find and make friends with a girl of your age and can help the girl's family in many ways. She can also help her own relationship with her father in the long term. It reminds me of a Hallmark movie, so give it a try and decide for yourself. It seemed to be more oriented towards children from 6 to 12 years old (maybe a little bit bigger) and is classified as PG or G. I am an adult who can appreciate a good "family" movie; I guess the other critic is not.
