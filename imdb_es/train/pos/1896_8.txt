Arthur has always been a personal movie for me for two reasons. A good friend of mine who worked on the film as an extra and to help with the horses during the barn scene recently passed away. If you look quickly, you can see Frank Graham during the restaurant scene in the background while Dudley Moore and Jill Eikenberry converse. Frank was an equestrian champion and will be missed by everyone who knew him. <br /> <br /> Second, I actually met Arthur Bach. He was not as rich as Arthur, but he spent 47 years of his life basically as a child. Her parents firmly controlled the ropes of her purse, but her rent and utilities were paid in an apartment in the basement of Greenwich Village. He spent much of his time getting drunk with various spirits and making a public spectacle of himself, just as Dudley Moore does. <br /> <br /> The wonder with Arthur is why someone would bother with him for the wealth of no. But that's the other half of the equation. My friend was a lovely person when you got to know him. In fact, it was almost a compulsion to be charming. I could not buy a newspaper or magazine without trying to establish some level of relationship with the seller. He spent his life being a perfect guest for the party. The term wastrel that was commonly used in the 19th century would apply to it. <br /> <br /> And that's what Dudley Moore is, a wastrel. Unlike my friend Moore, John Gielgud has to clean up after him. That's a full-time job as we see it demonstrated in Arthur. My friend also did not find a Liza Minnelli, a Liza Minnelli, in fact, because he was gay. Still, Moore's Arthur Bach portrait is extremely precise and very real to me. <br /> <br /> Arthur, the waste of the twentieth century, is forced to marry another baby trust fund in Jill Eikenberry. Since he will not work to live, the threat of being cut is quite real to him. It only has to its butler Hobson interpreted by John Gielgud and the driver Bitterman, interpreted by Ted Post, to pour its problems. We should all have these problems. <br /> <br /> John Gielgud in his almost century of life did a better job than Arthur in the film and, in fact, Gielgud is best known for his performances on stage. However, 1981 was a year of feeling at the time of the Oscars. The Academy awarded the Oscar for Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn for On Golden Pond and Gielgud the Best Supporting Actor Award for essentially life-long work. That man was amazing, still in his trade almost to the end. <br /> <br /> So Frank Graham, who worked on the film, and Jackie Weiss, a real Arthur of real life, I dedicate this review.
