Nora is a single mother who still wants to live the life of a young artist in the 1970s, as well as her friends, a group of writers, singers and actors. The philosophy of "free love" is not completely outside the system. and Nora did not count on falling in love, particularly with a drug addict. Hazlehurst won her first of two AFI awards in the space of four years for her incredible portrayal of Nora, who makes sure she does the right thing for her children, but falls in love with Junkie Javo (Friels) at the same time. Garner ?? Who would later act in films like LOVE AND OTHER CATASTROPHES and STRANGE PLANET? is well interpreted as Nora's pre-pubescent daughter, and Caton (perhaps in preparation for her role as presenter of the HOT PROPERTY lifestyle program in 2000?) appears as a bearded painter. The initial effort of director Cameron is a winner; He went on to make the award-winning mini-series MY BROTHER JACK among his later projects. But it is the surprising delivery of Hazlehurst that brings to life the intelligent script and search, based on the award-winning novel by Helen Garner.
