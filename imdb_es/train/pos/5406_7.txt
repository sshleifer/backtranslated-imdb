The fourth Pokémon movie made me cry when Celebi died. Do not you dare say that Pokémon stinks! I do not like it when people say that ... I have liked Pokémon for 5 or 6 years, so everyone should enjoy Pokémon, including this movie and other Pokémon movies. Then, without further ado, say that Pokémon is great and should be enjoyed by people of all ages. And also, why do those who hate Pokémon give low ratings for all or most of the Pokémon movies? I do not understand ... They should not do that ... There is absolutely no reason why people should vote without proving that Pokémon stinks, besides the fact that: 1) Pokémon is only for small children. 2) Pokemon is stupid. and 3) People should not like Pokémon. I think that's why people do not like Pokémon.
