The movie Titanic makes it much more than a "night to remember". Write a tragic historical event that will always be discussed and never forgotten. Why so criticized? I have no idea. They could / will ever make a movie like Titanic that is so moving and touching every time you see it. Could they ever replace such an epic masterpiece? It will be almost impossible. <br /> <br /> The director, without doubt, had the biggest impact on the film. A simple disaster movie (boring to watch) turned into an incredible romance. Yes, I'm not a Romance either, but that should not bother you, because you'll never see a romance like this. Guaranteed Everything for the amazing effects, to the music, to the sublime performance. <br /> <br /> The film creates an incredible visual and wonderful feeling. Everything looks very real and alive. The legend "TITANIC" is shown brilliantly in all classes, it is also seen, it is also adapted. The performance was the real effect. Dicaprio and Winslet are simply the best at playing the roles there. Nobody could have done better. In part they are the reason why the movie is so big. <br /> <br /> I guess it's not much to talk about. The plot is simple, the performance is brilliant, based on a true story, probably more than half of consumers who watch the movie will share tears, thanks to an unimaginable ending that can never be forgotten. Well, if you have not seen this movie, you're missing something from Hesterical and a Hollywood idolatry movie. It could get better? Not at all. The most moving movie of all time, do not listen to people, check it and then you will understand. A point of reference (Do not be surprised if you cry too)
