This is one of those movies that you wish you had not seen before, so you can see it again "for the first time". Van Dine's books still bring pleasure, but many describe them as excessively flowery. This film is, by far, the best cinematographic adaptation of his works. William Powell is William Powell, do not say more. The plot is intricate. The story moves too fast, because you want it to last. Enjoy.
