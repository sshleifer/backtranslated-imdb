Budget constraints, time constraints, record a script and then cut it, cut it, cut it ... This team is a group of good young filmmakers; reflective in this script: yes, allegorical; intelligent zero-dollar effects when all you have is time and knowledge, trusting actors and friends and others for their time, devotion and location; and getting a first feature in the can, a thing of 1 in 1000. These guys make movies. Good ones. Check out his short collection "Heartland Horrors" and watch the development. And I can answer, working with them is the most fun you will do in the business. I am frustrated by the harsh and insulting criticisms of this film, and I wonder if a critic listened to a word of dialogue, reflected on a thought or concept, or if all that was desired from this work was the visual blood of hitting and trimming to satisfy to some. senseless vision of what horror should mean to an audience. Let "The Empty Acre" approach you. Do not preconceive what you expect to be just because it is put in the genre of terror / suspense due to its supernatural premise. It is a drama with a depth that goes beyond how far you can stick a sword to someone with a reverence for a message that does not assault the visual center of your brain, but rather is based on one's empathic imagination to experience the suffering from the mind and spirit of others. Mark Ridgway, Curtis, "The Empty Acre"
