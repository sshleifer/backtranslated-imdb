With a relatively small budget for an animated movie of only $ 60 million, the folks at Fox Animation and Blue Sky Studios have done an incredible job. <br /> <br /> They have combined avant-garde digital animation, the Elaborate voice talents of Ray Romano, John Leguizamo and Dennis Leary (among many others) to create a very entertaining family movie with a strong message about cooperation, the friendship and care of their fellow members of the pack. And how many different creatures are sometimes needed to form a pack. <br /> <br /> While I watch this movie I received a strong political message about how to get along with the people who share their space, maybe it should be necessary to see it. For all world leaders! <br /> <br /> David Newman, another member of the Newman family of Hollywood composers, offers an excellent score that is not intrusive but serves to advance the action and, at times, it is a positive touch. <br /> <br /> The general appearance of the film is incredible; A land of fantasy of intense colors, strangely believable, of snow, geysers, mud, rocks and ice. The individual characters were also deliciously believable, with the facial expressions of "Manfred" by Ray Romano being a particular delight. <br /> <br /> The complete sequence with the DoDos will leave no doubt about where is the expression `Dumb as Here comes a DoDo '. <br /> <br /> This is a good family movie that keeps things that could alarm or scare children, but in spite of everything. <br /> <br /> It would be a great movie to see in the theater and to buy it at home.
