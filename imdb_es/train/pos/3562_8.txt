Nathan Detroit (Frank Sinatra) is the manager of the oldest floating dice game in New York, and needs $ 1000 to secure a new location. Confident in his odds, bet on the best player in the city, Sky Masterson (Marlon Brando), who can not woo the missionary Sarah Brown (Jean Simmons). 'Guys and Dolls (1955)' is a great musical because it skilfully combines the contrasting styles of film and stage. During a dazzling opening sequence, crowds of pedestrians move to the beat, stopping and starting as if responding to signals behind the scenes. Even the movements of walking are stylized and angular, halfway between a walk and a dance. The New York City of Mankiewicz is a shimmering movement of color and art deco movement, a fantasy world so completely removed from reality that even the business of clandestine gambling and criminal crime seems perfectly cool. <br /> <br /> As I write this review, I just received the news that Jean Simmons passed away, at 80 years old. This, incredibly, was the first time I saw her in a movie, but it dazzled her. I from the beginning Her idealistic and sexually repressed, Sarah comes out of her shell after an alcohol binge in Havana, releasing an adorably playful version of "If I Were A Bell". Although both Simmons and Brando were not singers, producer Sam Goldwyn decided not to double their voices, arguing that "maybe it does not sound so good, but at least it's you." Despite Goldwyn's trust, the two do well to carry full musical numbers. Simmons suggests the same childhood vivacity that Audrey Hepburn might have brought to the role, and Brando exudes such self-confidence and charisma that it does not matter that his singing voice is not enough.
