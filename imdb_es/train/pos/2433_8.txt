I was about 12 years old when I saw this classic cartoon of "Casper the Friendly Ghost". I assumed it was one of the first since Casper did not look good, in the same way that Porky Pig does not look good in the cartoons of the old 1930s. But I'm digressing ... <br /> <br / > Anyway, this episode in the beyond of the friend's friendly friend's life concerns him to befriend a young fox whom he calls Ferdie. I remember being happy to see Casper have a friend, since those who have seen the cartoons usually know that most people flee from him, shouting "A Ghost!" <br /> <br /> Casper and Ferdie have fun together until someone else appears ... I hate to leave you with a semi-spoiler, but the caricature only lasts seven minutes, so you can not be too ambiguous. Also, anyone who reads the IMDb Synthesis of the cartoon can deduce what will happen next ... <br /> <br /> The ending is a bit heartbreaking. In fact, it's probably the saddest thing I've felt when I saw a caricature. But that only means that it moved me, which probably explains why I decided to write a comment on this particular cartoon and not on many others. Or, the fact that I REALLY REMEMBER this caricature is due to its emotional effect on me, I have not seen it since then. But the cartoon ends on an optimistic note, and I was pleased to see Casper and Ferdie happy again. <br /> <br /> I would give this caricature 8 out of 10 stars. Secondly, only for the Warner Bros. animation "Peace on Earth", this is the most that has moved me an animated short.
