I really like this movie even though it seems deliberately less 'polished' than the other Fred and Ginger films, not to mention the somewhat problematic casting of Harriet Hillard in the main romantic role. <br /> <br /> Once again with these films, the plot has a minor consequence: Astaire plays a rather unlikely sailor (who happens to be a brilliant former hoofer (of course!)) and Rogers, an aspiring actor in a seedy music room. Even though their relationship is brilliant and fun to watch, they are bogged down by a main story without participation from Hilliard and Randolph Scott who fail to find any chemistry between them. <br /> <br /> Although it was a last-minute decision, Hilliard was a bit bad about it since he does not have the presence on the screen to give this film what it needs despite being sweet and nice at all moment. It is possible that the film has benefited by promoting Lucille Ball's metallic character to a more important role, since she simply shone in every little scene, and would have done a great side kick from Helen Broderick to Rogers in this kind of brilliant film ( See 'Stage Door', done the following year, to see an example of wonderful scenes between these two fantastic actresses - that Scott's one-dimensional Neanderthal character finally falls in love with Hilliard's is even harder to believe than Astaire in the Navy! <br /> <br /> Now in the important part, singing and dancing: nothing else can be said about "Let's face music and dance", apart from being brilliant and moving and perfectly executed and I often finish to see that scene with tears in my eyes, however, other songs in the film also deserve some recognition, "I put all my eggs in a basket" is a beautiful example of the inst comedians of Astaire and Rogers, and almost makes fun of his reputation for breaking into a spontaneous and perfectly synchronized dance. Other highlights are "I prefer to be a band leader" and "Let Yourself Go", which show how these two talents could act as brilliantly alone as together. I almost forgot to mention that this is one of the few (if not the only) time that we see Astaire play brilliantly on the piano; It seems that this man's talents were infinite! <br /> <br /> In general, I prefer this to 'Top Hat' and 'Swing Time' (even if only fair), since it is more earthly and is done with such enthusiasm by all involved, it is difficult not to like it the fun factor.
