At the end of the 19th century, San Francisco, the well-dressed poor Errol Flynn (as James J. Corbett) works in a bank and enjoys attending local "fights" (boxing) with a work colleague and drinker Jack Carson (as Walter Lowrie ). One day, the beautiful Alexis Smith (as Victoria Ware) enters the "Comstock Bank", where Mr. Flynn works. Flynn is so impressed with the elegant beauty of Mrs. Smith, who offers to take her purse away. Smith is secretly kidnapped with the handsome Flynn, but is discouraged by his impudence. <br /> <br /> Flynn's good deed (actually, collection attempt) gives him a free membership in the boasted "Olympic Club" Conveniently includes a gym (with boxing equipment). However, Flynn's presumptuous manner and practical jokes (he tickles the men on the parallel bars) irritate the members of the "Club." When an English boxing champion visits the club, members struggle to get Flynn to fight with the man. They are hoping that Flynn will resign, humiliated by his defeat, but, Flynn wins! <br /> <br /> The first producer Robert Buckner organizes a good package for Warner Brothers and director Raoul Walsh. Mr. Buckner was certainly enjoying the success of his contribution (script) to the brilliant "Yankee Doodle Dandy" of the studio. Unfortunately, this story is positively ridiculous. There was a "Gentleman Jim": this story is supposedly the filming of James J. Corbett's autobiography "The Roar of the Crowd," but this film must have significant fiction. <br /> <br /> Flynn is a very attractive man leader; He maneuvers the script lightly, and should have been recognized, at the beginning of the 1940s, as an excellent actor. Many of Flynn's characterizations were (are?) Overlooked as great performances, and this is one of them. Smith does it well as her female interest, skillfully transmitting her emotions to the viewer. Director Walsh makes stupidity look soft and extravagant. The cast is a treasure, from the bustling Alan Hale (as Pat Corbett) to Lon McCallister ("Paging Mr. Corbett"). <br /> <br /> ******** Gentleman Jim (1942) Raoul Walsh ~ Errol Flynn, Alexis Smith, Alan Hale
