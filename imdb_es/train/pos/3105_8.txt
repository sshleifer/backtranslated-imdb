The Bourne Ultimatum is the third and last exit of the super spy Jason Bourne, a man who is willing to kill the people who made him a murderer. The Bourne series is one of the trilogies most appreciated by critics (Ultimatum has an 85/100 in metacritic.com, which means that his state is "acclaimed by all") and for good reasons, the fight is very well choreographed and the deep story can be very fascinating. <br /> <br /> First of all, I recommend you watch The Bourne Identity and The Bourne Supremacy, the two Ultimatum luxury titled prequels. There may be three different movies, but in reality they are all a continuation of one another: missing one leaves you helpless and confused, just like me. You will still be ready to enjoy the action and the Ultimatum battle scenes if you missed the first two, but the story will definitely lead you to some confusion. <br /> <br /> If you were lucky enough to see the prequels of this movie, you probably enjoyed watching Bourne take down his enemies and locate the man who took him out of Supremacy. Jason Bourne is very good for Matt? Damon. Damon does not do anything to deserve an Oscar. Your work here is good enough to sustain that it is your own. Bourne's adventures take place in many different cities; The cities are all varied enough to prevent the film from becoming tasteless at times. The agency that tracks Bourne takes advantage of all the technological tools known to mankind to track him down. <br /> <br /> I will not go into details about the characters because they are a continuation of the first two films. However, it would not hurt the film to explain some things to the audience, not all viewers are moviegoers who can understand every little clue about the development of the story. Ultimatum would not have been harmed at all if the story was a little more advanced. <br /> <br /> It seems that most people agree that Ultimatum was the success of a movie: the movie opened at $ 69 million, and ... The total box office is now up $ 216 million. Currently, it is still very important for a movie that has been in theaters since August 3. It's the best action movie I've seen since Live Free or Die Hard. <br /> <br /> Good) Damon is solid, but not spectacular, very intelligent. Bad movie History is like many others.
