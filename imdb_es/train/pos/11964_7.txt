I went to the movies this afternoon waiting for Scoop to disappoint me. Fortunately, the film exceeded expectations, at least a little. It's nothing heavy, nothing deep, and it's not as good as any real Allen masterpiece, but it's also completely fun as a light comedy and prankster. There is something quite simple and sweet about it. "Lindo" was the word I heard from people in the audience when they left after the show. It does not feel like Allen set out to create a masterpiece here, he feels like he wants to do a little comedy and have fun doing it. Compared to almost everything that Hollywood is producing, Allen's things have a tendency to love. Even fluffy things. These days it's simply refreshing to go see a movie made by a real human being.
