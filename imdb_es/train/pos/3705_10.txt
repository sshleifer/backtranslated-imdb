I do not understand the low grade of 5.7 in this movie. It is a delight for people who like a plot of strong suspense and dark atmospheres. The tone reminds Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, to the place (Savannah). The performance is strong, and I was surprised by the plausibility of Kenneth Branagh's southern accent. Famke Jansen is great, Robert Duval is effective in a small part and Embeth Davitz is the PUMP. Great full naked scene of her, too. <br /> <br /> The plot is quite standard but effectively executed.
