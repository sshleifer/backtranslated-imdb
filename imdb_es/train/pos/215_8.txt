The word 'classic' is used too loosely nowadays, but this movie is well worth the attention. The combination of Neil Simon, Walter Matthau (possibly the best live comic actor in the world) and the last lament George Burns make up a comic book masterpiece. It is interesting to contemplate what the film would have been like if death had not prevented Jack Benny from playing the role of George Burns, as had been planned. As it is, it is unlikely that the meeting scene in Matthau's apartment will be overcome as a lateral separator. Definitely one of my movies on a desert island. <br /> <br /> "Come in !!!!!!!!!"
