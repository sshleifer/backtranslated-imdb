['I liked the movie, first of all because it told an interesting story, but the story told in the film felt like it was condensed from a much longer story. Since the book has more than 400 pages, that makes sense. It covers a period of time from the 1920s to the 1970s, in a fictitious country in South America, also a lot to fit in the time available. I think it would have been much better like a six-hour miniseries than a 140-minute movie. <br /><br /> Although it is hurried, the story does not jump so much that it gets confused. What is said is said quite well. One flaw is that Clara&#39;s supernatural powers appear inconsistently; either they should have appeared more evenly throughout the film, or they should have been excluded. Two more faults (which could be spoilers): the eventual return of Esteban to goodness happens too suddenly, and Ferula&#39;s curse seems to disappear, although the tone of the story suggests that it should last forever. <br /><br /> The acting is excellent. Glenn Close, like the tormented spinster Ferula, is outstanding. Jeremy Irons, as the self-made brutal brutal man, is also excellent. Meryl Streep, like the protagonist Clara, is great, although often it is even better than in this movie. There were also many smaller roles well done. The biggest flaw is that the movie seemed to lack a dialect coach; Each actor seemed to speak with a different type of accent.']
