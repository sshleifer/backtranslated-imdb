Steve Carrel shows himself as a great protagonist in this breath of fresh air, wonderful and original. I mean how cool it was how fun it was. <br /> <br /> Basically, the title of the film says it all: Andy Stitzer is a 40-year-old man who works in an electronics store. He is a little nerd who loves video games and comics, and has the largest collection. His colleagues who work in the store with him discover that he is a Virgin during a game of poker full of sexual dialogues, and then Andy has to go through a funny and funny Odyessy of rude sexual awakenings, but always fucking what takes him . without losing his virginity, but finally he has luck in the end. <br /> <br /> Leave the little ones at home, but take the whole family to see this amazing adult romantic comedy. It will keep you hooked and cracked from the start, and when it's over, you'll want to wear your extra thick absorbent underwear. Just another thing I can say about it is that it's a pity that Steve Carrel was not recognized as a man who had left 20 years ago. He will definitely win the best male performance at the MTV Movie Awards next year. You can bet your hard earned money on that, people! <br /> <br /> I give this one a perfect 10!
