['I thought I should rate my position after reading other reviews. The movie is not great, but it has many great elements. The lighting and the scenes along with the work of the camera are excellent. The story is slow and weak, but entertaining. The acting is bad, but not worse than what you&#39;ll find on the SyFy channel. The music is pretty good and the blood is good. He has the big leather face in the film and is produced by Bruce Campbell. I saw the whole movie and, although it was generally predictable, it was still nice. Women are attractive enough and the main actor does a good job of being thoughtful and chilling. The film was remarkably clean for a modern movie and appropriate violence for children 13 and older. There were no sex scenes. I gave it 7 out of 10 and I think it&#39;s fair. I would see it again if I had nothing better to do. The gay sound angel was the most annoying aspect of the movie, the devil is pretty creepy.']
