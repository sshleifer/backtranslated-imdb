['This is a series of cartoons where most of the action takes place in the human body where the actors are vitamins, viruses, blood cells, etc. I will not try to explain it in more detail, you will simply have to see it for yourself: You will not be disappointed. <br /><br /> I remember seeing this as a child in the &#39;80s (with Swedish voices). I have spoken with some people who were also children in the 80s and they also loved it! I must admit that the part of the education of the episodes did not reach me at a conscious level, but the idea of educating children while having fun is wonderful. Recently I have seen some episodes; There is a mood and a heart that is hard to find in other programs for children nowadays. <br /><br /> 5/5']
