['Several contributors have mentioned the age difference between Stewart and Novak. She was 25 years old and he was 50 when this movie premiered. I think the difference did not matter for a suspense drama like Vertigo, but it does matter for a romantic comedy. We can easily understand, that is, why his character would be attracted to hers, but it is less clear why he would be attracted to him. <br /><br /> Still, the movie works like a light romantic fantasy. The scene in which she looks at him through the head of the cat, with her dark eyebrows painted and the sounds of her buzzing and the cat purring, is true magic. It is a bit shocking, therefore, when the scene moves to the top of the Flatiron building, and we see the age difference very markedly. While he hugs her, she reaches over to run her fingers through his hair, but stops that movement and just rubs his fingers lightly against his wig.']
