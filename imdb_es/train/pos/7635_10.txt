I have seen this movie many times and I have to tell you that I have enjoyed it every time. This is the pinnacle movie of Belushi in my opinion. Belushi and Lovitz are so nice and identifiable with the common man that you can not help getting involved once you start looking. The movie has a wonderful cast of stars, some were already great and others were just beginning. It is considered a good movie, and that is exactly what it is. This movie teaches you that life is not always so bad, after all. Sometimes you just have to look at things from a different perspective to fully appreciate what you already have. When you finish watching, you will appreciate the things that you have much more and you will also be smiling. You can not ask for much more than one movie in my opinion, not to mention that it's a hilarious movie and you'll never lose interest. Very very underestimated movie people here. <br /> <br /> Rating me: 10 I'm out !!!
