This is a movie that the general market will probably never be able to access, since it does not give the viewer a simple vision. The story about the worried Spike and his friend Heaton is not exactly a Friday night movie, but it has its own unique advantage and I found it entertaining. There are moments of brilliance given that the film was shot on such a low budget, as when Spike inhales the spray. However, I did not really understand the relationship between Spike and Heaton and, to be honest, I did spend most of the movie trying to solve it. And I did not like the fact that most of the movie is spent with the two friends talking and not really much "action". It is a small movie that is complex to watch and that is what makes it attractive.
