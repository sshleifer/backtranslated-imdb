Sidney Young (Pegg) moves from England to New York to work for the popular Sharpe's magazine hoping to live the lifestyle of his dreams but struggles to make a lasting impression. <br /> <br /> Based on Toby Young's book on survival in American business, this comedy drama received mixed reviews of criticism. Tagged as inconsistently funny but charming by the actors, how to lose friends seemed like a fish escape from the pond making fun of another cultural comedy, but it is not. <br /> <br /> This 2008 The image works because of its actors and the simple but sharp story. We started in the past, then in the present and we continue moving forward to see how Young left his mark in one of the most important magazines in the United States. <br /> <br /> Pegg (Hot Fuzz) is too nice for words. Whether it's hitting zombies with a cricket bat or showing your partner the nature of the law, the English actor brings charm and lightness to every scene. Here, when the scripting is good but far from its own standards, it brings a lot of energy to the image and only it is worth it. His antics with "Babe 3" are unforgivable, they are simply impressive things, as is his exuberant dance, but he does it splendidly. <br /> <br /> Bridges and Anderson do a good job of portraying stereotypical magazine chiefs where Dunst fits the confused love interests very well. Megan Fox, who stole Transformers, reminds everyone that she can act here with a funny hyperbole of a stereotype star. The fact that her character Sophie Myles is starring in an image of Mother Teresa is as laughable as her character's antics in the pool. To emphasize the point, there is a dog, and Pegg rounds off that in a true British-style comedy, with a little twist. <br /> <br /> Although in a British movie there is an adaptation of the American lifestyle for Young while trying. to fit in and we can see the different approaches to tell stories. Young wants the bottom to be dirty, in contrast to American professionalism. The inclusion of the stars of the tabloids of today will make this film be dated, but the concept of exploitation of film stars offers this advantage. <br /> <br /> Weide's first image is not perfect. There are flaws in the concentration as the plot becomes too soapy with an obvious clumsy turn and there are too many characters to be needed. The physical comedy can also be exaggerated. As a side note, the bloopers on the DVD are some of the best you'll ever see, which last almost half an hour. <br /> <br /> This comedy drama has Simon Pegg in brilliant shape again and with the collective approach to storytelling and sharp comedy, it's worth seeing.
