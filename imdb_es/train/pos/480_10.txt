The main aspect of this film that most people miss is that Luhzin lives his life as a game of chess. Many people have seen this movie and they just do not get it, and I do not understand why. While watching this movie, I was taken on a private trip that surprised me. I will try to explain this without spoilers, but be forewarned, I do talk about the things that happen in the movie. <br /> <br /> **** Possible Spoilers **** Be Forewarned! **** <br /> <br /> His life is "big movements" versus "small movements". He chooses Natalia to be his queen, and he and she behave as his aunt described the king and queen and their movements when she introduced him to chess when he was a child. Listen carefully to that description. <br /> <br /> When someone asks you a question, you answer the past as if you were reviewing past movements. (By the way, the flashbacks are beautifully lit). The flashbacks are also quite interesting, since they not only give their point of view as a child, but also the point of view of the other character. Is awesome. <br /> <br /> Several characters become their helpers or enemies, pawns, bishops and knights, their actions illuminate you as to who is on the side. Even its location in a scene is fundamental to understanding what is happening. Very well done. <br /> <br /> I will not comment more on what happens to Luhzin's character, but I hope this illuminates what is really happening at the end. <br /> <br /> This movie is constantly working on many levels, so I endorse it. It was a pleasure and a joy to see it. <br /> <br /> If you like this movie, I would recommend a movie called Fresh. The only way these films are similar is the use of chess and the characters that are treated as pieces. <br /> <br />
