Forget that this is a "B" movie. Forget that it is in many ways outdated. Instead, it deserves the writer and director Ida Lupino deserved recognition for addressing a topic that at that time (1950) was a taboo in Hollywood. As far as I know, this was the first film that addressed the issue of rape and the emotional and mental effects that crime has on its victims. <br /> <br /> Although much of the performance of the cast is, at best, pedestrian, Mala Powers, which at that time was eighteen or nineteen years old, gives an excellent performance all the time as the traumatized young woman, Ann, who tries to flee from her "shame". Based on her work in this film, I am surprised that she has not had a career as a more successful actress. Tod Andrews also has some good times as the minister who comes to help her. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Lupino, obviously working with a limited budget, was still able to create some memorable scenes like the search through the streets and alleys that lead to the rape, and the police lineup that follows her. And, she created a bittersweet ending that made me wonder if Ann could have a normal life again.
