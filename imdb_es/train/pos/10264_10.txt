I just watched the movie for the third time and enjoyed Lindsay Crouse and the rest of the cast as much as before. Each time it gets better and better. You just have to marvel at the carefully measured way of speaking, the slow and deliberate action, everything is exactly in place. <br /> <br /> Truly one of the greatest and definitely my favorite of all time!
