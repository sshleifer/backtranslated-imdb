['As a comic book reader, who still sees myself as a total child at heart, I admit that I might have been a bit skewed towards this movie. I mean, there has not been a good superhero movie for quite some time now (NOTE: Batman Forever was NOT a good superhero movie). I really wanted this movie to be good and, unlike most of my recent trips to the movies (read Blair Witch Project), I was not disappointed. <br /><br /> Mystery Men was definitely not an action movie full of tension and great effect, it was a comedy. And on that basis, it was a success. He had everyone in the little theater laughing, and they received applause and laughter in the final scene. Stiller and Garofolo are fun together, as always, and Azaria adds the right touch of madness. William H. Macy plays a great heterosexual man, while Kel Mitchell and Paul Rubens join to keep children happy. <br /><br /> Although the sets are strange (and sometimes they seem to be both Batman and Blade Runner scams), and some of the jokes are obvious, it&#39;s still just funny. There are some lines that will catch even the most tired spectator off guard, and they will bring tears to those who laugh among us. <br /><br /> I definitely recommend this movie. Although it&#39;s not an all-time classic, it&#39;s twice as fun as the last retread of Austin Powers. The writing is good, and the cast is BIG. If you are worried, make plans for the registration session and pay less, but in any case you will be pleasantly surprised. I mean, who of us does not support the losers from time to time?']
