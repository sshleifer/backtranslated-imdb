After listening repeatedly to the soundtrack of the CD, I knew I wanted this movie, I got it for Christmas and it surprised me. Marc Bolan had such a charisma, I can not describe it. I had heard about him that way, but I did not understand what people talked about until I was in the company of this video. He was amazing The Wembley concert clips are interspersed with surrealist sketches like the nuns who stuff themselves at a garden party while Marc Bolan plays some acoustic versions of Get It On, etc. (I'm still learning the titles of the songs). George Claydon, the diminutive photographer of Magical Mystery Tour, plays a driver who jumps out of a car and eats one of the side mirrors. Nothing I can say to describe it would spoil it, although I put the spoilers' disclaimer in this review, so I would only need to see this for yourselves. Evade the description. <br /> <br /> Yes, I love the Beatles and I was curious about Ringo directing a rock documentary, that was 35 years ago, now, I finally discover that he has been on DVD for 2 years, but finally he is in my home . It's an incredible visual experience, even fascinating. <br /> <br /> Now the DVD comes with hidden extras and the following is a copy and paste of another user: <br /> <br /> There are two hidden extras in the double release of Born To Boogie DVD. <br /> <br /> 1.From the menu of the disc one, select the extra material and go to the additional scenes 2. In the page of extra scenes go to scene 42, take 1 and continue pressing to the left 3 When the cursor disappears, keep pressing until the logo "Star + 1972" appears 4. Press Enter <br /> <br /> 5.From the main menu of the disc two, select the sound options 6. On the page of sound options, go to 90/25 (I think it is on the right) and hold down the left button 7. When the cursor disappears, press and hold the right button until the "Star + Home video" logo appears 8. Press Enter
