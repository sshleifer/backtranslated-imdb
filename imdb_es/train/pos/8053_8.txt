['This is one of the great comedy films of Sammo. This is not a parody of entering the dragon, the main character (Sammo) is obsessed with Bruce Lee and emulates it extravagantly for a man of his size. Nominal story about how their struggle continues to cause problems for their loved ones, and then to fight. Oh, the fight. Good fast-paced scenes with high impact (the white man who plays with a boxer looks like he really feels hurt by one of Sammo&#39;s kicks). <br /><br /> The funniest part of this movie was purely involuntary. There&#39;s a guy looking like Jim Kelly (one of the three experts hired to get Sammo out), but he was a Chinese guy with a black face and an afro wig. Come on, did not they have real black people in Hong Kong in 1978? Well, I think I&#39;ve also seen a lot of &quot;Chinese people&quot; as false as hell in the old American movies. <br /><br /> This is one is for any fan of Sammo or Bruce Lee.']
