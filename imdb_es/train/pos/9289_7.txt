In BARBARIAN AND THE GEISHA, John Wayne plays Townsend Harris, a true envoy from the United States who was responsible for truly opening Japan to international relations in the late 1850s. Before him, Commodore Perry basically entered Japan with warships and forced a treaty on the Japanese in 1853. Harris, who arrived shortly after, reviewed the details and helped ensure compliance, since many of the Japanese felt no particular inclination to Honor the first treaty. All this is true and shown in the movie. According to some other sources that I found, the romance between Harris and a Japanese geisha is mostly fiction and this romance is the focus of this film (hence the title). <br /> <br /> My first reaction is the first time I saw this movie was one of the surprises. John Wayne as a diplomat? When he is being a diplomat in most movies, he says that please and thank you, how he hits people! Therefore, watching him play against a man who is NOT a man of action and who is able to play the diplomatic game seems really very strange. In fact, I can not think of too many actors in 1958 that would have been more unusual for this role. By the way, I've seen pictures of Harris and Wayne practically does not look anything like him. <br /> <br /> However, even though the story took many liberties with the truth and the strange casting, the film is still very observable. Color cinematography is nice, the film shows some nice ideas about Japanese customs and culture and the acting is not bad. In short, a nice and visible film despite its strange casting. <br /> <br /> PS: read the questions in this movie. Discover a little more about the real-life characters, as well as a supposed fight between Wayne and the director (John Huston) where apparently Wayne knocked him out! According to what I've read about Huston and the way he got along with the actors, this is an incident that I tend to believe. And, it is also a good example of John Wayne's "diplomacy".
