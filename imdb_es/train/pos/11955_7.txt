['Allow yourself to be transported to a different kind of old school narrative. Scoop is Woody Allen&#39;s classic. <br /><br /> Allen&#39;s latest muse, Scarlett Johansson (who also appeared in last year&#39;s Match Point, also Allen&#39;s), is surprisingly able to tone down her sexy sex kitten appeal and transform into a normal-looking student type with the help of nerdish goggles and costumes, but still fails to make the public believe how the stately character of Hugh Jackman can be so in love with her, given the real background (do not worry, here there are no spoilers). Here there are no great transformations for the character of Johansson, since she always plays the same character even though the script says otherwise. You even forgive her character&#39;s apparent lack of logic, continuing a romance with an alleged serial killer, simply because it&#39;s Her Royal Hotness Jackman, who is cooling off to see the Wolverine fans. <br /><br /> In any case, consistency is what the 70-year-old Allen is about. He continues to tell his stories about celluloid in the same way he has always done; as if he had never been exposed to modern cinema, which is probably what makes his quiet and simple films attractive. It seems that they never point to a specific market; as if Allen made movies to his liking alone, whether the public likes it or not.']
