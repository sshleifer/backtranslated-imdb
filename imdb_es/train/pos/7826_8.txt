Presented as the story of Steve Biko, played excellently by Denzel Washington, as expected, it was actually more the story of Donald Woods, played by Kevin Kline. <br /> <br /> This was undoubtedly the creation of Kline as a serious actor, and he was surprisingly good at the role. <br /> <br /> Attenborough gave this the kind of direction you would expect, and the often spectacular scenes of the masses were the kind that only he can convey it. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast was competent enough and did a good job, in what ends up being a sad story of a South Africa that is not yet close to the distant past.
