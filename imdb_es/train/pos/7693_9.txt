"GOOD TIMES", in my opinion, is a CBS hit that must be seen! Even though I've never seen all the episodes, I still enjoy it. It's hard to say which one is my favorite. Also, I really love the theme song. If you ask me, even though I like them all, it would have been good if everyone had stayed on the program throughout his career. They all always gave a good performance, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well designed and the writing was always very strong. In conclusion, although now it can be seen on TV Land, I recommend you catch it in case it gets out of the air forever.
