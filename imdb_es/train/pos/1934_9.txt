I watched The Big Bad Swim at the 2006 Temecula Film Festival, and I was surprised at the amount that attracted me. <br /> <br /> The film focuses on the lives of a group of people who take an adult. Swimming class for several reasons. A humorous idea in itself, the class serves as a catalyst for greater changes in the lives of students. <br /> <br /> What surprised me about the movie was how real it felt. Rarely in the pieces of the set the characters are treated so well. I enjoyed the scenes immensely in the class, and the drama that took place outside was very moving. Nothing seemed out of place or out of place, and in the end it left a very strong feeling, much like going to school or summer camp, where you find fast friends, make strong connections and make discoveries about yourself, but you have to leave too soon. . <br /> <br /> My only complaint was that Paula's character had a very strong and unusual introduction, which made you want to know a little more about her than what was finally revealed. I guess you can not meet everyone in class, though ... <br /> <br /> Apart from this, the film seemed very complete and enjoyable. See it if you have the opportunity.
