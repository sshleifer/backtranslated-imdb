I love the way this game can literally make you jump out of your seat while you play it. The way the screen jumps and flickers when they hit you is very realistic and at the same time you must remember that it is just a game and you are not there. The sound effects and the audio are incredible. There are many different weapons and spells to cast, and you can even choose which spells you want to make stronger or not. You get this stone that can knock down enemies while you recover mana to destroy your enemies with even more magic. The best part is that all the time you play, you are very nervous and afraid of what might be lurking in the next corner or what might jump behind you. If you want to get the full experience, try playing with headphones on.
