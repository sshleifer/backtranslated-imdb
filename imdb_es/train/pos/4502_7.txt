I have seen virtually all of Cynthia Rothrock's films, and for me this is the most fun. It reminds me of the first Jackie Chan movies. It is true that Mrs. Rothrock may not be the best actress, but she is very good at seeing her as a martial artist and as a very pretty young woman. This film, although probably not the best of all his films, was the most entertaining.
