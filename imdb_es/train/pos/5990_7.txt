['I do not have much to add to what has been said before, but it is a movie of its time, and the first (and probably the only) time that the studio completely hung the movie in Dead End Kids. <br /><br /> The Warner&#39;s gave the kids a lot of help, from director Ray Enright and an &#39;A&#39; budget, to an almost magical cast of supporting actors. At each step, we obtain one of those gems of true professionals. They are too many to list, but it seems that almost everyone in the Warner lot (Sans the biggest stars) walks through this image. (See if you can find John Ridgely) <br /><br /> The only superior performance is that of the always reliable Eduardo Cianelli as head of the Mafia with a Messianic complex. He plays this character almost exactly like that of the Thuggie leader in &quot;Gunga Din.&quot; It&#39;s something to look at! And Marjorie Main is excellent and gets her best role from &quot;Dead End&quot;. <br /><br /> My offer for this is a second feature in a double bill with something like &quot;City for conquest&quot;. <br /><br /> Hurray for Warners!']
