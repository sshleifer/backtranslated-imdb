I'm going to be short enough to not spoil anything for you. This movie is incredible. From beginning to end, it is full of genuine emotions. The fight scenes are fantastic, the chase scenes are fascinating and they move at such a pace that in reality it just felt slow towards the end when things are explained, but that's only because everything that preceded it. Damon shines and has really proved to be a very solid actor, challenging himself not to believe him in this role. He is this role. A welcome addition to the series in David Straithrain (I hope I wrote as close to the right) as a shabby CIA agent to kill Bourne. This is non-stop and will really leave you on the edge of your seat for most of the way. Some things towards the end are just an absurd smidgeon, thus denying a score of 10. The end is open for the sequels and I hope you consider doing more of this, because none has been bad. Excellent film in general and a fantastic ending to an incredible trilogy. <br /> <br /> P.S. The unstable camera did not affect anything of the action, but I still think we could do without it. The good news is that you only notice when people are talking and not so much action.
