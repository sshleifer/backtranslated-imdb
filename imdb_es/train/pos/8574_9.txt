Huge fun for both adults and children, this film works on many levels: there is everything from car accidents and cake on the face to some very good (albeit subtle) jokes for adults. <br /> <br /> Glenn Close is in his sublime wickedness as Cruella ("call me Ella") De Ville. <br /> <br /> After three years at Dr. Pavlov's Behavior Modification Clinic, is she cured of her desire for skin? even the puppy skin that he had wanted so much. He even has all his fur coats placed in the dungeon of the extraordinary castle he inhabits. <br /> <br /> But it would not be a "Dalmatian" movie without the subterfuge and machinations of Cruella, and you know that Something will change your behavior modification. And now she needs an extra puppy (therefore, 102 Dalmatians) to complete her evil scheme this time. <br /> <br /> Ioan Gruffudd is instantly attractive as the hero of the film that runs the dog shelter "Second Chance". Although I was on 'Titanic' and on the television version of last year (like Pip) of 'Great Expectations' I did not recognize it; Well, he was the "Fifth Officer Lowe" in "Titanic" and I did not see "Great expectations", so I'm not terribly surprised. <br /> <br /> Gerard Depardieu makes a charming turn when cruella's furry pawn. Do you mock and pose with the most extravagant and outrageous leather clothes you've ever seen? and he does it well. His tribute to 'Wicked Witch of the West' is hilarious. <br /> <br /> Tim McInnerny is superb, is not Cruella's henchman so bad? it was also Alonzo, Cruella's butler, in "101 Dalmatians," and you may also recognize him for all the Brit Comics. He plays his usual awkward, good-hearted and somewhat silly character with great effect. <br /> <br /> Oscars for costumes are usually given for the entire costumes in a movie. This is unfortunate since the clothing worn by Glenn Close is amazing. It is incredibly detailed (consider your wives when you leave the Behavior Modification Clinic) and is worthy of such an exaggerated character. Only his clothes deserve at least an Oscar nomination. <br /> <br /> Does animation have a special place in my heart? But comparing this movie with the original animated film is like comparing apples with orangutans: it can not be done. Suffice it to say that "102 Dalmatians" is even better than the film version of "101 Dalmatians" that came out in 1996. There's a lot to like here: from the looks, the dialogue and the costumes to the casting. It's a good movie for the whole family.
