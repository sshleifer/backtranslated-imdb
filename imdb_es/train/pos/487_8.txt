A film of outstanding brilliance and a touching and unusual love story, the Luzhin Defense describes the intense attraction between an eccentric genius and a woman of beauty, depth and character. <br /> <br /> He gives John Turturro what is probably his best role to date (thank God they did not give it to Ralph Fiennes, who would have killed him). In the same way, Emily Watson shows the richness of her experience (from her outstanding experience on stage). To reach the tortured chess master (Turturro), your character has to show intelligence and the love of a woman. Watson does not portray the sexuality of a beauty contest, but she brings to her parts an awareness of herself that is attractive. <br /> <br /> In a casual encounter between Natalia (Watson) and Luzhin, she casually prevents him from losing a piece of chess that has fallen through a hole in his clothes, a specially designed piece that, we realize Later in the film, it has come to symbolize their hopes and aspirations. Later, as her love relationship develops, she subtly compares dance with chess (Luzhin has learned to dance but never with a partner); She encourages him to guide her with "bold and brilliant movements" and, in doing so, allows him to relax enough to then play in the best way (and also to realize himself as his lover). <br /> <br /> This is a story of a woman who inspires a man to her greatest achievement and, in doing so, finds her satisfaction more deeply, emotionally and intellectually (or that leads us to believe, indeed, within the time frame, Natalia is something like a liberated woman instead of someone preparing to be a wife and a stereotyped mother). <br /> <br /> The Italian sets are impressive. The complexity of the characters and the skill with which the dialogue unfolds is a delight for the intelligent viewer, however, the film is accessible enough to make it a popular popular success, and deservedly so. Chess is simply the photogenic backdrop to develop an emotive and emotional film, although the game is treated with enough respect to almost convince a chess player that the characters existed. Although it is a tragedy of remarkable heights by a classical author, the final outcome is surprisingly encouraging.
