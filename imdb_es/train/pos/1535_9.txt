Fortunately, as a student, I have been able to see "Diagnosis of murder" for several years. It is basically a doctor who solves murders with the help of his son of the Los Angeles police, a young doctor and a pathologist. DM provided 8 seasons of exceptional entertainment. What made it different from the many other police shows and that is worth seeing many times was its cast and writing quality. The main cast gave good performances and the roots of the Dick Van Dyke artists shined through the use of magic, dance and humor. The best aspects of the DM were the fast pace, the ingenious scripts and, of course, the touch score of the toe. Regrettably, it has been unfairly compared to "Murder, She Wrote". DM is far superior with more difficult mysteries to solve and more variety. Now it's gone TV is a worse place. Gone are the days of the Feelgood police and family shows. Now there are only a few "sandy" depressing.
