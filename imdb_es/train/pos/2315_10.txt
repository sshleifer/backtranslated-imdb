There is so much value in this movie that it is difficult to know where to start with the praise. Let me begin by expressing my admiration for a perfect representation of Reese Witherspoon. That his performance stands out in the excellent cast is a praise indeed. Robert Mulligan has rarely disappointed those of us who have admired his work. Each frame of The Man on the Moon is evidence of film making at its best.
