Spoilers! <br /> <br /> From the moment I saw a local film critic trashing this film in a review of the 10:00 news, I wanted to see it. I do not remember who he was, nor what Omaha local newscast published the review, but the critic insisted that this movie was too bad for the Nebraskan average who attends church. They showed a fragment of the scene where John Glover is about to kidnap Ann-Margret when she is swimming in the pool. The character of Glover is congratulating her on how beautiful her body and so on are, using many words that the local station felt was necessary to edit. I got hooked. However, there was a problem. I was only 13 years old at the time, and I had to wait a year until it went cable. Let's say it was worth the wait! <br /> <br /> If there was ever a guilty pleasure of mine, this is the movie. Calling this film sordid would be a great understatement. The film centers around a successful businessman who is blackmailed by three little bastards after an affair with a young woman. Roy Scheider, who is as effective as ever, plays the poor man who just wanted a little adventure and now finds himself at the mercy of three terrible villains. The character of John Glover is one of the most memorable hairs of all time. It's sordid, sometimes funny, and always about to do something crazy. Then there is the character of Robert Trebor (nice name, by the way!), Leo, who is clearly outclassed with his scheme of blackmail. He is a coward, sweaty, coward who runs a peep show place with live nude models. Then you have Clarence Williams III as Bobby Shy, a melancholic sociopath who everyone fears for a good reason. Who could forget the wake-up call he gives to Vanity with the giant teddy bear? <br /> <br /> After dealing with the initial shock of realizing what he is facing, Scheider turns the tables on these chills and takes control of the situation, that is until Glover goes after his wife! The conflict develops brutally, with virtually all the cast being shot, raped or exploited. <br /> <br /> I do not know why I love this movie so much. I really should be scared, but it does not. Maybe it's because all these characters are interesting, and the story has many possibilities that most movies today never try. It's scary to think that the adult film industry probably has more than a few characters, like Glover, who walks around in L.A. in search of problems. Just thinking about his voice is enough to make me laugh. "Hey, sport, have a nice day!" <br /> <br /> This movie has lots of shootings, great cars, a great dialogue (like the line in my initial statement) and a decent performance. Lots of cameos from real-life porn stars. Find Ron Jeremy having fun in a hot tub with two girls in a party scene at Glover's house. <br /> <br /> Another thing that I should add: How attractive are the women in this movie? Woohoo! Travolta did the right thing by marrying Kelly Preston. Yum We also see that Vanity strips naked in a moment before she becomes a born-again Christian. And Ann-Margret. What else could you say about her, except that she is the quintessential American beauty? <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> That's what the bloodhound says. <br /> <br /> Added on February 14, 2008: RIP Roy Scheider!
