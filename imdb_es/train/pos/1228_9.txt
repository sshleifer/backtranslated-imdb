This 1991 NBC-TV movie aired six months before the big-screen version of John Goodman on the life of Babe Ruth. For my money, there is no comparison between the two. Television production is not perfect, but it presents Babe's story with more depth and complexity than Goodman's one-dimensional narrative. I especially enjoyed the film's description of the complex relationship of love and hate that Ruth had with Yankees manager Miller Huggins, who always understood the brilliance of his star player and also tried to point out why Ruth's own character fails. would never allow him to become a manager or leader of players The television movie correctly points out that Ruth never fulfilled his dream of managing the Yankees because of his failures, while the horrible version of Goodman tries to highlight the falsehood that Ruth was denied That should have been for him. <br /> <br /> This movie is a great companion piece for "Eight Men Out", as the story begins with Ruth's arrival in New York in 1920, a year after the Black Sox scandal and when his exploits of home runs literally saved baseball from ruin. In fact, the continuity between the two films is accentuated even when John Anderson repeats his role as "Eight Men Out" as Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis.
