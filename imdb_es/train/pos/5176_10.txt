A movie that must be seen for anyone who has gone to the camp, or wanted. This film captures the absolute essence of what summer camp is about. It's funny, it's compassionate and it makes you want to see more about the characters once the credits start playing. If you have not seen this movie ... what are you doing? Get off your ass and run the video store. Have an excellent summer :)
