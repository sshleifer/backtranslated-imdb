['The House of the Spirits is an exciting story of family intrigue, South American politics and supernatural powers. Meryl Streep, Glenn Close and Jeremy Irons give life to the novel by Isabel Allende with all her passion and suspense. This, in my opinion, is one of the best films of the nineties. Jeremy Irons, as Esteban Trueba ages and softens very credibly, while Meryl Streep in the role of Clara maintains his warm and friendly warmth throughout his relatively short life. Winona Ryder and Antonio Banderas are a beautiful couple who fight for family acceptance in a racist culture. Glenn Close, as Esteban&#39;s sister, gives a very moving performance. The field of Portugal is a reasonable substitute for a non-tropical Latin American country. The adjustments of Clara&#39;s house and Esteban&#39;s ranch are effective and the period in which the cars of the USA. UU They add to the postwar atmosphere.']
