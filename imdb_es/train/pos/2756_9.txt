I picked up this movie based on the plot summary and the critics' quotes on the back of the box. I do not like foreign films very much, and I did not know what to expect. I do not care about the subtitles either. But I loved it! It has a simple and friendly quality that makes you feel good with life. I found myself laughing out loud repeatedly. I would recommend this image to anyone, even those who abhor foreign films with subtitles. This makes it worth the effort.
