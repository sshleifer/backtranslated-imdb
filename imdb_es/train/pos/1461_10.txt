The film exposes the flagrant exploitation of the Chinese worker, usually female, who obtains images of the Chinese businessman who shares his point of view without shame and delirium, his American counterpart also as without shame and delirium, the oppressed workers who have a voice and, of course . , the American drunks who wear the necklaces of beads they hold without thinking of New Orleans. <br /> <br /> The brightness of hope comes when some Americans are really outraged that people who make their bill necklaces get paid as much as $ 0.10 per hour to do it. He also has the feeling that workers may have the opportunity to escape from work in the accounts factory, but they will probably do so when they get fed up with the popular punishment treatment with the factory owner and / or simply exhaust themselves too much to work. At 20 hours per day of forced labor. <br /> <br /> I have asked myself where these necklaces come from, without realizing how exhausting and arduous it would be to make them. I really appreciate this film, because it beautifully portrays the impact that the American indulgence has on something that we consider relatively innocuous in our society in the towns on the other side of the world. Honorable mention for Wal-Mart. It is simply amazing. And of course, only the tip of the iceberg!
