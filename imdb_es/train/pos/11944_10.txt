I was going to give him an 8, but since you made 6.5 of the votes much better, I had to increase my contribution. The Styx River was pure genius. Sure, Woody was his perennial, but at least his role was appropriate. The first half hour was very fun, and then it was easy to see the rest of the movie. The dialogue was smart enough, and Woody's card tricks at parties, along with the reaction of the upper cortex, were fun to watch. This was much better than what newspaper critics made it look like. And a point in favor, a little apprentice sorcerer to agree. And, of course, did you notice that Johansen is getting a little cranky? Charles Dance is always entertaining, as was Hugh Jackman.
