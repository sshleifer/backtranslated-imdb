Every time I see this movie, I am more impressed by the whole production. I came to the conclusion that it is the best romantic comedy ever made. Everyone involved is perfect; Script, acting, direction, sets and editing. While you can always rely on James Stewart for a good performance, and the cast is magnificent, it's Margaret Sullavan who reveals what an underestimated actress was. His tragic personal life gives great importance to his qualities as an interpreter where comedy skills are not easy to achieve. Lubitsch managed to get the best and obviously gave the best of himself. Observe the number of scenes that were taken in one shot: impressive.
