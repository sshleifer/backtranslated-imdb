What can I say about it? It is another Hollywood horror movie with a very high budget (80 million dollars). It is not scary at all, it offers us only some emotions and a really spooky sequence with the skeleton in the fireplace. A lot of computer generated special effects and nothing else. Catherine Zeta-Jones is beautiful as always, Lili Taylor is also a good actress. The architecture of Hill House is amazing, all these monuments, statues, furniture ... Delicious! However, I do not like the ending because it was so exquisite. Check this and create your own opinion about it. I give this image 7 out of 10.
