Having recently finished Cronicles of the Heroic Knight a few minutes ago, I am extremely grateful, but the questions still hover over me. While it seems that the first 7 episodes are more or less a recount of the events of the first Lodoss War Log, the truth is that they really are not. It seems that the creator of CotHK had a different view of how the original ended (and that may be the reason why the first 7 episodes occur), but I do not think that is the case. CotHK says it starts 5 years after the War of Heroes of which Parn was a part. I think the director made the first 5 episodes look so much like a summary of the original, just to give the viewer a little reminder and an introduction to the characters and their deeds, since they appear much less after the series begins the story of Spark. Now, once the series is in Spark's part, we find ourselves with another 10 years (15 years since the War of the Heros). Spark and his team resemble, in some cases, Parn and his team once the trip gets under way, especially the love story that develops between Spark and Neese. I also thought several times throughout CotHK that I launched the original series and, if it were not for Spark's long blue hair, I know I would have pressed to stop more than once to make sure that there was the right disc. I do not do it in any way. Consider these big setbacks, however, the writers did a good job in creating credible characters and an extraordinary story. The only thing that hurts me is that Ashram and Wagnard come back. Ummmm ... how? Do not get me wrong, both are great villains, although the only villainous feature of Ashram is that it supports the Marmo. Maybe I missed something during the rudeness of the series that explained that part. Regarding the aftermath, however, I highly recommend CotHK. I put both CotHK and, even more, the original Lodoss War Record well above the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Both are more epic than anything I've seen or read. I highly recommend it
