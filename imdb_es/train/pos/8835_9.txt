A sharp political commentary that arises as a story of coming of age is what this movie is. The annoying thing is that it works effectively on both levels. He is not supposed to do it but he does it. This story of four children and a girl who grew up in 1953, the Belgrade Communist, is a warmer heart. It's what the gentlemen call classical cinema. Obviously, 1953 Belgrade is not a dictatorial and fascist environment as severe as communist society is often portrayed. One can listen to rock and roll music, one of the songs played is the song "Hey Babu Riba" and the title of the movie. But jeans can not be bought or certain drugs that are illegal to own. Unlike the heavy criticism of a communist society, this film does so by showing how it affects the lives of the five protagonists who refer to themselves as the four. The girl who has a father in exile in Italy and is waiting for a passport for her mother and she will travel to meet him, the piano that is taken away from the communist of one of the children, the sudden delivery of his home and lodging. To your new colleagues because they need it. The boys spend a lot of time listening to music and it is clear that they despise the fascism that communism has created by participating in a fight with a fascist charlatan who has Stalin tattooed in his hands. All this leads to the actions that take later and to the memory of a time that vanishes, since this film premiered in 1986 in the twilight of the Soviet Empire. A great movie that is worth seeing again and again. "Repentance is not your enemy, but neither is anyone's friend."
