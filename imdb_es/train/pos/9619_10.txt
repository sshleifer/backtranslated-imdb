Okay, a 10 for a 2 1/2 star movie that you order? ... well, look at this and maybe it makes more sense ... Hitchcock never combined the scenes better ... The film weaves the scenes without problems from the beginning and yet, you do not have that scattered feeling that you sometimes have when a movie It shows you the many characters that you are trying to develop. You feel that the characters will show you something unusual about themselves and then they will not disappoint you when they do. The surreal story of the life of screenwriter / producer Phil Hay, mixed with an absolutely extraordinary soundtrack, makes you think more about the 6 degrees of separation in life than in the movie with the same title ... I'll look for more good things this producer in the future.
