I would say it's time for this movie to be amazing ... and yes, if you do not want to become a Christian, then why bother seeing it? I saw this movie after it had already been saved and it seemed very moving to me. Now I see that they have taken these films to another level and have created the series Left Behind ... they execute a close comparison and they are definitely more modern to reach people. I think to really judge this movie, you should see it, there are 3 or 4 of them in the series if I'm not wrong ... do not use our comments to judge, watch the movie for yourself! ! God will bless you if that is why you are seeing them.
