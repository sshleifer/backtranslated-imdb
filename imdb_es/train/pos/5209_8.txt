I saw this important intense movie tonight. It is the most important and best work of Richard Gere and Claire's Dane. Gere deserves an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of a man who was forced to retire early as a registry administrator for sex offenders. Claire Danes is fascinated as the woman that Gere selected with her hands to replace him: a woman who tries to teach everything she can while investigating a final case in which the character of Gere is convinced that one of the people to whom is responsible for monitoring can be retaining a young woman. The issue is shocking, sex offenders and those who monitor them, but this movie will not be forgotten soon. I know that I will be obsessed with the representation of Gere for a long time. Not since Anthony Hopkins' portrait of a serial killer has a terrified screen portrait and that's why I got hooked. The movie starts with a shocking statistic, so do not miss the opening credits. Intense and memorable. The best role of Richard Gere is to show that man can act. The Danes can do it too, and both do extraordinarily well in this often challenging film. <br /> <br /> This is a brave movie and Gere offers a very meaningful multilayer performance. Just give him the Oscar now ... he deserves it!
