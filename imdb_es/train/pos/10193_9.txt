This review is dedicated to the latest Keith Moon and John Entwistle. <br /> <br /> The Original Drum and Bass. <br /> <br /> It seems that there is very little time of Who images these days, if there is more than what is happening, nowadays it tends to be of a very different kind from Who, together , a parody, a shadow of his (much) better years. To be fair, none of them has to prove anything to anyone else, they have earned their respect and with overtime. <br /> <br /> This concert material for me is one of the best. Directing an audience of more than 400,000 people with great capacity for singing, skill, charisma, wit and great music. <br /> <br /> We all know about the other acts on the poster, The Doors (their last never weeks before Jim Morrison died), Moody Blues, Hendrix, Taste, Free and many more. The point is that whoever was there was The Who whom the majority had come to see. This show was a year after the Great Hippie Festival of the 1960s; Woodstock. The movie and the album had come out and also The Who's best work to date, Tommy. The always hungry crowd wanted to try, to experience their own unique event, to be able to "Grove and Love" knowing that this concert was theirs. To do this, he needed the best of what Rock 'n Roll had to throw at the hungry bait crowd. <br /> <br /> At two o'clock in the morning at the end of August 1970, the MCC. announces, "Ladies and gentlemen, a little rock band 'n Roll by Shepherds Bush London, the' OO. ' <br /> <br /> John Entwistle's suit is black leather, on the front is the outer line of a human skeleton from neck to toe, Roger dressed in his traditional stage costume with long tassel and hair long and loose, Keith in a white shirt and jeans, since Pete had his white boiler suit and Doc Martins that he had preferred to wear. <br /> <br /> The Who never stopped his High Energy Rock attack for more than two hours, playing the best songs of his and other artists like Young Man Blues, Shaking 'all Over, and then in the queue , Keith baits the chant of "Shut up, it's a bleeding opera" with Tommy, the Rock Opera. The song became wild. This is what they had come to hear, and the Who did not disappoint, directly to Overture and never left to take a breath until the final note of "Tommy, can you hear me?" Amazing. <br /> <br /> To capture a show of this magnitude from a band of this size at its peak in a Festival that was to be the last of its kind anywhere in the world, it was a fantastic piece of Cinematic History. <br /> <br /> The English DVD only comes in an English / Linear PCM Stereo soundtrack, like in the United States, I think you can get at least 5.1, "Check the local press for more details?" in that, it's fine. <br /> <br /> The duration of the DVD is 85 minutes without extras, which is a disappointment. Yes, for a fragment of Rock and Festival History, this DVD will send you on a journey of nostalgia along the path of memory at the moment you press Play, to see some of the best images of the Who concert, as they should be, Live, Raw and in your face. ! <br /> <br /> I would have given this DVD ten if it were not for the lack of 5.1, and some extras would have been fine. <br /> <br /> Thanks Roger, Pete, John and Keith.
