Dark Angel is a futuristic science fiction series, set in post-apocalyptic Seattle, centered on Max (Jessica Alba), a young genetically improved woman, who flees from her creators. <br /> <br /> The universe of Dark Angel is absorbing (not as much as we say Buffy, but it absorbs) with an interesting and credible set of characters. Certainly, it is not for everyone, but those who give it time will find themselves watching one of the funniest series that exist. Dark Angel is criminally overlooked, and underestimated, and was unfortunately canceled after only 2 series. What was a great shame, since it had the potential to become a great series, although its 42 episodes are only 10 shy of the BBC sci-fi comedy Red Dwarf. As it is that Dark Angel remains unfinished, look for it, and if you want more, press Fox to make another series.
