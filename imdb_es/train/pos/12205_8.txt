['After CITIZEN KANE in 1941, Hollywood executives turned their backs on the great Orson Welles. With the exception of KANE, Welles lost all creative control of AMBERSONS MAGNÍFICOS, JOURNEY INTO FEAR and many other films to come. Welles was an innovative and creative genius, the most unconventional filmmaker when Hollywood needed some more. THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI is another example of the misunderstood vision of Welles&#39;s films at that time, a film that seems a little choppy and fluent. It has a conventional premise of 1940 told in a very unconventional way, and I am sure that some scenes ended up on the floor of the cutting room. Now it&#39;s a legend that Columbia mogul Harry Cohn stood up during his initial screening and asked what it was all about. In retrospect, many old grunts that ran through the studios at the time did not have a single clue as to the cinematographic techniques and storytelling of Orson Welles and THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI, which is only almost great because of its intrusion . <br /><br /> In addition to possibly being the best director of all time, Welles was also a great actor as an actor. At age 25, we all know what he did as &quot;Charles Foster Kane,&quot; perhaps the most famous character in film history. Here, he inhabits a rare character of tenuous intelligence and low intelligence, something that is unfamiliar to those who are familiar with Welles&#39;s other great work. Instead of a wise and skillful language, it speaks with a rough Irish timbre. Rita Hayworth (his unhappily married wife at the time) plays an unhappily married wife of a lawyer who puts Welles in a spell and can take him to a job that will take him to the limits of deception and disappointment. It&#39;s a great taco that may have even killed a man, but the real mystery lies in the relationship between Hayworth (with dazzling blond hair) and her crippled husband Everett Sloane (Mr. Bernstein of CITIZEN KANE). A scary companion of Sloane&#39;s is sailing around the country to unleash a series of peculiar events that turn the head of Welles&#39; &quot;Michael O&#39;Hara&quot;. Welles narrates the image as O&#39;Hara, but things are still unclear. Check it yourself and understand that you need at least 2 visits to know exactly what is happening. <br /><br /> A strangely strange sequence of the court centers around &quot;O&#39;Hara&quot;, with Sloane defending him. It&#39;s a strangely comical scene with some extravagant methods in the courtroom, including Sloane&#39;s cross examination. I really did not laugh here because the film stops at this point after a first part that can never take off anyway. Up to this point, the cinematography is excellent, some scenes are recorded with skill and dexterity (aquarium love scene), but there is no different line that draws the elements and we, the audience, in. Reportedly, the court scene was re-recorded. against the requests of Welles (ten close-ups of Hayworth were ordered) and an improvised song sung by the star was launched at the insistence of Cohn. A striking score infuriated Welles, who, once again, was left out of the editing process. Thank Welles himself for saving the film completely with a tour-de-force ending that will always be treasured. The so-called &quot;Hall of Mirrors&quot; scene brings the fans back again and again, rightly so. <br /><br /> You have to see it to believe it and do a good job summarizing some confusing ideas presented. The clash of the mirrors represents the disappointment of &quot;O&#39;Hara&quot; and the &quot;crazy house&quot; in itself is a masterpiece of art and stage decoration. It seems more like a mental state than a real place and in fact it is &quot;crazy&quot;, twisted and twisted like a painting by Dalí. This is a great end to a faulty image that, if left alone, would probably have reached the Top 100 of the AFI. On the other hand, 3 or 4 more of Orson Welles&#39;s films may have made all the &quot;best&quot; collective lists if he had been left alone. Create your own magic <br /><br /> NOTE: Look for the mercury players that are so prominent in Welles&#39; photos. They appear everywhere. GRADING: 8 out of 10']
