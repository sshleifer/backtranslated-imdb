Well, it's definitely different from anything else directed by Lynch. There are no supernatural things, no violence, no blasphemy. However, it is a beautiful movie. It's a bit slow, but maybe it was intentional because it's the story of an old man's 6-week-old trip (that's my best estimate for its duration). The characters are everyday people and therefore, they are credible. The performances are good and the final scene was incredibly moving. Everyone who has a brother can relate to him. Lyle and Alvin do not even have to say anything. For a moment they are back in the old days and the whole fight is forgotten.
