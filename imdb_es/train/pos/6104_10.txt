I must admit that, of the EROS MOVIE COLLECTION, this must be the one I love most and the one that I have also reviewed. History is something that really keeps you watching. Many of the EROS films have a plot that looks like a hammer was smashed to pieces before production when you look at it. All focused on sex, and who can see how many different people reach the end of the movie. And, oh my God, never look at one of these movies when someone pulls a gun. It does not work, it's almost ridiculous, but you do not want to spend the energy to do it. <br /> <br /> "Losing Control" is exactly how your name appears. The protagonist, the main character (the wonderfully talented and beautiful Kira Reed). Control is the control that a person has over their senses, their body and their feelings. And a man changes everything for her, almost makes her a different woman. But the mirror breaks at the same time. This makes for a great movie that I would have liked to do first! <br /> <br /> 10/10
