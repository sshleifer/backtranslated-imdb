"Ship Ahoy" was probably made to show the talent of MGM. The film is a fun trip on a transatlantic on its way to San Juan, Puerto Rico, at the time the country was involved in World War II. This was a typical meal for the studios, which gave the film light and public entertainment as a distraction during the difficult times in which the country lived. <br /> <br /> The beautiful Eleanor Powell is the best in some musical numbers. where she shows us clearly that she was a dancer to take into account. Red Skelton is also seen in a straight part, without too many clowns, while chasing the beautiful Mrs. Powell on the boat that takes them to Puerto Rico. The irresistible Bert Lahr has good opportunities in the film to prove he was a funny man. Virginia Gray is also seen as a funny girl who is not deceived by anyone. <br /> <br /> There are good musical numbers with Tommy Dorsey and his orchestra, in which one sees, among others, the amazing Buddy Rich, who has a few solos with Mr. Dorsey and Mrs. Powell. A young Frank Sinatra also appears as the lead singer of the band, backed by the Pied Pipers. <br /> <br /> This is a nostalgic trip that should be enjoyed by fans of this genre, which MGM controls completely.
