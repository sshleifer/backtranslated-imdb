This is, in my opinion, much better than either of the two versions of the 1990s, but it's still not that good. It feels old-fashioned, probably because it is, but it stays well in comparison to other pieces of the 1980 BBC, such as Mansfield Park and Northanger Abbey. <br /> <br /> The duration of this adaptation allows a much better adaptation of The Book than any of the versions of 2 90 and St John Rivers is at least covered, although not very well. Timothy Dalton is very good like Rochester, but the actress who plays Jane is too old. Definitely, there is a margin for a television adaptation of this length that has more than one tithe spent on it.
