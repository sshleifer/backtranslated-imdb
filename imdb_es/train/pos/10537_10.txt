This movie was very funny, I could not stop smiling when I saw it and I already saw it twice in a period of 2 days! The film is distinctly unique in its humor and visuals, both are great and are on par with the other (more serious) gems of Natali's films, Cube and Cypher. I have become a huge fan of Vincenzo Natali since I saw Cypher and everything he did is very interesting. <br /> <br /> Very nice about this movie are the music and the "losing" characters Dave and Andrew, played by David Hewlett and Andrew Miller (co-writer of the story), actors that I love so much. Also great are the fights of X-Box Dead Or Alive (you even see Dave playing Halo at one point) and Andrew's amazing guitar solo, among many other things. <br /> <br /> In general, an excellent movie to feel good. about friendship You gotta see This!
