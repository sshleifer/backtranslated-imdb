At first I was surprised that the main character of a television show could give life back to the dead, but then I thought I would try. Guess what? I love "Pushing Daisies" and I wait Wednesday nights just to see it, then, for next week, I see it several times more on my DVR. The colorful characters, the ingenious jokes, the accelerated dialogue and the new unique situations attract and captivate me from beginning to end. The relationship of Ned and Chuck Charles is interesting to observe as they work their romance around the fact that they can not have physical contact. Even the character of Detective Emerson Cod has continued to grow in complexity. And Olive Snook! Jiminy Crispies! She breaks me! It's fun to listen to the narrator's voice and the cinematography gives me the impression that I'm watching a movie instead of a television show. I have recommended to my relatives and friends that they activate "Pushing Daisies" and they are also hooked. The show is worth waiting a week for a new episode and if you have not seen "P.D.", I recommend you see it.
