['The psychotic transgender Bobbi murders the patient (Angie Dickinson) of a prominent doctor (Michael Caine) and then pursues the expensive prostitute (Nancy Allen) who saw Bobbi in the elevator. Liz (Allen) is under suspicion of the crime and is associated with the patient&#39;s son (Keith Gordon) to catch the killer. <br /><br /> It can be summed up in a couple of words: it&#39;s very sexy (Dickinson and Allen look great), it&#39;s very bloody, with the blood type usually reserved for splash films, and it&#39;s well designed. The screenwriter&#39;s script / director De Palma is fine, but in reality it is in the background against the cinematographic abilities of man. It is very successful viscerally and, in fact, I am involved / interested in these characters. I can notice the standard de Palma tributes to Hitchcock scams, at least one of the Master&#39;s photos. <br /><br /> And to top it off, he has a professional and credible cast. <br /><br /> This was De Palma&#39;s third film with his ex-wife Nancy Allen (after &quot;Carrie&quot; and &quot;Home Movies&quot;.) <br /><br /> By the way, the dancer turned actress Rachel Ticotin was one of the production assistants. There is a bit of trivia for you. <br /><br /> I do not think that a thriller is elegant and bloody at the same time, but this image succeeds. <br /><br /> One of the best things about this is a typically amazing Donaggio Pine music. <br /><br /> 8/10']
