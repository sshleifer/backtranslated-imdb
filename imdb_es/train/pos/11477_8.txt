['In my honest opinion, everyone should watch this movie at least once. He really put things in perspective while looking at him. Although it was fictional, this film is about something that could happen to your children. <br /><br /> It shows how easily two children can hide their hatred of their school and their plans to kill innocent students. This movie would not have worked in any other format. They took out the handheld camera, perfectly. <br /><br /> It reminds us on April 20, 1999, when Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold murdered 12 students and then themselves. It also reminds us of the media storm that followed later. Everyone wanted to see the Rampart video and everyone wanted to see the tapes in the basement. <br /><br /> This movie is a fictional version of our dreams that come true. We can see the child behind the monster. <br /><br /> The only bad thing about this movie is that it did not work well in the market, and few people know that it existed. If you had a single preview in a single successful movie, everyone would have gone to see what the big problem was, Zero Day. <br /><br /> I think this is the best film adaptation of a school shoot of the few who have really tried it. The shooting itself only takes about ten minutes of the one-and-a-half-hour film, because it focuses mainly on Cal and Andre, and what they did up to that point. <br /><br /> If you have not seen this movie yet, rent it and watch it. I guarantee that when you finish, you will be speechless.']
