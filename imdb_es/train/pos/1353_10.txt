The cast is different and now they took a different approach, we have the smart street team "Networth" vs. the supposed professional team "Magna", but, if you think that the intelligent team of the street would have problems, you would be right. While the Magna team has fought at times, the street team has simply disintegrated week after week. <br /> <br /> First, some things to reiterate to the point of "Apprentice 3" continues with the same absurd mentality (since Trump) and the game of this series: if you are a good project manager, but you lose, the team will attack you and fire you, despite the fact that your support teammates are often the ones who do half-hearted work. Simply absurd, a game program that aims to hire the best candidate actually "eliminates" the best, while dysfunctional candidates stab each other until there is one and that person is the best. lol <br /> <br /> This season, we have seen a total of offensive stereotypes, including stabbing and even homosexuals carried out while the teams are trying to campaign. <br /> <br /> The list of victims so far Elenco Tara Dowdell, Audrey Evans, Danny Kastner, those three are the only ones who I believe were unfairly dismissed by Trump, the rest really had to come as they only incited the conflict , anger and suffering. It is simply amazing that a candidate, Audrey Evans, said how she was fired, that she did a good job, and how some of her useless teammates are still in the game. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's the game, it's "The Apprentice" where the manipulation, the stabbings in the back and always the popularity of "everyone joins the project manager" governs. <br /> <br /> It has been an entertaining trip, however, the candidates receive a wide range of tasks from photo sessions to the construction of minigolf fields, the construction of new apartments. <br /> <br /> Even so, he is still the "Apprentice", so all you can do basically is laugh all the time, since madness and chaos end up with the lucky person. Is the winner.
