I was so happy to have found this short film. I'm always so disappointed that the short films are hard to find, so when I saw this and saw that I was nominated for the Live Action Short Film at the Academy Awards, I was so glad I had a movie I was encouraging. <br /> <br /> The plot is quite simple, the director, writer and star Nacho Vigalondo tried to find a reason why people suddenly form a song and a dance number as they do in movie musicals. The result is extremely entertaining and the song is really catchy. <br /> <br /> It's a well-made, well-edited short film and all the actors do a great job. And the last picture of the movie is perfect. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie.
