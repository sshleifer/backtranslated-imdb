Zombie 3 has an interesting history in its manufacture. First, it's a sequel to Fulci's hit Zombie 2, and Zombie 2 itself is, of course, a marketing strategy to trick people into thinking it's a sequel to Dawn of the Dead, also known as Zombie. , by George A. Romero. Confusing enough? Basically, none of the movies have anything to do with each other, but who cares when they make money. I suppose that Fulci himself did not care about the production in the middle of Zombie 3 when he decided to leave. Bruno Mattei got up to help fill in the film with additional scenes to extend the execution time. <br /> <br /> The plot of Zombie 3 is your typical zombie rate. Scientists develop a serum on an island in the Philippines, terrorists steal it to unleash a plague and zombies go crazy. Scientists want to create an antidote, while the military is willing to tear everyone down without prejudice. There are also brief insertions of a Radio DJ that preaches about how we treat the planet. <br /> <br /> In general, I liked this movie. I heard horrible things, but the ridiculous dialogue is quite pleasant. The film seems to be an attempt to raise awareness about pollution, the corrupted army, Man touching God, etc. I have the feeling that at some point it was a serious movie, but it veered off in a strange direction, probably when Mattei came on board. <br /> <br /> Besides stealing other zombie movies, this reminded me a lot of Los locos de Romero. Listen to Radio DJ give the good news: "When you see men in white suits and gas masks, run to them for help." This, of course, applies to the images of blank men who shoot down zombies. Later, they directly steal a scene from Crazies in which one of the normal and uncontaminated people dies by mistake. <br /> <br /> The gore factor is pretty good in this case with hordes of zombies in every corner. How is it great? Let me count the forms ?? 1. Zombie Birth 2. Flying Zombie Head 3. Zombie Birds. 4. Zombie without legs swimming in a pool. My favorite zombie was the maniac who runs the machete at the gas station. It was a bad ass and almost knocked down the whole building trying to kill a girl. <br /> <br /> Favorite quote? When a sergeant insists on cremating a zombie, scientists ask: "Do not you think that once the ash is in the air, it will fall to the ground and contaminate everything?" To which the Sergeant responds boldly: "Now you're talking about science fiction." He also continues to mention the "Science Fiction" told by scientists even at the end when everyone dies. <br /> <br /> Extras: Gallery, Trailers and Interviews, especially Mattei's, where he insists on directing. 40% of the scenes, but I can not remember which or other significant details. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: a must for zombies and Fulci fans. <br /> <br /> Rating: 7/10 <br /> <br /> Molly Celaschi www.HorrorYearbook.com MySpace.com/HorrorYearbook
