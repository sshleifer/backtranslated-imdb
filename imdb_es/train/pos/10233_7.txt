I've always liked watching Hong Kong movies, but all of them did not meet my expectations ... until now! BURNING PARADISE does not contain the flat humor that most HK films have, nor a second-rate story that has been dragged into the film. The story is not complex, but there are never scenes that are there to fill an "intelligent" space (the only truly intelligent martial arts film I've seen is CROUCHING TIGER, but since Hollywood is involved, it's not a true HK movie for my ). There are some incredible fight scenes in this movie, from the first one (which is one of the coolest I've seen, but so short) to the last major scenes. But keep in mind that a lot of blood also flows (people are cut in half, beheaded, etc.). The production is quite good and the special effects show that the writer's fantasy can be fulfilled, although some shots must be quite technical (notice: the sheet of paper that is pulled and fixed on a wall!). Yes, it's not Tsui Hark or John Woo what made my favorite Hong Kong movie, it's Ringo Lam! And I'm sure I'll see more of this director! Ace.
