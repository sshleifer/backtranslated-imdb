['I really liked this movie! Although it looked nothing like any of the books, it is still Nancy Drew&#39;s classic style. I had seen a lot of ads for this movie and, because I really liked Nancy Drew&#39;s books, I had high expectations for this movie and they definitely met those expectations. Almost all the characters were exactly as I imagined them reading the books. I am very happy to have seen this movie. All the actors and actresses really acted as they did in the series of books. Since I saw this movie, I wanted to read all the Nancy Drew books out there. All the actors and actresses really got into their characters and it was definitely shown when this movie was shown on the big screen. Definitely, it seemed that all the actors and actresses were really in the positions in which the characters were. I definitely give this movie 10 out of 10.']
