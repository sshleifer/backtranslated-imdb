The first time I accidentally stepped on the LoG one night while watching TV: since then, I've never missed an episode. <br /> <br /> His humor is very strange, like a cross between the social commentary of Brass Eye, the excellent Fast Show. of a single line, and an incredible plot that seems to develop every week without having to go anywhere. The best example of this was the special material of Hillary Briss: what is it about? <br /> <br /> Humor will not attract everyone. Some will say that he is too sick, and it is easy to see where they come from. However, try it. If you do not like it, do not look at it, but if you like it, you'll be glad you followed my advice.
