['I&#39;m not joking about that summary and vote! Video distributors have packaged this as another typical werewolf movie from the 80s, but in fact it is the biggest parody of the horror genre you can imagine, having made for the horror movie what &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot; did for the western. I have seen many comedies (good, bad, stupid, rare, etc.) (and, in general, I am not impressed), and I think that comedy should be the hardest genre for filmmakers and actors to work with: it takes the right kind of touch to make things succeed, and part of that is having good ideas. &quot;Full Moon High&quot; is full of good ideas, so many, in fact, that they can embarrass the Zucker / Abrams team of &quot;Airplane&quot; and &quot;Naked Gun&quot;. One of the best is the presence of Ed McMahon in a leading role as a right boat John Birch style. The jokes, the ones that do not make jokes, the jokes and the puns are, literally, continuous and everything, including the kitchen sink, has been released. The ironic tone is very similar to &quot;Back to the future&quot;. <br /><br /> Some people (that is, almost all the critics here) must have been rejected by the spirit of anarchy here, but I almost die of laughter, and this is one of those movies in which you never know what kind of madness will happen. then. As the extraordinary character in the movie B, Larry Cohen, had not made a direct comedy before this, one has the feeling that he was making up for lost time by including any joke he or his collaborators might think. If Mel Brooks had done this, critics would have called it a comic masterpiece, but because it was made by Cohen, it has been dismissed as an imbecile. Criticism critics have also called this movie &quot;dumb&quot;. SILLY? What is a comedy supposed to be - serious? Anyway, I laughed more for this movie than for any other I can imagine. Cohen mocks everyone, including him, with many references to his usual brand of low-rent movies; He and the actors must have had a complete explosion when doing this. <br /><br /> Humor is very similar to Mel Brooks-ish, and anyone who loves Jewish humor or watches many B-movies (especially horror) will love this. Trust me: the film is not too hard to find, and as long as you accept it for what it is, a roller coaster of laughter without any pretense of social value at all, then you will really enjoy it! <br /><br /> A side note: this movie should somehow go down in history as the only thing that Bob Saget starred in (albeit briefly) that was really funny.']
