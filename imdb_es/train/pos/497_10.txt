Call me a teenager, but I really believe that this is a great series. If you have not had the opportunity to experience some episodes of the latest Star Trek series, you should definitely see this. Perhaps more convincing than Voyager's Caretaker, which launched the series with Cpt. Janeway, Archer's adventures are completely different, but strangely familiar ... The music is also catchy. No true sci-fi fan can pass without seeing at least one episode of Star Trek, and these deliveries make it worth the wait.
