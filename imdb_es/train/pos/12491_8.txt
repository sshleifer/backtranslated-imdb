['This movie was very good. If you like watching horror movies, I recommend it. The acting was very good, although I thought that the actress who plays Julie could have had more emotion behind her lines. Allan was very good and I thought that the cinematography was incredible. I was on the edge of my seat all the time while my friends went crazy and shouted. It was a complete success in my opinion and should have reached the big screen. I give you two thumbs up! I would definitely say that if you have not seen it yet, go rent it. If you have seen it and you have not liked it, go see it again because there are parts that are completely unreal. I also liked how much of the film was filmed on my school campus.']
