['Keep in mind that I am a fan of the genre, but only recently have I seen this movie for the first time. How I&#39;ve overlooked all this time is a wonder to me. For me, this is a better movie than the highly praised &quot;High Noon&quot;. It is a great western with excellent performance and a great history. The DVD is in a beautiful black and white with an exceptional cinematography. If you like westerns or James Stewart, you should not miss this movie.']
