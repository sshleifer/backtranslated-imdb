['I do not remember that this movie was released here. I only saw it when it came to the cable. The film is about the dehumanization of children in killing machines. Specifically a person, the way he is replaced and discarded (literally) in a community outside the world where he is unable to deal with accepting who he really is and what he feels. <br /><br /> It seems to me that many people expected this to be Rambo in space, and it would have been happy if it were. <br /><br /> I&#39;m certainly glad it was not, Kurt does a good job of portraying an emotional cripple. The scene in which he is sitting outside the room shows this, although the decision of two slow-motion repetitions will detract from the moment. <br /><br /> This is not a classic SF movie in the way that it was Bladerunner, Alien, Silent running, Logan run or THX1138, but unfortunately it is the closest I&#39;ve seen in a long time. <br /><br /> It changes in the film to a credible degree, it does not break Arnie&#39;s lines, it does not become Snake Plissken and there is no definitive happy ending. <br /><br /> That&#39;s why this movie did not do well. It did not follow the formula, and among a US audience of 18 to 25 years, that is unforgivable, since it was not what they expected to see. <br /><br /> Fear and discipline <br /><br /> Forever.']
