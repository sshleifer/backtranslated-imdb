I caught Evening in the movies with a friend. The night is a movie for girls that does not apologize for being like that, but I can say with some relief that it is not so infused with estrogen that it is painful for a man with red blood to look. Except for a single instance at the end of the movie, I watched it with interest and did not have to move away or roll my eyes in any self-indulgent melodrama. The ladies, for their part, will absolutely love this movie. <br /> <br /> Ann Lord is an old woman, is lying down and spends her last days on Earth as comfortably as possible in her own home with her two older daughters on her side. Disconcerted by memories of her past, Ann suddenly screams the name of a man her daughters have never heard before: Harris. While her two daughters silently contemplate the meaning of her mother's strong need to remember and repair her unfortunate affair with this mysterious man at this time of all time, Ann falls back on her head on the fateful day she met Harris, and in doing so, then, we lost the youthful optimism for the future with which we all inevitably separate. <br /> <br /> Both Ann and her two daughters, a married woman with children, a "serial comedofopher", struggle with the central question of whether true love really exists, and perhaps most importantly, whether true love It can stand the test of time. Are we all one day predisposed to realize that love never lasts forever? Will we all realize that conformity with the imperfect is the only realistic result? The subtle fact that old Ann is still struggling with an answer to these questions on her deathbed is not lost on her two daughters. <br /> <br /> The cinematography of Evening is interesting: most of the film was spent in Ann's. remembering the past, and for that reason I think the film was shot as if it were a deliberate overexposure, to give everyone an ethereal shine (and thus make it very obvious that all this is not real, but it happened in the past). Claire Danes is beautiful (she seems to be really tall, although she only measures 5 '5 "in reality), and is absolutely captivating in a climactic scene where her singing talents are finally put to the test. <br /> <br /> Not really You can speak ill of the cast, which leads Claire Danes and does not stop: Vanessa Redgrave, Patrick Wilson, Meryl Streep and Glenn Close complete the other main and minor roles in the film. <br /> <br /> Not really I can say nothing negative about this film, although Hugh Dancy's struggle to make his character emerge from a single dimensionality is, in the end, a total loss. Play the adorable and spoiled drunken children of the obscenely rich who put a front of great bravado but who is secretly scared and rigid of not getting to anything that probably does not offer much in the exploration of the character, he had his orders and stuck to them. <br /> <br /> In the end, gentlemen, your lady friend sureme He will cry, and while he does not make him feel so affected, the night will definitely not be a waste for the time we spend watching the Night. Come to the theaters or fix it as a rent to redeem for points when you want to be accompanied to a visit of Die Hard 4 or the next movie of Rambo. It will be your little secret that this visit really did not cost you much.
