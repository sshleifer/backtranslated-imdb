After 'Aakrosh', this was the second film for Govind Nihalani as director. Until this movie was made there was no public for the documentaries in India. This film showed that a documentary can meet the requirements of a commercial film without diluting its essence. It was one of the successful films in the year it was released. This film competed against the great bollywood banners such as 'COOLIE', 'BETAAB', 'HERO' in 1983. <br /> <br /> SmithaPatel, in this film acted more as an awareness of the hero each time he walked away or She lost her composure. She was there to remind him. She was not like a regular heroine to do the usual things of running around trees and shrubs. In a moment, he even abandoned his love when the implacability of the hero touched the roof. <br /> <br /> There was another character from this movie, which was played by contemporary Om Puri, Naseeruddin Shah. He played like an inspector turned into an alcoholic character. The paper conveyed the message of the end result of an honest cop who rubbed the wrong side of the system that also gave viewers the opportunity to predict the end of the hero. <br /> <br /> In his debut film, Sadashiv Amrapurkar captivated the audience with his cameo, which eventually won him as the best supporting actor in the film. The film's policeman was not a complete direct personality, he was able to adapt to the system to a certain extent. The anger that left half, continued in the other film by Govind Nihalani "Drohkaal". Even after two decades, this film is remembered only by the director and the entire team. Everyone did their part par excellence.
