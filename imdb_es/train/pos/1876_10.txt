An adaptation of the book 'Buscando peces'. This story is about a young sailor with problems, Antwone Fisher (Derek Luke), who tells the painful story of his past to a psychiatrist Jerome Davenport (Denzel Washington). A brilliant debut performance by Derek Luke and an always surprising performance by Denzel Washington. <br /> <br /> This movie was amazing on many levels and I was disappointed that it did not win an Oscar, I think it was because it was released at a bad time so it was overlooked. I recommend this movie to everyone, it will move your story and really make the audience empathic with this young man who is Antwone Fisher. <br /> <br /> If you like true inspirational stories, then see Antwone Fisher. <br /> <br /> Thanks
