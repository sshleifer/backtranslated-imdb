['&quot;Citizen X&quot; tells the story of &quot;The Butcher of Rostov,&quot; the nickname of a perverse and perverse Russian serial killer who claimed 52 lives between 1978 and 1992. The film focuses on the rookie detective (Rea), who stubbornly persecuted the murderer against all odds against an uncooperative bureaucracy in self-denial and convenient denial. An HBO product for television, the film offers a solid cast, good performances, saves the audience much of the spooky details, but is presented as a docudrama without the stylistics of the similar Hollywood fare. A direct and uniform dramatization of a serious and relatively little-known story more interesting than &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot;. (SECOND)']
