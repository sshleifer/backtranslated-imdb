This film is an exact copy of a television series on the Indian television channel doordarshan that was broadcast at least 15 years ago. The series was known as "gubbarre", which means balloons. Each episode was a new short story. The story is excellent and the original is much sweeter and "convincing". Abhay Doel does a good job, but does not fit the role of "normal" and "third class" types (as he calls himself in the movie). In fact, Shayan Munshi with short hair and no designer clothes would have fit into the role of Abhays, but Shayan just does not have the talent to take it off. <br /> <br /> I would suggest to see the series if it is available. It's the same story, except to run with the mother of friends and the initial introduction. The performance of the television actors was much better than these "stars". <br /> <br /> The only reason why these films are a failure is because the director tried to extend the story from half an hour (or 45 minutes) to 2+ hours. So he has to get draggy. Even the sensations of nasal singing that the songs could not compensate. <br /> <br /> This movie is good for a Sunday afternoon and it's really refreshing if you have not seen the original TV series. The script and the end of the series were much better <br /> <br /> ##### SPOILERS AHEAD ########## SPOILERS AHEAD ####### ## # ##### SPOILERS AHEAD ######### ##### SPOILERS AHEAD ######### ##### SPOILERS AHEAD ######## # THe The end of the original series was much stronger, since the hero got rid of the girl, although he thought she was willing to marry him. He is aware and tells him that he does not want to be "rewarded" and that he never helped him with that intention. The director or the script somehow failed to capture the original ending of this movie. The original ending would have bought tears in the eyes of the girls and would have made the boys agree. The delivery was simply not good. <br /> <br /> But personally I think this is a pathetic copy. No credit should be given to the director / scriptwriter. The story is amazing and it is from one of the famous novel writers in PRemchand munshi's class. I'm not sure if this is the story of premchand munshi, but many of the other stories in this series present some of the stories of premchand munshi and other great Hindi writers.
