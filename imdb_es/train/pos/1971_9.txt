I have no idea what people complain about. Yesterday I saw this movie and I liked it a lot. Stone returned to deliver a great character. She was as good as she was in the first Basic Instinct. She still has those intelligent but difficult answers. Although Sharon may be 48 years old ... she looks amazing! I do not care if it's as fake as a Barbie. She looks good and that's it. Basic Instinct 2 gives you everything you want from the first moment. Sex, violence and a great ending that will leave you thinking and talking about it for hours. Half of the people who comment on this movie have not even seen it. So do not listen to them.
