Four prisoners share a single cell: the dominant transvestite, Marcus (Clovis Cornillac); The idiot friend of Marcus, Paquerette (Dimitri Rataud), who will eat anything in sight, including pocket watches, cockroaches and his little sister; Lassalle (Philippe Laudenbach), the intelligent librarian who murdered his wife; and Carrère (Gérald Laroche), the new guy who was involved in a corporate fraud and is now focused on escaping. After a brick falls from the wall of the cell, the men discover the hidden diary written by a serial killer obsessed with the "Fountain of Youth" that occupied the cell in the 1920s. Is this diary the secret for your escape? Or is there something much more sinister behind this? <br /> <br /> I was a little tired of getting into this movie because the only other experience I have with Eric Valette was the terrible One Missed Call (2008), which I consider to be the worst theatrically released movie I've seen. However, much of what was wrong with One Missed Call could probably be attributed to Klavan's awful script, because (as I recall) Valette's direction was not the worst part of the movie (unless he chose to include the baby) . Anyway, Maléfique was a good way to get my respect back. . . It's a French movie (obviously something I like) and it takes place in prison (which is my second favorite place of terror after the asylums). So that's two points for him even before the movie starts. Fortunately, Valette had me once the movie also ended. Maléfique is a pretty deep story, quite complex, quite convincing of obsession and desperation. . . The desire and the need to bring fantasies to reality. While it is not a terrifying movie in the traditional sense, the rarity of its power makes it quite terrifying. The period between the climax and the conclusion was one of the best movies I've seen in a long time and I would wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a decent psychological thriller with some great blood. <br /> <br /> Final verdict: 8.5 / 10. A little respect won by Valette. <br /> <br /> Note: Paramount took over the rights to make an American remake (surprise). It is expected to come out in 2009. I am not sure why, to be honest, since this does not seem to be something that would be a great money generator here in the United States. But, before I had been surprised. <br /> <br /> Live La France! <br /> <br /> -AP3-
