I recently saw this, but when I started I had no idea what the concept was about, what the topic was about ... in short, I had no idea what it was. It was a documentary, it was a comedy routine ... Well, it was SO MUCH. <br /> <br /> It started a little slow, but I think it's because I had no idea what kind of program I was watching but it quickly absorbed me. The episode I saw had Robert Wuhl talking about facts and fiction in the story. Mainly how we (Americans) learn a story that is not really true, and how we came to learn what we did. He did this in a way that kept the viewer completely entertained and interested. In fact, I learned some things and that is a true indicator of how effective this type of program can be. <br /> <br /> I'd love to see this be detected as a series for HBO. I think it can be just as fun and effective with a variety of topics, especially if they are "taught" in the same way as in this episode.
