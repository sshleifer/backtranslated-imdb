It's a good movie! Most of us have seen Jurassic Park, where chaos theory is summed up by talking about the wings of a butterfly, causing a tornado on the other side of the planet. Well, Bug has to do with that (or at least something, do not worry, this is not a spoiler) I'm definitely not a religious type and I do not believe in predestined things, destiny, etc., but this movie surely makes you he wonders if the coincidence really exists ... <br /> <br /> moreover, the acting and the camera are also excellent, another proof that it is still possible to make a good movie without a million dollars
