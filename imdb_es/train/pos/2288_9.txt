It is very rare to find a literary work properly translated to the screen that you may have rated this movie above what it deserves, but not by much. As a former student of Vonnegut's works, I have no hesitation in recommending the film to his readers, at least to those who love him like me. The casting is inspired: Nolte is discreet in triumph, bewildered in defeat, decisive in the trial. Sheryl Lee is delicious at all times, but her handling of the treacherous Resi and her tragic crescendo almost makes you forget her beauty. Alan Arkin offers a totally adorable, but equally treacherous, Soviet spy. <br /> <br /> Do not feel like you have to read Mother Night to appreciate the movie; However, if you have not read Mother Night, you probably want to do it after watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Observe the color changes to black and white and vice versa, and do not miss the final symbolism of the campbell rope. Look, too, for the Kurt Vonnegut cameo near the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> The "white Christmas" of Bing Crosby will never sound the same (I write in mid-December, when the song is getting heavy), and it's driving me crazy.
