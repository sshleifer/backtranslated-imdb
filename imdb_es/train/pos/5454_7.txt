This is one of the boldest and most important of the so-called "Pre-Code" movies made in Hollywood during the 1930s. Unlike some Pre-Code films that occasionally ventured into themes that would never have been allowed after 1934-5 , this film was completely submerged in a very sordid but entertaining plot from start to finish. The conventional morality of the late 30s and 40s was definitely not evident in this film, since the film is essentially about a deceptive woman who sleeps to the top, and without apology on the way. This "broad" enjoyed sex and used it on every man who could help her get rich, something she would never have seen in films made two or three years later. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with Barbara Stanwyck working at her father's house. In addition to being her boss, he is also her pimp and encourages her to sleep with a local government official to allow the illegal bar to operate with impunity. Although it is not particularly clear here, it seems that Dad has been "renting" his daughter's body for a long time. <br /> <br /> However, after almost being raped and attacked, this man broke a bottle of beer. His skull, Barbara has had enough and goes to the big city. It does not hurt that he still exploded and killed his father, but his feeling that he was prostituting and had nothing to show, seemed to be the impulse to move. <br /> <br /> Despite the Depression, Barbara uses sex to get a job at a huge mega bank. She starts out in a low class job as a file clerk, but in the space of what seems like a few weeks, she falls asleep from one job to another until she is sleeping with the head of the bank. and his future son-in-law !!! All this ends in tragedy, but Babs does not seem too shocked by the death of these two men. In fact, some time later, she can insinuate herself into the life of the NEW CEO and once again is at the top (perhaps in more ways than one). <br /> <br /> Now so far, this is a wonderful movie because it was so harsh and unrepentant. Barbara played a 100% sociopath, a woman without morals or conscience, just a desire to squeeze life as much as she could not, no matter whom she hurt in the process. However, the brave writers and producers "cowered" and thought it was important to approach a redemptive end. Considering that this woman was so evil and intriguing, her change of attitude in the end was a great disappointment and detracted from the film. In many ways, this reminded me of the end of JEZEBEL. Once again, an evil person somehow "sees the light" and changes in a not very convincing conclusion. <br /> <br /> My advice is that try to see the RED HEAD WOMAN and the DOWNSTAIRS. THE RED HEAD WOMAN looks a lot like BABY FACE, but it does not present a magical transformation at the end: the protagonist is really a sinking bitch! In DOWNSTAIRS, a film very similar to the RED HEAD WOMAN, the roles are reversed and a man (John Gilbert) plays a similar character. Both are classic and a little better than this movie. <br /> <br /> This film is a surprising description of a brief period of often ultra-sordid Hollywood films and, from this point of view, worth seeing for Cinephiles. In addition, the fans of The Duke take note: John Wayne plays a very small role in the film and it is very unusual to see a very young Wayne playing such a conventional role.
