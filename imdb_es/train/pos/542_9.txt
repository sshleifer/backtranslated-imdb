When I first learned that Brian Krause was going to be in this film, I wanted to see it. It took me weeks to realize that I have seen the original of this and I have loved it. So I had even more reason to look. Well, I watched. Actually, it was better than most of the sequels of movies for television. I hate what happens to Brian's character (you can find out for yourself) and I did not like most of the characters, including Brian's. But the film needed the corny, annoying and foolish characters for Stanley Caldwell (Judd Nelson) to shine once more. In the end, he was cheering for Stanley and his happy ending. If you liked the original Cabin by the Lake or if you like horror films without blood, I suggest you see this.
