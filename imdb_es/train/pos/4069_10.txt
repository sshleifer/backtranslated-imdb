When listening to the soundtrack at this time, the images return with an intensity that makes my longing for a dry eye very strong (to be able to write this). So far I've seen it twice, and I should be ashamed to have seen it * only * twice. <br /> <br /> I have seen all the Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli movies, and they are invariably nothing more than masterpieces (Except maybe for Nausicaa who was, even in the uncut version too premature compared to the manga nec -plus-ultra). Even so, their strength sometimes becomes their weakness, as they tend to be too naive / positive (Chihiro), or, with more nuances, a bit too explicit / moralistic (Mononoke). At least, compared to, for example, Ghibli's other teacher, Takahata (Grave of the Fireflies / Only Yesterday / Raccoon Wars). But not this one. <br /> <br /> In Laputa, Miyazaki pours in all the brilliant storytelling that storytellers have gathered and perfected over the centuries, combined with a bit of morality, but well interwoven with a completely transcendental aspect. Atmosphere, but also with the humor and fun of, for example, Totoro. Each main character is perfectly represented with their doubts and fears and their qualities that help them overcome difficulties. The rhythm is so perfect that I do not know anything, except a black hole that would be able to exert such a gravitational pull on your whole being. The story is presented as an action flic with insinuated mysteries, but when the girl falls from the sky, unconscious, floating with the stone, and the main theme is activated, we can see the great mystery that is yet to be discovered. , but the story then settles down and gradually, over several carefully selected action scenes and serene beauty, is built for an unforgettable climax of melancholy, hope, beauty, after days of grim sadness, and finally see the horizon in a clear morning , knowing the way he walked, seeing the distance ahead, but smiling at the mere fact of being able to glimpse it. <br /> <br /> It's like an explosive white light in your skull that by the Once the credits start rolling, you've kept your eyes dry and your mind numb, you should see a therapist. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that, technically, some of the more recent Miyazakis can be more overwhelming, this is for me their undisputed masterpiece. If it takes a fraction of a second to realize that this was done in 1986, you can only conclude that Hayao Miyazaki is a genius like a star that appears only once every 200 years. This, of course, has been suggested previously, but for me this is their only film that can, by itself, fully illustrate that simple fact. If you miss this during your life, you will die with a huge gap, which would be a pity, since the coffin costs the same.
