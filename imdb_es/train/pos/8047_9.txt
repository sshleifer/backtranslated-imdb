I came across this movie by accident, and I really enjoyed it. The character of Timothy Busfield has no redeeming qualities, and at one point, Busfield and the star Meloni eat the women as they pass by ... Meloni's opinion of the parade is different from that of Busfield. Janel Maloney is great ... She looks a lot like Tea Leone, but the main difference here is that Janel can ACT. Some very nice things in this movie and they deserve your attention when they are on the wire.
