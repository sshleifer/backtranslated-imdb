This is one of the best talkies of Joan Crawford. It was the first pairing of Gable-Crawford, and it made it clear to MGM and the audience that they were a hot team, which led the studio to make seven more films as co-stars. <br /> <br /> The film convincingly describes the downward slide of a brother and sister who, after their father loses everything in the stock market crisis, must fend for themselves and work for earn a living. Life is difficult in the Depression, and soon even their attempts to find legitimate work become useless and resort to the activity of the underworld. <br /> <br /> Joan Crawford is excellent as the socialite turned into moll. She is intelligent, complex and credible. It even tempers the theatrical rigidity of the early acting style of the other Talkie actors. Clark Gable is a diamond in the rough, masculine and brusque like the senseless gangster who gets involved with the character of Crawford. The same year he would play a similar and even more successful role against Norma Shearer in "A Free Soul", securing his position as the best male sex symbol in MGM. <br /> <br /> If you like Crawford in this type of role, do not miss "Paid", which he did a year before, which is also among his best initial performances of Talkie. <br /> <br />
