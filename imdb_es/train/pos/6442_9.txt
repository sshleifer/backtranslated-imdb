['It&#39;s an excellent Swedish film ... it was the first Swedish film I&#39;ve seen ... it&#39;s simple and profound ... what a great combination! <br /><br /> Michael Nyqvist made a great performance as a famous conductor looking for peace in his hometown. <br /><br /> Frida Hallgren was great as her inspiring girlfriend to help him continue and never give up. <br /><br /> The fight between the driver and the hypocritical priest who loses his battle with Michael when his wife confronts him and defends Michael&#39;s noble cause to help the people of his hometown find his own peace in music. <br /><br /> The only thing I did not like was the end ... it was not so good, but it has a deep meaning.']
