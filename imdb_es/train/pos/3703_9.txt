Ok, then it's a movie for adults. But it really is very well done. It is obvious that the producers invested a lot of time and money in making a kind of classy film. I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. Even the performance was pretty decent. The plot was more solid than most of the adult movies I've seen. The work of the camera was above average. It's just a good movie!
