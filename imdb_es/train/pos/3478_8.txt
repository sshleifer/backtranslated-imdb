This was actually my favorite Scooby Doo series when I was younger. I thought that each episode had more advantage and that the villains had a lot of creative thinking put into them (and even very scary and also credible). Some of the best episodes were "I left my neck in San Francisco", "Twenty thousand cries under the sea", "The Ghoul, The bat and the ugly" and "When you wish on a star creature". If you have never seen these episodes please do it. However, this series was a bit mixed, as there were other episodes that did not seem to have the same kind of advantage for them, like "Rocky Mountain YIIII!" and "The Ransom Of Scooby Chief". As in the previous series, it was very well organized, an interesting story and very well drawn. As everyone says, however, it would have been much better without Scrappy Doo. The character was tired and distracted the story that was told.
