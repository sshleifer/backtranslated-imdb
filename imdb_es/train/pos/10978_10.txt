Several years ago, when I first saw "Gray Gardens", I remember that I laughed and that I found the camp fun. Years later I still laugh out loud when I see him, but after many visits I have seen the beauty of the strange and twisted relationship between the inseparable "Grande" Edith Bouvier Beale and his daughter "Little" Edith Bouvier Beale. <br /> <br /> Mother and daughter living together in the 28-room decaying East Hampton mansion add new meaning to the term "Shabby Chic." With innumerable cats, raccoons and opossums as roommates, this aunt and niece of Jackie O. allowed filmmakers Albert and David Maysles to enter their mansion to film their daily lives. The result is a hilarious, beautiful, sad and moving story of true love and the rule of anarchy. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Big and Little Edie is a testament to the unbreakable bonds of love. And their lives an example of unity, determination and free will. This movie has more recommendations than I can express in words. It is a rare experience that you must see for yourself. <br /> <br />
