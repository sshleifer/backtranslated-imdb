['One of the best movie dramas I&#39;ve seen in my life. We act a lot in the church and this is one that can be used as a resource that highlights all the good things that actors can do in their work. I highly recommend this, especially for those who are interested in acting, since &quot;you have to see it&quot;. There are several scenes of the note. On the one hand, the scene of the cemetery when Hamlet meets Yorick (everyone knows about THAT scene just by going to elementary school), and his interaction with the skull was extremely well done. The logic used in this scene was tremendous, I suppose it is a testimony of Shakespeare more than anything else. For a second, I really enjoyed the scene in which Hamlet, Horatio and the character played by Robin Williams talked about the next duel.']
