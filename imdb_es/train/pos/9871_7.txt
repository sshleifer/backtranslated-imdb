Return to the Lost World was filmed consecutively with the 1992 version of The Lost World. <br /> <br /> In this sequel, the same five people, led by Challenger, return to the plateau where a group has started. Drilling oil that threatens to destroy the earth. Gomez has something to do with this. They manage to defeat the drillers and the plateau is saved, much to the delight of the natives. <br /> <br /> As in The Lost World, the few dinosaurs we see are made of rubber and these include a T-Rex and Ankylosaurus. <br /> <br /> John Ryhs-Davies and David Warner repeat their roles while Challenger and Summerlee and three other actors also return. <br /> <br /> Despite reading several negative reviews of this and those cheap looking rubber dinosaurs, I enjoyed Return to the Lost World. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 stars out of 5.
