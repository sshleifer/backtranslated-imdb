If I did not know better, it almost seems that it was staged, but it was not like that. He prepared himself perfectly, and how they got all those images is incredible! The unfortunate events of September 11, 2001 combine well in this documentary and the classic images that they obtained made this an unfortunate classic. Only the history in the archival material should only be one MUST be seen by any American or person affected by the tragedy of September 11.
