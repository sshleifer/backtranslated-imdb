['I could see this movie in a preview and I was dazzled by it. It is not the typical romantic comedy. I do not remember having laughed so hard in a movie and, nevertheless, having been moved by it. Laughs are not jokes here, they are observations, laughs of recognition, small commotions of &quot;Oh, my God, I thought I was the only one who felt that way!&quot; I will not reveal the plot, which is more than &quot;Guy falls in love with his brother&#39;s girlfriend.&quot; The whole family plays a role in the relationship here. Probably the best combination of laughter and warmth since &quot;While You Were Sleeping&quot;. <br /><br /> Steve Carell is much deeper than he has gone before, and for the first time I really liked him. The cast is amazing, a list of veteran theater actors whom I&#39;ve loved in other roles, but they mix to form a compelling family. Dianne Wiest is charming as the mother, Juliette Binoche is bright and hilarious (who knew she was funny?), And even the villain Dane Cook offers a warm, quiet and moving performance. The soundtrack by Sondre Lerche is a wonderful addition, and I&#39;ll buy the CD as soon as it&#39;s available. <br /><br /> Do not miss it.']
