Paris, je t'aime (2006) is a film composed of 18 segments. You can do the mathematical calculations: 18 segments in 120 minutes means that each director had seven minutes to tell his story. The film is based on the premise that you can, in fact, tell a story in such a short time. The premise works. Almost all the segments are powerful, complete and satisfactory. Each one presents a different aspect of the Parisian experience, and almost all the directors extract outstanding performances from a cast of great and almost great actors. <br /> <br /> There were so many powerful representations in this movie that it is difficult to interpret them. Choose one or two favorites. Probably the most memorable for me were Juliette Binoche as an afflicted mother in the segment "Place des Victoires", Gena Rowlands as an aged beauty in "Quartier Latin", Catalina Sandino Moreno as a servant in the segment "Loin du 16ème" and Margo Martindale is a Colorado postman who learned to speak French in order to visit Paris (segment "14ème Arrondissement"). <br /> <br /> Special mention must be given to Gulliver Hecq, probably the most evil child who has harassed a US tourist in a Paris subway station ("Tuileries" segment). <br /> <br /> This is an outstanding film. My wife and I decided to rent it in a few months so we can pick up some of the subtle points that we surely did not see. However, Paris is so well photographed that I would suggest that you try to see it on a big screen. In any case, do not miss it!
