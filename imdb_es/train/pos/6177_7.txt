The adaptation of SPIRIT by Will Eisner to the TV screen followed many other offers developed from comic book pages or comic books. (Remember, the two are not exactly the same medium). In fact, it is ironic that this is the only adaptation (at the time of writing this article) of the intelligent alec, the wise cracking, the ironic superhero. <br /> <br /> The story says that Republic Pictures was interested in making a film version and was negotiating with the copyright owner in the mid-1940s, but they could never close the deal. The game that remained on the screen became the series, THE MASKED MARVEL, one of Republic's best. Maybe it was the best, because that studio had a penchant for playing with adapted material from comic strips, pulp magazines, radio and comic books. <br /> <br /> In this 1987 made for the film for television, it is quite obvious that he was a failed pilot for a proposed television series. While an older comic reader, like me, may be a bit harsh when criticizing an adaptation, a viewer who is not familiar with the character may offer some new observations, regardless of any preconceived notion of how this version of screen. I like it. <br /> <br /> Well, as you sit and watch the story unfold, with the characters interacting in the middle of a crime wave, the little lady (my wife, Mrs. Ryan) did it with a statement. "This can not be decided if it is serious or not!" That pretty much describes THE SPIRIT and its creator, Mr. Will Eisner, the true creative genius in comics. <br /> <br /> The film is a sincere attempt to put the world of Eisner on the screen. The casting of Denny Colt / The Spirit, Commissioner Dolan and Ellen was really well done. Although in a contemporary setting, it was still a tradition of "the old days" in terms of costumes, you know, when men and women still wore hats! That brings up this final (and meandering) point, and that is that the director and the production made a conscious effort and managed to give the characters an aspect of Will Eisner in terms of facial expressions and body language. We say: Congratulations to them for their effort. <br /> <br /> It's a shame there has not been a series! Oh, well, in the world of cinema today, comic adaptations seem to be a hot topic. Maybe some producer and director of large timers could do a first-rate SPIRIT production for Big Screen. We can only wait. <br /> <br /> UPDATE: Dateline, Chicago, Illinois. 4/4/2008. At this point, all those who come to the movies in the Multiplexes shopping center have seen the poster announcing the new movie of THE SPIRIT, (subtitled, MY CITY SCREAMS); that will be launched on Christmas Day 2008. Well, we'll see then what we've been talking about. Just keep your fingers crossed! TO CONTINUE ............. <br /> <br /> UPDATE II: We saw the new movie, the writer and director Frank Miller's version of THE SPIRIT a couple of days ago. Well, we have our desire; But is this a good thing or another case of "Be careful what you ask for, why can you get it?" Please, read our article on IMDb.com. Thank you
