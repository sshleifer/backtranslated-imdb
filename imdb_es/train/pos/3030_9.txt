This movie has scenes that remind me of the strangest moments, that intense scene with Mr. Muckerji that tells Mrs. Melandez that someone she talked to talked to the girl who was pushed out the window by a woman who fits in. his description. that turns around, the way she keeps referring to him by name, with a Greek accent "Mr. Muckerji", and then, when Boyer discovers that he has just taken poison and gives him one last blow on the side of his head before she dies --- it's a delight! "Fools - Fools - all my life" ... etc, you get the point ... I have to buy this one. I love Dan Seymour's performance; usually, he plays a foreign sultan or plump police chief, he appeared in Casablanca and has many great pictures.
