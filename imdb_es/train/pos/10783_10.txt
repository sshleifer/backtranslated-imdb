I enjoyed this movie. I have not seen Andy Griffith in years and I felt that I fit perfectly into this role. I have associated it with comedy, but I am pleased to see that it is versatile. <br /> <br /> I was not worried that Dotty's "anxiety disorder" was not literal from a psychiatric textbook. There are billions of phobias and neuroses, and these can acquire a wide variety of quantitative and qualitative forms. She is clearly sensitive with extra-sensory powers as understood by the local Indians but not the Anglo-Saxons. Not surprisingly, this character is vulnerable and nominally eccentric. <br /> <br /> Although it is considered to be a light "family movie", it is actually more sophisticated than it seems. Also, Hiram's touch at the end was a pleasant surprise for me and he joined all the previous action in one package. It is fun to contemplate the possibility of such spiritual guidance.
