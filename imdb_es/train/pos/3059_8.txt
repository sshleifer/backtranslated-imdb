['Writer / director Henry Brommel has done a wonderful job with his film &quot;Panic&quot; since 2000, and that includes his casting choice: William H. Macy, Tracy Ullman, John Ritter, Neve Campbell, Donald Sutherland, Barbara Bain , David Dorfman. Brommel has chosen Ullman and Ritter in decidedly unfunny roles, and unusual casting is a welcome change from what we normally see. <br /><br /> &quot;Panic&quot; is the story of a hit man, Alex (Macy) who really works for his father (Sutherland). It covers his true profession doing jobs by mail; according to all appearances, he and his wife (Ullman) and his son Sammy (Dorfman) are a typical suburban family. Unhappy with his life, Alex seeks the help of a psychiatrist (Ritter) and tells only his mother (Bain). In the waiting room, he meets a young woman (Campbell) to whom he feels immediately attracted, which further complicates his situation. His mother breaks her promise and tells her father about the psychiatrist. When Alex receives his next assignment, he discovers that he must kill his psychiatrist. <br /><br /> This is a deep story of a good and gentle man turned into a murderer by a monster of a father, with the knowledge of his mother, who kills to please his father but can not cope and resign. His anger is so ingrained that he has lost the emotional attachment to almost everything and everyone, except his son, and finally it is his son who awakens him from a repression that lasts most of his life. When it&#39;s time for &quot;Panic&quot; to move, it does - quickly. <br /><br /> The &quot;panic&quot; does not seem scared at all. In fact, it moves very slowly. But it moves slowly, not because it is wrong: the slowness is deliberate, reflecting Alex&#39;s own psyche slowly emerging from the fog. When making a decision about Sara, the character of Campbell, and seeing his brand, his own psychiatrist, as a human being who lives and breathes, Alex begins to establish the connections between what he does and what he is, and how not make. jargon. And the difference between the two could lead to the loss of another psyche, that of Sammy. <br /><br /> William Macy offers another brilliant performance, as a loving father, a distant husband and a cold killer, the son of two monsters who never cared about their feelings or desires, a man who finally realizes that he has to take care of the situation. Plate or repeat the cycle. <br /><br /> This is not the kind of drama that plays well in a movie theater. He is too adult, too small, too subtle, too motivated by the characters and too good.']
