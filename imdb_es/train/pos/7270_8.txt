['This movie made me very happy. It is impossible not to love the intelligent and sweet orphan girl who changes the heart of a selfish lawyer who is only interested in pursuing success in her career. This is a very optimistic movie and I sincerely believe that we need more movies like Curly Sue. It touched my heart']
