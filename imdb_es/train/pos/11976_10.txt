This show is about three little girls. (D.J, Stephanie and Michelle) His mother is killed by a drunk driver, so his father Danny invites his brother-in-law (Jesse) and his old friend (Joey). So the whole show is about living life. The girls go through the problems of life and have life lessons. They develop crushes, boyfriends, and many more. The whole show is basically about to go with the flow. You do not have to hold a grudge, you just have to let it go. I think this show is really good and fun to watch. I grew up watching this show and I still watch it today. I am glad that you still broadcast this program on television. I see it almost every day. I rate it 10/10.
