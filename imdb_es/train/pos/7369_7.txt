['Personally I could not enter &#39;This song is not love&#39;, it is a brilliant movie and there is a great story, I just found myself checking the time on my phone every two minutes to see how much was left of the movie. <br /><br /> I love the relationship between Spike and Heaton, who depend on everyone to get along in life. At the same time I would like the relationship to be more than it is. Heaton is in love with Spike, but Spike is not in love with Heaton, or does not know how to love him. Acts of treachery, on both sides, have a great effect on both men. Both are devastated by the fact that the other one escaped and abandoned them, at a time when they really needed each other to survive.']
