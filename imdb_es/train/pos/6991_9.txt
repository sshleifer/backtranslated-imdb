This is an excellent movie. The cast is a great mix of characters and the story is decent. Basically, the film is about a well-accomplished doctor who steals the bodies of dead brides and takes them home. Once the bodies are in his house, he removes things (I hate to use such a general term, but I forget what he took away) and he puts it on his wife to preserve his youth. Then, a journalist, Patricia Hunter, investigates the situation and begins to find answers about why brides were dying. She travels to the doctors' house and interesting things begin to happen. Definitely look at this old man, but hey if you can.
