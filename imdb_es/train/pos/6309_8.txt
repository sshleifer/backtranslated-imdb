I saw this movie jewel in Cannes where I was part of the directors' fortnight. <br /> <br /> Welcome to Collinwood is excellent. Very funny in everything, with all the members of a strong cast acting their socks. It is a comedy that sometimes laughs out loud about a little thief (Cosimo, played by Luis Guzm√°n) who is caught trying to steal a car and sent to prison. While he is in prison, he finds himself with a "lifeguard" who talks to him about "the last bellini" that you and I have ... It's a sure scheme to get rich quick ... It turns out that there is a path from an abandoned building to the Jewelery store in the city, what could net millions, sounds simple? Well, put all kinds of extravagant characters and incidents along the way and you have the ingredients for a wild trip! life goes down to the next and soon a team of them gathers to try to take advantage of the Cosimos 'bellini' advantage of the failed boxer Pero (Superbly played by Sam Rockwell, surely a budding star) and reluctant the swindler Riley ( William H. Macy), who is forced to take his baby with him since his wife was locked up for fraud !!. <br /> <br /> Based on the Italian film I Soliti ignoti (Big Deal on Madonna Street ) that also inspired a movie similar to 'Coll inwood '?' Palookaville '. This draws attention to this latest effort and, although it is written and directed by the Russo brothers, it definitely has nuances from the Coen brothers about it. Produced by Steven Soderbergh and George Clooney, who has a small but fun part as a safe and crippled switch.
