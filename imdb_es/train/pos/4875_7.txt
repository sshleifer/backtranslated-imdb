"The father is still out on business," was the headline of a review after the premiere of "Promise Me This" in Cannes. I understand why many people think the same but Kusturica's unique expression is still present in his new film and it is something that critics can not touch. I had two hours of pure energy without rest. Even when Kusturica suffers from lack of concentration or fear of empty space, it remains unique and intact. Surprisingly good performance of Stribor Kusturica. Much more close-ups and less landscapes than in "Life is a miracle". Marija Petronijevic has a fatal world-class potential, please do not spoil it. Surely, I recommend everyone watch this movie.
