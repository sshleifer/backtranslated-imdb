I must admit that the only reason I bought this movie was because I'm a big fan of Gackt and a big fan of Hyde. I expected a good movie with many shots that were, say, pleasing to the female eye, but a slightly corny story. I mean, the synopsis really sounded out there. And now that I have just finished seeing it, I feel the need to tell the world about its brilliance. Hyde and Gackt gave poignant presentations, and my eyes are still hot from the crying that lasted during the last half of the movie. You get caught up in the story, and you really feel for the characters at the end. The element of vampirism, which I love, but it's very easy to exaggerate or ruin a movie with, is mixed subtly in the story to make it merely exotic, normal in this context, rather than an unnecessary random addition to the story . . I classified it with a 9 out of 10 at the beginning ... and then I went back and tried to think why I had not given that last point. It came up with nothing. So ten out of ten is. After all, I'm not very critical, the fact that I'm bothering to write a review means I really hate the movie or I love it. You can tell which side I'm with Moon Child.
