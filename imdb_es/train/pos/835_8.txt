Pierce Brosnan, the newest, but no longer James Bond, is a murderer. He is very good at what he does, but he is getting old and tired. Greg Kinnair is really good as the straight and narrow businessman. Now, when the story begins, the film shows these two people in their separate lives. Then, one night, they take a drink at a bar and start talking. Then, suddenly, you discover that these two people draw together during a series of events. The story is excellent, the acting is top notch and the humor is funny. I never thought that Pierce Brosnan would be so fun, but it really is and I must say that this movie is a must.
