I have to say that despite their reviews, Angels in the Outfield was a pretty good movie. I like the fact that it teaches children to always have faith and never give up because, yes, miracles can happen. Unlike the other baseball movies, this particular movie was highlighted by the amazing special effects and well-orchestrated soundtrack, which was very interesting. Although I liked this movie, it had some flaws, as something irrelevant (that is, towards the end, when Ray Mitchell hits a homer, he does not stop at the plate and, therefore, that would not be a score. a trap). I have to say that I was very impressed by the presence and the moral of this movie: just have faith, do not give up.
