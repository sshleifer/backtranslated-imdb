['People say that their editing was fun, but they had to reduce it substantially in postproduction. I have Harry as a professor at this moment in ucsd, and honestly, it&#39;s one of the best classes I&#39;ve ever had, it&#39;s quite funny here about what happened when making the film because Harry is so animated. I originally saw &quot;Joy of Life&quot; for another class in which Harry made a voice in the movie, and I started watching this movie after I started the class. Originally, Harry did a performance work, and it&#39;s really genuine to create moments that move you, especially when you have to re-edit things until you get to that moment, but it&#39;s something you see in this movie.']
