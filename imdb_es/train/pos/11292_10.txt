I once saw this movie as a child in the afternoon and afternoon program and I fell in love with it. <br /> <br /> It took more than 30 years, but recently I found it on a DVD, it was not cheap, either - in a catalog specializing in war movies. We saw it last night for the first time. The audio was good, however, it was grainy and had the trailers between reels. Even so, it was better than I remembered it. I was also impressed by the veracity of the work. <br /> <br /> The catalog is here somewhere. If you are sincere in finding it, send me a letter and I will see if I can get the information. cartwrightbride@yahoo.com
