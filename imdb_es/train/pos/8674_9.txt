This is a very typical case of Tom and Jerry: a situation is designed, conflict arises and chaos ensues. The characters behave appropriately, the natural tensions between several characters lead to general chaos. The best part (and the funniest) is when the peace treaty is in force and is respected: all kinds of strange wonders appear before your eyes. One caveat: it is very unwise to allow Tom to help you perform your morning cleaning routine! Highly recommended
