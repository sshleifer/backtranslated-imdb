A surprise thriller with more twists and double crosses than a sketchpad. A great cast that mixes it with an intriguing plot overseen by an influence of Twin Peaks on director Dahl. Nicholas Cage is a very underestimated actor and shows a great representation of a man in a bind looking for what he should do. J.T. Walsh (RIP to a great actor) is always a wonderful villain, as is Dennis Hopper. It is a pity that I have never made a higher profile in the business. Although I'm sure he has his followers. In general, this is a great movie that shows you that you do not need big bangs or a commercial soundtrack to be an entertaining movie.
