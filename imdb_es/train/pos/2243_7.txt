I thought that the whole film was beautifully developed with fresh images and an interesting cinematography throughout the process. The actors were on top of their character's back in an almost perfect time and they looked really good. The music was exuberant and well thought out. I even had a decent turn of an ending. So, what about everyone voting down? The story was not entirely fresh (it felt like a remnant of "Running Man" with the whole idea of ​​the television show), but the attitude towards Christianity and Judaism about how the public chooses their Messiah certainly sounded quite true . It made sense to follow this man who was put in front of a modern crowd and put him on a pedestal because of his chance. <br /> <br /> Christians or other religious people may pick it up because the film has the word "God" on it, but it shows what the filmmakers were trying to do is show a possibility to people who may never have seen the world in this way, especially in the modern world where Christianity has been increasingly accepted and forgotten. by some. <br /> <br /> I gave him a 7/10 star here on IMDb. I thought that every gram of the movie was entertaining and original, for the most part. Look at it if you're not offended to watch an entertaining film from Madrid, Spain, about the possibilities of the modern Messiah approaching a television set near you.
