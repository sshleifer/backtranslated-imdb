In the same way, Frank Miller and his comics of Sin City used black and white to express themselves (and their influences of black cinema), so does Christian Volckman with the Renaissance. <br /> <br /> It's the year 2054, in Paris. . In the tradition of science fiction, the future is a bright and brilliant jewel of several tears. This is a jewel in an environment of misery, inequality and darkness; Bright and beautiful at the top with a dark under belly below. One of these "bright" people at the top, a research scientist from a very large and influential global company (Avalon), is kidnapped. The well-known and efficient Captain Karas (with the voice of the new James Bond, Daniel Craig), has the task of finding it. <br /> <br /> The plot and the design are not too original. He is heavily influenced by Film Noir, Gibson Neuromancer and other detective stories, along with films like Blade Runner, Sin City, Metropolis and Minority Report by Fritz Lang. There is the main plot, surrounded by other possible subplots that connect at the end. It is not difficult to understand everything. <br /> <br /> The strength and originality of the film lies in its intense visual presentation. Paris is an intricate range of levels and sublevels. At its base is the most primitive industrial infrastructure. As the city rises, so does its architectural complexity and luminescence. However, in this structure, the upper part does not equal the elevation of human ideals and behavior. Paris has been intricately animated and designed in bright black and white. The film is closer in spirit to Sin City (the comics) and then to Sin City the film was with its original material. This becomes much easier, because it still remains in relatively the same medium; animation. In the same way that a Darkly scanner pushes the visual aspects of storytelling, so does this. The light and the dark, the black and white creates an atmosphere of contrasts, as well as visual ambiguity. Right and wrong, black and white can lose all meaning at the same time it is right in front of us. The film shows that white and black can be ambiguous and obvious at the same time. <br /> <br /> In keeping with the spirit of the film, I can be critical and fanatical. I can love and hate from the same light. It is definitely an experience that I recommend for lovers of the visual arts. So pour another Black and Tan, enter the void and enjoy the ride.
