Imagine being so hindered by a bureaucracy that a single man spends 8 years of his life and suffers a mental crisis that attempts to solve a mass murder case practically alone! The murder technique is clear, but a government that is unwilling to admit the truth allows a monster to destroy dozens of lives. When I think my work is stressful, I simply remember the true story behind this movie of wonder. The main character's devotion to duty was brilliantly portrayed by Rhea. The comic (and almost tragic at times) relationship between Rea and the character of Sutherland made this one of my favorite movies of the last 5 years. The capture of one of the worst mass murderers in history had me on the edge of my seat. Although not as well publicized and commented as "The silence of the lamb", the plot was equally suspense. Rent or buy this movie today!
