The part where Meg visits the mechanic and he says: "Is the piston firing?" (implying little sexual energy on the part of his girlfriend) was hilarious. I love Meg Ryan and she is as sweet as ever in this wonderful movie. Very friendly and very intelligent too. Her innocent and indignant expressions make you want her to be yours. The hero handles garage mechanics well for the transformation of the physicist. Einstein had a romantic side to his psyche? The round of puzzles in front of the press and the audience was done well. It is very underestimated and deserves praise and attempts of a revival. Lose a vote to include the very unlikely foolish theory that the US government is buying. UU I do not see why it does not appear in the 20 best romantic comedies of the century. Great movie, it has the seal of presidential approval!
