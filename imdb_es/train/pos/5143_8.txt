['With a fast interconnection of crazy scenes in an asylum, and the montage / superimposition of images, and vague and interrelated narrations, this is a very difficult movie to follow. Apparently, a man (Masue Inoue) takes a job as janitor or janitor in a nursing home so he can be near his imprisoned wife and perhaps rescue her. But she is clearly angry, huddled on the floor, with an empty expression most of the time and the fear, misery and confusion written on her face the rest of the time. The filmmaker changes to his point of view at times, and we see vague images of her next to a pond that chokes a baby, or that clings to a drowned child. She is tormented by something. When the point of view changes to her or to other angry people, the filmmaker uses distorting lenses and those things, showing us what the crazy people see and how they react. And the place is full of crazy people, laughing, hiding, and in one case dancing frantically day and night. At one point, the man tries to get his wife out, but the night at the door terrifies her and she runs back to her cell. Gradually, the man plunges into a nightmare in which he is interrupted in another attempt to steal it, and kills the doctor and many assistants, and all the time the crazy people laugh and applaud. When he wakes up he feels relieved, and cleans the floor. Some fascinating photos of Japanese life, streets, buildings in the 1920s.']
