SPOILERS This is an exciting movie about grifters. But who is cheating who here? When does the hunter become a prey? This dark and gritty film is slow and seductive. It attracts you and drags you down the proverbial garden path, only to find you right when you think you're safe. <br /> <br /> It has a fascinating script, with good performance (at least from the cables). I did not notice the background music, but it was never jarring, so it must have been done well. <br /> <br /> I was very surprised that I liked this movie, because I do not usually go for this. Gender, but this one absorbed me and kept him hooked until the end.
