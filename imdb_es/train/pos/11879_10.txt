This is one of my favorites of all time. <br /> <br /> If the movie has a flaw, it is that it appears as a furious bull. It does not attract the spectator as much as it assaults him. '' Scarface '' is a production as voracious and inflexible as Tony Montana himself. Nothing remains for the viewer's imagination. <br /> <br /> Moroder's languid synthesizer adapts to the action on a t-shirt. Like the chorus in a Greek tragedy, he laments and cries, broods and jerks, a constant reminder of Tony's inexorable fate. <br /> <br /> It's not so much a cautionary tale as a disaster in progress, "Scarface." Rips across the screen with the unstoppable strength of a runaway train.
