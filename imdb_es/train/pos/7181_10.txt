Eyeliner was used almost 6,000 years ago in Egypt. It really is not a stretch for it to be around the 12th century. I also did not notice the flopped series. There's a second season on the air now, right? It's amazing to me when the comments are made by people who are misinformed or who do not see any program. It is a waste of space in the tables and in the time of others. The first show of the series was perhaps a bit painful when the cast began to fit in its place, but that is what is expected of any show. The rest of the first season is excellent. I can hardly wait for the second season in the United States to begin.
