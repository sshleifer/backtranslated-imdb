Probably the best achievement of Bigas Luna is that he achieves a delicate balance between sleaze, eroticism and surrealism. The delightful Mathilda May, who spent most of Tobe Hooper's "Strength of Life" in the amateur, is the object of the pre-adolescent lust of young Biel Duran. She can not get May's breasts out of her mind and wants to both breastfeed and suck her own mother's breasts too. Your search for May is the movie. As in Luna's work as "Lulu" and "Jamon! Jamon!", The director brings a slightly distorted sexual sensibility to his strange but beautiful story. The usual suspects will be offended, but those with open minds will enjoy this sparkling erotic poem in the female breast. The images of Jos√© Luis Alcaine are beautiful and Nicola Piovani's score is sweet and rich. A magnificent cinematographic confection with a delicious anarchic sensibility that the Spaniards do naturally.
