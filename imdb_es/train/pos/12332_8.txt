After having seen the short number of times in marathons of horror movies, I think it is a comical parody that slices the main point of his reference. <br /> <br /> Although the themes are crispy and obsolete for today's viewers, it is by no means a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Although being a student film hardly gives rise to an excuse, the proof is that it seems to have been carefully crafted on a budget of little or nothing. br /> <br /> As another critic pointed out, it's less than ten minutes, which is enough time to clear the roof of the eye with a toast of joy, sit back and loaf through the movie. <br /> <br /> I think that this short bread of a movie should be enjoyed as an appetizer for the reference of the title and the viewer should relax and shoot with it.
