A single mother (Diane Keaton) is working in several minimum wage jobs. When she gets fired, she discovers that she can not support her children (Michael Seater and Colin Roberts), the last of whom has asthma. Then he goes to his friend and starts selling drugs. Very soon, she becomes addicted to the drugs she is selling. His life collapses, especially when his children, that is, his eldest son, discover the truth and threaten to leave it. So, she struggles to redeem herself with the help of her children, but can she protect her family from the drug lords she worked for? <br /> <br /> Wow! This lifelong movie has some of the best performances I've seen! Diane Keaton exaggerates a lot, and her character goes crazy, but she was extremely convincing. She adapts much better to drama than to comedy. However, the best performance in the film comes from Michael Seater, who plays his eldest son. He is perfect as the responsible son who is still young but tries to be the adult in the family. His performance was especially good in scenes where he confronts his mother about drugs. Colin Roberts, who plays the younger son, also does a great job. <br /> <br /> A movie worth watching, especially for the performance of Michael Seater and Diane Keaton!
