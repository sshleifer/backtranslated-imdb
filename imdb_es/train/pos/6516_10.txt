Hi. I just watched this movie earlier today for the 14th time in 3 days. I am a history teacher who has too much time on my hands. I need a life. I found the movie that had a striking resemblance to the broken mountain. I also found that I look a lot like Jean Lafitte if he were white. In addition, my favorite line in the whole movie was Mr. Petey: "this baby can shoot a squirrel 300 meters!" Oh, and my favorite scene in the movie was when the British came in, and the only drummer who was so dedicated to his work, and he drummed to death, as if that drum ended the war completely ... but he would not Well, that's all I'd like to say about this movie. OH, one more thing ... Brownie Brown is a crazy bipolar and bipolar physicist who is swinging BEEYOTCH. that is all.
