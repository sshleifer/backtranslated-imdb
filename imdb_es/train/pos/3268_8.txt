A lovely romantic comedy. The plot is a bit too complicated. I tried to summarize it three times and I can not. Suffice it to say that it is worth seeing. The movie is fun, beautiful, the plot is totally unreal, but it works. Everyone in the movie is very nice and everything looks very good: it creates a sweet and romantic feeling throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> The performance is excellent: Robert Downey Jr. and Cybill Shepherd are in top form and enjoy every second. Ryan O'Neal and Mary Stuart Masterson are fine, but fine. If you are a fan of good and sweet sentimental movies (like me), catch this one. Downey also looks great in his underwear! <br /> <br /> Additional Bonuses: the title song sung by Johnny Mathis and another great song "After All" sung by Cher and Peter Cetera.
