['I had lost faith in Sooraj R. Barjatya after the movie Main Prem Ki Deewani hoon, and a year ago I saw promotions for Vivah that looked good. But I did not want to waste my hard earned money watching it at the movies. When the movie first came out on DVD, I rented it, I saw it, I loved the movie and I recovered my words for Sooraj. I just finished seeing him again yesterday and this time I thought I had to review this movie. Sooraj R. Barjatya He got it right this time, well, he was not a big fan of Hum App Ke Hai Kaun. But I&#39;ve always loved Manie Pyar kiya, after Manie Pyar Kiya, I think Vivah is Barjaty&#39;s best work. I almost never cry in a movie, but this movie made me feel like crying. If you have ever been in love before, there will be many moments that will touch you in this movie, the film is too sweet and will make you fall in love with it, my opinion is a very underestimated movie. <br /><br /> The story of this film could be called desi and very old times, but to me it seemed modern because the two couples who are married are aware that it is an old tradition. It is done in the current times, many people do not believe in this marriage agreement, but I do. The journey between commitment and the wedding, which will always be special and this film shows it clearly. When Prem meets Poonam for the first time, they show him how he is and that is the reality, and my parents said that they got married and showed it in such a real way that the Prem and Poonam people know each other in this movie. It&#39;s like most marriages happen. It was very sweet, you feel nervous but excited, the song &quot;Do Ajnabe&quot; shows it very well. Going back to the story, yes, it&#39;s a trip that you soon get stuck between Prem and Poonam (Shahid Kapoor and Amrita Rao) and their families. There is a turn in this movie that is really good, the last 30 minutes you will all be reaching for the tissue box. <br /><br /> What makes this film so surprising is the chemistry between Prem and Poonam, the way they fall in love is too sweet. Simple boy and Simple Girl, when they meet for the first time during and after the song &quot;Do Anjane Ajnabe&quot;. It is very nice to see, almost does not say anything and Prem speaks with sincerity about his past and the girl who liked him and him. of smoking. Then he takes them all to have a family trip and that&#39;s when they really fall in love. It makes you just want to look at the couple and see all the sweet moments they have. Another factor is that Poonam chichi is really bad with her and you feel bad for her because they have treated her badly and makes you want to see her happy and when she finally finds happiness, you also begin to feel happy with her. Fall in love with Poonam more than just Prem. When you find happiness through Prem, you want her to stay happy and also hope that nothing goes wrong because the character appears as a sweet and simple girl. What brings me to the performances and Amrita Roa as Poonam is amazing in the movie, her best work to date will make you fall in love with this innocent character and encourage her to find happiness. Shahid Kapoor as Prem is also amazing, he is the support of Poonam in the film, he is his happiness in the film, together they share an incredible chemistry and I have never seen a cuter couple since SRK and Kajol. If Ishq Vishk did not touch you to tell you how pretty they are together, surely he will. &quot;Mujhe Haq hai&quot;, the song and before that is an amazing chemistry they show. The scenes that moved me were when Prem takes Poonam to his room and shows him that they will stay there, he opens it and they have a moment between them that is too sweet. Again, if you&#39;ve ever been in love with someone, these scenes with which you can definitely connect. The movie is the sweetest thing you&#39;ll ever see. <br /><br /> The direction is right, for me a good movie is basically something that can attract me and stop me to believe that in these hours what you see here is false and there is a camera that is filing them. For me, this movie attracted me and during those three hours I felt really connected to the movie. The songs that you will really like when you have seen the movie, since they are songs placed in the situation after I saw the movie, I have been playing the songs without stopping. The music is amazing, the story is just amazing, what else can I ask for? <br /><br /> What I can finally say is that we seldom get a movie that makes us feel good, this movie, once you&#39;ve seen it, will make you feel really good and make you want to be a better person. It&#39;s basically the sweetest trip of all time, it basically shows you the way between commitment and marriage, and many people say it&#39;s the best part of your life ... Well, this movie actually shows you how people really says that Why do people really say that the trip is so incredible? Watch this movie and you will discover why the trip is incredible.']
