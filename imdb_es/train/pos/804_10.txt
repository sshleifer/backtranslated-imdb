No, there is another! <br /> <br /> Because all the Star Wars fans had to have an opinion about I, II and III and because that opinion was partial since we missed both the atmosphere and the characters of the original trilogy I will declare the positive points of "The Return of the Jedi" and some corresponding negative points of the prequel. Of course, I loved the music, the special effects, the two droids, but this has been debated too much elsewhere. <br /> <br /> What we get in the original trilogy and in this particular film: - A great ecological concern - Antimilitarist positions - Fascinating ideas about the Jedi Order and the Force - Cute creatures - Harrison Ford Smile - A murderous scene: Near the end, when Vader looks alternately at his son and at the Emperor. The lightning bolt of lethal rays was reflected in his black helmet. And when he catches and betrays his Master to save Luke, risking his own life! Oh boy! <br /> <br /> What is wrong with the INMHO prequel: - all the element of the "human factor" that the original cast could push forward is somewhat lost. The Force seems to be more about super powers and deadly leaps, than about wisdom - Too many Jedis at once and too many Light Sabers on the screen - The lack of experience of some actors often threatens the coherence of the plot <br /> <br / > By the way, if I enjoy the theory of the Force as explained by Obi Web (Obi Wen, I mean) and Yoda, then I should read some books about Buddhism and the forms it adopted in ancient Japan. <br /> <br /> The magic of Star Wars, IMHO is mainly based on the continuous spiritual inheritance of a master to his apprentice, from a father to his son, though difficulties. "De mon âme à ton âme", (from my soul to yours), as Bejard would write to the late Zen master T. Deshimaru.
