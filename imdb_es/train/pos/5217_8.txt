I caught this movie late at night on the cable, and I was pleasantly surprised. I can only imagine that the reason why this film was not known better, is because the subject is very disturbing. But if you can handle the issue of sexual abuse, it's a well-acted, suspenseful and very interesting movie. Both Richard Gere and Claire Daines are very good at that. And although the subject is not for the weakest of heart, the film is not brutal either (like 8 mm, for example). <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys it. Serial killer and suspense movies.
