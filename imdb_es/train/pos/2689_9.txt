['This is a warm and funny movie, very similar to the works of Almod√≥var. I&#39;m sure he has a 10-year-old boy who sucks milk from his breasts, but the style is so playful that I can not understand all the readers who found him sick or perverted (but I&#39;d be willing to let my 10-year-old son play the part ? I&#39;m not sure!). <br /><br /> Spanish cinema is often quite sexual, but in a very open and healthy way that leaves the viewer without any sense of voyeurism or twist. I think if the Northern European guys had the same attitude, we would be much better as a result. <br /><br /> This liberal attitude is also seen in the hilarious character of &#39;Fartman Maurice&#39;. As his lover tells him: &#39;Most people are ashamed to have farts. You make it an art form.']
