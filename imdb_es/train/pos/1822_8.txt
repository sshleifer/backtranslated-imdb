['An unforgettable masterpiece by the creator of The Secret of Nimh and The Land Before Time, this was a very moving bittersweet caricature. I remember it very well from my childhood, it was fun, sad and very beautiful. Well, it starts a little dark, a dog that escaped the pound, and is killed by an old friend, ends in heaven and returns. But it becomes sweet when you make friends with an orphan girl who can talk to animals. Some scenes were a bit scary as opposed to other cartoons, like the sequence of dreams of Charlie, but everything else was fine and the songs were fair. A memorable role of Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise, I love that guy, hehehe. And Judith Barsi of Jaws The Revenge, may God rest her soul, poor girl, she did not deserve to die, but now she is in Heaven, all good people go to Heaven. In general, this is a very good animated film, a Don Bluth classic enough to embarrass the anime and Disney. Recommended for the whole family. And you know this, if you have the original video of this, you&#39;ll find it after the movie, Dom DeLuise has a very important and special message, that you should love that guy, hehehe.']
