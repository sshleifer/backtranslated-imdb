The writers Perry and Randy Howze produced a very attractive little story in "Chances Are". <br /> <br /> Using the idea of ​​a reincarnated man who returns to his ex-wife's house many years later, the plot becomes unexpected and charming. <br /> <br /> Robert Downey, twenty-four years old, Jr. offers a charming presentation, with the help of Cybil Shepherd as a widow and Ryan O'Neal as a good friend. <br /> <br /> This trio has the right chemistry for this race, playing with each other with an elegant style. I have seen this movie several times on television, and each time I found it more enjoyable.
