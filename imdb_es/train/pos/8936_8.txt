After "Beau Travail", everyone waited for Claire Denis to make a follow-up masterpiece that never came. Now you have. Denis takes a quantum leap in this film, an orgy of magnificent cinematography, elliptical editing and intentionally obscures narrative events that feel strange and even act as strangers. There is a nominal plot (derived in part from Jean-Luc Nancy's book of the same name) about a mature man who needs a heart transplant and who is looking for a Tahitian son he left a long time ago; But above all it is an exploration of the idea of ​​personal and cultural intrusions. It takes a couple of visits to fully understand it, and it has rhythm problems near the end, but it's still more advanced and exciting than anything else I've seen this year. You lose it at your own risk.
