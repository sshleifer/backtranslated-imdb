I would recommend this movie to everyone. Not only the fans of the rocker Luciano Ligabue, but all moviegoers. Because it is sincere, moving, fun and true. Because Ligabue is a born narrator and lover of the film, and each frame of his film is made with love and care. Because his characters are loved and ask to be loved. Because most of the Italian debut films are miserable and this, made by a stranger, is a real joy to see and hear. Because Stefano Accorsi is beautiful and reminds me of Andrea Pazienza, who was, like Freccia, beautiful, talented and good, and lost her life due to heroin, which Ligabue shows as it is, unattractive and ugly, without falling into easy moralisms. Because it is a film that speaks to our heart, to our ears, to our souls. And because I lived the experience of FM radios and it was exactly like that. Thanks, Luciano!
