When I see most of the criticism, it's called 'a misfire for Eddie Murphy'. These critics want to take a look at some of the things he's doing these days, and maybe soften his posture in retrospect ... "The golden boy" is not an intellectual entertainment, but thanks to some of the actors, it gives new life to the old Clichés, and gives Murphy one of his best roles. I do not understand, at all, the dominant lack of "love" for their efforts. Perhaps it was launched at a time when the establishment had grown weary of the exciting and exciting adventures of a minute? Steven Spielberg started with Indiana Jones; It is unfair to make him a scapegoat when what is possibly his greatest sin is also completely harmless. There is nothing necessarily wrong with trying to take advantage of trends. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is nonsense, but even an occasional observer should be able to understand that "ridiculous" is where the idea of ​​Hollywood mysticism begins and ends. What is more important than credibility with a story like this is that the public has tourist guides at their disposal to show them the mysterious places. Michael Ritchie and Eddie Murphy adjusted perfectly to this ability. My advice to you is to buy the ticket and take the ride.
