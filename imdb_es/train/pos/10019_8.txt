When it comes to movies I can be quite demanding, and I will complain about everything and everything that is done wrong. While each film has its flaws, The Night Listener had an exceptionally low count. <br /> <br /> If you read the last revision (it was difficult, since half was written in capital letters and did not contain real information about the film), you may have been led to believe that this movie was not very well made . Unfortunately, if he read more than 3 lines in that same review, he discovered the reason for the poster's disdain: he / she does not like the fact that the director is gay (or that the production team smokes crack ... apparently) . <br /> <br /> Then, even though I have never written a review before, I thought that this film deserved one based on its merits, not on the sexual orientation of its director. Let's first review a quick checklist: 1. Great plot? Absolutely. I will not leave out, but the plot is very convincing and definitely not what one would expect based on commercials. This is a thriller, not a horror, and should be approached as such. The story will really surprise you, even more because it is true (and the plot remained fairly true to the real events). <br /> <br /> 2. Wonderful to act? Oh yeah. Robin Williams has long freed himself from comedy-type chains, and since then he has blossomed into serious roles for which many people would have dismissed him just a decade ago. Once again, he achieves a high level in his role in The Night Listener, playing a radio host who becomes increasingly concerned and entangled in a case of ... well, I'll let you see for yourself. <br /> <br /> 3. Excellent address Certainly. Now, unlike the other poster I referred to, I actually know something about the address. I've been stitching the art of management at school for 3 years. Of course, I really do not think that makes a difference (the only thing that matters is whether YOU like the address), but I thought that I should simply establish once again that I am basing my opinions on something substantial and relevant ... for example : not the director's sexual orientation (or the alleged drug habits of the production team, LOL). <br /> <br /> The direction of Patrick Stettner was sullen and dark, and allowed angles and lighting to help create those much-sought feelings of "tension and release" instead of the quick and messy camera work and the quick cuts to which we are subjected today. Some people can really show you a story through their camera, while others feel they have to create the story with the camera. I really appreciate that someone these days has the courage to use the camera as it is supposed to be used, which is like an eyeball through which we all see. <br /> <br /> 4. Lighting, cinematography and editing? Great all around. I already wrote a lot, and I could continue with these last three things for another ten paragraphs, so I'll simply summarize it. <br /> <br /> In short, go see this movie. Do not listen to people who have external reasons to destroy it, especially if they are so stupid that they unknowingly reveal that motive 1/4 of the way through its publication. Enjoy the show! -Ben
