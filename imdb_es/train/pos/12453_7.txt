Unfortunately, many consumers who write comments for IMDb equate a low budget with no good. Anything else this film may need, more budget is really not part of it. Big sets and many special effects would have made it another Lara Croft movie. What we have here is a step or two better than that. <br /> <br /> The almost unknown Alexandra Staden is captivating as the enigmatic modesty, and this is crucial for this movie to work. Their wise smiles and their wise looks are formidable, and you find yourself wishing that the camera does not lose face. It makes feasible that the bad Nikolai, played by the little known (at least in the United States) Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, may have an unusually cerebral interest in her, something that modesty can exploit. She is able to deflect her violation with just a push and spitting "Stop wasting my time!" then assaulting himself among his henchmen heavily armed but suddenly timid. Making such a plausible scene does not happen by accident. <br /> <br /> Probably the biggest problem I have with the modest Staden who plays modesty is that it's not very credible that she goes hand in hand with a muscular, athletic guy like Coaster-Waldau and hit him. She simply is not a Peta Wilson or an actress of the Hilary Swank type who can give a convincing blow. Coaster-Waldau, letting himself be dominated by Staden, seems to be just fighting with his little sister. <br /> <br /> Since this is not really an action movie, this is not a big flaw. I just hope that they do better in that if and when they do sequels.
