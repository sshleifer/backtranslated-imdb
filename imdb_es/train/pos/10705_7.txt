The trailer for this movie did not do justice to the movie. And although the film did not know what I really wanted to convey, the first half of the film was a romantic comedy and the second has a more serious and romantic drama, the overall impact was much better than I thought. be. This movie was more of a date movie, but the trailer became more of a suspense thriller than it ever turned out to be. Kidman, being one of my favorites, of course I'm partial, but this movie proved to be a light, sensitive, if somewhat extravagant, movie that deserved better. Three out of four stars. 5/5/02.
