As an enthusiastic fan, I recommend this film as true to the facts and well acted. When I was 11 years old and I lived in Istanbul, I heard some friends talk about a new musical sensation that caused the girls to scream. I thought hmmmm, if girls like them, they must be crap. My only albums until then were Haley Mills, The Everly Brothers and Ricky Nelson. Shortly after, while on vacation with the family in a military cafeteria in Ismir, I heard a song (which I later learned was 'Love Me Do') and I was surprised at the difference between her and all the songs I had heard so far. When I listened to the album 'Meet The Beatles' by my older brother, I was hooked for life. After having read the definitive book of its beginnings (by Davis), I was surprised that this film followed the facts very well, with the exception of leaving aside most of the sex and part of the use of drugs (touched the use of metadrine / dexadrine). >
