The performance of the Noni Hazlehurst force tour (which won him an AFI award) is at least on par with his effort at FRAN three years later. Colin Friels is also good and, for those who are interested, Alice Garner appears as Noni's daughter, and Michael Caton (better known as THE CASTLE) is a bearded painter. (Interestingly, Hazlehurst is currently the host of the BETTER HOMES AND GARDENS lifestyle program, and Caton is the host of property type programs that include HOT PROPERTY, HOT AUCTION, etc.). This film reaffirms the popular belief that Noni was Arguably the leading actress in Australia from the early to mid-eighties. Score: 79/100.
