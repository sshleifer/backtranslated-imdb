Being a transplanted New Yorker, he could be more critical than most when he sees City Hall. But I must say that even before getting to the story I was captivated by the shooting in the place and the political atmosphere of the city of New York that created the director Harold Becker. <br /> <br /> For example, there is a reference to the Woerner's restaurant in Brooklyn, where the political boss Frank Anselmo likes to eat. There is a Woerner's restaurant on Remsen Street in downtown Brooklyn when he lived in New York in 1996. In fact, he was favored by politicians in the Borough, although they had two other meeting places. <br /> <br /> No wonder because the script was co-authored by Nicholas Pileggi, who still writes stories of organized and political crime. Get to know the environment well and know how these two worlds intersect as they do in this movie. <br /> <br /> A detective played by Nestor Serrano goes to an unofficial meeting with a relative of the mafia boss Anthony Franciosa and things explode and three people end up dead, including an innocent 6-year-old boy whose father I accompanied the school. The story grows and, in the end, it is reached inside the Town Hall. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino plays Mayor John Pappas and John Cusack is his deputy mayor, a transplanted Louisianan, a state that has a tradition of delicate corruption. He is the outsider here and while trying to control the damage, Cusack finds more than he expected, <br /> <br /> Danny Aiello plays Brooklyn political boss Frank Anselmo and for those of you who are not from New York , his character is based on the late president of Queens, Donald Manes, who was also shot down by scandal. He is the type of Brooklyn politician I met on the day whose friendship with organized crime and the favors that were done for them, to Aiello. <br /> <br /> The City Hall was the farewell performance in Anthony Franciosa's film. Of the most underestimated and less appreciated talents on the screen. Nobody sees anyone else when it's on. <br /> <br /> The best moment of Al Pacino is when at the funeral of the murdered child, he takes charge of the process and makes it a political triumph for him. His is a complex part, he is a decent enough man, but caught up in the corruption that is needed to grow up in a place like New York. <br /> <br /> For those who want to know about political life in the Big Apple, the City Council is highly recommended.
