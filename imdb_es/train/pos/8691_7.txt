A cinéaste maestro Alain Resnais likes to work with those actors who are part of his family. In this film we also see members of the Resnais family such as Pierre Arditi, Sabine Azema, André Dussolier and Fanny Ardant who deal with serious issues such as death, religion, suicide. , love and its general implications in our daily lives. The formal nature of the relationship shared by these people is evident, even as friends, they address each other through a formal "I". In 1984, while creating L'amour à mort, Resnais grappled with time. , memory and space to unravel the mysteries of a fundamental question of human existence: is love stronger than death? Sixteen years ago, in 1968, Resnais made a somewhat similar movie, Je t'aime Je t'aime, which also dealt with love and memories. The message of this film is loud and clear: true and deep love can even embarrass science. Dead lovers recover their lost lives by leaving doctors in charge of their reputation. L'ourour à mort is like a game that is not didactic at all. It is a film in which the musical score is in perfect harmony with their images. This is one. of the reasons why this movie can be easily captured.
