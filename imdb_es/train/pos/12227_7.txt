I searched for this after seeing the hilarious and challenging linguistically "Clueless" (1995), perhaps the best known effort of Alicia Silverstone since the beginning of her film career. "True Crime" has Kevin Dillon, who should be useful to improve most film projects. In fact, everyone in the cast does a good job. The only disappointment that I think the film has for me is an uncomfortable "feeling" in some of the scenes, due to the need to execute a rather intransigent and older theme as part of what in tone begins as a schoolgirl adventure . <Br /> <br /> Alicia Silverstone is pretty good in this case. He gets along with the naive enthusiasm and the growing uneasiness that affects Mary Giordano as she maneuvers towards the truth behind the serial murders. I calculate that your characterization of MG also has some mileage. The inference from the storyline is that she continues a career in law enforcement. It could be very interesting that a senior Silverstone revisits Giordano in a moment of crisis later in the officer's life. Just a thought! <br /> <br /> "True Crime" shows its director in a good light. Pat Verducci also has the writing credit. I do not know of any other film work that PV has done. I can only wonder what happened after such a promising start. <br /> <br /> Like most productions, this has a fairly unknown cast, although Bill Nunn (Detective Jerry Guinn) is not that. Over the past decade, he seems to have been able to secure an impressive number of screen appearances. I remember seeing it recently in "Carriers" (1998), a TV presentation with a military theme. Bill Nunn played "Captain Arends". Fans of the American television comedy show "Who's the Boss" may also be interested in "Carriers" because the protagonist is Judith Light, remembered with affection by many due to her long participation in the program. <br /> <br /> "True crime" may not have worked easily, but it works well. I think it's an entertaining story that is worth seeing.
