An old family story told to two girls by his grandfather comes alive 16 years later, as he predicted. <br /> <br /> People are killed and blood is spilled and rats are running everywhere and naked bodies are enjoyed. <br /> <br /> Kitty (Barbara Bouchet) is the suspect, but we know that she is not the murderer. Is it Franziska (Marina Malfatti)? Is Evelyn from death for revenge? Is it a plot to steal an inheritance? The color is excellent in this thriller by Emilio Miraglia, who only made another Giallo, as far as I know. <br /> <br /> The only thing that ruined the movie was the appearance that several frames were cut out. Someone calls the police, and suddenly they are there trying to save Kitty.
