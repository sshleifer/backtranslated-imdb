['Well, no, I&#39;m telling a lie, in fact it&#39;s not the best movie of all time, but it&#39;s a really nice movie that nobody I&#39;ve seen has seen. <br /><br /> It&#39;s a friend&#39;s police movie starring Jay Leno and Pat Morita (Mr. Miyagi) with a fluff story about a prototype of a lost-car engine or something like that, but that does not matter. The reason why this film is funny is due to the interaction between the two protagonists, who initially get upset and distrust each other, but in a surprising turn of destiny they become friends. All the cultural difference is quite good, since it is fun to watch, it is completely ridiculous but in a cheesy and pleasant way. The soundtrack is great, once again in a cheesy 80s style, it adapts to the movie, I&#39;ve been trying to find one of the songs for years, but as I work by memory I remember what I think some of the words where I can not seem to find it. <br /><br /> Another thing that this movie has is the most fantastic reward of all, but I will not reveal it, oh no! In conclusion, I would take this film in more than 48 hours, most of Eddie Murphy&#39;s production, including the Beverly Hills police, and any friends that Jackie Chan or Martin Lawrence have in their names. If you&#39;re looking for a friend&#39;s cops movie and you&#39;re getting sick of &quot;the white cop encountering the streetwise black cop,&quot; give him a shot. You may be pleasantly surprised because this overturns the entire formula with &quot;the Japanese policeman meets the white policeman on the street&quot;. <br /><br /> I&#39;m giving it 7. to be honest, I like it more than that. I prefer to see this than many things that would give 8. But I think that deep down I know it&#39;s a kind of madness that makes me like this movie.']
