Samuel Fuller brings his usual playful and elegant style to this sordid and pulpy story, and manages to create one of the undiscovered gems of the cinema of the 1950s. <br /> <br /> Richard Widmark plays a minor thief (a role that perfected the course of many films), which snatches the wallet of a young lady (Jean Peters) in a subway in New York and with it a piece of microfilm very wanted. This is 1953, so, of course, the microfilm is owned by communist spies who will stop at nothing to recover it. When the girl appears in the shack on the bank of Widmark, sent by an abusive boyfriend to claim the film, Widmark feels the opportunity to shake her and her "comrades" for large amounts of money. The plot is complicated, people begin to die, and Widmark and Peters fall in love. <br /> <br /> Fuller handles the love story clumsily, but more for a sense of indifference than for bad writing or direction. It's as if he included a love story under pressure, and so he intentionally made it incredible, since love stories were so often and continue to be in Hollywood movies. Peters offers extraordinary performance as a tough New Yawk cookie, partly gangster and partly damsel in distress. When violence occurs against her, we really care about her well-being, and it's typical of Fuller's renegade style, ahead of its time, that a happy ending is not necessarily an inevitable conclusion. <br /> <br /> But the final success of "Pickup on South Street" rests squarely on the tired shoulders of the world of Thelma Ritter, who plays Moe, a feisty woman who earns money in any way she can , either selling neckties or acting as a police informant. Ritter gives the performance of his career; in an impressive monologue, she transmits without even talking directly about the sad trajectory of her character's life and the despair she feels when she awakes each morning to a world of struggle, crime and difficulties. It is as if all the characters that Ritter played converge in a brief moment to vent all the emotions that they did not have the opportunity to vent in those other films. The scene is the highlight of Fuller's film, and the highlights of the cinema of the 50s, period. <br /> <br /> Grade: A +
