Here is another movie from the 80s that most people simply do not know exists. This slow and picturesque (the amorous photos of Montana's landscapes are impressive and reminded me of Costner's recent "Open Range," which was also starring Robert Duval), and an emotionally satisfying movie is the perfect kind of movie to see Night when you can Do not sleep or on an apathetic Sunday afternoon. Those in the right mood will receive a detailed and intimate look at the pain of a family and how they get back together after the youngest son accidentally shoots and kills the eldest son while hunting. The performances are all first class and are subtly nuanced. Glenn Close, Robert Duval and Wilford Brimley are perfect in their performances, as are all supporting players and young actors. I especially liked how the director Cain (who, unfortunately, has not directed anything important since this, except the first "Young Guns") gives us small and silent glimpses into the personal pain of everyone. Not only do we see how death affects the younger brother or the parents, but also the confused middle sister, the wayward uncle, his crazy wife and the girlfriend of the dead teenager. What essentially arrived here is the rural Midwest response to "Common People." There are also nuances of "The Straight Story" by David Lynch in some of the moral stoicisms of the people of the Midwest represented here and also in the lovemaking of the farmland they inhabit. This is one of the best and most realistic "shooters of tears" of the era, and a small find for the quality movie hunters that exist.
