A director for the first time (Bromell) has assembled a small but powerful cast to see the world of a middle class, middle class, depressed hit man and his struggle with his relationship with his father. This film in less than 90 minutes presents an incredibly interesting contrast in human nature. David Dorfman as the 6 year old son of William H. Macy is the most refreshing little actor I have seen in a long time. Macy is brilliant in a part that almost seems written for him as a tortured author struggling to break the reins of his father and his business. It is always good to see Donald Sutherland and here he is wonderful as Macy's cruel father. The alternative audio track of the film is worth listening to the director explaining how he selected the cast, the locations and the movie. The basic 2-channel Dolby sound is suitable for this movie and is well recorded. Cinematography creates the atmosphere together with a very subtle musical background. Any movie buff or observer of human nature will enjoy this, especially if he is a fanatic of contradiction.
