Another masterpiece of Woo! <br /> <br /> This is the best wuxie movie I've seen! Woo - RULEZ forever (except some Hollywood moments ...). John Woo, senior director of the century. <br /> <br /> He may not be more intellectual than many of the Great Directors ... But he is the lyrical and spiritual idol of all free-minded people! <br /> <br /> His films like great poetry! Woo is a Sheakspeare movie! Woo is a Biron movie! Woo is a Mozart from Bloodshet! <br /> <br /> Violent IMHO in Woo's films is not a thirst for directors, but an instrument of art. Themes of Woo movies is more humanistic than more of the new movies.
