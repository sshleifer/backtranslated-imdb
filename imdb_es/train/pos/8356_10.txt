I'm not sure if this counts as a spoiler or not, so be careful: <br /> <br /> Just a small but crucial thing to keep in mind, an intriguing possibility: the guys steal a green Citroen at a point , for a pleasure trip, and return it to the owner after having done an intentional and vengeful hidden damage to the automobile, in the hope that the owner will crash. Is it the same car that the picnic family is stolen much later? We know that the original owner sold it. They move away at the end of a dangerous road, one that, I understand, has been closed to all except pedestrians for the past ten years. A whole new bias towards the end of the film. <br /> <br /> In another matter, this movie could have been called "The Scent of a Woman". I do not remember another film, certainly not American, that treats the scent of a woman in such a frank and open manner, like the "nose" of a good Bordeaux.
