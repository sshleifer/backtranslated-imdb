After having found this movie on the Fox movie channel on a lazy Friday afternoon, I can not think of a better way to spend a lazy Friday afternoon and then put the value of my two cents. Especially when you consider the lack of comments from users. Do not all movies, good or bad, deserve more than four comments? And this movie is not bad at all. <br /> <br /> The first thing that should be taken into account when watching a movie like April Love is to remember the time from which it emerged, in this case at the end of the fifties. The movies were almost a happy medium back then. The movie theaters lacked tragedy, while the screens were full of wide-screen Technicolor movies to keep people away from the gray glow of the mean evil in a box called television. I do not know how many people were taken from the teat tube to see this, but it managed to capture my attention for 97 minutes. <br /> <br /> The teen idol Pat Boone plays Nick Conover, a young teenager sent to live with his aunt Henrietta (Jeanette Nolan) and his uncle Jed (Arthur O'Connell) in the country after being put to try to steal a car. It seems that his aunt and uncle have lost their own son (Jed Jr.), so Uncle Jed seems to have lost his enthusiasm for living. Aunt Henrietta hopes that Nick is on the farm in some way will get Jed out of his stalemate. Of course, this guy's stories are what they are, Jed and Nick do not care too much for each other. Jed then proceeds to meet with the neighbors, Fran (Dolores Michaels) and Liz (Shirley Jones) Templeton. Immediately Jed falls in love with Fran, and of course I do not have to tell him that Liz falls in love with Jed. Then there is the matter of Uncle Jed's horse, a trotter who has gone crazy and will not let anyone handle him since the death of Jed Jr. He can probably complete everything that happens from that moment on his own, seeing that there is There are no real surprises. However, it does not matter, you will have fun anyway. <br /> <br /> Once you get over the image of Pat Boone, who is a supposedly bad child, you will not have problems with the rest of the image. movie. Given that, Boone has a surprisingly good performance as Nick. Certainly, the role does not require much depth, but even so it is a job well done when you least expect it. Like Jed, Arthur O'Connell is the perfect choice for the role. At first, it's unattainable and cold, but as it warms up slowly with Nick, we see that it's really a good guy. Jeannette Nolan is very funny as Henrietta, who constantly plays the role of mediator between Jed and Nick. Shirley Jones takes a break from Rodgers And Hammerstein and has some opportunities to please us with her singing talents. Like Liz, she's beautiful to look at, great to listen to, and quite funny at times. Dolores Michaels as Fran, who is a bit more wild, is equally entertaining. <br /> <br /> The best thing about April Love is that there is no real intricate character of any kind on the screen. . There is no real villain in the whole thing. Everyone is so nice that you can not help but enjoy the movie. Honestly, I find it quite refreshing, something like leaving behind your problems and enjoying a summer picnic with friends. Think of it like the old Andy Griffith show with musical numbers, a bit more plot and widescreen Technicolor. The songs are a mix, with the title song April Love being the best of them. Another thing that I really liked is that they did not resort to the use of blue screen backgrounds during the horse racing sequences, and that is why they are much more entertaining and exciting. In fact, you will find that the whole movie is very well photographed and it was nice to see that they did not skimp on that department. The chemistry between Jones and Boone is good. Best of all is how the dislike between Nick and Jed is portrayed, as each attempt tries to gain the respect of others. <br /> <br /> This movie will never be confused with the great cinema. However, sometimes, instead of going to Disneyland, you just need a good trip in the park, and that's what April Love is. <br /> <br /> My rating: B + <br /> <br />
