An entertaining, slow-paced and entertaining erotic thriller with many graphic and "blasphemous" scenes that will undoubtedly bother some viewers. However, it will be difficult even for them not to appreciate the various imaginative sequences that this film contains, or to ignore Krabbe's top-level performance. Verhoeven maintains an intriguing ambivalence throughout the film, playing with the meaning of the visions-omens of the hero. Unfortunately, in the last 5 minutes everything becomes blurry, and the unsatisfactory ending is not as good as the rest of the movie. (***)
