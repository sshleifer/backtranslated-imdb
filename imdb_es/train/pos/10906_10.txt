I have a two-year-old son who suffers the same condition as Jonny Kennedy. I never had the opportunity to meet him, but I have never heard anyone say a bad word about him. I hope you know how much the completion of this program contributed to your fellow sufferers in raising awareness of this terrible condition. This man has touched people in a way that a million charitable leaflets could not. I think that this should be mandatory visualization in schools. I also agree with other comments, what do I have to regret? He took everything that life could throw at him and still managed to preserve his sense of humor. God bless. I could not see the part that showed that their bandages had changed. I have enough problems with my son's.
