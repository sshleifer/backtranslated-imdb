I've seen the movie Holes and I say it has to be the best movie all year long. Take out the child in all. I mean, who would think of having problematic children digging holes as their punishment? Louis Sachar is who. Although the film was different from the book, it was still very good. For example, Caveman / Stanley was supposed to be the largest there. Weight in height and height, but ZigZag / Ricky was taller and Armpit / Theodore was bigger. X-Ray / Rex was also supposed to be one of the youngest children, but it was not. The only thing I did not like about the movie was that the flashbacks were quite persuasive and long. I would have preferred to see the present more than the past, but that is only my opinion. Although I especially like the work of the boys. Like Squid / Alan, who was played by Jake M.Smith, he was supposed to be a whimsical, tough kid. Jake M.Smith did just that and did a great job like almost all the actors in Holes. So I would say if you have not seen Holes yet, then you should definitely see it when it comes out again or you'll miss a lot of fun.
