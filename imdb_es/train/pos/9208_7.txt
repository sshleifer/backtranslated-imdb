"The Shooter" was a different kind of movie for Michael Dudikoff. Although it is usually associated with action films that incorporate martial arts, this film, because it was a western, allowed him to demonstrate that he is a much more capable actor than certain lines of the history of formulas have allowed. <br /> <br /> The problem, of course, is that the film does not allow any solid development of the characters. The data download is really left to the viewer. We can only guess the sadness that has made the Shooter, whose real name is Michael Atherton, the killer that is, a murderer, of course, that a small town, terrified by a local bully, welcomes like a hero who can free from his misery.
