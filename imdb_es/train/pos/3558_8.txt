Along with the South Pacific, Guys and Dolls is for adults, is bold, sexy and full of men being men and women tied. <br /> <br /> There's an energy and momentum that makes this stand out from the pack: the strength of Jean Simmond's performance and the charm of a young Brando, and an already Sinatra teacher adds a lot to the feeling and The general appearance of the piece. <br /> <br /> Guys and Dolls wins since it has no shame what it is: an MGM musical. <br /> <br /> It is still good to watch and listen also with great melodies and dance numbers: it will continue to be one of the 20th century film classics and will be seen with Placer in the coming years. <br /> <br /> With pleasure.
