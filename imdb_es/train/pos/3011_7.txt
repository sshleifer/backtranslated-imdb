One of Vance's best films is most successful in an interesting plot and artistic direction on the part of Michael Curtiz. This time, a generally hated financier is found dead in the head, in his locked room on the top floor. Philo Vance, upon learning of the situation when he was about to leave for Italy, decides to end his vacation and try to solve what he believes is murder and what everyone else considers a suicide. William Powell is a Philo Vance as affable as you will find. He never seems to press and is always very gentle in what he says and does. Powell is assisted by a lot of very talented actors, some top-class actors and actresses like Mary Astor as a niece who hated her uncle, Ralph Morgan as secretary of the dead man, Paul Cavanaugh as a fan of the rival dog, Arthur Hohl as the mysterious butler, Helen Vinson as the neighbor kept the blonde, and two really good performances of James Lee as the Chinese cook and the portly Eugene Palette as a police detective who makes cruel judgments. Add a wonderfully comical turn of Etienne Girardot to the mix as a public forensic scientist who always misses his food. It is this depth of suspects and a story that has many twists and turns that make The Kennel Murder Case a quick and fun mystery.
