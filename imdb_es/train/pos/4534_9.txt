Without pretending to be a satire of D.W. Griffith's intolerance, The Three Ages was Buster Keaton's first attempt at a comedy feature film. The only similarities with intolerance are the opening scene of the "book" and the fact that similar stories over the centuries are edited together in a complete movie. Keaton's reasoning for appropriating this style was that if he did not succeed as a feature film, it could be reduced to three reelers. Fortunately, The Three Ages triumphs brilliantly as a comedy and contains some of the funniest routines I've seen in any of Keaton's films. There is nothing unique or daring about the lines of history. They are simple plots of boy with girl, boy with loss, boy with girl, but the satires of time are rampant and set the standard for future works of Mel Brooks and all the films of this genre. However, I do not think anyone has overcome this comedy. Nobody can interpret idiots like Keaton and the stunts in this movie are some of their best. In addition, the appearance of Wallace Beery as Keaton's rival adds to the appeal of this film. Anyone who thinks that the comedy of the 1920s can not be appreciated by the modern public needs to see this movie.
