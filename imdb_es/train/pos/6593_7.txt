['I&#39;ve seen this movie twice and I think it&#39;s pretty good for the limited team that is used to create this movie. (filmed in 1947) Dr. Heyerdahl explains his theory about the migration of pre-Columbian Indians from South America to the islands of Polynesia through a raft of large balsa trees. This documentary follows Dr. Heyerdahl and his team as they select the balsa trees in the Equidor and float with them downstream to the Pacific for their meeting in Peru. They launch into a 101-day maritime adventure testing the strength of their primitive raft that survives only by means available to the natives of that era. Look for yourself, a true adventure!']
