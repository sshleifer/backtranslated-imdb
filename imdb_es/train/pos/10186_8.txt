['Okay, I know that this does not project India in a good light. But the general theme of the film is not India, it is Shakti. The power of a warlord, and the power of a mother. The relationship between Nandini and her husband and son swallows you in their warmth. Then things go terribly wrong. The interaction between Nandini and his father-in-law, the power of their dysfunctional relationship, and the lives that have changed are the strengths of this film. The performance of Shah Rukh Khan seems to be a simple cameo compared to the credible desperation of Karisma Kapoor. It is easy to get caught up in the love, violence and redemption of lives in this movie, and you find yourself with a sigh of relief and sadness at the climax. Musical interludes are strengths, credible and well done.']
