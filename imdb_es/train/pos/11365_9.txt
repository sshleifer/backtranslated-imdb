Well, let's start by saying that this movie is not an accurate interpretation of the crimes and legal persecution of Andrei Chikatilo. While it may have been an "official policy" in the Politburo that the USSR did not have serial killers, in reality the legal system had handled others, and "Killer X" (as it was called) was already being sought after when Fetisov led to Burakov to the case. In fact, as soon as they realized that they had several murders in their hands, the authorities assigned a working group of dozens of officers to track down and end the wave of murders of a man who did not fit into what is perceived as a normal serial killer. parameters It is good that the director and the writers constantly remind the viewer that the story is only "based on real events", for a docudrama that is not. <br /> <br /> *** THE SPOILERS FOLLOW **** <br /> <br /> That said, this is a very good example of a fast-paced Hollywood-style thriller that still shows the basics of what happened. It's easy to follow and has enough truth behind the events version to achieve a convincing visualization. Yes, Chikatilo violated and murdered children and adults, both men and women. Yes, the laboratory work of poor quality left him free to continue killing for years. Yes, innocent men were accused of the murders and "confessed" their crimes at the behest of the police. Yes, the gay community was harassed while the crimes were committed (although with the committed assistance of Burakov). And yes, Chikatilo was taken to confession not because of the repentance of the special prosecutor, Gorbunov, but because of the gentle understanding of a psychiatrist named Bukhanovsky (although Gorbunov was by no means close to the selfish martinet portrayed in this film). Leaving aside questions of truth and truthfulness, all these events are dramatized in a way that constantly reduces tension and fear. <br /> <br /> It does not hurt that director and co-author Chris Gerolmo has a perfect cast. . The growing emotional participation of Stephen Rea in the murders and the development of the experience in the detection of clues, the shrewd manipulation of Donald Sutherland of the attacks of the Soviet party and the subtle spine that becomes evident when necessary, the furious current Jeffrey DeMunn's hidden by a behavior full of fear, Max Von Sydow's youthful excitement for being part of a criminal investigation improves sharp dialogue and sharp editing in ways that can not be underestimated. <br /> <br /> Taken for what it is, "Citizen X" is almost perfect (the "almost" due to a moment of self-congratulation at the end that simply does NOT fit). Highly recommended as well-told fiction, not as a fact that is presented ... but considering the "serial killer" movies that Hollywood spits, that's enough for me.
