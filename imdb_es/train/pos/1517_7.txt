From the mind of Robert Bloch, from the fame of "Psycho", four sinister horror stories emerge in this anthology film Amicus, which, while not as fun or frightening as I would have liked, still offers decent genre entertainment. <br /> <br /> It is linked by the complete story of a skeptical detective from Scotland Yard (John Bennett) who is investigating the disappearance of a prominent actor; has informed that this case is linked to others by the house in which they were carried out, and our film is underway. <br /> <br /> "Method for Murder" has the author Charles Hillyer (always charming Denholm Elliott) pursued by his latest fictitious creation, which has apparently come to life. This sequence has some good surreal moments and quite suspense, and is limited by a reasonably funny revelation and denouement. <br /> <br /> Horror icon of "Waxworks" stars Peter Cushing as retired stockbroker Philip Grayson, who, along with an old friend Neville Rogers (Joss Ackland) becomes obsessed with the image of a Beautiful woman who is in a macabre wax museum. The most effective in this episode is the sequence of the dream, although it is always good to see Cushing. The final images that are presented to us in this story are quite impressive. <br /> <br /> "Sweets to the Sweet" features another beloved horror star, Christopher Lee, as John Reid, who does not treat the adorable moppet child. Jane (Chloe Franks) with too much kindness, and it depends on the new companion / tutor Ann Norton (Nyree Dawn Porter) to know why. The mystery of this particular episode is handled excellently; The filmmakers wisely do not shake hands, so it is a real shock, since we understand the truth of this unhappy family. The "dying" moments are particularly horrible. <br /> <br /> "The Cloak" has the clearest comedy of the four; Jon Pertwee, one of the many actors who have played the role of Dr. Who over the years, is very funny as a vain and temperamental horror movie star (in fact, it is the highlight of this story) that , enraged by the lack of quality in his latest low-budget movie, he goes out and buys his own cape. This layer has strange powers, which I dare not reveal here. The sexy Ingrid Pitt is a welcome presence as a companion of Pertwees; A wonderful example of humor here is an intelligence coup by Christopher Lee! <br /> <br /> The recap story concludes in a predictable but effective way while Inspector Holloway learns that he should have done it. He took all the warnings that gave him more seriously. <br /> <br /> Featured by the unusual, surprising and amazing result of Michael Dress, "The House That Dripped Blood" is an entertaining mixture of stories; Although I do not enjoy it as much as, for example, "Tales from the Crypt", it's still fun. Capably directed by Peter Duffell, he moves slowly but surely towards each of his chilling conclusions, and it's certainly a good movie of its kind. <br /> <br /> 7/10
