If you like Deep Purple, you will enjoy this excellent movie with Stephen Rea in the lead role. The story is about the most famous rock group of the 70s, Strange Fruits, and they decided to play together again. But, of course, there will be many problems during their concerts. Jimmy Nail and Bill Nighy are great, and the song "The Flame Still Burns" is perfect. You have to see it.
