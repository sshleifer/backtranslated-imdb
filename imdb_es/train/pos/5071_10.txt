I saw this movie on the Hallmark channel and I thought it was wonderful, especially because it was based on a real man. Pierce Brosnan was very good as the lone English man who took the image of the medium-sized gray owl. The photography was beautiful. <br /> <br /> This movie made me investigate more about this character that Archie Belaney knew as simple as Gray Owl. I want to read everything I can about him. At the time I did not know Richard Attenborough had directed it. But I'm not surprised. I like all your movies, whether you're acting or directing. I gave him the highest rating. However, I would have liked to have seen more in the movie WHY he took care of this person, since he only showed the two aunts who raised him and his room in his house. <br /> <br /> You can not go I do not agree with this movie if you're like me and you enjoy a beautiful story without hearing bad words and special effects devised every few minutes.
