['I remembered seeing this movie as a child one day in the wonderful world of Disney. This movie has been in my memory for more than 30 years and I&#39;ve been looking for it. I would have to say that of all the children&#39;s movies I saw at the time, it stood out more than all of them and, after watching it only once, I really hoped to see it again. The history and images of this film have been recorded in my memory. Until today, I never saw it after that day in the 70s, in fact, I never remembered the title until an Internet search that appeared today, revealed it to me. I loved it and I want my children to see it. Does anyone know where I can find it?']
