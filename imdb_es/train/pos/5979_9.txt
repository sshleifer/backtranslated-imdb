Undoubtedly, the best heavy metal horror article created in the crazy fans of the 80s, which certainly does not sound as if we considered absolutely abysmal many other entries in this strange sub-genre of films like "Hard Rock Zombies", " Blood Tracks, "Terror on Tour" and the stinking "Rock'n'Roll Nightmare" by Jon-Mikl Thor, tended to be, leaving that aside, it still deserves accessories to minimize the excess of splash and the special flash unnecessarily striking for the focus on the adolescent high school characters that are depicted with greater acuity and plausibility than the norm for teenagers of the mid-80s. Directed scare hunting.In addition, the accentuated sardonic parody of the absurdly exaggerated heavy metal stupidity of the 80 and the disgusting complacency of the immensely tense and conservative aunt who claimed that it was the devil's music is very intelligent and her money is funny (the famous god of he heavy metal Greed Decade Ozzy Osbourne has a bit of hilarious as an anti-metal TV evangelist who is very elegant!). <br /> <br /> Marc Price (Skippy remorseless in "Family Ties") offers a surprisingly strong and winning performance as Eddie "Ragman" Weinbauer, a geeky, socially awkward and severely persecuted heavy metal aficionado who is constantly pursued by the abused hoodlums that make up the majority of the student body at Lakeridge High School (the cruelty and wickedness of high school students is pinned with painfully credible accuracy). Eddie's life will worsen when his idol of rock star Sammi Curr (an impressive portrait of Tony Fields) dies in a hotel fire. The modern disc jockey Nuke (the head of KISS, Gene Simmons, in a great cameo) hooks Eddie with Sammi's last unreleased album, which when played backwards rescues Curr's evil spirit from the dead. Sammi encourages Eddie to insult him in all the vile scandals that make poor Eddie's life the proverbial hell, just so Edek is a reluctant accomplice. It depends on Eddie, assisted by the nice girl Leslie Graham (tested by the lovely Lisa Orgolini), to stop Sammi before things get out of control. <br /> <br /> Directed skillfully with commendable consideration and sensitivity by character actor Charles Martin Smith (who also appears briefly as a nerdy school teacher), intelligently written by Michael S. Murphy, Joel Soisson and Rhet Topham, and deftly acted by a cast in a uniform manner, this safe sleeper is even completed with a handful of clever moments of "leap" (an outrageous attack on the back of a car by a grotesquely lustful long-tongue mutant qualifies as the definitive climax ), a high school dance kill sequence in the style of "Carrie", a carefully used Halloween setting, revenge is correctly displayed as a truly ugly business and a strong central message that you should not turn a person into excess over his hero character strictly due to the calculated anti-establishment stance that said partner makes to qualify that state special.
