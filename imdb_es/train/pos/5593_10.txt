This movie could have been a silent movie; It certainly has the feeling of one. I was very, very lucky to see this very rare version of this movie. Extase, is a 'symphony of love', and transcends all linguistic versions. French, which is the last romantic language, seems quite suitable for this sensual and lyrical version. A young Hedy Lamarr illuminates the screen, in this film that, in a way, is almost like a sexual fantasy; but definitely far from being pornographic. The technological qualities may have been a bit raw; but that does not detract from the magic spell emanating from this movie. Many lovers of old cinema would love this movie.
