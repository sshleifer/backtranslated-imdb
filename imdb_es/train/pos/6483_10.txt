This excellent series, narrated by Laurence Olivier, brilliantly, it must be said, traces from the beginning to the end of the Second World War. The origins are not fully examined after the fall of Germany at the hands of the Treaty of Versailles, which helped boost the demonic rise of Hitler. , but as one critic says, that must be difficult to do, in a series of 26 parts with a lot to put. <br /> <br /> Apart from the expected combat action / photography, there are a lot of personal, emotional and human tragedies that are counted giving the viewer a surprising vision, especially if he is not necessarily a fan / fan of the Second World War. The episodes that showed "testimonials" and what life was like on the home front of the main allies / adversaries, Great Britain, Germany, Japan, Russia and the United States were quite revealing. To show the extreme savagery of the war on the front line and, of course, the sufferings of the civilians, the extermination camps, etc., were very well handled and exposed. I would totally recommend it in any kind of history for the younger generation (of which you could say I have one in 47!). <br /> <br /> Certain things are strangely excluded, such as the arrival of the new jet era, with the experimental pilot Gloster by Frank Whittle and the combat debut of the Gloster Meteor, as well as that of the German Messerschmitt. I was 262, especially when it was seen that the V-1 debuted and there was a surprisingly smaller mention of the V2. This is probably a minor oversight, not referring to the most sensational secrets and fantastic weapons that World War II brought from a more sterile science. But a great series that left its mark and has done so since when it fortunately repeated itself. <br /> <br /> A series to own as a box in terms of history, on DVD for anyone, especially who is a military fanatic. Jeremy Isaacs and Thames TV should be very proud.
