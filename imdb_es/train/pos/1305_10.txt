This movie caught me off guard when it started at a coffee house in Arizona and a Richard Grieco, (Rex), "Dead Easy", '04, decides to eat something and gets all hot and annoyed by a very hot, sexy waitress While Rex exits of coffee, go to a state policeman and ask him: "ARE YOU QUICK?" and then all hell breaks loose in more ways than one. Nancy Allen (Maggie Hewitt), "Dressed to Kill", 80, is a television reporter and is always looking for a scoop of news to broadcast. Maggie ends up in a jacuzzi and Rex goes to her to tell her that she wants a Western-style show, with the local policeman in the city. This is a different movie, however, Nancy Allen and Richard Grieco are the only two actors that help this image TOGETHER!
