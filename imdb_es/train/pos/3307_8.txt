Let's start by saying that the English title of this movie "The Power of Kangwon Province" is a bad name. It's because in the Hong Sang Soo movie there are no real shots of wars, problems and conflicts. Therefore, the idea of ​​establishing the power of a province is neither adequate nor valid in the context of this film. If we were to judge this film by its title in Korean, "Kangwon-do ui he" will appear as a cryptic statement about the emotional disturbances of its young protagonists whose minds are not at rest. Hong Sang Soo has also directed a very prolific visual document about the erratic choices made by the people in their lives. The people in question are a couple of young girls who are constantly in the process of showing their moods, whims and fantasies. If making a movie out of nothing can be claimed as the meritorious virtue of a filmmaker, then Hong Sang Soo should be greeted. like a brave filmmaker whose films speak a lot about the ubiquitous relationship of human relationships, feelings and lives. Whether one likes it or not. , this is the only fair conclusion that can be inferred from this particular movie.
