A kafkian thriller of alienation and paranoia. Very well done and Polanski performs well as the shy introvert who struggles to adapt to his gloomy Parisian accommodations and fellow accommodation. Horrifying from the beginning because of the seeming pettiness and at the same time obsessed with the other tenants and horrifying later as he develops his defenses, which will ultimately be his downfall. Personally, I could have done it without the element of cross-dressing, but I accept the nod to Psycho and the fact that he had some logic, considering the story. However, it could have worked without and would have eliminated the slightly theatrical element, but maybe that was thought because the courtyard seems to have the look of a theater at the end. I can not help but feel that there is more than some of the director's own feelings of not being a true Frenchman and Jew. Still, there is a lot to enjoy here, including the excellent performance of a beautiful Isabelle Adjani and the good old Shelly Winters is as reliable as ever.
