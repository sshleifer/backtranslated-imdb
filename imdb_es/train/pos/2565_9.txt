I really enjoyed this movie about the relationships that sometimes developed between the US military and Japanese women in post-war Japan, as well as the obstacles that prejudice created for them. Brando goes from having contempt for the Japanese (which is natural considering WW2) to falling in love with a Japanese woman and wanting to marry her. His acting is fine (I'm not a big fan of his acting style) and the movie is wonderful at all times. Red Buttons received an Oscar for his moving performance of another GI who falls in love with Japan (although the Japanese women who play in front of him also did an extraordinary job). <br /> <br /> I do not want to spoil it but the movie is good to watch with a box of tissues. <br /> <br /> This movie manages to say SOMETHING and be entertaining at the same time. A jewel mostly underestimated.
