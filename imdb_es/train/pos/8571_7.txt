It could be said that this is a very good "sequel", better than the first live action movie 101 Dalmatians. He has good dogs, good actors, good jokes and good slapstick! <br /> <br /> Cruella DeVil, who has received a fairly important therapy, is now a dog lover and very kind to them. Many, including Chloe Simon, owner of one of the dogs that Cruella tried to kill, do not believe it. Others, like Kevin Shepherd (owner of 2nd Chance Dog Shelter) believe that she has changed. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Dipstick, with his partner, has given birth to three cute Dalmatian puppies! Little Dipper, Domino and Oddball ... <br /> <br /> Starring Eric Idle as Waddlesworth (the graceful macaw), Glenn Close as Cruella and Gerard Depardieu as Le Pelt (another bad boy, the name should give a clue ), this is a good family movie with emotion and much more! One disadvantage of this movie is that it has a lot of painful slapstick, but not as exaggerated as the last movie. This is also more fun than the last movie. <br /> <br /> Enjoy "102 Dalmatians"! :-)
