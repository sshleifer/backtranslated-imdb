In the northeast of Brazil, the father of the illiterate girl Maria (Fernanda Carvalho), twelve years old, sells her daughter to the intermediary of a prostitution organization, Tadeu (Chico Dias), to work as a domestic employee and have a better life. However, the girl is resold to farmer Lourenço (Otávio Augusto) who deflates her, and gives the battered girl her teenage son so that he has his first sexual experience. Then they send her to a brothel in a gold field in Amazonas and explore their owner, the despicable Saraiva (Antonio Calloni). When Maria escapes to Rio de Janeiro hoping for a better life, she is explored by Vera (Darlene Glória). <br /> <br /> "Anjos do Sol" exposes the sad and shameful reality of child prostitution in Brazil through the fate of the girl Maria. Last year I saw "Lilja 4-ever" telling an identical story in the former Soviet Union; therefore, this problem exists in Third World countries. The director and writer Rudi Lagemann presents a great film that exposes reality but never shows naked or explicit sexual scenes. It is the debut of the promising Fernanda Carvalho, who has an excellent performance in the role of a frightened child who struggles to survive. Most prostitutes are amateurs, and it is impossible to recognize the famous Darlene Glória so different than after many plastic surgeries. The bitter and hopeless end of the story is also very realistic. My vote is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Anjos do Sol" ("Angels of the Sun")
