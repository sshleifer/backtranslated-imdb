My wife, Kate and I loved the series and we can not wait for the next one (I hope there is a sequel!). I'd love to know what the catchy song is called and who wrote it, maybe because I'm "old and gray" and I'm still interested in life :-). If someone has the complete letter, please send it. <br /> <br /> Of course, one of the main reasons why my wife and I liked this series was that we are 75 years old and we are retired, but still very active intellectually. It is great to see a program that highlights the contribution to society that still can be made by older people with special skills and experience. The aspect of human interest that shows the interactions of the characters and the younger people around them is an important part of the show. <br /> <br /> This series is very entertaining and very sophisticated, along with some of our favorites. , "Spooks" and "Hustle".
