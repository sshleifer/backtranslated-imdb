Not wishing to give * anything * here, I would only say that this excellent technique, impeccable and small animated film will reward the viewer with an excellent entertainment of an hour and a half: entertain, surprise, possibly embarrass occasionally and almost certainly throw in the heart of time when, when approaching the inevitable, but not obvious, it ends without becoming clich√© or predictable in any way. Definitely recommended. <br /> <br /> A previous comment from the user gives 8 out of 10 for the movie and 10 out of 10 for the outstanding performances of Branagh and Bonham-Carter. I totally agree ...
