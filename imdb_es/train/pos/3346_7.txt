A famous "tamer of the city" called Clit Tollinger (Robert Mitchum) is hired by citizens to rid the gunmen (Leo Genn, Claude Atkins, among others), the thugs of Baronland. There he meets the blacksmith (Emile Meyer), his daughter (Karen Sharpe), his boyfriend (John Lupton), the marshal (Henry Hull) and the owner of Saloon (Ted De Corsia). Clint as representative of the law is appointed deputy to bring peace and puts posters that say the following: ¨ The warning, the use of firearms or other weapons in the city is prohibited. Check all the hardware in the Marshal's office ¨. Clint finds his ex-girlfriend, a local madam (Jan Sterling) in charge of the Saloon girls (Angie Dickinson, Barbara Lawrence, among them). But the city council fears the crude methods carried out by Clint. In the end, the leading landowner appears and tries to assassinate Tollinger with his own hands. <br /> <br /> This is a tremendously exciting story of a hired sheriff who only had one more murder in front of him.
