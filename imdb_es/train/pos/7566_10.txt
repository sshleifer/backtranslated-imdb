['The girl&#39;s name is Bonnie (Polay). She is attractive, apparently living a fairly decent life, but suddenly she is inexplicably snatched from her home and her life by Evil Dude and the Miscellaneous Miscellaneous Evil Henchmen. Now she has no idea what the hell is going on, only that a group of people armed to the teeth seemingly want her dead ... and she will die without knowing why. <br /><br /> God, I hear the moans all the time. Now that the content is so cheap to produce and people can create their own movies / books / comics / internal organs, there will be no one to ensure that there is a quality standard! We&#39;re going to drown in the shit! The only people who really think that this is people who have not seen any movies or read any books recently, because we are already doing the garbage of a dead man. It&#39;s people like Ferrari and Rodriguez who put the lies to these ignorant people just like they&#39;re throwing $ 8K on the table and doing ... well, what I&#39;d say is a better action movie than anything you&#39;ve seen in theaters. year ... but you have not seen any action movies at the movies this year. I&#39;ve seen the box office. You&#39;ll stay away in droves. It would be better to hook up a copy of this, spend twenty entertaining minutes and move on with their lives. <br /><br /> It&#39;s pure entertainment. Enter, like Bonnie, with many questions and where everything ends is hazy. The complete concept has been done before in many ways, but not in such a compressed amount of time and not without a set of weapons so concentrated and tasty. You are there because of the atmosphere, the mystery and the weapons. That&#39;s it, that&#39;s all the filmmakers promise, and they do it. <br /><br /> Warm the wells of my heart to think that this was done with that budget. We passed a good number of indie movies around here, but we rarely see something as polished as this short, and we&#39;ve never seen one in the action genre that looks so good. Hell, you could give these two guys MY: 3 and I could get to see him. The bond franchise. Hell, anything. No, in fact, better yet: I would like to see these guys do a show on their own and stay away from Hollywood. Whatever is killing the film industry is certainly contagious. <br /><br /> The best indie we&#39;ve seen in a long time and the most effective indie calling card we&#39;ve seen. The DVD has $ 20 and has extra features in the ass. Go take the budget for your movie ticket and put it in its place.']
