It could be said that it is the best performance of John Thaw in which he successfully shakes any trait of his Morse Inspector character and brings a perfect adaptation of Tom from the pages of the book to the TV screen. This is a well-made production that maintains its family viewing environment despite some very mature themes such as the outbreak of World War II and the physical abuse suffered by the child. <br /> <br /> However, it is the relationship between Tom and Willie Young who is the heart and soul of this story. It is touching and beautiful to see this link between the young evacuee of London and the grumpy old man who has left to develop, a real connection between grandfather and grandson. <br /> <br /> It's a pity that this story has not existed. It is not done with a bigger budget with a more established director, since it belongs to the big screen, it is not shown once or twice every ten years on a Sunday afternoon. With the right orientation, John Thaw would be celebrated all over the world and he would be awarded many prizes for his brilliant acting in this film. A great actor and a great role that should have been honored more than it was at that time.
