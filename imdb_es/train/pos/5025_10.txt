Man, some of you have to relax. This movie was an artistic genius. Instead of looking for reasoning or messages to justify it in your reality, why can not you understand that it is a work of fiction? A story. Entertainment, for God's sake (no pun). It seems to me that many of the people here are trying to be film critics, and they are not doing well. I am so impressed with the film and the work of Bill Paxton at the address, that I will personally contact him to tell him. You know, if you were not trying to thoroughly analyze the possibility of the plot, you could enjoy the movie. Me and all my friends did it!
