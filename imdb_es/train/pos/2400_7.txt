I do see what my ancestors saw in the young Bette Davis. She is splendid throughout this quasi-crazy political comedy that actually plays Warren Williams as the political agent who is constantly behind her alimony. Vivienne Osborne is brilliant as her ex, and I found myself supporting her at all times. The character of Williams does not sympathize at all, and is not even a good option. <br /> <br /> Guy Kibbee is one of the best at what he does. As a candidate stopped sleeping at a political convention and was appointed governor to prevent a rival candidate from being nominated, all this mess is due to an internal political war in a party called "Progressive Party". If you have a political mentality, you will probably see a party other than the party to which you are affiliated, reflected in the fictional "Progressive Party" of Williams and Kibbee. I could draw exact parallels, but we're not here for that. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie for those of us who love these old comedies. If you've ever seen any of the old Wheeler & Woolsey titles (HALF SHOT AT SUNRISE, THE RAINMAKERS), you'll find Frank McHugh, Williams' right arm, who looks and looks a lot like Bert Wheeler. He cheated me. <br /> <br /> Yes, both my wife and I recommend this one.
