I do not see how it can be said that Freddy's Nightmares is cheesy and a scam. Obviously you do not know good television when you see it. The episodes are full of drama and blood. Freddy is creative in the way he kills people. I love Freddy's nightmares and I hope to get the 44 episodes on DVD. The best episodes are: Saturday Night Special, School Daze and Love Stinks. If you think this series was bad, you have the right to your opinion, but remember that it is only your opinion and does not mean anything. Freddy's Nightmares will always be one of the best series in history and you will soon accept it. If you do not like it, then do not look at it but do not deny its brilliance.
