['The characters were alive and interesting, the plot had an excellent rhythm, the pyrotechnic effects were achieved masterfully and is based on a basic story of love triangles and a science fiction element. I could identify with many of the characters and their motivations had a logical and rational sense in the context of the story. <br /><br /> The work of the camera was excellent, the audio clear and precise, the background music perfectly chosen for the effect, the firemen singers a pleasant and memorable rarity with talent, brilliantly designed stages and special effects made with an expert expert. <br /><br /> I&#39;m a little disconcerted how a complete mini carnival in the parking lot of a chain of stores could be powered by a single pole outlet. That seems impossible to say the least. However, the fight between the brothers near the end of the movie was brilliant. Having Jim Varney in a role of no clown was also a wonderful touch, as he played very well the semi-serious role of a carny.']
