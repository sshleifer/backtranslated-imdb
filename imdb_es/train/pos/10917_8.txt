I just got the Celestial region 3 DVD from The Five Venoms and the excellent work they have done with it. A fantastic digitally remastered transfer and a must for any Kung Fu fan. <br /> <br /> The story is quite simple, and it has already been mentioned, so I will not talk about it again. Needless to say, these are the fight scenes for which many people buy the film, and they do not disappoint. The only problem is that they are a bit scarce and seem too rehearsed. Bruce Lee could take these batches and have a cup of tea at the same time! All the kicks and punches come with the "clicks" of type "type writer" and the air "whooshes", which is a great effect although quite funny. <br /> <br /> I give this movie a B +. Good but not great. In a way, I think it could have been a little better. Golden Swallow, from the same director of the previous decade, had such a good story and a better action.
