(WARNING: minor spoilers) <br /> <br /> I found this halfway and watched from there, not knowing what it was or what the plot was. It certainly caught my attention; I did not know until the end that it was based on a real story! The guy she used to do the dirty action came out as a really good guy, who just twisted his head a torturous girl; I have to wonder how faithful to life is that portrait. Anyone who murders a husband and wife while they sleep simply can not be entirely nice. However, he felt a certain sympathy for him, since he had been established and taken advantage of; that was clear. <br /> <br /> My main complaint is the end (here comes the biggest spoiler! Skip this paragraph if you do not want to learn it). A few minutes before it was over, there seemed to be no way to discover the truth. The way it was discovered was in a "sting" operation, but my question is: how was the police convinced to accept it? The film did not show us that, and I found it too convenient without the explanation of how they were persuaded to do so. <br /> <br /> I think the way they handled it was done with dramatic ends, as the omission of the explanation gave an aura of suspense to the crucial scene that otherwise would not have been there (we would know from what it was the scene, and what happened to Brad in it). <br /> <br /> Otherwise, this is a pretty good movie; I give it 7/10. It made me think. Now I am interested in knowing the facts of the real case. <br /> <br /> One more thing: the movie was made in 1996. Some of the criticism here seems to treat it like a more recent movie. <br /> <br /> PS Meadow Sisto is lovely. I had not seen it before. She can also act a bit (it's always an advantage in her line of work, hahaha).
