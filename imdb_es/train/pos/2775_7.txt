The old movie fans will know why he would call this "The man in the gray flannel robe." Most of the films based on the Bible are basically disoriented. What could cause smiles and giggles here is how Peck tries to raise awareness about a variety of psychological and social problems with the spear that carries the Neanderthals around him. As a great romance, it falls flat like unleavened bread. But there is something exciting about this movie. Of all the great images in the Hollywood Bible, it most strikingly conveys the ambivalent attitude of the average American toward belief in the biblical God. The thesis of Billy Sunday is at odds with the antithesis of H.L. Mencken throughout the entire script. Who gets the best of this in the synthesis backed by the heavenly choir depends on their point of view. Apart from that, D & B has a good performance of Peck (especially in the final scene of repentance) and Jayne Meadows as his bitter first wife Michol, a vivid and moody atmosphere (good idea to put more action at dawn or the night), and the moving version of Psalm Twenty-three at the end.
