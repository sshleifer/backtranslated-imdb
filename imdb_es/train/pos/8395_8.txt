*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** This is undoubtedly the best film made by Rainer Werner Fassbinder and even with the wonderful script, the film is reinforced by a great performance by Hanna Schygulla. The film begins with Maria (Schygulla) and Hermann Braun (Klaus Lowitsch) newlyweds as the bombs continue to fall and Hermann is sent to the last days of the war and now Maria and her mother and sister must survive to survive. Maria decides to get a job as a dancer / prostitute in a club that cares for American soldiers, she meets a black army soldier named Bill (Greg Eagles) and they start seeing each other constantly. Maria hears that her husband Hermann died in the war, so she gets very serious with Bill. But one day, getting intimate with Bill, they see Hermann at the door. He has not died and when he enters the room there is a fight and Maria breaks a bottle on Bill's head and he dies. Hermann takes the blame and condemn him to a long time in jail, so Maria tells him that he will succeed in something and that he will get it out. The war is over and Germany must rebuild and one day, on a train, Maria meets Karl Oswald (Ivan Desny), a successful businessman in textiles and uses his charms to get a job. Maria is determined to do well and climbs the corporate ladder and becomes Karl's lover. She tells him that she will never marry him, but he is in love with her. Hermann leaves prison but goes to Canada to try to overcome everything Maria has done since she was locked up. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** <br /> <br /> One day Karl dies and leaves Maria almost everything in his will and Maria buys her own house. Then, Hermann finally returns home with his wife and both are ready to begin their marriage, although they have already been married for some time. But Maria leaves the gas on in the stove and the house explodes with the two still in it. <br /> <br /> There are so many interesting things in this movie that it is one of those movies that you can study and talk about. at great distances. As in all Fassbinder films, the use of color is used in a very interesting way. When the film begins, the tones are brown and gray to represent war-ravaged Germany, but as Maria begins to succeed, they change to bright colors like red and white. The reconstruction of Germany with all the sounds of construction is used as the only backdrop and the film focuses on the exploits of Mary. Fassbinder wanted the sounds of reconstruction to remind us of what was happening in Germany at that time. Hanna Schygulla was never better and her performance is the key to the success of this film. With a minor actress, this would have been another interesting film, but Schygulla is so strong that his performance elevates this film to an elite status. Schygulla shows Maria very determined and intelligent, but at the same time uses her beauty and femininity to get what she wants. She is not ashamed or feels guilty about this and Fassbinder wanted to show Maria as a woman who practically sells her soul to survive. Schygulla was not nominated for an Academy Award, but gave a great performance that will stand the test of time. Fassbinder himself appears in the film as a street vendor and his own mother, Lilo Pempeit, plays Frau Ehmke. I have heard many things about the end of the film and it has to do with whether Maria left the gas on purpose. Later, in the bathroom, water runs on her wrist and she seems sad. This is just speculation and if you think I'm wrong, please send me an email. I think she was very excited that Hermann was at home and left him by accident (Do you remember that she put on a dress for no reason?). Then, when the testament is read to him, at that moment he learns that Hermann and Karl had become friends without his knowledge and I think he felt that everything he had done was for nothing. That is the reason for the bathroom scene. So when the house explodes it is by accident. But I think the reason why Fassbinder has such an ending is to show that anyone who sells his soul does not have a business life. Fassbinder was fascinated by the survivors, but he was also incredibly passionate. From her point of view, Maria can not have both. A fascinating movie
