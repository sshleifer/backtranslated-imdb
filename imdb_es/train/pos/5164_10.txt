I attended the Chesapeake camp. It was located at the head of the Chesapeake Bay on the North East River in MD. It was a similar type summer camp with cabins. It was established by Coatesville, PA YMCA. I started as a young camper and then I became a junior, principal counselor and later, the director of Waterfront. If the camp had continued, I would have done anything within my power to become the camp director. Unfortunately, the powers of the YMCA decided to close the camp and sell it to the state of MD. I visited the old camp a few years later by boat and was dismayed by the abandonment of the MD state and the natural destruction by Mother Nature. The 350 acre site served many with all the benefits of contact with nature's offerings. A black man named Curtis Ford and his family were residents and caretakers of the property. Mr. Curtis was my friend and mentor. I idolized every being. Even when he could not swim, he was a man of water. If I asked him where the fish stung, he would designate the place and I would have a ball. There was also a family camp at the end of summer. These memories will be with me for eternity.
