A true classic. Beautifully filmed and acted. It reveals an area of ​​Paris that is full of comedy and tragedy. Although the area of ​​the 'Hotel du Nord' and the hotel itself still exist, it is not as cheerful (in the original sense of the word) and cheerful as it should have been. The film makes a longing for the past, which has been lost, with a sigh and bittersweet.
