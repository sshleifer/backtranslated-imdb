I really enjoyed this movie as a little boy. At that age I thought the baseball nonsense was fun and that the movie was "great" because it's about sports. Now, several years later, I can look back and see what a well-designed film was. This movie opened my eyes like a small child to the struggles that other children tried and the problems of the real world. That type of exhibition is largely lacking in films for children these days, which I do not think will benefit our society. Of course, baseball antics seem to be really silly now, but they attracted kids. No seven-year-old child will ask to see a movie about foster children, but they will ask to see a movie about baseball. Disney realized this fact and took advantage of it to teach these children an important lesson about the world. <br /> <br /> As a young adult, the performance of Al and the other angels seems much less impressive, however, I will give credit. to the actors who play the two children and to Danny Glover, who did a fantastic job.
