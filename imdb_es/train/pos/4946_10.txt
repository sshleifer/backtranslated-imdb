Bravo! Morgan Freeman is an actor who investigates a character for whom he is selected to play, before committing himself. Freeman is a "good fit" for this movie (as it was for "Driving Miss Daisy"), and is not only credible, but also has the opportunity to change his image of playing a character with reserved dignity and property. Although there are no guarantees in life, for anyone, this gives the actor a great opportunity to play different or unique characters that stand out, to avoid stereotypes. And it must be said that stereotypes have hampered, or completely ruined, a significant number of actor careers. <br /> <br /> This is a low budget film that, surprisingly, was made in a time span of only two weeks. . It's a well-directed film written by Brad Silberling. The location manager chose Carson, CA to set up the movie, and the location helps set the tone and timing of the movie. The edition is fair to good, but a little rough. <br /> <br /> Silberling was the 'subcontractor', making Freeman make this film, while the actor was in the midst of film projects. <br /> <br /> There is good chemistry between Freeman and Paz Vega, a Spanish actress, and this opens an effective dialogue between each of the cast members, who are diverse and come from different cultures. The film also fosters understanding between people, who not only speak two languages ​​(English and Spanish), but come from two different worlds: ethnicity, race, gender, norms, customs, beliefs, traditions, principles and values. The film strives to achieve some honesty and reaches a certain truth to maintain the integrity of the film. <br /> <br /> Part of the comedy is that Freeman plays an unemployed actor who has not worked for four years. In truth, Freeman is as much in demand as an actor he is constantly working on. <br /> <br /> The film offers an adventure of bonding, caring, exchange, exchange and exchange. And, the shots of the film give the viewer a preview of some of the things an actor must go through to prepare for a role. <br /> <br /> If necessary, tell your boss that you are attending a "mental health day", and go see this movie. If you can, take your partner or your family with you. I classify the movie with a 10 out of 10. It's nice, interesting, informative, moving and valuable.
