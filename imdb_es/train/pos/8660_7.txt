This is a racist film, but worthy of study and enjoyment. For the first time, the natural inclination is to focus on Erbe & Dad. They have something relaxed and calm, with her still at home about to graduate from high school, and he retired and relaxed, hoping for inspiration to do something. The second time, you realize how horribly the sister's husband is dissuaded by his friends at the backwoods blues bar. He takes it, is what needs to be done these days, and the critical moment happens as if they were chatting about the weather. In that same scene, the sister blues song is a real tear jerk if you're a little sensitive and you like that kind of music. His performance feels like the climax of the story; a history of blues with the good guys being "people of color" in their element in backwoods, SC. Meanwhile, all the white people in the film wear what seems to be a meaningless superficial life, suitable only for babies. That's great, as long as you recognize it as fiction.
