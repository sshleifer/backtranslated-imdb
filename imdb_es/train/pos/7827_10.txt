This movie is, simply, brilliant. The cinematography is good, the acting excellent and the story absolutely impressive. This is the story of Donald Woods, a white South African who thought himself liberal until he discovered the reality of apartheid. Kevin Kline is completely convincing, so much so that when Donald Woods himself appeared on television some years later, I recognized him for Kline's portrait. Denzel Washington also presents a masterful performance, as always. <br /> <br /> I urge you to see this. It's long, but he deserves his patience because he tells such an incredible story. Remember, folks, this really happened.
