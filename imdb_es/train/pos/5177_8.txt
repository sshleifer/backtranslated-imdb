I saw it last night after not having seen it in several years. It really is a funny little movie, with a lot of faces that you did not know were in it. Arkin shines as always. Check it out; You will not be disappointed By the way, it has just been released on DVD and, unlike its packaging, is wide screen. The transfer is quite poor, but at least the entire movie is visible. ;-)
