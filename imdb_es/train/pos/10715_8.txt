Teresa Pavlinek was a popular member of the Toronto Second City cast. She has made numerous announcements and announcements here in Canada. Finally someone has the sense to create a show for her. The support case seems pretty good too. Now I have seen the pilot several times and I still find it refreshing. However, I'm not sure why the show appears as The Jane Show 2004. (I could be wrong). But, as far as I know, the program was conceptualized in 2005 and appeared on Global TV in Canada in early 2006. A fresh idea and I hope it goes well. Too bad this can not be combined with Corner Gas. Now I know that Corner gas is in CTV, but the two shows would be excellent complementary pieces.
