['I could not stop commenting after reading the very brief comment &quot;Not bad&quot;. This movie is much better than just not bad. The performance is stellar, even of the children in the cast, who do not play cute or anything else, but act as my son&#39;s friends. The film is intelligent and expects its audience to be as well. The story lines of the double-backed flashes are imaginative and contribute to the story instead of acting as a time filler. I saw this movie with my children and then I saw it again just a few days later. If you have children and you are sick of the movies that inspire a diabetic coma with its thick sweetness, check out &quot;Holes&quot;. My 6 year old son enjoyed it as much as my 11 year old son, and my husband and I enjoyed it as much as they did. How many movies can you say that?']
