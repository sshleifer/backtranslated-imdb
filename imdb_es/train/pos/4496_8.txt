In a nutshell, I liked this movie. The reason for my interest and enjoyment was not related to anything other than the subject itself. I had heard stories of my mother and my grandmother about how the attitudes and life of the working class of northern England used to be (as they experienced it) and this is an interesting representation that seems to faithfully represent what they told me. In particular, the paternalistic but dominant father who "knows" what is best for his family along with his obstinacy when this paradigm is challenged. (Not much has changed there then!) <br /> <br /> People who have seen the play will probably be disappointed with the film because the story is not easily transferred through the different media. However, in a certain sense, the film is a historical document and I personally enjoyed it, if only because of the way it transmitted a social phenomenon.
