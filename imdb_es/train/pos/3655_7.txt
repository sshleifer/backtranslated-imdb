De Sica is becoming one of my favorite directors, but this was a success for me. A smiling young idiot becomes the leader of a community of illegal settlers in a deserted area outside of Milan. It is a detailed and sparkling story of the innocent poor masses, complete with evil capitalists and happy police forces, but little by little it evolves into a magical fantasy tale, while the Toto boy develops unlimited powers of superheroes. I had it here with the always smiling Toto after 10 minutes, and when the magic took over, I stayed in the dust. There were so many beautifully orchestrated shots, so many good characters among the colonists, that I kept thinking it was a waste that the film was not more serious with its material. The combination of neorealism and fantasy emerges more as an experiment of the type "look what we can also do as a mother" than as a fully developed work / art.
