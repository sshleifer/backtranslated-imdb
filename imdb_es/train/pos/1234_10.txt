I grew up watching this movie, and I still love her as much today as when I was a child. Do not listen to critical criticism. They are not accurate in this movie. Eddie Murphy really shines in his roll. You can sit down with your whole family and everyone will enjoy it. I recommend this movie to everyone to see it. It is a comedy with a touch of fantasy. With demons, dragons and a small bald child with powers similar to God. This film takes you from Los Angeles to Tibet, to the amazing view of the wonderful mountain temples in Tibet. A beautiful view! So do yourself a favor and take this one away! You will not regret!
