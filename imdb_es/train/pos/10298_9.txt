For my part, I was happy to see Jim Carrey in a film in which overcoming was not the goal. His character is like all of us. Wanting more, better things that happen to us and waiting for God to give us. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman made a great God. With a sense of humor and a genuine sense of love for each one of us, but we are still ready to take a vacation when the opportunity presents itself. <br /> <br /> I thought the character of Jennifer Aniston was a little too vulnerable and understanding towards Carry's Basically egocentric TV presenter wants to be, but that's how it was written. <br /> <br /> I think the previews ruined several potentially very funny scenes because everyone who saw them knew what was coming before it happened. <br /> <br /> I have read several of the reviews and it seems that some people are looking a little too deep. This is a summer comedy and it does not pretend to solve the problems of the world, although there are some messages that we can all take seriously. <br /> <br /> A funny movie.
