If you want a serious pain of laughter, watch this movie and the things that Bruce inflicts on his speaker partner. The deleted scenes are priceless. I do not know why they were not included in the original movie. It can not be for the time, since the movie only lasts 101 minutes. Morgan Freeman is a brilliant actor, who has been overlooked for too long. Jim Carrey needs medicine!
