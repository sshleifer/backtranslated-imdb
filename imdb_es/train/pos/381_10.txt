I gave this film 10 not because it is an extraordinarily consistent film, but because of its pure capacity to evoke emotions in its audience. The story of a woman's fight against all odds is an old clich√©, but very few films have achieved it with as much warmth and sincerity as The Color Purple. <br /> <br /> It also showed a different side to the African-American experience: showing that after the slaves were granted freedom, many fell in the path of the hated "white man" and abused their own people. I think this is an important point, as it goes against the tendency to portray white on black, violence and win an Oscar. <br /> <br /> The performances are also excellent, especially Oprah, which I am now. have a new respect for. <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing, but have some fabric at hand.
