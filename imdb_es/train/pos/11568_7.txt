One of the many Merrie Melodies cartoons that entertained American moviegoers during World War II, "An Itch in Time" by Bob Clampett portrays a flea of ​​bums that perches on Elmer Fudd's dog. The little man becomes a true sadist while making a home on the dog's back, but Elmer warns the dog: "One more scwatch and I'll give you a bath!" Meanwhile, the flea is setting up dynamite in the dog! * And that is not the end! I noticed that in one scene, Elmer is reading a comic with Bugs Bunny and Porky Pig. Obviously, Elmer and Bugs are often co-stars, but Elmer never co-starred with Porky (unless you count the short "Any bonus today?"). But for me, the idea that Elmer reads about these other famous people of his same genre emphasizes the metaphysical nature of his world, as if he knew of his existence within his universe even if they do not appear in this caricature. <Br /> <br /> Of course, I probably go too far in my analysis. I am sure that the caricature was thought of as pure entertainment, and certainly entertains. As for the line "I might get to like this", it sounds as if that were something that the censors would not have allowed but somehow had overlooked; I, for one, do not really know how it's supposed to sound. Was it something sexual? As for the end, if I had thought I had seen it all, I would have been tempted to look for more, instead of doing what the cat did (although it was a good trick). <br /> <br /> * The guys behind these cartoons probably had something on TNT, right?
