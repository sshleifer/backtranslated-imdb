I think I really love this movie. "Prix de Beaute" was originally a silent film, but was later dubbed into French in 1930. Although the voice of another person was bent over hers, this is still an impressive tour de force for Louis Brooks. The fact that his singing voice is nicknamed by the legendary Edith Piaf helps appease the purists about the deception of dubbing. <br /> <br /> This is the story of Lulu and we see her for the first time in a resort with her male boyfriend, Andre (Georges Charlia) and his friend Antonin (Augusto Bandini). Lulu enters the frame as a pair of legs: we see her inside the car changing to her swimsuit. Lulu is very free to show her body and this does not suit the annoying Andre. When Lulu considers running for the title of 'Miss Europe', we know that a happy ending will not sit at the end of Easy Street. <br /> <br /> The film seems to focus a lot on men who look with their eyes at beautiful women. We see many bathing beauties and the reactions of men who stare at them. But at the center of everything is the magnificent Louise Brooks. <br /> <br /> If you do not mind watching movies from past eras, then consider this one. Louise Brooks is not a name that most average moviegoers can easily know, but as soon as you see her she will be hypnotized and want to know more. You can also see it in 'Pandora's Box' if you can find it. <br /> <br /> Beware of the US Kino DVD release. UU I do not know if his projection speed is correct. Many of the scenes seem to show up at too fast a speed. This may have been the way they were shot. I do not know. But since it's the only way to see this movie, it's worth swallowing that little bitter pill.
