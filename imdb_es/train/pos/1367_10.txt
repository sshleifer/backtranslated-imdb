This movie was so great! It has that attitude of feeling good, but totally in your face that attracts me to watch a movie. She has a good message (the party girl decides she needs a real job) but she does not completely lose her sense of fun. I recommend this movie to anyone who needs some humor, but he is also a thinker! :)
