This is a very rare example of a film about transvestism (of heterosexuals). The film treats the taboo subject so that even a general audience that knows nothing of transvestitism will sympathize with its main character. Adrian Pasdar is very credible as Gerald / Geraldine and will not forget this brilliant performance. The direction of Christopher Monger is very sensitive, since he deals with such a difficult subject quite excellently, and is in a good story. It's not a big movie, not an "artistic" movie, but a lovely little movie!
