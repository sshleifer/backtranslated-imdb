Freebird is the perfect marriage between the road trip comedy, the whim of the band, the movie "stoner" and the British movie to feel good. <br /> <br /> They are the brilliant main characters that distinguish this film from other films of this genre. The stars Phil Daniels, Gary Stretch and Geoff Bell have a great chemistry and make their characters are very nice and realistic. The main story focuses on your road trip from London to Wales, and the adventures and setbacks that occur along the way. This little movie also has a big heart, it's not just for bike fans, it's based on the relationships between the characters, including dreams and regrets, such as Fred Stretch's wish for Fred for the family he left behind. behind. The picture is also great: a love letter to the Welsh countryside, as well as the capture of the streets of London and the typical pub life in the Welsh cities. <br /> <br /> Elegant, elegant, fantastic soundtrack, nice characters and funny story - I would recommend Freebird in the blink of an eye!
