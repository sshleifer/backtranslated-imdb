The final output of William Powell as Philo Vance occurs in the case of murder in the kennel, where the murder of a dog of a championship leads to two more murders and one attempt of mankind. Everything is in the form of discovering how it leads to who and why. <br /> <br /> The assassinations of Philo Vance by SS Van Dine were the most popular at that time and the ingenious Van Dine discovered a way to sell his books one at a time to the highest bidder in the studio. This is the reason why you see so many Philo Vances and so many studios that publish them. If Bill Powell had not achieved a greater fame with MGM as Nick Charles of the series Thin Man, he would have been known as the greatest of Philo Vances. <br /> <br /> It turns out that Powell had entered his little Captain Terrier in the same competition where he entered the murdered dog and then another rival owner became the first murder victim. As usual, Powell appears as Eugene Palette as Sergeant Heath, whose biggest contribution to the process was to use his bulk to break the bolt on the inner door where the first murder victim was found. <br /> <br /> I said I was blocked. The interior and it was a superior story, so it was in figuring out how. Powell has a charming group of suspects, as extensive as what is normally a mystery of Thin Man. People like Paul Cavanaugh, Helen Vinson, Ralph Morgan, Mary Astor, well fulfill their roles in the cast. <br /> <br /> Warner Brothers liked this version so much that, in fact, they remade it again in the thirties with James Stephenson in his One and only exit as Philo Vance. It does not offer a candle for this. <br /> <br /> Since this is the only Powell Philo Vance that is available on VHS or DVD by all means, see it or buy it if you can.
