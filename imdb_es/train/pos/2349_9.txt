It is a pleasure to see so much creativity on television. This show is poetic, artistic and fun. The characters relate well and the writing is not bad (I think it will improve as they get their legs). Definitely worth checking out. <br /> <br /> The girls steal the show so far in this series. Chuck is adorable like Olive. The two aunts are a delight. I sincerely hope that you write them in larger parts, since they are magical. <br /> <br /> Well, those are all the news that can be printed. Make yourself a big bowl of popcorn and enjoy something fun the old-fashioned way. This is like Dr. Seuss for adults.
