My friends and I were discussing how frustrated we are with the way movies are made and especially the romantic comedy. We are offended by the stupid Hollywood is serving these days as they act as if everything is fine. <br /> <br /> Well, all is not well ... with the exception of some bright spots, like this movie. It does not have the big-name actors, the big budget, I do not think it had a great release (I rented it from Hollywood Video), it really did not have anything that the biggest romantic comedy has. <br /> <br /> But he had what most of them lacked. He had a great chemistry between love interests, "Parker" (Jonathan Schaech) and "Sam" (Alison Eastwood). His love story was not forced on us like so many. The director took his time to allow these characters to really get to know each other. His story reminded me of one of my favorites, "Tootsie." <br /> <br /> The supporting cast not only added really funny comedy moments, but also depth in the story. The character of James LeGros was absolutely invaluable. Sam's gay friend was hysterical. Parker's interaction with his co-workers on a psychic hotline was very fun. <br /> <br /> I laughed, I cried, I remembered how good it feels to fall in love.
