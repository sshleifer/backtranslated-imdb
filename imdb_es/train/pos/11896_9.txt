I came across the repetition of the syndication of this program several years ago, and I fell in love with it. He introduced TÃ©a Leoni and Holland Taylor and made me laugh, one episode after the next. I guess it did not make it that big, and it was canceled after a few seasons, but I think it was a good race, and I would suggest seeing it ... if the opportunity arises.
