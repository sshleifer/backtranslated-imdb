I saw it for the first time in the early 90s on UK television, so I liked it, but I lost the opportunity to record it, many years passed, but the film always stayed with me and I lost the hope of seeing it again, the main thing What stayed with me was the end, the part of the pit castle really touched me, it's easy to see, it has a great story, a great music, the list goes on and on, it's okay to say how good it is, but all They will take their own opinion. It is best to have them with them once they have seen it, yes, the animation is first class and beautiful to see, it shows its age in very few parts, but now it has become part of its beauty. I'm glad it came out. on DVD since it is one of my 10 best movies of all time. Buy or fix it just to see it, the best visualization is at night only with drinks and food at your fingertips so you do not have to stop the movie. <br /> <br /> Enjoy
