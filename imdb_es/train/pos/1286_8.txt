This family history of an older man / young woman is surprisingly hard. Bikers, hippies, free love and prison bait mix surprisingly well in this forgotten black and white indie effort. The main actress, Patricia Wymer, as the titular "Candy", gives the best performance of her career (covering the 3 epic drive-in). Wymer was precocious and attractive in THE YOUNG GRADUATES (1971), but offers a more serious performance in THE BABYSITTER. Occasional violence and periodic nudity are somewhat surprising, but well managed by the director. Leaders Wymer and George E. Carey sell the May / December romance credibly. There are enough similarities between THE BABYSITTER and THE YOUNG GRADUATES that one wonders if the same director also directed this last movie. Patricia Wymer, where are you? <br /> <br /> Hailing from Seattle, WA, Miss Wymer had appeared as a dancer on the rock and roll TV show MALIBU U, before decorating the cover (in addition to appearing in an eight-page) of the number August 1968 of "Best For Men", a magazine of good taste only for adults. She also appeared as a group witch in the popular cult film of 1969 THE WITCHMAKER. <br /> <br /> THE BABYSITTER finally made its debut in the home video, as part of the set of eight movies BCI DRIVE-IN CULTOS CL√ÅSICOS vol. 3, which is available on Amazon.com and at some retail stores such as Best Buy.
