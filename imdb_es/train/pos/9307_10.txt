It's not a movie for everyone, but this movie is among my 10 best. I am a lover of black comedy. With a cast that includes Richard Dreyfus (Vic), Jeff Goldblum (Mick), Larry Bishop (Nick) and Gabriel Byrne (London's Ben 'Brass Balls on the tracks), the lines can not help but be dry. The supporting cast is almost the dead center. Counting the minor flaws in the film: Ellen Barkin's makeup gave her face a washed look; There were a couple of whims of Joey Bishop and Richard Pryor that did not help, and the screen time of Michael J. Pollard was too short. Above all, the cast was simply amazing without egos to destroy good writing. If you've seen the movie by Larry Bishop (writer, director), Underworld (a dark crime movie), you'll enjoy this one. His next outing (writer, director, actor) is Hell Ride with Michael Madsen and Quentin Tarantino.
