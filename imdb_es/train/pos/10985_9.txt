I was speechless and devastated after my first time seeing it, many parts of GRAY GARDENS are very funny and incredibly surreal. No documentary, this really gives Fellini or David Lynch a run for his money in the weirdsville contest. I kept concentrating on how these women (who are clinically far from being eccentric) reveal their own humanity in the most surprising way, and I wonder if their withdrawal from the world was caused by something beyond the congestion of life in the unreal blood blue. universe, maybe some abuse, or maybe just a streak of defiance and rebellion that went spiraling out of control and took on a life of its own. This could be one of the best movies in history that is dangerously close to exploitation, without going over the limit. While the Edies do their thing, I wrote down things like empty gin bottles in the bedroom full of debris, the cats who wet the room. The bed, the raccoons that emerged from the holes in the walls and the final scene seemed incredibly sad, as if a child's birthday party was very bad. Definitely worth seeing and looking for, you will never forget it, but it is very disturbing.
