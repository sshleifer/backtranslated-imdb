I did not set very high expectations for this movie, which left me pleasantly surprised. The story is a bit strange at times, but overall I think it has an acceptable credibility. The action scenes are quite nice and the music that accompanies it is used to induce a bit of patriotic feelings common to American movies. This may not be the best movie, but it is not common in Sweden and I hope to see more similar in the future.
