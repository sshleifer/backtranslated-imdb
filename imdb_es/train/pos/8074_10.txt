Gypo Nolan (Victor McLaglen) is as poor as anyone on Earth. Living in Ireland in 1920, Gypo and his Irish compatriots are part of a clandestine rebellion against the oppressive British. A rebel in particular, wanted for murder by the English, returns to the city in secret. He thinks he can trust his friend Gypo, but the 20-pound reward is too tempting. Gypo kills his friend and sinks into a pit of despair and intoxication. Meanwhile, the other Irish rebels are looking for the informant. Immediately, Gypo, with the money burning a hole in his pocket, is his main suspect, but they, who are his friends, do not want to believe it. The story of The Informer is simple in its plot, but complex in its moral and emotional problems. It is easily one of the films with greater emotional involvement of John Ford. What Gypo did was wrong, but we can certainly understand his motives. We also understand its lamentable character, and there is much sympathy that arises for it. The script is also very suspenseful. It is the kind of suspense in which we are quite sure that we know how everything will end, so we have to grit our teeth and endure it. The performance is remarkable. Victor McLaglen, who acted in many of Ford's films, probably gave his best performance here (and won an Oscar for it). All the other artists in the film deserve their congratulations. In addition to an amazing script and performance, The Informer is one of John Ford's most expressionist films. I love the darker side of Ford. In his mood, as well as his themes, The Informer reminds me of two of my other favorite Ford movies, The Long Voyage Home (1940) and The Fugitive (1948); It is also a bit similar to The Grapes of Wrath (1940) in these aspects. 10/10.
