Bromwell High is a cartoon comedy. It was executed at the same time as other programs about school life, such as "Teachers". My 35 years in the teaching profession lead me to believe that the satire of Bromwell High is much closer to reality than the "Masters". The struggle to survive financially, the insightful students who can see through the pathetic pomp of their pathetic teachers, the pettiness of the whole situation, remind me of the schools I knew and their students. When I saw the episode in which a student repeatedly tried to burn down the school, I immediately remembered ......... in .......... High. A classic line: INSPECTOR: I'm here to say goodbye to one of your teachers. STUDENT: Welcome to Bromwell High. I hope many adults my age think that Bromwell High is crazy. What a pity it is not!
