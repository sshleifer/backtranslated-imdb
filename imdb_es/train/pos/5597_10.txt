"Le Locataire" ("The Tenant") is undoubtedly one of the most important horror films ever made. Polanski plays Trelkovsky, a shy file clerk who lives in Paris, responding to an advertisement for an apartment, only to discover that the previous tenant tried to commit suicide by jumping out of the apartment window. Trelkovsky is forced to visit her in the hospital and there she meets Stella (Isabelle Adjani). Trelkovsky moves immediately when the previous tenant dies and, at first, is quite happy to have found such a nice apartment. His happiness will soon be replaced by waves of paranoia, as he becomes increasingly suspicious of his neighbors, who seem to be trying to provoke Trelkovsky to repeat the suicide of the previous tenant. This movie is great. Polanski manages to create a surrealist. Atmosphere of terror and paranoia. A lot of bright moments, like the classic scene in which Trelkovsky discovers the tooth of the previous tenant in a hole in the wall, or the feverish dream in which he enters the building. To find the walls covered with hieroglyphs, the photograph of Sven Nykvist is really beautiful. "The tenant" is an abandoned jewel. It can be difficult to track it, but it's worth the effort.
