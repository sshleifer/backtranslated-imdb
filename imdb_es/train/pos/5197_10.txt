This movie ran completely around the original Dolemite. It had everything that makes a movie great ... except for real actors. (Ernie Hudson could not do it alone and you know it! LOL) I admit that I killed my first video tape of this movie and I plan to buy the DVD version again as soon as possible! This movie has so many catchy lines that it's unfortunate! I am ashamed to say that I know the theme song in reverse! I love Jimmy Lynch's character to death, and he should have won the Best Supporting Actor Award at Blaxploitation, but the Oscars were NEVER ready for this! This is a random movie that consists of crooked cops, breasts, chases, bad editing and, of course, martial arts. (Being that they are 70 and I can say that everyone knew some kind of martial arts). I think this movie should be restored and shown one night in the middle of a marathon in local theaters!
