This is probably one of Brian De Palma's best-known films, but it's not the best. Body Double, The Fury and Carrie are better movies, but this movie is better than Blow Out and Obsession. De Palma is very influenced by Hitchcock and this movie is a Psycho takeoff. Angie Dickinson is a bored housewife who is thinking about having an affair and after her psychiatrist, played by Michael Caine, rejects an offer, Dickinson meets a man in an art gallery and ends up sleeping with him. After this point, it is better that you do not know what happens, but there is a murder and Nancy Allen is a prostitute who looks at the murderer. Dennis Franz is the case detective who does not really trust Allen and she has to find the killer herself. It's a good movie, but it's not one of the best of De Palma.
