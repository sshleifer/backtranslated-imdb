Miike makes an adventure movie for children, not like The Neverending Story. Actually it's one of my favorite movies of the director. However, even the worst Miike is better than many movies, and The Great Yokai War has a lot to recommend. It is at least as noisy and unpleasant as most movies for American children. You might think that the children themselves will like it very much (the DVD includes a copy in English), but, like all Miike's films, it may tend to move very slowly. That means you have a strange kind of irregularity, where sometimes there is a noisy action sequence and the next scene will go on forever while the characters talk. The story itself is not very good either, and Miike's perpetual incoherence flaw sticks out his ugly head. Most of what I liked came from the technical side of things. This has to be the most expensive movie of Miike, and it looks fantastic. The "Yokai" are Japanese spirits, and they come in all different and fantastic ways, and the costume designers, the special effects team and everyone else involved in the designs did an excellent job. I've seen the 1968 movie that it's supposedly based on (Yokai Monsters: Spook Warfare), and the rubber-suit monsters you can find there have been transformed into more credible entities using state-of-the-art makeup and special products. Effects I especially liked the look of one of the bad guys (or girls, in this case), Agi, who wears dark shadows, a tight white suit, a white beehive hairstyle and a whip. She played, by the way, Chiaki Kuriyama, whom you may remember as Lucy Liu's teenage daughter in Kill Bill: vol. 1. The hero of the film is played by Ryunosuke Kamiki, who provided voices for Miyazaki's Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle.
