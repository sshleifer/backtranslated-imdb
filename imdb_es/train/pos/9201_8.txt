Dev Anand (or Prashant) and Zeenat Aman (Jasbir / Janice) are brothers raised in single-parent families. Jasbir (the sister) grows up in a rich environment, but this is not enough to make her reject her life and, finally, join a hippie movement that finally leads her to drugs. Prashant (the brother), on the other hand, grows up in a less prosperous environment, but grows to become a mature gentleman. The story marks Prashant making efforts to save his little sister (who is perpetually in a trance) from a hostile hippie environment. This film passes the test of time, commenting that the groups of cults and hippies are a place for those who give up when they should get up and be counted in the face of adversity. Magnificent musical compositions in this film that mean different things in different situations and for different people, and the director gives a strange feeling.
