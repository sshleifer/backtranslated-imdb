I have been impressed with Chávez's stance against globalization for some time, but it was not until I saw the film at the Amsterdam International Film Festival that I realized what he really accomplished. This film tells the story of the coup / conspiracy of the elite of Venezuela, the oil companies and the corrupt and oil-loving Western governments, to remove the democratically elected president Chávez and return Venezuela to a brutal dictatorship. This film is for all those who believe in freedom and justice, and it is also a lesson for the rest of the world! I congratulate the people of Venezuela for taking matters into their own hands and saving their country from people like Halliburton and the Bush regime.
