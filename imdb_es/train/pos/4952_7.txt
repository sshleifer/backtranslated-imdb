['Revised in the second screening of September 12, 2006 at the Paramount 1 theater during the Toronto International Film Festival. The film premiered worldwide the day before in the VISA screening room at Elgin Theater. <br /><br /> The basic plot involves Morgan Freeman playing a popular one-time actor who is on the downward slope of his career and who is taking on roles that may be below him, but still doing so with a positive attitude, knowing that You need to pay the rent. The descending slope is indicated by its long time between the papers with previous films in cheap DVD trays and its driver by a production assistant who is not very sure of himself and who leaves Freeman in a local community market where he will do Research for a role as supermarket manager. He soon discovers that the real life market is in charge of an employee of the starting line &quot;10 Items or Less&quot; of iron will interpreted by Paz Vega. When Freeman never comes back and Vega needs help preparing for an interview, circumstances make them join in a trip through the city to take Freeman home and get Vega a job that leads to a more upward career. <br /><br /> Although the movie was nice, it felt like it was still a sketch or a work in progress. There were two extended musical sequences (one with Vega and Freeman teaching children songs in the car, one that literally plays like a Paul Simon music video) that felt like a filler to increase time and even then the movie only had a few 80 minutes long <br /><br /> It&#39;s good that Morgan Freeman likes it as much as he does because without him, this would have been very little. Of course it was fun in some places and Paz Vega is also a delight, but there was not enough here to say that it was a complete movie. <br /><br /> I got lost when Morgan Freeman started talking about stopping the car to ask for directions and Paz Vega said he never does that. Who has heard of a boy who wants to ask for directions and the woman who says no? In the real world, it is exactly the opposite. <br /><br /> Make sure you stay for the credits. The brigade with a Target Store saleswoman teaching Morgan Freeman how to rush sales is simply funny! An early part in which Freeman&#39;s driver insists that it is Freeman&#39;s voice in a reading of &quot;Books on Tape&quot; was also quite funny. <br /><br /> Director / writer Brad Silberling and actress Paz Vega were there for a brief question and answer session after the screening. Silberling answered a question by saying that the script was not written specifically for Morgan Freeman and that once Freeman took over the role, he changed very little of what was there. A compliment to Silberling&#39;s writings and also to how Freeman can slip on a piece of paper and make him feel as if he was born to interpret it.']
