I am Belgian and I grew up in the sixties. The majority of the series of EE. UU They were shown here (original language with subtitles) and Batman was one of the first ones I was interested in. Unfortunately, here it caused a "panic hysteria" among the mothers because Batman was considered too violent. Geez, compare the innocence of that series with the garbage that children see today. So due to my overprotective mothers of the 60's, I only had the chance to see maybe two or three episodes! I got so frustrated that I started to collect the comics and the gum cards (I still have them!) To compensate. I even got the View Master slides ... I wanted to see the crusader with the cape. All children need some kind of hero. <br /> <br /> Years later, I finally had the opportunity to see the replays as a teenager and enjoyed it immensely. The ironic performance would have escaped me when I had seen him as a child, but I understood him at the age of 17. Yes, I've seen them all now and the occasional friendly soul in Internet publications. episodes because they have not released the series on DVD (to my knowledge) <br /> <br /> Tonight I enjoyed "Return to the bat cave" ... it was a pleasure to see it because it was full of trivia. And inside jokes. Seeing Adam and Burt was delightful and this television movie is simply fantastic in every respect. They play themselves as they did their part in the series. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to the people who produced this great nostalgic "banquet" ... I will see it again. My advice to all Batman fans is: SEE IT !!! Rent it !!! Lend it to a friend !!! Buy it !!! I would never expect you to rate this as 9/10 ... Very well done!
