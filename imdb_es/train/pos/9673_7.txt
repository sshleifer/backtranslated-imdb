Paulie sounds like the most saccharine, tearful and sentimental garbage you can find, but in reality it's much better than you might expect. The stupidity of the plot could easily have set the tone for the whole movie, but in reality, in most other departments, the film is charming. <br /> <br /> In case you're wondering, Paulie is a parrot. Purchased by a small girl with difficulty speaking, Paulie becomes her best friend and goes everywhere with her. He even sits on his shoulder during speech therapy lessons, and eventually becomes a super intelligent speaker. However, Paulie is expelled by the girl's mother and he spends the rest of the movie trying to get from NYC to LA to join her. <br /> <br /> So, why does this horrible sound sound? Does the movie succeed relatively well? First of all, it has some interesting and impressive animatronic effects. Secondly (and much more important) has the courage to embrace his absurd premise and tells a genuinely moving story, often funny, without worrying too much about the obvious flaws in the story. Third, she has several surprisingly strong performances, including Jay Mohr as a sly con man, Gena Rowlands as a kind old lady and Cheech Marin (yes, Cheech Marin!) As a musical immigrant. It may not be a classic, but Paulie is a sound entertainment for children of all ages.
