['&quot;Scoop&quot; is also the name of a novel by Evelyn Waugh of the thirties, and Woody Allen&#39;s new film, although it premiered today, has a nostalgic charm and simplicity. It does not have the depth of characterization, the intense performances, the suspense or the shocking final chill of Allen&#39;s penultimate effort &quot;Match Point&quot; (argued by many, including this critic, as a strong return to form) but &quot;Scoop&quot; It seems much The last output of Allen focuses on the English aristocrats, the luxurious apartments of London, murder and detection. This time Woody leaves behind the mystery genre of arrivist murder and returns to comedy, and reappears on the screen as a gentle vaudevillian, a wizard named Sid Waterman, stage nickname The Great Splendini, who responds to some polls with &quot; snb. &quot; to be of Hebrew persuasion, but as I got older, I became narcissistic. &quot;After a revelation in the midst of Splendini&#39;s standard act of dematerialization, with Scarlett Johansson (as Sondra Pransky) the audience volunteer, the couple Unpaired is involved in the post-mortem attempt of a dead English journalist to write down one of the last important news.On the edge of the Styx, Joe Strombel (Ian McShane) has just met in the shadow of a secretary of Lord Lyman&#39;s son, who says he was poisoned, and told him that the charming and aristocratic son Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman) was the murderer of the Tarot card, a serial killer in London.Sondra and Sid immediately become a pair of amateur detectives With Sid&#39;s ingenuity and Sondra&#39;s sumptuous beauty, they quickly made their way to the cream of London&#39;s aristocracy. <br /><br /> Woody is not kicking his young heroine muse, as in &quot;Match Point&quot;, again Johansson, as in the past. This time, in addition, Scarlett is not an ambitious sexpot and a possible movie star. She has been transformed amazingly into a dazed, with glasses, but still quite elegant. Sid and Sondra have no flirtation, which is a great relief. They simply join, more or less politely, to fulfill Strombel&#39;s wishes by making friends with Lyman and observing him for clues to his guilt. With only a minimal protest, Sid agrees to appear as Sondra&#39;s father. Sondra, who has captivated Peter by pretending to drown in her club&#39;s pool, re-baptizes herself as Jade Spence. Mr. Spence, that is to say, Woody, continues to cover himself by doing card tricks, but he entertains widows with these and beats his husbands in poker, throwing direct lines without stopping and at the same time maintaining, apparently successfully, that It is in oil. and precious metals, such as &quot;Jade&quot; has told him to say. <br /><br /> That is all there is to do, or everything that can be told without ruining the story by revealing its result. At first, Allen&#39;s decision to make Johansson a gauche schoolgirl, naively married and poorly dressed is not only unpleasant, but a totally wrong decision. But Johansson, who has played and has become an actress, manages to miraculously accomplish it, helped by Jackman, an actor who knows how to make any actress look desirable, if desired. The film actually creates a sense of relationships, to compensate for the limited range of characters: Sid and Sondra fight in a friendly way, and Peter and Sondra have a credible attraction even if it&#39;s artificial and tainted (after all, she&#39;s going to bed with a presumed homicidal maniac). <br /><br /> What bothers us a little is that Allen is once again drooling over English wealth and class, the things that his Brooklyn story seems to have left him, despite all his celebrity, with an eager desire to do so. Jackman is an awesome guy, glamorous and elegant. His parents were English. But could this athletic comedy musical star raised in Australia (&quot;Wolverine&quot; by X-Man) really pass as an aristocrat? Only in the movies, maybe (here and in &quot;Kate and Leopold&quot;). <br /><br /> This is not a movie as strong as &quot;Match Point&quot;, but to say that it is a loser as some spectators have, is a mistake. It has no more depth than a half-hour radio program or a television show, but Woody&#39;s jokes are much more fun and original than in any other media of this type, and sometimes show a return to the old wit intelligence. It does not matter if a movie is silly or slapdash when it&#39;s diverting summer entertainment. On a hot day you do not want a heavy meal. All this deliciously evokes a moment in which the movie comedies were a very light escapist entertainment, without crude jokes or grandiloquent effects; without Vince Vaughan or Owen Wilson. Critics are eager to tell them that this is a return to Allen&#39;s decline that preceded the &quot;Point of coincidence.&quot; Do not believe them. He does not try too hard. Because I should? He may be 70 years old, but verbally, he is still light on his feet. And his body moves pretty fast too.']
