Theodore Rex is possibly the best film experience of all time, and it is certainly a milestone in human culture, civilization and artistic expression. In this convincing intellectual masterpiece, Jonathan R. Betuel is aligned with the great filmmakers of the twentieth century, such as Francis Ford Copola, Martin Scorcese, Orson Welles and Roman Polanski. The special effects are nothing less than impressive, and make any work of Spielberg look trite and elementary. At the time of its release, Theodore Rex was such a revolutionary jewel that it raised the level of cinematography to levels never anticipated by filmmakers. The concept of not only making a movie with a dinosaur, but adapting an exciting and action-packed detective novel, co-looking at a "talking" dinosaur with a postmodern name like "Theodore", and a female existential police changed Mankind as we know it. The world could never be the same after experiencing such magnificent beauty. Seeing Theodore Rex is very similar to looking at the face of God and hearing him say "you are my dearest creation". This is one of the few movies that is simply to die for!
