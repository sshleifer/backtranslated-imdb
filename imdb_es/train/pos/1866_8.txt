A great story, based on a true story about a young black man and all the difficulties along the way. Since this is Denzel Washington's first film that he himself will direct, I must admit that he was a bit skeptical, but who would not be ...? But, again, he is a great actor with many years of experience and the final result was excellent. The story is told in an excellent way, which means that he has had difficulties during his childhood and in adulthood, which is seen in those situations. Then, it hits you hard, letting you know that you are not the only one going through hell. In total, a moving story about a young man trying to succeed in this shitty world. (The story is based on the life of Antwone Fisher, born on August 3, 1959 in Cleveland, Ohio, USA, who was also the author of this film). Highly recommended 8/10
