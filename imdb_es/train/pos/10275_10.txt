Get ready for it: this is one of my favorite movies of all time. I am relatively unaware of the other works of David Mamet (writer and director), but after having seen this film half a dozen times (it is always a pleasure to see it), I can say without hesitation that he is a genius. This movie is extremely well written, and quickly attracts you to its surroundings of deception, artistic scams and hustle and bustle. The sensation of the film is very similar to The Sting (1973) and it is also a tribute to the black cinema. <br /> <br /> It's a fairly complex film from the psychological point of view and it will definitely make you think about the various twists and motives of the plot. of the somber characters. Sometimes it's a bit predictable, but the shocking climax is always exciting to watch. <br /> <br /> In general, the acting is excellent, especially Joe Mantegna, but someone with whom I saw the film told me that it is not a It is a good idea to have a heroine (Lindsay Crouse) who is not only a player , a smoker and a thief, but also have a hairstyle of the 80. I agree, but I think that, however, is outstanding on paper. <br /> <br /> The less you know about the plot of this movie, the better, like Mamet's latest movie, The Spanish Prisoner, because the ending will be even more impressive. Just curl up and prepare for a movie that is dangerously close to brilliance.
