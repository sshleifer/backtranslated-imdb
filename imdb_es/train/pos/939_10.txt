Well, there are a lot of comments here, what can I add? <br /> <br /> I'll try anyway. <br /> <br /> The reason why this is my favorite Scrooge is because of EVERYTHING. The sets, outdoor places, costumes are so beautiful and authentic. The music is sweet. The cast is very well done. One of my favorites is the narrator and nephew, played by Roger Rees. His discreet sincerity is touching and his voice is the sound of Christmas for me. David Warner is also a totally believable Bob Cratchit. Hers is a difficult life, but it is still positive and dignified. <br /> <br /> The best part, of course, is George C. Scott as Ebenezer Scrooge. Some have said that his portrait is too abrupt. I could not disagree more. Their exchanges at first, although cold or hard, were not out of place. He is a terribly disillusioned man whose heart has been hardened by the vicissitudes of life and his own lust for wealth. <br /> <br /> During the flashbacks, it is obvious that it is not completely abrupt. This is where we see that there is hope for him. If he had gone completely, his partner Marley would never have come for his good in the first place. And after all, we are not any of us beyond hope. I think that's a HUGE part of what Dickens was trying to say. When Scrooge observes his dance in Belle with his employer, you see him smile with regret while telling Belle in the flashback that he will spend his life "with a smile on my face". Clive Donner was smart enough as the director to allow these moments in the film. Sometimes they stay on the floor of the editing room. <br /> <br /> And finally, her conversion is so absolutely full of joy that it makes me cry with joy every time I see her. His apologies to his nephew Fred, so sincere, so moving, is the spirit not only of Christmas, but of humanity itself. The joy that Fred brings to his wife is so obvious. And the line that puts me each time, "God forgive me for the time I wasted." <br /> <br /> Bravi tutti!
