['A classic caricature, always fun and funny. It has an interesting plot complete with adorable characters. Road Rovers is a program that is worth seeing, it is a short 13 episodes, and if you ever get the chance to see it, you should do it. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to find. I think the Warner Brothers studios should release a DVD that contains all 13 episodes. I would definitely buy it if they did, and if they do, you should also buy it. If you have kids who like dogs, they will love rovers! Road Rovers should have received more attention while it was broadcast, it was definitely an original and very special show that should have been appreciated much more than it was.']
