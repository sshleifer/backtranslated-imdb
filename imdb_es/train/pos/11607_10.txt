Picture Bride has an excellent insight into Hawaii's past and the people who lived there at that time. The time, the money earned and the hours these people dedicated to their lives to survive and live, acquire a new meaning for blood, sweat and tears. <br /> <br /> The concept of dating / encounters is something like what we do today similar through the network. Only that is more than postal mail. Very slow snail. <br /> <br /> The singing of the songs of the workers of the plantation reminds me of the songs of the workers of the southern plantations about their disappearance and future goals. <br /> <br /> The film shows the difficulties, as well as the soft romantic scenes that Hawaii can bring. Like the stillness of a storm and the sudden chaos of the rain and then the tranquility.
