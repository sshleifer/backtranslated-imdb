This series, probably produced at the most propitious time after the events of World War II, is on a scale of value that is well above the presumption of any individual to criticize. <br /> <br /> The timing of the production of World at War in 1974, equivalent to some three decades after the events of the war, allows a precise relationship of events in a colorless manner by the residual propaganda and the inclination. The passage of thirty years allows the narrative to be supported by an impressive and fascinating panoply of the same individuals involved, ranging from some of the highest political and military figures to field soldiers, civilians and survivors of the camps. extermination as they have remained to bear witness to the unimaginable inhumanities of which civilized humans are capable. The subjects interviewed, who approached more or were well in their later years, had had enough time to reflect on their experiences and in most cases had had enough time for the propaganda and fervor that had affected them in the past they would have walked away, leaving only the memories. of what they saw and what they did. <br /> <br /> The information provided by these survivors, surprisingly reinforced by the postures and expressions they display while telling their part, gives more impact to their stories. Names like Ira Eaker, Adolph Galland, Louis Mountbatten, Albert Speer, Gertrude Junge (personal secretary of Hitler) ... the list is too long to relate it. <br /> <br /> Today, in the lives of the survivors of this enormous lesson in the horrible price of political ambition, there are young people who sing the same kind of militaristic and nationalist war promotion that led to WW2. The DVD series we are discussing here should understand the core of a compulsory history topic in schools, that lessons purchased at such a horrible cost in those days should not have been wasted but should be taken seriously by those who did not see it. first hand A terrible price. <br /> <br /> I almost finished watching the set of 11 discs, after having seen most of the series when a local television channel aired it more than 10 years ago. It has not lost any of its moving value to me, in fact it has become an even more magnificent chronicle of some of the darkest days of human times. <br /> <br /> The highest possible rating is not worthy of being applied to this presentation. I think the value of this series is beyond the account.
