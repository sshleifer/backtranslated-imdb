Since I was only a small child when this program was originally broadcast, I recently picked up the DVD set and wish that more episodes were recorded. This program was a version of the 70's of the popular TV series "X-Files" of the 90s, but with a slightly more comical and cheerful approach. But do not get me wrong, some of these episodes are full of horror themes, many of which have some pretty green arguments (left to the imagination, of course, this was the television of the early 70's). <br /> <br /> Some of the plots were a bit silly, in addition to the acting, but that is the charm and attraction of this series. Whether you like dramas, comedies or science fiction / horror themes of mysterious crimes, this series brought all that together. Each episode lasted approximately 50 minutes approximately (1 hour with commercials) and those 50 minutes pass quickly and leave me wanting more. A great classic show that is underestimated in my book!
