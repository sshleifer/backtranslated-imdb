I have always had the philosophy that every human being has different tastes, I found that this movie is amazing and I think that every university student could agree with me. Even though this is not a "movie with an argument", it is about real people and some of the "problems" they face. I found the movie hilarious (especially the parts where they played practical jokes with each other). In short, if you are on the same "wavelength" as these people, this movie will seem incredible. I do not think this is going to win Golden Globes or Oscar, or that people in this film will become future Hollywood stars, but it's a sort of "cult classic" among young people that could relate to their experience. For me, the boy who stands out is Hans: the Scandinavian boy, who, according to him, "is not a spectator", but gets all (or some) of the girls. "Small people" also play an important role in the film, especially when they are drunk. If I continue, I can provide a spoiler and I do not want to do that, just go find the movie and you will not regret it. I give it an 8/10
