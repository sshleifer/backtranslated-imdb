Franco proves, once again, that he is the prince of surrealistic and erotic cinema. It is true that much of his work can be considered as an entertaining sleaze, but with Succubus (Necronomicon) it shows what he is really capable of doing when his twisted creativity goes wild and he gives us a film that is hypnotic and enigmatic at the same time maintains delirium The intrinsic eroticism in his work. The splendid score of Jerry Van Rooyen vibrates when the spectator is thrown from one strange scene to another while we follow the tests of a strip artist (Reynaud) who can be schizophrenic, or who can be (as a mysterious character says) a demon, an attempt to reach an agreement with the world that inhabits. A beautiful and enigmatic piece of cinema highly recommended for anyone who has a passing interest in alternative cinema.
