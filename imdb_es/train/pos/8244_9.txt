I loved! What do you not like? - you got your suburban area, got your zombies, had family problems, got your social dilemmas, got yourself a Retro Fino 1950s Style Eating under the Portfolio Held in the Bay For a Restless Worried About if they are the next meal of the upper crust. You can not ask for more. <br /> <br /> The cast is excellent. Carrie Ann Moss is absolute perfection as a debutante social climbing housewife. She is both unjustified, and criminally conspiratorial. All people's dream. K'sun is really great, since the son is trying to be as normal as possible in this nightmare existence, and is somehow achieving it. It is a genuine screen presence. Very photogenic, and natural. Without naming them all, the rest of the cast is wonderful. Henry Czerny plays a suspicious cop with sharp instincts and little apprehension as if he were his everyday character. Billy Connolly is a delight like Fido. A good actor: I wish I had played the lead role in "Braveheart", with the direction of Gibson. My feeling is that his William Wallace would have been closer to the real character. Su Fido is contained, but accessible. A nice touch <br /> <br /> In short, a great and wonderful satirical blow to morals, values, social influences, feelings, growth, coping in uncertain times and compensatory adjustments to impossible conditions. A true reality show.
