The first time I saw this movie was years ago and I kept seeing it several times a year when I have an opportunity. It's on my list of favorite movies along with some of the classics. If someone tells you that it is nonsense or outdated, ignore them ... this movie is for anyone who enjoys laughter and music. Dancing is not as important in this movie as in other Astaire films, so comedy and acting shine. Watch this movie if you can, it can be light but it's still fun. So I know that a lot of people hate black and white movies, they think that old movies can not really be fun, this movie should make them change their minds. Nobody I know can see this movie without being at least slightly entertained. The only problem with the movie: Fred Astaire singing without dancing. He can be a great performer and a capable singer, but he is simply not fascinating and leaves a big hole in the middle of the story. The comedy sometimes has a bit of clich√©, but the vaudeville performances of G burns and G Allen are simply perfect for the piece and can satisfy anyone looking for some easy laughs. Give this movie a chance, even if you do not like old movies, this movie can attract the ridiculous in anyone.
