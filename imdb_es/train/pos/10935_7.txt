Well, I must say that this was a very funny movie. Even though the dubbing was pretty cheesy, and there were some strange moments in which the movie seemed to turn dark blue for no apparent reason, it did not disappoint me. The story was quite interesting: the last member of the poisoning Clan must track the other five members and discover who is using their evil skills and who is using them for good. The key was that during the training, all the clans were masked, and since then all have returned to society in disguise and have changed their names. <br /> <br /> The fights are a joy to watch, as each member of the Poison The clan has a different fighting style: toad (my favorite), snake, scorpion, lizard and centipede. The fight scenes make the actors jump everywhere and, fortunately, the camera is planted and uses a wide enough shot so that you can clearly see all the action. <br /> <br /> The only drawback of the movie is that the story tends to crawl a bit in the first half until the first fight sequence. But stay with that, and you will not be disappointed!
