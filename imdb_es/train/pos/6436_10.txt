Ingrid Bergman is a temporarily impoverished Polish countess in Paris in the 20th century, who is being persecuted by France's most popular general and by a glamorous recount, and that is in addition to being engaged to a shoemaker magnate. Such is the fail-proof premise that contains one of the most delirious arguments in the history of cinema. There are political fret manipulators on the part of the general's manipulators, a downed balloonist and an ecstatic Bastille Day crowd, but the heart of this superbly photographed movie are the frantic up and down intrigues that involve Randy's servants and only to aristocrats a little more restricted. Yes, it is rules of the game redux. Before it's over, even Gaston Modot, the jealous Ranger of Rules, makes his appearance, like a gypsy capo, no less! Things go a little too fast and fast towards the end, which results in some confusion for this person who does not speak French, but what the heck, Elena and her men is another deeply human masterpiece of Renoir.
