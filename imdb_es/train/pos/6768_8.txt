One of my favorite shows in the 80's. After the first season, it began to go downhill when they decided to add Jean Bruce Scott to the cast. Deborah Pratt was wonderful and it was fun to see her accompanied by the character of Ernest Borgnine and her. The last episode in which he appeared was one of my favorites for the second season. Unfortunately during those days, the blacks did not last long in the television programs. Some of the episodes of the second season were fine, but the third season was more about the human characters than Airwolf and did not show until near the end of the show. When he went to the USA, it was disgusting !!!
