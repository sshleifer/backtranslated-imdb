['I had not seen this movie since the late 80s and decided to buy the VHS version of it. The plot is very slow, and the actors almost seem robotic in this breakdance movie. Music, hip hop / freestyle artists and breakdancing scenes are what make this film special. Breakdance is really better in this movie than in &quot;Breakin &#39;&quot;, but I must say that &quot;Breakin&#39; 1 &amp; 2&quot; brings the energy and emotion to the screen much better. It&#39;s a movie that I&#39;ll keep in my library, but it&#39;s not a movie I can watch over and over again, just once in a blue moon.']
