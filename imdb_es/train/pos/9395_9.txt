If you like the plot turns, this is your movie. It is impossible at any time to predict what will happen next. Nothing is as it appears or ends as you think it will. The characters are all sandy and attractive. Cage is at his best. Dennis Hopper again shows his deliciously sinister side. JT Walsh is perfect in his last performance. Laura Boyle sizzles. Dwight Yoakum makes an extraordinary film debut in a cameo. I classify this movie as "I'm having a very, very, very bad movie." It's not a slow minute in this movie. A true sleeper. This film is underestimated and, sadly, overlooked.
