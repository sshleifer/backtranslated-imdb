['The Hotel Du Nord is an exciting drama of guilt in which Marcel Carne portrayed an entertaining miserable love story that also works as a revolt against the cruel world. The movie is based entirely on a couple of unfortunate lovers. Pierre and Renee were wrong. when they believed that suicide would put an end to their misery. The Hotel Du Nord has its own inimitable charm, as its inhabitants have become an essential part of the establishment. There is an element of coexistence when everyone goes to the Hotel Du Nord to eat, chat. Marcel Carne has remained true to the spirit of the films produced in the 30s and 40s, since the Hotel Du Nord has a certain nostalgic feeling. Carne, while recreating the life of the Parisian roads, was able to create a kind of nostalgia for the black and the Hotel Du Nord can be described as quintessential film populism. The scene of July 14 on the banks of the San Mart√≠n canal is still a magnificent sequence. The image of the film Much popularity can be judged by the fact that the Hotel Du Nord has been declared a national monument.']
