A brilliant Russian emigrant elaborates the system of "Stanislavsky" to win on the contract bridge, which makes him and his beautiful wife the GRAND SLAM Sweethearts of America. <br /> <br /> What could have been just a stupid soap opera is raised by good production values ​​and excellent performance in the state of a very nice little comedy. Some unexpected touches are thrown to keep the spectator's attention, the way in which the main cast is presented as faces in a deck of cards; the introduction of a crazy acrobatic in the plot, for no other reason than to enjoy a little madness; and the way in which a great variety of different types of Americans are shown that are paralyzed when listening to the transmission of the final game. <br /> <br /> Paul Lukas and Loretta Young do very well as Bridge Sweethearts - Lukas Soft and sophisticated, and Miss Young, passionately loving and beautiful (even if the script causes a cigarette to be inflated too much). It's fun to watch them, even when their behavior is not always the most credible and convincing. <br /> <br /> Frank McHugh offers another good performance as an implacably cheerful ghostwriter who adores Miss Young. The charming Glenda Farrell avoids her usual character to cackle in a small role as the ditsy gal McHugh's friend. Roscoe Karns manages the quick dialogue as a blatant radio announcer. The weaker Ferdinand Gottschalk is wonderful as an expert in the snobbery of the bridge. <br /> <br /> Film experts will recognize Dewey Robinson as a belligerent sponsor of a nightclub; Emma Dunn as a sister reporter sobs; Paul Porcasi as owner of the Russian disco; Charles Lane as a Russian waiter; and Jimmy Conlin as a kibitzer in the final bridge game, all uncredited. <br /> <br /> The film takes advantage of the contractual bridge fashion that had spread across the country since its development in the 1920s. It expects the viewer to have a basic understanding of the complexities of the game and do not try explain anything to the uninformed.
