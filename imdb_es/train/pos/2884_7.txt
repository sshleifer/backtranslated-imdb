Of all the princess stories that Disney has published, Cinderella probably has the most lasting appeal. I really can not say why, but for some reason, generation after generation pushes her to the top of her lists. As a child, I wanted nothing more than to be Cinderella with her glass slipper, it was my absolute favorite costume. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I do not think there is any story that realizes the yearnings of The Human Heart Cinderella. Who has never wanted to flee the nightmares of everyday life and find someone to see you like no one else has ever had? The story is older than the English language and somehow it still sounds true. <br /> <br /> As for the characters, at least, Disney can be a wonderful villain. Lady Tremaine is evil to the T, in a wonderfully calculating way, not overtly physical. Her sharp tongue and her eyes do the work for her, she does not need relief canes to strike the fear in her heart. Animal friends tend to grate, especially that idiot Gus. I would have been glad if I had found his destiny in the maw of Lucifer. Cinderella herself was not easy to do, making some fairly malicious remarks sometimes. However, she just lacked the drive to make her fully understanding. Sure, she was nice and fed on animals, but what kept her in that place? We never know Even if she only became a maid in another house, at least she is being paid and has an opportunity to respect. It seems that the only reason why things work in the end for Cindy is that everything falls into her lap. He never works for his dreams that he sings with such affection. <br /> <br /> What brings me to music, which is beautiful, as always. Ilene Woods has a lovely and rich voice, probably my favorite of any Disney heroine. Some great standards originated here: A dream is a wish your heart makes, so this is love, Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo ... <br /> <br /> Cinderella is a wonderful and sincere story with lots of musical themes featured While it lacks character development, it provides some classic villains and excellent voice work. If you feel bad of heart, make it explode and it will make you buzz Mmm Mmm Good! <br /> <br /> Movie quote: <br /> <br /> - Surprise! Surprise! -Duh duh duh- Happy birthday!
