Being that I'm not a fan of Snoop Dogg, as an actor, that made me even more eager to see this movie. I remember he was interviewed in "Jay Leno" and said he rejected a role in Adam Sandler's big budget comedy "The Longest Yard" to participate in this movie. So, obviously, Snoop was on a serious mission to show that he has the skills to act. I'm not going to overestimate Snoop for his performance in "The Tenants." Certainly there are better rappers / actors, like Mos Def, who could have done more with their role. But the point is that Snoop did a "good" job. It seems he can not get rid of some of his body movements and vocal inflections, but that's something even Jack Nicholson has trouble doing. The point is that I found him convincing on paper, and the tension between him and the character of Dylan McDermott captivated. McDermott, by the way, offers the best performance in the film, although his subtle performance will probably be overshadowed by Snoop's not-so-subtle performance. Being a great reader and aspiring writer, I could not help but find the characters and the plot a bit fascinating. I was aggravated by the way in which the character of Snoop constantly asked McDermott to read his work and scolded him for criticizing him. But you know what? I'm sure many writers are like that. His character was supposed to have flaws, like McDermott's, in his own way. My only slight criticism of the movie would be its ending. For some reason, I felt too hurried for me, although the resolution certainly made sense and was motivated by the characters, rather than the plot.
