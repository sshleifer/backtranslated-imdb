I think Dark Angel is great! The first season was excellent, and had a good plot. With Max (Jessica Alba) as an escaped X-5, the creation of manticore, trying to adapt to a normal life, but still "saving the world". And being hunted by manticore throughout the season, which gives the series an extra touch. <br /> <br /> The second season, although suddenly it became a bit strange compared to the first. The plot disappeared a bit, and the series lost a bit of its charm, mainly due to all the strange "creatures" that appear. Do not get me wrong, the second season is good, but with a bit of much of the "manticores". However, they managed to return to a new promising plot in the final episodes of season 2, in which he had high hopes of seeing more. <br /> <br /> So I really wish you could start making new ones. episodes And with James Cameron behind this, he can not go wrong. So, as a conclusion, I would say it's a great series, but I'm still waiting for a third season!
