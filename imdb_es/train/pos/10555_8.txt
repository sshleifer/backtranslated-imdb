['The premise of this movie has been tickling my imagination for quite some time. We have all heard or read about this in some kind of text. What would you do if you were alone in the world? What would you do if the whole world suddenly disappeared before your eyes? In fact, the last part is actually what happens to Dave and Andrew, two roommates who live in a dilapidated house in the middle of a highway system. Andrew is a nervous mess to say the least and Dave is considered one of the biggest losers in society. That&#39;s just why it&#39;s the main reason why these two guys get along so well, because they simply have someone to turn to when they need comfort. Only until... <br /><br /> Since the beginning of the film, many problems happen to them. Both are involved with the crime, Andrew suffers from paranoia and simply does not dare to leave the house. Dave is not successful in his work and his colleagues do not treat him very well and with the respect he deserves. The amount of problems they face continues to increase until the day they face the inevitable and face it. This is too much for them and they want everything to disappear ... And, of course, that is exactly what happens. <br /><br /> The rest of the story places Dave and Andrew in this world out of nothing. At the beginning, they are surprised and have problems to understand and deal with the characteristics of this crazy environment, but later they discover that they can do everything they want because they seem to be the only ones left. <br /><br /> Nothing presents an incredibly small cast; In fact, in addition to the first shots of the movie, we only see Dave (David Hewlett) and Andrew (Andrew Miller) throughout the film. It is clear that to achieve this, the cast has to be more than prepared for the task, because in a world where there is nothing, there is nothing that can distract the viewer in any way. Vincenzo has decided to use a reasonable number of close-ups to make it more interesting and, in fact, it works quite well. The director of photography, Derek Rogers, also has a good way of annoying the audience by hiding visual information, especially in the moments when a character sees something and reacts to it, but we do not see it immediately. <br /><br /> Obviously, this can not be a movie driven by an event and it is not. Much of the action occurs outside your home when you move in a vacuum. And that&#39;s where some of the funniest scenes take place, especially in the case of when Andrew discovers a chocolate bar. <br /><br /> Now, one might be thinking: &quot;How do you see anything?&quot; Well, there seems to be nothing. The whole world of nothing is white ... white, no matter which way you look. This is the weakness of this movie ... After an hour or less it&#39;s getting extremely boring to watch and there have to be events to make sure it&#39;s more interesting to watch. Thank God, there are some. For example, at times when the two boys, due to the properties of nothing, can jump very high as if nothing were made of ... tofu (as Andrew says). It&#39;s fun to see how they can instantly use nothing to become gods of their own little society. <br /><br /> One of the best parts of the film is the set ... Production designer Jasna Stefanovic has done a beautiful job in this movie, the house in which these two boys live is very fun to watch, it still seems to be the right thing to do these two. be living in a place like this. In short, the production design is undoubtedly one of the most powerful aspects of this film, since it really makes it worth seeing. <br /><br /> However, the best part of the movie is acting. Both David Hewlett and Andrew Miller really look like the professional actors they both are. The camera is in them for every second of the movie and, as stated above, there is almost no fixture in the movie, they are actually on a bare stage. With a lot of character development and some decent phrases, intelligent dialogues (sometimes hilariously stupid), everything works for that purpose, and this really moves the film away from the low budget area to well-crafted manual work. <br /><br /> Let&#39;s talk a little about the visual effects, because it&#39;s definitely worth mentioning them. Nothing presents visual effects and digital prosthesis that equals any modern horror movie. There&#39;s a pretty awful dream sequence in the movie, and although The Drews have milked that scene completely, it&#39;s still fun to watch it. One of the best visual effects of the film is the end, where Andrew and Dave suddenly discover their powers in this environment: they have the ability to want everything, and if they can do it backwards and make things appear? <br /><br /> &quot;Nothing&quot; is a bright and well-lit movie, it really helps to promote the idea that they are probably dead (this is actually one of their theories), but &quot;Nothing&quot; is a comedy and slowly destroys their own theory. We do not know where they are or what has happened to them. We do not know if they will ever leave, because the movie ends before we see something like that. The end, by the way, is not as good as it could have been. It is fairly easy to predict what will happen, yet writers have thought of some incidents that help make it a little more interesting and, in the end, it is quite satisfying. <br /><br /> Take &quot;Hollow Man&quot;, &quot;Kill Bill&quot;, &quot;Cube&quot;, &quot;Epoch&quot; and many other movies and you&#39;ll have &quot;Nothing&quot;. It really is an amalgam of different styles, there is not yet another movie (at least that I know of) Nothing is really like that. People who remember the original Cube Production Commentary on their DVD can remember that Vincenzo Natali talked about how he came up with Cube&#39;s story. He talks about him and Andr√© Bijelic having been roommates at the same time and both were in this extremely boring room with no hope of leaving. &quot;Nothing&quot; could be the projected version of the origin of the history of the Cube, and for that purpose, it is almost like one of the prequels of the Cube. <br /><br /> What can I say? I enjoyed &quot;Nothing&quot;, it&#39;s a great movie and the different parts of the film are extremely well done with a lot of smart ideas, I still feel that the film is missing something and I have trouble discovering exactly what it is ... Maybe if We have a &quot;Nothing 2&quot; I can answer that question. &quot;Nothing&quot; is a great movie, but not as good as I expected. <br /><br /> Final score: 7.5 / 10']
