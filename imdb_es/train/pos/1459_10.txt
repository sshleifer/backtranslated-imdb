['Woohoo! Woohoo! Woohoo! I have never seen a non-preaching documentary about globalization until I saw MARDI GRAS: MADE IN CHINA. This film has a null story and combines real images with delicate interviews with four teenage workers in China who live inside a factory compound. They play with toys, jump ropes and dance. However, most of his days and nights consist of work, work and work, but the images of his work are illuminating and fascinating to watch. The owner of the factory in China is incredibly open, so much that it hits the effects of globalization while &quot;punishing&quot; the workers. After following the accounts of Mardi Gras from China to Carnival, the film reveals how the place is connected to the global through humor and interesting and attractive images of both cultures. One of the most interesting parts of this film is the intercultural introduction of factory workers and revelers of Mardi Gras to each other through images. Here, the film completes the circle and shows how images can be a point of communication and transformation. The film is never predicative, it is not guilty and it allows everyone&#39;s point of view to be present. In the end, we, the spectators, form our own conclusions about the complexity of the film and globalization.']
