I must say that this miniseries was the best interpretation of the beloved novel "Jane Eyre". Both Dalton and Clarke are very credible as Rochester and Jane. I have seen other versions, but none compares with this one. The best for me I could never imagine anyone else playing these characters anymore. The last time I saw him was in 1984, when he was only 13 years old. At the time, he was a bookworm and had just read Charlotte Bronte's novel. I was completely delighted with this miniseries and I remember that I did not miss any of the episodes. I would like to see him again because he is very good. :-)
