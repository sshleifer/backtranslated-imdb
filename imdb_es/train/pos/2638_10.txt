One of the best movies for all ages. You will never be able to look at LION KING again without thinking about the additional story that this movie adds. Almost 40 years, I saw this with my wife and my two children after work tonight and I have not laughed and enjoyed a movie so much in a long time. <br /> <br /> Take some time and look at this with the children. It will remind you of how Disney used to be when you were little.
