We have to remember that the 50s were practically a blank slate when it came to movies. Hollywood was in transition from patriotic war movies, noir, two hazels, etc. to movies with a message. We had Blackboard Jungle, on the boardwalk and so on. Some people may think it was an improvement. I do not. Who was the tycoon who said: If you want to send a message, call Western Union? He was right. These psychological thrillers are less entertaining than some kind of remote therapy. <br /> <br /> This is a pip. It is about three sisters trying to wrest control of their dead father's inheritance. One of them, perhaps the only one worth redeeming, is the help of the company's pilot to help her keep the rest of the family at bay. He is initially in this for the dollars, but he finally falls in love with her. Meanwhile, the rest of the family schemes to sabotage the romance. The results are predictable. You have a bit of everything in this movie. Sexual tension between the sisters. A little subtle masochism. Hereditary madness - if there is such a thing. We never got to know the parents, but they really must have been fucked up. The cast is practically unknown. One or two of the actors sound vaguely familiar. The acting is so bad that it is hard to believe. It was released under the umbrella of United Artists by a company called Bel-Air Productions. It was filmed in and around Los Angeles, mainly at night and probably without permits. The ending was so strange that I thought it was a joke. It was as if they had run out of money and the producer decided to wrap him in the middle of a scene. <br /> <br /> I can not explain it, not even to myself, but I gave this pile of garbage an 8/10. I'm familiar with the term "It's so bad that it's good", but I think I've never encountered the phenomenon before. Well, maybe "Hot Rods to Hell", but this one certainly fits. You may want to try this if you like movies that seem to have been made in someone's basement.
