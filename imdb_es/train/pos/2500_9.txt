... would probably be the best word to describe this movie (in my opinion). In addition to a great fan service for fanatical girls (well, that was redundant ~), it was the story that struck me. Hurray for Takahisa Zeze and Gackt! and I know that some people will not agree with me in this case, but it was none of the three great actors (the guys who played Sho, are and Kei) who gave the best performance (for me, anyway). It was Taro Yamamoto, child # 5 of the Battle Royale! <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I like Hyde, I love his voice, but the problem was that some of his scenes came out a bit 'out', but I loved that scene where he danced The body of the dead guy killing the other guys. and Gackt was not that bad either, I preferred that his character was a little distant from the start. There's not much I can say about my story in Lee-Hom Wang, I do not pretend to know him, but he carried his own weight with the cast full of stars. <br /> <br /> this movie paved the way for one of the best collaborations I've heard, Orenji No Taiyou (forgive my spelling if it's wrong). While the entire song lasts about nine minutes, you would not notice the duration because you would be enjoying listening to Gackt and Hyde together. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this movie is a must-see not only for fans (big fan base ~), but also for those who enjoy science fiction, futuristic movies and Asian style.
