['I see Cold Case because of the real life experiences represented. This one was very close to me and it touched me deeply, very well handled, thank you, Merideth. All the characters are well developed in 3D, especially Coop. The material is still difficult to address, the United States is far behind the developed nations of the world. only this kind of real and honest experiential treatment and retreat has an impact on the population. Of course, not everyone sees things the same way, but I am encouraged that 3/4 of the men surveyed in the crowd of less than 30 voted the same as me 10. are reaching the most difficult; I always reserve the &quot;best episode&quot; for this episode, please continue to take risks and accept my sincere gratitude.']
