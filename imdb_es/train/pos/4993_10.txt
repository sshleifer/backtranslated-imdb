Unfortunately, this film has not been available for a long time (as other posters have pointed out), but this is one of the essential dramas of the Great Depression, a lyrical and moving love drama located in a shantytown. It features performances by Spencer Tracy and Loretta Young that are almost the best of their careers, and is an outstanding example of how the director, Frank Borzage, was able to create an almost fairy tale aura around elements of poverty, crime and Horror social inequality, which shows that the talents of the truly romantic and spiritual were. This film shows how love survives in the midst of misery and desperate need, and is totally affirmative of life. This is a true masterpiece of the period, and it is a film that deserves to be better known.
