In the sea of ​​shit that Hollywood (and others) continue to broadcast, this is one of those rough diamonds. A small and simple movie that is very entertaining and leaves you with the feeling that you not only lost an hour and a half of your life. <br /> <br /> Ashley Judd is really amazing in this movie. I had never really been a fan or had noticed her before, but coming back and seeing this early performance of her convinced me that she is extremely talented. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie was a chore in a college course for me, so I was skeptical, I would even care. I thought: "Oh, boy, a stupid and chic movie or a feminist shit that hits indie ..." I was pleasantly surprised. Without analyzing the many relevant issues, I'll just say, if you have not seen it, do yourself a favor and take a look. Sometimes, the simplest and easiest to use movies are the best, and this one is excellent.
