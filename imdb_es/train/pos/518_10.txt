Also known as "Stairway to Heaven" in the United States. During the Second World War, the British plane Peter Carter (David Niven) is shot down in combat but he survives. Meet and fall in love with the lovely June (Kim Hunter). But it seems that a mistake was made in heaven: I should have died! A French spirit comes to look for him but he refuses. Soon he will present his case before a Celestial Court so that he may be allowed to live. <br /> <br /> It sounds ridiculous, but it's really an amazing movie. The script is good, the actors play the roles with a completely frank face and are beautifully directed: the scenes on Earth are in impressive Technicolor (I've never seen such beautiful blue skies) and the scenes in Heaven are black and white! Niven is a little stiff at times, but Hunter is just great (and very beautiful) and Roger Livesey is excellent as a doctor trying to help Niven. The images are amazing (especially the staircase and during the final test sequence) and the special effects are really great (considering the age of the film). There is also a very strange sequence when Niven meets a totally naked child who shepherds sheep! This is an absolutely beautiful film, which invites reflection, highly recommended. This is still unknown in the United States, which is a shame.
