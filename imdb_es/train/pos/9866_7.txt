['I just watched ICE AGE, a very funny and especially beautiful movie. The story is simple but effective, the characters are friendly and very well developed, but what really shines is the digital design of the stage. <br /><br /> More inspired by traditional animated films than in reality, designs give you a really beautiful world in a surprising use of color. Sometimes, the touches of reality shine (especially the water was impressive), but nonetheless, it is a fantasy world based on reality. Including loads of vast landscapes, especially helps minimize representation costs. <br /><br /> Pixar films shine with technical brilliance, this shines with effective uses of technical knowledge. <br /><br /> Sufficient technical babbling, the film is entertaining, family-friendly and, at times, hilariously funny.']
