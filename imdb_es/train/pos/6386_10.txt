Disney, the name of the film that once represented all innocent things and suitable for all ages, finally began to realize that to survive it must be more diverse. This diversity has been very evident in recent years. Films like "Tarzan" and "The Emperor's New Groove" have tried to move away from the traditional routine driven by the songs of Disney's past and into new and unexplored territory. "Atlantis" is the most daring step so far, but we must remember: this is STILL Disney. The first serious film that comes out of the Disney animation studio is a great achievement for them, in fact, it is so serious that it reaches PG territory. Maybe why many families were scared to see him last summer. <br /> <br /> But despite the more mature theme, this is still a movie that Disney wanted to draw in families, not just mature audiences, so the plot had to be simple enough for children to understood, but interesting enough to get her away from the realms of "The Little Mermaid" et al. <br /> <br /> Then, what we get is actually a potentially detailed plot, which unfortunately suffered the blow of being condensed into a 96-minute movie. Ultimately, this is an action movie about Atlantis, not about the exposure that precedes it, so we spent the first half hour with as many sequences bombarding the screen as possible without losing coherence. Suspend your disbelief of how the characters move from point A to point B so quickly that it's unlikely you'll find an animated movie detailing how it leaves Hollywood. If you want epic levels of detail in the plot, go to the "Titanic" by James Cameron. Both films show a boat in some way. <br /> <br /> And let's talk about love, okay? Yes, as with many movies, the male protagonist (a Milo Thatch, a clumsy archaeologist) and the protagonist (Kida, the cliché princess atlantiana) will fall in love with each other. But what I found was not as clichéd as I expected. At the end of the film, for once, the characters' touch / feel / kiss sequence was much dimmer. There are several points in the movie where the attraction grows, but it is not on the playing field of, for example, "The Little Mermaid" (something good). <br /> <br /> You may have understood that this is a movie cliché. Right. You have your main hero and heroine, backed by more than half a dozen crew members involved in the expedition, and all have had their moments during the film. Many other characters appear, occupy the few minutes of screentime and then disappear. Does not it take a genius to do the math? A 96-minute film focused on action and images, and with a considerable cast, has very little time to expand the characters to a large extent. So, what is it based on? Clichés, and many of them. Each character emulates something that has been done a thousand times before. You have the clumsy scientist, the attractive princess, the square-jawed colonel, the rich eccentric, the maniac sleazebag, the Russian femme fatale? Do I need to continue? <br /> <br /> I do not know why this affected someone? I found the ironic nature of this movie quite funny. Okay, this is meant to be a serious movie, but do you really expect Disney to give up every feature of its story? At least the writers have tried to establish an ingenious dialogue in a consistent manner, and sometimes it's even a bit inspired. <br /> <br /> But in the end are those impressive visual effects that put the icing on the cake. The CGI animation is really amazing in some places, and does not dwarf the characters, which was a flaw that left the recent "Titan A.E." down. Speaking of characters, Disney hired an outside artist from the comic industry to create the designs, bringing an anime style to the movie. In fact, the visual presentation of the film in its entirety is largely due to the anime, much more than any previous Disney presentation. This led to a conflict with Japanese anime fans, "Nadia", for the general similarities of the film with these cartoon series. Having not seen this anime, I can not comment. <br /> <br /> With the image, there is sound. Gary Rydstrom leads the sound team, and what a soundtrack! From the opening plane, the sound stage is alive and is a delight. James Newton Howard treats us with dynamic musical music, which complements the film in every way, never sounds out of place and always helps to increase tension or to attenuate it. <br /> <br /> Maybe I missed the point of what the creators want. For me, the film conveys that it is an exciting adventure, although with a more serious tone than any other Disney movie before. If you do not like the cliché with the ironic attitude, then maybe the effort that has been poured into the visual is a delight. Hell, at least the mythology is much more correct than what can be said about Disney's other efforts (* cough * Hercules * cough *). <br /> <br /> This is a positive, 10 out of 10 reviews, from someone who was impressed by this movie. I always suspend my disbelief with any animated movie? after all, the laws of the real world are more than broken in the middle of cartoons. So sit down, enjoy the trip, and maybe everyone can find something to enjoy this movie.
