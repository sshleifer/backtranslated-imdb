I must admit that at the beginning I did not expect anything good, at all. I was just expecting a cheesy movie that would promote the image of Gackt and Hyde, but I'm happy to say that it has a lot more to offer. <br /> <br /> Yes, the performance is not so good, but it does not stink. Or, the whole cast is well disciplined and they bring enough strength to their characters. The effects lack coherence, but the action scenes are satisfactory enough. <br /> <br /> What really hooked me was the essence of the story, although it combines fantastic elements, it also shows a harsh reality. The development of the characters, their doubts and their feelings really affected me and I think that is the key to this film. It makes you think and it makes good to transmit all the anguish. <br /> <br /> It meets all expectations for a good drama. I would definitely recommend it to everyone.
