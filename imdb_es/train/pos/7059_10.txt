I was surprised and surprised by the negative reviews I saw on the web. I thought Cinderella 2 (and 3) is a very cute and fun sequel for everyone, children and adults ... like me, I'm 22 years old. <br /> <br /> I also find it and a very informative movie, shows lessons on how to be honest with yourself and follow your heart. I thought I had a great animation, and the casting of voices was very good; the songs played by Brooke Allison as well. Since this movie has been divided into three flashbacks / stories, my favorite of three, is the story of when Jaq the mouse, became human for a day, thanks to Fairy Godmother and his magic.
