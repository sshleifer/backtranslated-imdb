We all create our own reality, do not we? That is the central question behind this highly original and masterfully elaborated examination of the illusory nature of reality. Combining oriental and Buddhist philosophies with the visual deception of M.C. Escher, this fascinating treaty manages to address the rather cerebral question of "Who are we and what is our place in the universe?", And it turns it into 100 captivating and fun-filled minutes. The film focuses on Bart, a writer who struggles with his script, "The sea that thinks." When you sit down at your computer, the work begins to unfold as nothing more than a description of your computer session, writing the script. In a short time he is caught in an enigma in which everything he writes becomes reality. Director Gert de Graaff approaches his subject with a sense of humor and dazzles the viewer with a series of surprising visual tricks that confront the nature and validity of our perception. Ultimately, De Graaff's film challenges the audience at several levels to question whether everything we see, touch or taste is really what it seems to be, or whether our complete understanding of the universe and our place in it is simply a trick. played by us. our senses Note: AFTER you have seen the movie, check out the movie's entertaining website.
