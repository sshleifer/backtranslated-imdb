Being that I am a true product of the generation of electronic dance music and hip-hop, this is undoubtedly one of my favorite movies of all time. Beat Street, while not as "authentic" in some ways as Wild Style, is a movie that guarantees a heart-wrenching experience for anyone who takes pride in the urban / DJ-based music culture and electro culture. club. br /> <br /> Although I will admit that sometimes the dialogue is something corny, you can not help feeling for the characters and, ultimately, "you wish you were there" for the beginnings of hip-hop culture in New York. City in the early eighties. The b-boy battle scene at the Roxy nightclub (a real-time, real-time competition between the legendary Rock Steady Crew and the NYC Breakers) is as essential to the records of a hip-hop fan as any album classic. Watch some of the movements of the breakers in slow motion, if possible, to truly appreciate the athletic and stylistic experience of an experienced B-boy / B-girl. All the praises due to the Zulu Nation !!!
