This movie is wonderful. <br /> <br /> I was "delighted", I must say, and surprised by the uniqueness with which it was made. The cast, the sequencing, the effects ... everything! Magnificent! I mean, it was a love story, yes, but what stood out from the rest was that it was told in an entertaining and healthy way. <br /> <br /> For me, it is the representation of the modern fairytale. . It's like the modern bread peter ... just amazing <br /> <br /> I would surely buy a copy of it the moment it hits the market. <br /> <br /> This movie is really a double MUST SEE one ... !!!! 10 stars for that!
