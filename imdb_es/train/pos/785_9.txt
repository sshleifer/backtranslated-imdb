Being of Irish origin, I loved this movie. Not only was he attractive and fun, he was also sincere and honest. I loved the girl he fell in love with too, she was pretty. They were such a beautiful couple. The ending was so sad. I love this movie! Although it is a bit dirty, remember a British or Irish version of Prime. If you liked this movie you should see prime. In the same story, a young boy falls in love with older women, older women fall in love with a young boy. Many paths cross, in the end, the best decision is made or the task is completed. I have nothing more to say, without ruining the whole movie, although I thought that the French was ugly, less attractive to me. Umm ... if you like Irish movies, I would recommend "Circle of Friends", that movie is very good. Quick quote, you may not get it unless you see it "well, that's my dinner ruined". LOL
