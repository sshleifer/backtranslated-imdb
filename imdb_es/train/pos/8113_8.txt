This masterpiece of science fiction has too many flaws after the editors killed her after its inauguration in 1936. Visually it's a wonder, but the script allows too many intellectual speeches about war and progress. dice to recite a lot of high-minded messages at all times. Raymond Massey and Cedric Hardwicke, both great actors, come out as a couple of fans. Ralph Richardson is very good as "The Boss", a megalomaniac warlord. The prediction of World War II was very strange considering that the world was on the verge of the most devastating conflict in the history of mankind at that time. I am happy that the war has not turned out as it did in the movie. There are some visually stunning montage sequences that exceed the time jumps between different episodes of the movie. Although it is not as entertaining as I expected, this film remains in your mind long after you have seen it.
