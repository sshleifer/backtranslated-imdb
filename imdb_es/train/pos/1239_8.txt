I think the movie was pretty good, I'll add it to my "classic collection" after all this time. I think I saw other posters that reminded the most demanding people that it's still just a movie. Perhaps some of the more esoteric points challenge the "logic", but many religious matters accepted "in the faith" do not pass the smell test. If you are going to accept any faith to which you subscribe, you can certainly accept a movie. Is it just me or someone else has noticed that Aja-Yee Dagger is the same possessed knife that Lamonte Cranston had so much trouble controlling in "The Shadow"? I do not mention it in the trivia section of any of the films here (IMDB), but I would bet a dollar on a dona, it's the same proposal.
