['Since this movie was based on the true story of a woman who had two children and was not very well off, it was just scary how real it was! Acting is what gave the movie that boost to greatness. <br /><br /> Diane Keaton played the main character, Patsy McCartle, who had two children she adored. His performance is what made the story of real life come alive on a television screen. It was very difficult to see some of the scenes, since they were so real in terms of what happens when you become addicted to drugs. <br /><br /> Just seeing this loving mother go from being sweet to not caring at all was difficult, but very true. I have met people who have retired and it was very similar to what happened in this movie, as far as I remember. <br /><br /> I also thought it was very risky for the director to want to make a film about what happened to this woman. However, it was done so well. I applaud the director for making this movie. <br /><br /> I recommend it to anyone who has met someone who has been addicted to drugs or simply knows what can happen to them if they become addicted to them.']
