In this film the year 2022 is very similar to the seventies. This is fun at first, but soon the viewer perceives how different this decadent futuristic world is in spite of appearances, how many things we take for granted might not be available. <br /> <br /> The characters often interact in a peculiar way, without tact or manners or respect. I think this is intentional, it's not a bad performance. After all, those who witnessed social changes in the 60s and 70s can assume that by 2022 the inhabitants of an overpopulated city behave that way. <br /> <br /> I did not like most of the action scenes, apart from the death of the priest: too cheap even for the seventies. The plot is not too polished. But the big scenes and ideas, like the death of Sol, the way in which the rioters and corpses are treated, the "furniture", overcome the defects of this film. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
