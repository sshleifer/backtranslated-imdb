This movie is exciting, daring and the music is very good. The film Moonwalker was destined to coincide with the album Bad (1987). I have Bad. It's excellent (*****). The film begins with Michael Jackson's performance "Man In The Mirror" on stage. Then, it shows a story of Michael, from his early years in Jackson 5 to the Bad era. Oh, and Badder is also good (Badder is a parody of the music video of the Bad the single video). Then it shows the video of Speed ​​Demon. The song and the video are very, very good. In fact, leave me alone. that appears later. Then he shows the movie Moonwalker. After a few minutes, play a soft criminal in a club called club 30. Just like when you make lean. Anyway, it's a pleasure to see you. Goodbye.
