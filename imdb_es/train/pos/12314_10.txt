Every once in a while, a movie appears that raises the level of all the other films of its genre. A film of this caliber will influence many films after its release in the coming years. `A history of Chinese ghosts' falls into this category. It could be said that it is one of the best horror films made during the 1980s; possibly one of the best that has been made. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers have created a film that attracts all horror fans. The story is fascinating and original. Villains are appropriately threatening and terrifying. The sets are spooky and atmospheric. There is even a bit of blood and blood to satisfy the fan of the house. But do not let the `horror 'label scare you, if you're not a fan of the genre. This movie easily fits into many different categories. <br /> <br /> The screenwriter has skilfully combined the genres of drama, comedy, horror, kung fu and romance into a delicious luxury film pizza. "A Chinese Ghost Story" is a beautiful story of epic love told, thankfully, without the gratuitous nudity and / or explicit sex scenes that have ruined many Hollywood "love stories". Those disillusioned by the romantic elements of history can sit back and enjoy the game of fast-paced swords and the "wire-fu". If that is not enough, the actors Leslie Cheung and Wu Ma provide enough humorous situations to satisfy their appetite for comedy. This movie offers something for all the fans of the movie. <br /> <br /> Director Siu-Tung Ching and producer Tsui Hark formed a really incredible cast for this film. Leslie Cheung proves that he is not only a talented actor, but also a talented singer and a charming physical comedian. I can not think of an artist other than Cheung who could have interpreted Ling Choi Sin better (except maybe Chow Yun Fat). Joey Wang is charming as Lit Su Seen, the enslaved spirit that steals the heart of Cheung's character. His interpretation of the title character is truly disturbing and memorable. Wu Ma is hilarious as the singer of the Taoists who helps young lovers. <br /> <br /> On a technical level, this movie is very impressive, even by today's standards. The address is excellent. I'd like today's Hollywood executives to look for talented artists like Siu-Tung Ching before they turn to the usual MTV video or the commercial "directors" of Pepsi. The cinematography is beautiful. You should congratulate any cinematographer who can make a movie look good when most of its key scenes take place in the middle of the night. The special effects makeup is top notch. In fact, most of the effects of the creatures in this movie destroy the evil CGI ghouls and goblins that have become commonplace in modern horror movies. <br /> <br /> Since its release, "A Chinese Ghost Story" has generated two worthy sequels, a long-running animated film and innumerable imitations. However, none of the films that followed or copied it were able to capture the magic of this classic. This movie is necessary for all horror fans to see or anyone looking for an excellent way to spend 95 minutes of their time. 10 out of 10. <br /> <br />
