I read a small ad in a horror magazine in the early nineties about Liebe des Totes (the love of the dead) or something similar. This, of course, aroused my curiosity, so I ordered Nekromantik 1 & 2 and Der Todesking (The King of Death). The Nekromantik films are fine, they are even interesting and unique in their approach to the topic Necrophilia (even if they are obviously opera horror tickets instead of invoking fear in the minds of the viewers, they are actually quite funny). <Br /> <br /> On the other hand, TODESKING is, in my opinion, one of the best films ever made. It consists of a series of scenes that represent the many facets of death. Death as an enemy; Death as a tranquilizer, death as the very physical decomposition of the body. The movie is a metaphor about life. It shows how fragile life is and how short our lives are. Reduce your viewers to children who are (us) in reality. The central fact of the film is that we can not really understand the nature of death and, therefore, neither the process of dying. This is a more realistic movie. Buttgereit never tries to hide the death behind the white roses or whatever. No matter what moral standards you establish, death is inevitable and, sooner or later, it will not be a fiction but YOUR reality. This applies to YOU, dear reader, as it applies to moviegoers. Some youth reviewers do not seem to understand this, which is totally justified, since, of course, they will live forever ... <br /> <br /> This is not an exploitation film. Why? Because death does not exploit us humans. It harvests us. We grow for seven days, then we return to the schopenhauerian state of pre-birth, which is death. Buttgereit gives us his version of the oldest stories. If you decide to consider it "optimistic" or "pessimistic" it's up to you. At first glance it may seem very dark. However, he considers that for something to live, something else must die. "Who wants to live forever?" <br /> <br /> I think that when Buttgereit shows a body that is being consumed by worms, it not only shows the decomposition, but the GENERATION of a new life. Is not it better to die and give life to worms and then to birds and, finally, to become land, to remain the dead zombie alive that is one of the favorite pets of the genre? <br /> <br /> When you realize this, you see Der Todesking in its correct context. <br /> <br /> Sieben Tage hat die Woche, siebenmal letzte Stunden. Seven are the days of the week (weak, deadly!), Seven times the last hour. <br /> <br /> Do not fear the mower, Buttgereit tells us, because the mower only takes what is ripe. And the apples that are not plucked to eat will rot! <br /> <br /> Have a good life, IMDB partners! <br /> <br /> (And look at this film, which compares only with Ingemar Bergmans "The Seventh Seal" in terms of depth and universality.
