Here is one more beauty in the chain of beautiful films directed by Eytan Fox. The film presents the story of lovers of the crossed stars (an Israeli, a Palestinian) in modern Tel Aviv. The effectiveness of the film comes not only from its description of interethnic conflicts, but also from personal and political conflicts within ethnic groups. For example, there is a revealing moment in which one of the secondary characters, openly homosexual, is visited in the hospital by her boyfriend, who brings flowers and tries to kiss him in front of his visiting family, and suddenly we see a wave of uncomfortable discomfort. Wash through the room. Clearly, the boy is not as open as he seems, and the family does not accept as much as he could want, while the boyfriend is confused and rejected. A lot of complexity is packed in a fleeting moment. As we know from Yossi & Jagger, Fox is a master at efficiently grouping emotional and psychological complexity into short sequences. The film is also effective because of the impartial manner in which the mutual brutalities that the Israelis and the Palestinians inflict on each other are presented. If you're not cruel, you'll cry during the last third of the movie. Although the plot is melodramatic, it is so intelligently written and acted that it reminds us how satisfying the good melodrama can be.
