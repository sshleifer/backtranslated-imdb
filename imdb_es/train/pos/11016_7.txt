Good action show, but nothing new. This took place high up in the mountains, which showed some nice landscapes and so on. A man faces a group of mercenaries, lead flies, and he kicks his butt. It could have been called "Rambo Goes to the Rockies", it was that pat. He had a very effective scene in the first part of the movie, which made me tremble in horror. It is not a bad image, but it is the same ol ', the same ol'.
