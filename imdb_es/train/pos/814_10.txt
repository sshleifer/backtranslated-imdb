Thanks to Kevin Smith, a group of geeks are running and they say the Return of the Jedi is not good because it's actually fun to watch. And oh no! The muppets are involved! That makes it bad! Everyone liked The Return of the Jedi until someone in a Kevin Smith movie made a negative comment about it. Now, suddenly, people look at you as if you have some kind of illness if you mention how much you like it. This movie is much better than anything else that Kevin Smith has considered creating, and I'm surprised the man even thinks about denouncing it. This movie is very funny! It's as amazing as I remember when I was six years old! Enjoy this movie for what it is and stop stealing the opinions of Kevin Smith! His is not right! <br /> <br /> And that Ewok song eventually reigned! I bet people do not even enjoy "Ewoks: Battle for Endor" !!!! I'm going to set everyone on fire!
