['I love this program. I see all the repetitions every day, although I have seen them all as 6 times each. <br /><br /> It&#39;s about two sisters, Holly (Amanda Bynes) and Val (Jennie Garth), who live in New York. Holly goes to live with Val when her dad is transferred to Japan. Val has the perfect life, has a boyfriend and a perfect Upper East Side apartment. <br /><br /> The show basically shows all the problems that Vall and Holly go through. The main problem is men, but it is also about being responsible and other life options. <br /><br /> Holly is 16 years old and is a totally free spirit, while Val is the opposite. She is the organized one has to have a plan to do any kind of person. <br /><br /> The other characters are Henry, Vince, Gary, Lauren and Tina.']
