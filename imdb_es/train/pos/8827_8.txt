['With a minimum budget, an execution time of eight minutes and a large amount of imagination, Nacho Vigalondo has achieved one of the most moving shorts I&#39;ve seen. The subtlety of the script is really remarkable, since it does not reveal the ending until the last moment. <br /><br /> Do not let anyone tell you what the short film is about, since you can enjoy much more. Nacho Vigalondo is the discovery of the year for his individual show: directing, writing and acting in this formidable short film is the most remarkable effort I&#39;ve seen in years. She also pays attention to the performance of Marta Belenguer, her reaction shots are incredible. <br /><br /> Overall rating: 8/10']
