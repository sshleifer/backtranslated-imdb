It is primarily a movie for girls, it is a romantic comedy. There is a fair balance between the two. This particular movie has the addition of some pretty sweet fighting scenes, I do not think any cable was used or, if they were, they were not so brazen. It is not a terribly complicated film, so it is easy for the brain, it is not necessary to analyze anything to obtain a deeper, simpler meaning, good chemistry between the prospects and a fun watch. I would like them to highlight the full potential of the girls, only once because it can be incredibly cute, but throughout the film they keep it discreet and beautiful. I would see him again ... with a girl.
