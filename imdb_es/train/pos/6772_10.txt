Unlike another user who said that this movie was bad (and that Olivia Hussey was terrible), I do not agree. <br /> <br /> This movie was amazing! Olivia Hussey is amazing in everything she does! Yes, it can be bigger now, because many people remember it from Romeo and Juliet, but it's wonderful! <br /> <br /> This storyline can be used quite often, but it is a unique movie and I will counterattack anyone who does not agree. I enjoyed this movie as much as I have any other Olivia Hussey movie. Olivia is "my girl" and I love her job. <br /> <br /> I saw it for the first time on Saturday (4/14/07) and I fell in love with it. Not only because it's an Olivia movie, but because of its unique history and wonderful direction.
