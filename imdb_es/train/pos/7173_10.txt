I just watched the documentary "Fog City Mavericks" on the cable TV network Starz. It is without a doubt, one of my most pleasant viewing experiences! It is a chronicle of the artists of the San Francisco Bay area and the creative talent responsible for some of the best films ever made. In addition to the well-known artists on the list, it also includes segments with Irvin Kershner, Caleb Deschanel and a segment on Pixar Animation Studios. I hope it is published on DVD; This is a must for any collection about the history of cinema and the brilliant realization of films. If you are even remotely interested in the movies and the people who create them, you will not be disappointed.
