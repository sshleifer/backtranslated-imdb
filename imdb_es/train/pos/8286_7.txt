Larry Fessenden has been hit by most of the comments in this forum. Well, the worst mistake, of course, is the commercialization of the film and the way in which the DVD could have been the target. Obviously, this is not a true horror movie, at least, not for people who expect something that is bloody and instantly satisfying. <br /> <br /> "Wendigo" is basically a movie that seems to be told from the young Miles's mind. Things that children do not easily understand tend to stay in their young minds and, ultimately, dominate their fears and the threatening world they can not understand. It is obvious that Kim, the mother, is a psychologist, but she has no idea what is going on in her son's mind. This is also a story of alienation. It is clear that the father, George, is a distant figure, perhaps a workaholic, who seems to be living in a different world. <br /> <br /> The fears of Miles reach a crisis point during the weekend in the country. . That part of the state of New York, with its winter landscape, barren trees, play havoc with the child's imagination. It does not help that you meet a strange figure in the city, it creates even more doubts in your young mind. Ultimately, the world of Miles crashes against him and he can not do anything, not even evokes the Wendigo spirit. <br /> <br /> The movie is well on its way and acted. Patricia Clarkson is excellent, no matter what movie she is in. Jake Weber is perfect as the distant father who has the opportunity to approach a child he does not understand. Erik Per Sullivan, like Miles, conveys the inner turmoil inside him. I thought it was extremely effective since the whole movie is Miles' own version of what happens around him. Finally, John Spredakos is perfect as the menacing Otis, a man who resents the world by the way he has become. <br /> <br /> Instead of leaving this movie, future viewers should approach it with an open mind.
