El Carmen by Carlos Saura is one of the best achievements in the world, not to mention Spanish cinema. He manages to awaken interest in flamenco in his wonderful adaptations of Bizet with powerful physical strength. At the same time, we see the impact of the creation and rehearsal of Carmen's new interpretation of the choreographer / director and the principal dancers. The fine line between life and art is dazzling.
