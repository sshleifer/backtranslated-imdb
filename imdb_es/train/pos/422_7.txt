"The Plainsman" represents the leadership skill of Cecil B. DeMille in its most inaccurate and unsuccessful way. It establishes parallel plots for a no less stellar retinue like Wild Bill Hickok (Gary Cooper), Buffalo Bill Cody (James Ellison), Calamity Jane (Jean Arthur), George Armstrong Custer and Abraham Lincoln to interact, although in fact Lincoln was already dead in the moment in which the story unfolds. From time to time, DeMille floats dangerously close to the truth, but with the same ease he deviates from her towards the spectacle and the spectacle without qualms. The film is an attempt to reinforce the latest version of Custer with a lot of fiction that is based solely on the lives of people, who were already products of manufactured products and legends. Truly, this is the world according to DeMille: a zeitgeist in the annals of entertainment, but a pretty camper relic by today's standards. <br /> <br /> TRANSFER: Considering the time of the movie, this is a moderately attractive transfer. , with often clean targets and extremely solid blacks. There is a considerable amount of film grain in some scenes and its absence in other moments. In general, the quality of the image is, therefore, somewhat inconsistent, but is it never so bad or so good? Only a little better than half the road. Artifacts related to age are kept to a minimum and digital anomalies do not distract. The audio is cute but it is well balanced. <br /> <br /> EXTRAS: Forget it. It's universal! LOWER LINE: As a pseudohistory painted on celluloid, this western is convincing and fun. Just take your characters and your story with a grain of salt? in some cases ?? A whole box seems more appropriate!
