Made in 1931, this foreign film must be seen and enjoyed more often. <br /> <br /> We open in a small quiet French village, exploring the roofs of sleeping citizens. Then we hear something that sounds like a party. When investigating the uproar, two men are told the story of two men, supposedly friends, who chose two numbers for the lottery. <br /> <br /> Our photo star has your number and your friend of yours. When you ask your friend, would you share half the mass? If your ticket was the winning number, your friend quickly answers no. In fact, H.E. Double hockey sticks no! It's the way he acts on it. <br /> <br /> Then, when our man discovers that he has the winning ticket and that he has been lost, for reasons beyond his own, he is desperate. Everyone is out on their own, looking for this ticket, in something like a precursor to "The Great Race." Even though all this is a flashback, I was in a knot all the time and I got angry for every little thing in this cash film at the show bank for me at all. Look at Le Million today!
