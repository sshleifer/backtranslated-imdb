Midnight Cowboy made a big splash when it was released in 1969, earning an X rating. By today's standards, it would be difficult to get a rating from R. Jon Voight, who has been better, is proficient in his role as Joe Buck, a fanatic who lives outside the city and wants to succeed with the ladies in the city of New York. He meets a crooked street con man named Ratso Rizzo, who tries to befriend Buck for his own purposes. The two finally forge a bond that is both poignant and pathetic. Like Ratso, Dustin Hoffman simply shines. Hoffman has often been brilliant, but never more than in this portrait. He is so personal that everything else around him pales in comparison. Losing the Academy Award to John Wayne is one of the most ridiculous decisions the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has taken. The director Schlessinger has a skillful hand in his production, but this film has a dirty bottom that leaves a bad taste in the mouth of the viewer. It's worth watching for Hoffman's performance alone.
