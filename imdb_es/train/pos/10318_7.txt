He has said that The Movies and Baseball thrived during The Great Depression. It seems that the grim realities of a nation trapped after this economic disaster created the need for occasional relief for the population. You could find a temporary escape in the ongoing soap opera that is Baseball. <br /> <br /> In the same way, an occasional 2 or 3 hour excursion to the dark cinema auditoriums. The presence of a radio in the house of almost all kept Depression Era America in tune with the events of the world and provided many drama shows and (especially) comedies for a pleasant interlude of harsh reality. <br /> <br /> Literature of the time also flourished at all levels. Youth reading habits helped create the comic as we know it, with all the fantastic characters and super exciting adventures. But the comic book simply did not appear magically, all fully developed with all the colorful 4-color pages, all by itself. There were mediums that were ancestral to them. Obviously, the Comic Strip newspaper was one of the parents, and provided the visual / narrative method of storytelling. <br /> <br /> The other direct ancestor was Pulp Magazine. Publications of prose stories, low cost, which contained a lot of stories of the same characters of adventures, even in series, although not necessarily in series. The pulp medium had existed for a few decades and introduced us to Edgar Rice Borrough's TARZAN and Johnston McCulley's FOX. The 1930s brought a great harvest as main characters such as THE SHADOW, THE AVENGER, BATTLE ACES of the G8 and THE SPIDER, MASTER of MEN, all came to the press kiosks, among many others. <br /> <br /> Another was DOC SAVAGE, a super hero of written history; The covers of the pulps had perhaps the only "image" of the hero. Possessing extraordinary strength, super sharp senses and an intellect of genius protean genius, Doc was the prototype of superhero. <br /> <br /> He also gathered 5 of his old army friends in a small team of free lancing adventurers. Each of them was an expert in a certain field. So we had the best classifieds: chemist, lawyer, construction engineer, electrical engineer, geologist-archaeologist-paleontologist, etc. <br /> <br /> The Doc Savage stories were very popular in the 1930s and '40s, and they were published in the middle of the 50's. Then they entered a break of a good 12-15 years. Then came the brainstorming to repackage the old novels into a new "container," the paperback. A new image of the cover was presented, with a series of very stylized paintings of a very muscular Doc, with a shirt always torn. <br /> <br /> The reintroduction proved to be very successful, with the publication of one title per month (and for a longer time). Soon, there was a rumor of a Doc Savage movie! But when, by what producer? Well, the venerable "Bronze Man" reappeared in newspaper kiosks for more than 10 years before a real project was launched. He was the veteran Stop-action Animator and producer of the best special effects films, Geoprge Pal, who made the film with Warner Brothers. <br /> <br /> When DOC SAVAGE, MAN OF BRONZE came to Movie Houses, he boasted a well-cast team of actors, albeit largely a "No Name" in terms of familiarity with the audience. With the former Tarzan of television, the almost perfect casting of Ron Ely at the head, the promising Beauty of a Starlette, Pamela Hensley in the female character and veteran Paul Wexler (as the villain, Captain Seas); No other name would have been recognized. And, maybe that was a plus point in this case. <br /> <br /> The story does a good job of getting the majority of the audience to become familiar with the incredible group and at the same time achieve a plot. The use of narration, by Paul Frees, and short film clips are the method pursued to bring the introduction to the main body of the story. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, there are indications that this story will go with the same kind of humor "Camp" manufactured that the television series Batman. The narration of Paul Frees and the unexpected and improbable results throw to the humor some of the really great initial scenes in which Doc and all the equipment that makes their individual specialties participate. (For example, a Doc experiment with a miniature rocket / missile turns out to be part of a method of catching fish, a small one.) The whole story unfolds like this, hitting the viewer with a small "Camp" every so often , as if to keep reminding us not to take it too seriously. We are also surprised that Mr. George Pal is the Producer (the last). The one who had been so well known for special effects, surely a factor that could be used in a science fiction scene from the pulp character world. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing it very vividly. Mrs. Ryan (Deanna) was in the hospital, right after giving birth to our second child, Michelle (8/14/75). Our oldest girl, Jennifer, was visiting her grandmother, so after the visiting hours at Maternity Ward, she went directly to the old Marquette Theater, 63rd and Kedzie, here in Chicago. <br /> <br /> Having seen Being a guy with a good familiarity with Doc, the final product disappointed me. I could accept a bit of this 'Camp' business, but I would not have objected if Mr.Pal had considered it appropriate to let it all go well and have some clean dinosaurs and volcanoes to give it a little more Pulp / Comic / Emotion serial type. <br /> <br /> And yet, the cast, led by Mr. Ely and the others, made the whole movie enjoyable, if not worthy of being loved. The sets and locations were, as far as we can see, very similar to those of a series or adventure film from the 30s that would be nice for anyone. <br /> <br /> And maybe that's what they were trying to do. With this DOC WILD, MAN OF BRONZE.
