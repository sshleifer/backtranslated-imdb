This is one of those Saturday afternoon movies that feel good. It is at the height of other retro films like Flight of the Navigator. Just a nice movie with a subtle comedy to lighten things up. And it's fun to see how 20 years have changed stars like Kelly Preston and Lea Thompson. Not to mention Joquin Phoenix. <br /> <br /> Personally, I like movies like this once in a while. Nothing too deep or too scary. Only a good story. And I never would have known that Mr. Phoenix had not read the credits recently. I was really just a baby when he made this movie. <br /> <br /> Kelly Preston was also a budding young actress. She and Lea did a wonderful job in this movie. I agree that it is not an Oscar-sized film. But it's worth a look. Especially if you have children in the range of 8 to 11 years, let's say. Or those who are interested in the space program.
