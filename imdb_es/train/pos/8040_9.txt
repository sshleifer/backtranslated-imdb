This will be something short. First, do not listen to the critics, since it is not as bad as most say! Sniper uses a classic movie formula, which many dismiss immediately as failing the movie. While Sniper does not reflect 100% truth about how Military Snipers work in our country, it does give those who know nothing about the Sniper Professional a look at the world of snipers. And yes, the movie has many flaws, but what movie is not? There are many good scenes and good performance by Tom Berenger. I have to say that the 2 worst scenes are at the beginning of the movie with Billy Zane in the helicopter, followed by Zane in the Navy bar scene. The best scene in Sniper is with Berenger in the middle of a field with the opposite force sweeping it! There are also lots of good shots of the jungle and some classic shots using the camera as if you were looking through a viewfinder. And yes, the sniper motto is "a shot, a death". Judge Sniper for yourself !! <br /> <br />
