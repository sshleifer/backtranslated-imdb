18 directors had the same task: to tell love stories set in Paris. Naturally, some of them were better than others, but the whole mosaic is quite charming; Besides, would not it be boring if everyone had the same vision of love? This is how I classify the segments (which could change in a second visualization): <br /> <br /> 1. "Quartier Latin", by Gérard Depardieu <br /> <br /> One of the best French actors that has I directed my favorite segment, with the always impressive Gena Rowlands and Ben Gazzara. Ingenious and charming. <br /> <br /> 2. "Tour Eiffel", by Sylvain Chomet <br /> <br /> Linda, visually stunning (thanks to the director of "The Triplets of Belleville") story of a little boy whose parents are mimes; <br /> <br /> 3. "Tuileries", by Ethan and Joel Coen <br /> <br /> The Coen Brothers + Steve Buscemi = Hilarious <br /> <br /> 4. "Parc Monceau", of Alfonso Cuarón ("And Your Mama Also", "Children of the men"), feat. Nick Nolte and Ludivine Sagnier (fun); <br /> <br /> 5. "Place des Fêtes", by Oliver Schmitz, feat. Seydou Boro and Aissa Maiga (playing); <br /> <br /> 6. The "14th Arrondissement", the wonderful appearance of Alexander Payne ("Election", "About Schmidt") of the pathetic side of life is present here, feat. the underestimated character actress Margo Martindale (Hilary Swank's mother in "Million Dollar Baby") as a lone, middle-aged American on vacation; <br /> <br /> 7. "Faubourg Saint-Denis", the frenetic style of Tom Tykwer ("Run Lola Run") works in the story of a young actress (Natalie Portman) and a blind person (Melchior Beslon) fall in love; <br /> <br /> 8. "Père-Lachaise", by Wes Craven, feat. Emily Mortimer and Rufus Sewell (plus a curious cameo by Alexander Payne as ... Oscar Wilde!); <br /> <br /> 9. "Loin du 16ème", by Walter Salles and Daniela Thomas (simple but touching story of the talented Brazilian directors, Catalina Sandino Moreno); <br /> <br /> 10. "Quartier des Enfants Rouges", by Olivier Assayas ("Clean"), a sad story. the always fantastic Maggie Gyllenhaal; <br /> <br /> 11. "Le Marais", by Gus Van Sant, feat. Gaspard Ulliel, Elias McConnell and Marianne Faithful (simple, but fun); <br /> <br /> 12. "Quartier de la Madeleine", by Vincenzo Natali, feat. Elijah Wood and Olga Kurylenko; <br /> <br /> 13. "Quais de Seine", by Gurinder Chadha; <br /> <br /> 14. "Place des Victoires", by Nobuhiro Suwa, feat. Juliette Binoche and Willem Dafoe; <br /> <br /> 15. "Bastille", by Isabel Coixet (fabulous director of the underestimated "My Life Without Me"), feat. Miranda Richardson, Sergio Castellitto, Javier Cámara and Leonor Watling; <br /> <br /> 16. "Pigalle", by Richard LaGravenese, feat. Bob Hoskins and Fanny Ardant; <br /> <br /> 17. "Montmartre", by and with Bruno Podalydès; <br /> <br /> 18. "Porte de Choisy", by Christopher Doyle, with Barbet Schroeder (known mainly as the director of "Barfly", "Reversal of Fortune" and "Single White Female"). <br /> <br /> I was able to classify some segments as bright and others as average (or even a bit boring), but none of them is just bad. In general, I give "Paris, Je t'Aime" an 8.5 / 10 and I recommend it for what it is: a beautiful mosaic about love and other things in between.
