As a pagan, I must say that this movie has little or no magical meaning. It is a "fun" witchcraft movie and is not meant to teach us anything, except that love is the most powerful Magic of all, and never use it in a controversial or vengeful way. That is a lesson that everyone needs to learn, not just the pagans. <br /> <br /> That said, this movie is beautifully written and executed with sweetness by Kim Novak and the venerable Jimmy Stewart. <br /> <br /> Hermione Gingold offers a stellar performance as Bianca, Elsa Lanchester (with too many film credits to mention, except as Mrs. Jane Marbles from "Murder by Death") was wonderful as Queenie, the neighbor above -capacity of Ms. Novak. Also starring Jack Lemmon (wonderful performance) and Jim Kovacs (brilliantly witty). <br /> <br /> "Witches can not cry, they can not shed a single tear because their hearts are full of Magick, I do not have time for silly things like love." Queenie <br /> <br /> Gillian Holroyd (Novak) and her brother Nicky (Jack Lemmon) are witches from Manhattan. Concealed deep within the secret underworld of The Craft, they live among other New Yorkers as one of them, without causing a raised eyebrow. <br /> <br /> But then comes Shepherd "Shep" Henderson (Stewart), a firm, meaningless and dedicated businessman who is committed to marry the old rival of Gillian University. <br /> <br /> By a strange coincidence, he finds himself moving into Gillian's building and is instantly "bewitched" by his charm and grace. With the use of Magick, with a little help from Pyewacket (Gillian's relative, trained by Robert E. Blair) and Queenie, Gillian starts working on this new and handsome man of dreams to return to his old enemy. <br /> <br /> But Magick should never be used to control, or hurt, and Gillian learns in the bittersweet way in the bittersweet way. Not only does he have to face what he has done, but he has to face Shep in his guilt. <br /> <br /> From a critical perspective; however, the film takes a serious turn: the effects are very old to the point of being a pure camp. Apparently, some of the landscapes were shot in the basement of someone's little house, but at least the characters were extravagant and funny. <br /> <br /> On a personal note, Pyewacket steals the show. Great cat Great training by Robert E. Blair. <br /> <br /> As a note of curiosity, this is the root of the beloved television comedy Bewitched. This introduces the original Samantha and Darrin. All the characters in the note are present and accounted for. You just have to look, see for yourself. <br /> <br /> This is one of my favorites, and I see it often. <br /> <br /> This movie gets a 9.1 / 10 from. .. <br /> <br /> the Devil :.
