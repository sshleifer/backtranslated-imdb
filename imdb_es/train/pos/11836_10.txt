This animated movie is a masterpiece! The narration, the music, the animation and the plot were remarkable. My girlfriend and I saw it a second time and we got more information about it. We invited a couple of friends to see Spirit with us and they enjoyed it a lot. When I asked them to come see it, they thought it was a movie about horses, but then they realized that it was more than that. I liked Esperanza, Spirit, Rain and Lil 'Creek, which reminds me of Nathan Chasing Horse, who smiles a lot in dances with wolves. Spirit has deep symbolic meanings and metaphors that seemed powerful and inspiring to me. <br /> <br /> I saw Spirit for the third time and I want to see him again. I enjoyed the "Spirit" tremendously because its representation of the American Indians is realistic, dignified and not stereotyped, unlike the movie "El Camino al Dorado", which was a total farce because it portrayed the American Indians in a disrespectful and stereotyped way . But Dreamworks has redeemed himself by making Spirit a great movie that I find acceptable! I hope they continue doing more animated films like Spirit, and I would like to see sequels or derivations of Spirit if they are done with respect and without stereotypes of the American Indians. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it to others who have an open Mind to go and pay to see Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron.
