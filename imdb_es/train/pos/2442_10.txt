This film is about one side of Ireland that Americans do not normally see, the religiously-minded and prejudiced side of the "world's friendliest race." The film, by the admission of the inhabitants of Fethard who are old enough to remember the events, is quite accurate (although they insist that the filmmakers invented some of the most violent scenes just to animate the action). <Br /> <br /> The film was very unpopular in Ireland, because it portrayed the Catholic church from a negative point of view, but the fact is that the representatives of the Catholic Church * did * organize minorities vetoes (before of the Protestants, they were the Jews). <br /> <br /> The movie is a fascinating insight into the whole subject of religion in Ireland
