Three girls (a media team consisting exclusively of women, including cult actress Barbara Bach, no less) who visit a small town to cover a festival, have just rented rooms in a house that they should have avoided like the plague. A little shocking well done, suffering a bit from some scenes of redundant dialogues and a rather thin plot (which does not hide its secrets very well). A particular underlying theme is quite disturbing (as in: vintage shock material), and this is basically what the movie thrives on. The performances and the cinematography are well above average (compared to many other movies of the late 70's and early 80's in the same sense), but what really makes me recommend this movie is the rather long climax scene in the basement. From the moment the character of "Keller Junior" was introduced, his performance left me speechless and it did not close until the end of the film. A very pleasant surprise to see that the actor Sydney Lassick (who was ridiculously crazy in "Someone flew over the cuckoo's nest", and now completely demented in "The Hidden") assumes one of the leading roles.
