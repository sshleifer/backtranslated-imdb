The movie is fine, it has its moments, the musical scenes are the best of all! The soundtrack is a true classic. It's a perfect album, it starts with Let's Go Crazy (appropriate for the beginning, since it's a great party song and very lively), Take Me With U (a funny pop song ...), The Beautiful Ones (a cheerful Ballad , probably the closest thing to R & B in this whole album), Computer Blue (a somewhat angry anthem towards Appolonia), Darling Nikki (one of the funniest songs in history, mocks Appolonia), When Doves Cry (the climax for this masterpiece), I Would Die 4 U, Baby I'm A Star and, of course, Purple Rain (a true classic, a very appropriate ending for this classic album) The film and the album are very good. I recommend them highly!
