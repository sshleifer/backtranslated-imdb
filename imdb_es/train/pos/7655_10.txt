After not having seen this movie in approximately 20 years, I am still impressed with its impact and stellar performance. Of course, such a Mr. Mickey Rooney is, in fact, INCREDIBLE in his role as leader "Killer" (referring to another review here, nothing less than Orson Welles evoked the name of Mickey Rooney as the best movie actor, too ). I also remember the jazz score and the black and white photography. I love Mick's last line before he comes out for his dose of lead poisoning. (I think the stranglers raised it in one of their songs: Get a Grip on Yourself). This is a great movie and a film unfairly buried. Let's get it out! Side note: a recent magazine Film Review published a great article on "Babyface Nelson" by Don Segal, made a couple of years before "Last Mile" and also starring Mickey Rooney. Another streak of Mick's intense and engaging performance. Perhaps it is the beginning of a great appreciation of some really superior cinematographic performances.
