I really liked this movie. I have read some of the other comments, and although I pity those who did not understand, I agree with some of the criticisms. Which, in a strange way, makes me even more like this movie. I accept that they have a nice cast to remake a smart movie for the general public, however, it has many levels and it is still great to watch. I also love movies, like this one, that provoke so many debates, theories, possible endings and hidden subtexts. Congratulations, Mr. Crowe, definitely in my Top Ten. <br /> <br /> P.S. I saw this when I went out for the first time when I was traveling with a backpack in Mexico, it was late at night and I had to return to my hotel and had a great paranoia trip. Where does the dream end and the real begin?
