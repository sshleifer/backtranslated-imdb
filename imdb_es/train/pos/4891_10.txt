['A great concept, a great cast and pity that there was no more time to develop the story. I loved it and wanted more. Dench, Dukakis and Laine, now there are some REAL women! Even so, Dench and his character only had enough substance to carry the script in some of their minor moments. I have it on the tape and I will continue watching it, hoping that there is a clue at the end that suggests there will be a sequel. <br /><br /> Top drawer! - No doubt! - No argument! <br /><br />']
