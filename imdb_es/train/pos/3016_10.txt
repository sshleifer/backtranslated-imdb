For those who like the mysteries of their murders, this is definitely the must-see, as it is full of interesting and suspicious characters, most of them from the socialite class of Long Island.

Mary Astor is very beautiful here. <br /> <br /> Powell had made a career by playing the lead character, Philo Vance, in a series of films made in a couple of studios over several years. In the midst of these films, he became a romantic protagonist something out of the ordinary, sometimes even rehearsing the roles of mafia knights. Already middle-aged, I was stuck in a kind of routine in the race when this one arrived. As with many of the first talkative stars, it seemed that their time had come and gone, that it was fine for the first films of the Prohibition of Depression era, but that with the change of times maybe it was too much.

In Kennel we can see the films still in a ritualized pattern, something rigid, since the camera does not move much, with the performance, like the presentation, tending toward the theatrical. There is no harm in this approach, however, that has its charms. It gives the film a baroque quality.
