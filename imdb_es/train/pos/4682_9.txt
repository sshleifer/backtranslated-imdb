This movie was in my Tivo for weeks before I saw it. I feared a self-satisfied yuppie movie about relationships that had gone wrong. I was wrong; This was a fascinating excursion to the libidos of New Yorkers. <br /> <br /> The format is the same as Max Ophuls's "La Ronde", based on a work by Arthur Schnitzler, who receives an "inspired" credit. It starts from a person, a prostitute, standing on a corner in Brooklyn. It is picked up by a contractor, who has sex with her on the hood of a car, but can not come. He refuses to pay him. When he is peeing, she answers her cell phone and receives a message. She flees with her keys. <br /> <br /> Then the story changes to the contractor, who makes a professional call to a rich and bored New York woman, who plays with him until he gets turned on, then walks away. . She tells him how desperate and unhappy he is; He tells her how beautiful she is, and fortunate. When he leaves, she asks if he would have sex with her. She sits on top of him, bounces up and down. This time he comes, he leaves. <br /> <br /> The woman and her husband organize a dinner for their fashionable friends. My husband (Robert) is talking business, his wife (Ellen) is bored, and she changes the subject to sex, and how often do men and women think about it. The husband changes the conversation to the desert. Later, after the guests leave, Ellen tries to lure Robert into sex. Robert does not want any of that, and he puts on a jazz record. Ellen turns on the radio; Robert up the music; Ellen turns on the television; Robert turns on another television. The cacophony occurs. Ellen climbs to the roof, Robert joins her. Ellen confesses that she needs to experience more men, other men besides Robert. Robert says that he also needs to experience men. <br /> <br /> Next, we follow Robert when he visits an artist, Martin, played by Steve Buscemi. I would like Buscemi to have more roles like this, where he is a sexy, intelligent and totally desirable guy. Robert praises Martin's work, much more than he deserves, promises to turn it into a show. Martin is excited, until it turns out that Robert is talking outside his groin, it's all a mating dance. Robert tries to kiss Martin, on the lips, and Martin retires, saying he is not gay. Robert says he is not gay either, Martin laughs. Both admit that works of art are bad. Robert is about to leave, when Martin lets Robert kiss him. They kiss, and Robert drops Martin. <br /> <br /> Then we follow Martin, as he prepares for an art exhibition in a Manhattan gallery. He is beaten by the receptionist, Anna, played by Rosario Dawson. (I had to cut part of this revision to keep it in less than 1000 words) ... and make love. <br /> <br /> Next we follow Anna, who is sitting at a food stand. Her boyfriend, Nick (Adrian Grenier), enters with flowers. She is cold towards him; He tries to find out why. He cheats on her that she has had sex with someone while he was in San Francisco. She convinces him that he has stayed with his ex-girlfriend while he was in San Francisco and had sex with her. The latest revelation turns out to be a lie. The two kiss in the luncheonette, but she decides that they should separate. Nick has a broken heart. <br /> <br /> And we follow Nick, who confesses his problems to an older woman on a park bench, Joey (Carol Kane). Joey is a bit strange and childish, but he's a good audience for Nick, who needs a sympathetic ear. The two go to Coney Island at night and look at the stars. Nick falls under the spell of Joey, despite the age difference between them. They return to Joey's apartment and Nick gradually realizes that he is about to have sex with a crazy old woman. She is on top of him, she does not want to let him go. But he manages to escape. <br /> <br /> (This is, by the way, the best role of Carol Kane since she played Latke's wife in Taxi). Joey's phone rings and he's a man who calls the Psychic Friends Network. , and Joey is one of the psychic friends. Although he is still suffering for Nick, he gradually gets into his psychic ability. The man is in his office, late at night, and wants to have sex on the phone with her. Although that is not Joey's business, Joey goes ahead and tricks the man to come. She wants to continue talking, although the man wants to interrupt the phone, and discovers that he has misused a lot of money from his company and that they will discover it tomorrow. His life is ruined. Joey realizes that the man is going to commit suicide, and she tries to make him believe that she is her friend, that she cares for him. And she cares for him. <br /> <br /> But the man packs a gun in his briefcase and goes to find a prostitute on the Brooklyn coast, and we go back to the beginning, to the same prostitute who started La Ronde. She wants to give him $ 75,000 in cash if he kills him. He tried to kill himself, but he could not do it. The prostitute does not want to do it, but he insists, holding his hand, holding the gun inside his mouth, telling him where to aim. Finally, the gun goes off and we see the prostitute walking down the street and reaching the corner where she normally does business. The contractor who did not pay him before in the movie goes up the window. They look at each other. THE END.
