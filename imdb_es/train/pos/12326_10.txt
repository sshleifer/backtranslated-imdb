I saw this movie for the first time at the Berlin Film Festival, and I had never seen the cinema in Hong Kong before. I felt that I was sitting on a roller coaster: the action was so fast, and there was not a dull moment throughout the film. It has martial arts, love, special effects and a fantastic plot. My favorite scene is when the Taoist drinks, sings and fights for himself, one of the many scenes that accentuate the extraordinary musical component of the film. This movie is a definite must!
