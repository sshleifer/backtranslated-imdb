Afterwards, I watched the movies ... I thought: "Why the hell was this movie a huge success at the Korean box office?" Even though the film had an intelligent / unusual setting, the performance was not as good and the characters were not very interesting. For a Korean movie ... I liked the fight scenes. If you want to watch a movie without thinking, this is the movie for you. But I must admit that ... the film was something childish ... 6/10
