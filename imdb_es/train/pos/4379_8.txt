It is not Braveheart (fortunately), but it is a good entertainment with attractive characters and good acting. I enjoyed this movie when it was released and seeing it again last week, I discovered that it has stayed well with time. It is not a classic movie, but a very good and visible movie to enjoy as a great entertainment.
