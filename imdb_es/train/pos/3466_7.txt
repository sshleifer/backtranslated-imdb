This was a real guilt pleasure ... I saw the trailer and all the publicity, so I thought "why do not you check out this movie vh1?" and, as they used to say on television, "I can not believe I've seen everything." Quinn and Harris were credible Beatle guys, and, although the accents were a bit exaggerated and difficult to decipher at times, I also found the dialogue credible. the film touched the tenuous relationship of len / mc and showed how, in the end, they were simply two guys who grew up together and shared a passion for music, albeit with different sets of problems and personal needs. you find yourself wishing you had jumped in the cab to snuggle up in an impromptu meeting that would have ripped off the world's socks, but you also get a greater appreciation of why they did not.
