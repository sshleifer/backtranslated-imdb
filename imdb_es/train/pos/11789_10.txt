Hello, this little movie is interesting especially for an artist, filmmaker or music creator or visual artist, because: <br /> <br /> One can feel and examine David's touch / style directly from a small part of a family. simplicity <br /> <br /> You can see the rhythmic spacing of the shots, the trays and the sound elements. <br /> <br /> Even as a simple movie, this creation is multi-layered. For example, there are some sounds that make up unmanned aircraft, while others appear (although they are subtle), at certain points to admit certain shots. <br /> <br /> You can also see several types of trays: some raise and lower smoothly backwards. There is diagonal bread. Zoos also come and go sometimes. <br /> <br /> Lightning and the composition / arrangement of the elements in space is, as usual and obviously, the work of a painter / artist. This can be felt even in this fucking room. That is to say: one can make an exquisite art by the simple art of placing the look / view and composing the scene. Then come the forcelines of the visual: as digonal, parallel, etc. The gradients of the light and the colors, although without too much research for the textures as in the big productions, are also good. This is an outline of an artist ... <br /> <br /> All this is not calculated, but it is done with an internal feeling and this feeling gives the touch / feeling of David, as with any real artist .
