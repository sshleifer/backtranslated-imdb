My name is Domino Harvery. {EDIT * dizzy * CHOP} My - my - my name is Domino Harvey. {CUT, CHOP} My name is Domino Harvey. {EDIT. CUT. Reproduction} <br /> <br /> I had never before seen a director interpret so much for his style. At this point, it is clear that most people do not appreciate the spicy, gaudy and dizzying editing technique of Tony Scott. If I have to choose between loving him and hating him, I would say that I love it. Sometimes it distracted the limit, but the end result was quite good and it's nice to see a director with a creative edge in his style and some originality (even if he takes a lot of the MTV videos). <br /> <br /> This stylistic advantage manifests itself when Keira Knightley plays the role of arrogant bounty hunter Domino Harvey and even his dialogue seems oddly choppy. Otherwise, he misinterprets it because I hated his character and did not like a bit of her, no matter how much he suffered. We follow Domino throughout his life as he joins fellow bounty hunters Mickey Rourke, Rizwan Abbasi and Edgar Ram√≠rez. The team became entangled in the FBI and suddenly has a reality show contract under the television production company of Christopher Walken (what is Christopher Walken doing in each movie, by the way?). I suppose it's an intelligent cinematographic technique, because now Tony Scott is free to use as many striking MTV / Reality Show images as he wants. At this point, it becomes a pastiche of the MTV culture. <br /> <br /> It follows then that the story is told at an incredibly fast pace, with strong and violent language with weapons. There are some funny jokes; Everything is very modern and surreal at the same time. It's a disaster, but it's a pretty nice disaster. Ultimately, it is flawed in many ways (the actors try too hard to make their characters "great", for example), but it works. I give a weak 7/10 that may seem generous when compared to the general consensus of the viewers who rated this movie. but I feel like I had some good ideas and I executed them well. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10
