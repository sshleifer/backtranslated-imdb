One of the first musicals, Anchors Aweigh presents several memorable musical sequences, such as Kelly dancing with Jerry the mouse, Kelly dancing with 7-year-old Sharon McManus, Sinatra singing with José Iturbi playing the piano, Kathryn Grayson singing with Iturbi Conducting, and much more . The Technicolor is perfect, with some innovative camera work, such as playing a piano from below, through transparent keys, and singing Grayson, seen through the search engine of another camera. The plot is thin, but you get involved with the enthusiasm of Kelly and Sinatra. The sailors are on leave, they have to take home a fugitive boy (Dean Stockwell) and Sinatra falls in love with his aunt. To organize it with the aunt (Grayson), Kelly suggests that Sinatra can get her an audition with José Iturbi. But Sinatra is young and naive in this, and in his own words he falls in love too quickly. While trying to get in touch with Iturbi, who is never available, he begins to fall in love with another girl (Barbara Britton); But Kelly is now falling in love with Grayson. Anchors Aweigh is best remembered for the combination of live action / cartoon sequence with Tom and Jerry, but there is much more here that is worth seeing. I give it nine stars because, while it is not as good as the best musicals, Singin 'In The Rain, The Music Man, Oklahoma, is one of the first of its class of large productions in Technicolor (maybe Meet Me In San Luis was the first, and better than most others.
