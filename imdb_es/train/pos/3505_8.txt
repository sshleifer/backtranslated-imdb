I have no idea how IMDb classifies the reviews, but I do know that, as often happens on Amazon.com, there is a surprising amount of very negative reviews for this film that repeat the same conversation points, somewhat obscure, almost textual. A bell? Only IMDb knows. <br /> <br /> Regarding this movie: it's fine. It's a fun, cute and very simple movie. <br /> <br /> It has been more than a decade since I worked in Brooklyn, lived in Queens and visited relatives in the South Bronx. But I found nothing inauthentic or exploitative in these children. Is the grandmother a strange character? Yep. Does the dialogue and the plot recognize this? Yes, fortunately, they do it. Are other films set in the LES and with Dominican / Puerto Rican children possible? You can bet. Does that make this movie a crime? As some of the comments (to my eyes, astroturf) would suggest? Barely. Let a thousand plastic flowers bloom. <br /> <br /> This is better than any episode of Degrassi JR. High or high Degrassi. He makes fun of the comparison, but we have never had that and I am moved by the humility of purpose and the tender spirit of this film. <br /> <br /> That said, I'd love to know the background story behind all this! :-RE
