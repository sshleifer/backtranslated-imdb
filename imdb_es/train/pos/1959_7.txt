Let me be in front, I like the pulp. However, it is like one of these "easier dives" that are seen in the Olympic Games. It must be reduced a little because it is easier to give a cheap emotion than to drag yourself into the world of, say, a late medieval painter. <br /> <br /> This is just a two-hour ghost train trip and although often (or more accurately, most of the time!) ridiculous and improbable, it always advances and always entertains. If not always in the right way. Check out the memorable quotes section for a giggle. <br /> <br /> (However, why he has been given a "Worst Movie", Razzie is disconcerting, I bet there were thousands of worst movies in 2006, but this movie I received the treatment because it was seen as a fashion victim.) <br /> <br /> Popular founder and novelist Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone) is now in London writing a novel, but death and destruction follow her like flies. Follow a horse during a hot spot. My God, you can not even go to the bathroom without tripping over at least two corpses and I'm sure if you opened the closet in your spacious attic, one of them would collapse Hollywood style. <br /> <br /> Yes, clearly a very dangerous lady to be circling (if you want your pulse to be above zero), but is she personally responsible? I mean, why would someone put two and two together and start thinking she might be a murderer? Likewise, his reaction to such accusations seems very casual. However, is this just a personality disorder (some form of addiction to risk on the part of the b / s) or another proof of his guilt? <br /> <br /> For reasons I can not fully understand or explain, Stone is assigned to the psychiatrist Michael Glass (David Morrissey) to evaluate him instead of tearing down the cells after another "lover found dead in mysterious circumstances" . Fortunately (for Stone) he is much crazier than any of his patients and has his own family / work life with problems. In the blink of an eye, the relationship changes from doctor to patient and then it is difficult to say because everything becomes a kind of rotating blur. <br /> <br /> In this intoxicating mix comes Roy Washburn (a strange Welsh sounding David Thewlis, who tells the doctor that he fell in love with him, as a long-time policeman, that the lady in question can I mean, keep the front page in. However, Glass is now too glassy to notice or worry in. Like a dizzy boxer in front of a Mike Tyson at his best, he's ready for the big loss, however, not before discovering that Washburn might have one or two secrets. <br /> <br /> Now comes Millena Gardosh (Charlotte Rampling) a fellow psychiatrist and a rare example (in this movie) of someone who is not barking or what Contrary to a murder suspect, assuming that she has actually seen the finished film, she must look back with nostalgia when she took off her underwear with the ease of Stone's, and fortunately (at least for us) those days have already passed. She does not think Stone is as dangerous as everyone else, either, she does not think the script is good enough or her check is big enough to act properly. <br /> <br /> After several laps the track that is described more or less above is a climax that mixes the provincial representation with a slope / cliff turn, which while it is as ridiculous as the rest of the film , it gives us enough space for the Basic Instinct 3 - very unlikely that this can be at this point in time.
