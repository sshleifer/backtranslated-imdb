I swear I could watch this movie every weekend of my life and I would never get tired! Every aspect of human emotion is magically captured by the performance, script, direction and general feeling of this film. It's been a long time since I saw a movie that really made me choke on laughter, reflect on the sadness and feel every intentional feeling that comes out of this excellent work. We need more movies like this one! Mike Binder: are you listening ???
