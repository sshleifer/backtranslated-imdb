If you like Cleese and all the British "python" humor of the time, then this little gem is absolutely fun. <br /> <br /> Arthur Lowe is a real pleasure! <br /> <br /> I saw him with friends on TV when he first came out, and his classic dates have been part of our jokes for 30 years, and they will do it forever! I have it on a tape and I always appreciate it. <br /> <br /> Maybe some critics are taking it very seriously. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that it is now only available in the US. UU (NTSC, of ​​course), and not in the UK, where it should be an essential part of the history of British humor!
