<br /> <br /> Charlie Kauffman has made the strange metaphysical angst popular, but this Canadian gem makes it hilarious. <br /> <br /> Like most strange movies, the less said about the plot, the better, but let's set the scene, two friends, Anthony and Dave have been together since childhood, can not do in front of the world and, finally, this means that I do not have to do it anymore. But that's where even more problems begin. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie, it made me smile a lot after the final credits and that is a rare experience with so many pieces of "nothing" mass produced out there. <br /> <br /> Do not miss it. <br /> <br />
