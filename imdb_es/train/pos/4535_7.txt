The first 50 minutes of this movie were pretty boring. He focused on Doyle's personal problems, including his sick wife, death threats from fans, an aggressive editor, and feelings of guilt about his father with mental illness. Although these issues had a major impact on Doyle's life, he was more curious about the birth of Sherlock Holmes. The last 40 minutes were excellent. Finally, we could see inside Doyle head, how he created Holmes and why he had to "kill" Holmes. The actors are excellent. Including the intriguing Selden played by Tim McInnerny, Arthur Conan Doyle, a convincing role played by Douglas Henshall and Brian Cox as the "role model" for Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Bell. The locations are good, especially for a television movie and the camera work is good. If the first 50 minutes had been so good, the last 40 minutes would have been a small masterpiece.
