Comparable to Fight Club, The Matrix, A.I., Sixth Sense, among others. This film approaches the psyche in a way never before done. The first 30 minutes build an interesting love story between DÃ­az-Cruise-Cruz. The rest of the movie is, well, confusing, you'll choose more every time you see it (I've been to the cinema to see it 3 times)
