I was a big fan of the series as a child and after that it has always remained in my mind as one of those memorable cartoons that made a difference in the early 80's compared to previous animated series (Heidi, Barbapapa, Il Etait unites Fois l 'Homme ..., most of which I love). It seems to me that similar Japanese cartoons of this type published later can not coincide with Mazinger Z, since they began to openly repeat the same pattern. <br /> <br /> That same thing, the novelty, may be one of the best. characteristics of Mazinger Z. Another good point is his inventiveness, with so many extravagant monsters, strange devices and strange characters; Actually, we were eager to see each new installment to discover what kind of new demon or evil machine was waiting for us!
