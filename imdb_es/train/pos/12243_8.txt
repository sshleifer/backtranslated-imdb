Kate Beckinsale is as good if not better than Gwyneth Paltrow as Emma in this movie, although I really liked Gwyneth Paltrow in the other version of Emma. Both are good in different ways. Kate Beckinsale as Emma seems more interesting, almost, however. And I also liked the woman who played Harriet Smith in this film ... she was more believably sweet and sentimental. However, there are certain things that I like more about Gwyneth Paltrow's version, such as the way the comic side is more evident.
