I have no interest in rap and ghetto culture, I am white and I like classic rock, however, that did not stop me from appreciating this fantastic comedy. It's practically a sequel to This Is Spinal Tap in the sense that it's the same movie, just about rap or rock. However, it is hilarious. There are many funny jokes, but not without some jokes that simply fall down. The characters are all very funny and believable. I saw it only because it made me laugh at 3 a.m., and any movie that can do that justifies at least one screening test. One of the reasons why these movies were so funny was that he makes fun of rap in another way. Today's rap worries about the wrong things and survives with studio noise and little talent. This movie comes from a time when rappers deserved more credit. In general, it is a funny movie with many jokes about racism, sex and musical culture, among the most obvious themes of humor. This is highly recommended for any fan of This is Spinal Tap. They are essentially the same movie, almost on different worlds, and yes, the same jokes work in both movies.
