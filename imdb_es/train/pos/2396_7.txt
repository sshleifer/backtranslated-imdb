['This is a very entertaining film that follows the trial process of a Macbeth production in New York. Although it has a lot to say about power, jealousy and ambition (the themes of Macbeth) in our modern world, the film works best when it is not taken too seriously. Recognizable actors such as John Glover, Gloria Reubens and David Lansbury do good jobs in the lead roles, but the highlight for me was the hilarious scene where the &quot;murder&quot; of Banquo (John Elsen) is rehearsed. It&#39;s probably a more entertaining movie for those who participate in the theater, but anyone who enjoys Shakespeare should enjoy this movie.']
