When I saw it for the first time, I was really impressed. The director created such a mysterious atmosphere, especially at the end. Throughout the story, viewers can expect Richard to really kill Thomas or he will do it first. But ... the main point was not the conflict, but ... FRIEND! Life. Is incredible. Every time I see it, I enjoy! Of course it is quite violent as in all action movies, but I think it is acceptable. Thank you very much Louis Liosa and Tom Berenger! Amazing movie! I advise everyone to see it. I am sure that people will not regret it and will really have a good time.
