Woohoo! I loved this movie and I love Judy Mars !! This girl is not just an awesome pretty face, she's fun and really talented! It made me laugh many times just for being very rough with Victor who was beating her desperately! We'll see it a lot in the next few years ... and probably also from director Peter Sollett and his co-star Victor Rasuk! <br /> <br /> Raising Victor Vargas is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time! Very refreshing! It's true, beautiful, funny, well filmed, he got it all: good story, good actors, good film direction. <br /> <br /> If you like simple urban movies, slow-paced, in real life, like maybe Jersey. Kevin Smith girl, you'll love Victor Vargas! Is better!
