I thought the movie "I Do They Do not" was fantastic. In the past, I've seen Rob Estes in "Suddenly Susan" & "Melrose Place" and also Josie Bissett in "Melrose Place" and I loved seeing them together again in "I Do They Do not". They have great chemistry together (I guess being married in real life helps!). In the film they are widowed with children and careers and fall in love and try to mix their already busy chaotic families without dropping the ball. Of course they stumble, but they keep it together, which is what working and forming a family is all about. Many people have been talking about this movie, all right! - And the movie left us wanting more. This would make a great series, attractive for many ages! - It would be so good to see a real, realistic life, a family program like this that portrays the reality of many of our lives today - instead of the so-called "Reality TV" that all the seasons are overwhelming us with these days. Someone tells the people of ABC Family that they have the start of a new series here!
