A fascinating film, based on a true story, about an Australian woman, Lindy Chamberlain (Meryl Streep) accused of killing her daughter. She insists that a dingo took her baby, but the story is very suspicious. Actually, the film is about the media circus that took place around the case, the way the Australians interpreted what was presented in the media and the lynching mob mentality that finally led to the conviction of the woman, based almost on no solid evidence. I love the films that question the media, and also the films that analyze how the justice system restrains people. I have always thought that juries should be shown to 12 angry men before they fulfill their duties. It is not, as has often been said, a liberal film, but a clinical look at how we, as human beings, interpret events based on both our prejudices and the desire for revenge. A scream in the dark is equally clinical. Schepisi is careful not to make the film at all melodramatic. Some may find the film boring or dry, but I found it attractive.
