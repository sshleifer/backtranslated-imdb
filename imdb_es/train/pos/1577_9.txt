SPOILERS WITHIN. <br /> <br /> It seems that von Trotta was much more comfortable with the balance between personal history and the history of events than in his previous film Versprechen, Das (1995). <Br /> <br /> The direction seemed carefully controlled, and I visually felt that it was very attractive, especially as it related to the visual narrative (the combination of the title sequence and the lighting of a new candle in the times modern commemorating the death of several characters in the past). <br /> <br /> To clarify two points that many people have confused: <br /> <br /> First of all, Lena did not sleep with Goebbels. Although this may have seemed implicit, it was not the intention. Von Trotta told me herself! (And by the way, she's a very nice lady!) <br /> <br /> Secondly, the calendar of events was actually historically accurate (the actual dates are shown in the foreground of the memorial) and the Prisoners were released as suddenly as in the movie. There is evidence to show that Goebbels was annoyed at having done this, and had planned to eventually recover those he had released. <br /> <br /> In general, what impressed me the most was that it was an original story. It was of 'excess movement'. It seems a pity that this film has taken so long (for several reasons) to reach our screens. <br /> <br /> More of the same, please, Margarethe!
