This is a better adaptation of the book than Paltrow's (although I liked that too). It's not so much that Beckinsale is better, both are very good, but the script is better. Davies is a master at Austen's adaptation for filming, and the production values ​​here are very good. It's not as bright as the Hollywood treatment, but it's close, and I thought the locations and the costumes actually worked better.
