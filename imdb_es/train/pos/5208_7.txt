If you want your vision of Chaplin is limited to a friendly tramp and you get your belly laughing at Pathos, look something else. However, if you like slapstick comedy, played by one of the best, look at this one. <br /> <br /> The image is of the vagabond who can not really catch the girl. See another couple kissing on a park bench, and have fun ruining their fun. <br /> <br /> This is one of Chaplin's "park comedies," filmed in Mack Sennett's park, with pickpockets, cops and couples. These shorts work, because the format allows Chaplin to shine as he weaves through the problems. <br /> <br /> I checked the box, since this could be considered a spoiler, although it is not if you have seen these movies. They all end up in the pond except Chaplin. He gets the girl, who in this case was played by Minta Durfee, a.k.a. Mrs. Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle.
