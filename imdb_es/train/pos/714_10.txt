Even if you're not a big fan of the Ramones, Rock 'N' Roll High School is * still * the best rock 'n' roll movie ever made. Why? Because under the countryside, treat with respect the contempt and hatred that teens often feel (and rightly so) for the boring, stupid, fascist world of adults. That final scene is one of the most glorious and uplifting final scenes of a movie I've seen. "My eyes have seen the glory of ..." Rock 'n' roll! <br /> <br />
