I waited for this film to come out for a while in Canada, and when it finally did, I was very excited to see it. I really enjoyed it. Of course, at the beginning, it's a very sad movie (and it was New Year's Day, which makes it even sadder), however, it stays with you. The next day I thought about it again, because although it revolves around something so emotionally exhausting, after a few days you realize that it is such a beautiful story. How a person can be seen as the link to so many people, but sometimes you can blind many things. And how the character of Diane Keaton saves the rest of them simply by being there. And how they save it in the process too. It was an excellent movie, and Chris Pine (one of my favorite actors) provides the perfect comic relief. It is definitely a movie that will need a box of tissues, but it will really stay with you for a long time.
