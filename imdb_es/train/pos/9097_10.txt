I gave this movie such a high rating because it was really cute, very funny, and unpretentious. I went to see this movie when I was in the Philadelphia area, and it was the centerpiece of a great night with friends. The film is well written and performed, and although it feels a bit like a comedy instead of a movie, that does not take anything away from the film. You just do not find comedies like this anymore, where you do not have to surprise people to be funny. The film focuses on a Ukrainian housekeeper who is working for a young couple who needs help. Although at first she helps, she soon adds more madness to their lives than the negotiated couple. Things get more and more out of control until ... you'll have to see! The jokes made me laugh, even after leaving the theater. This movie put me in a good mood. I can not wait until it is published on DVD because I want this movie in my collection.
