I can not understand why none of the "reviewers" gave this documentary "0" more than for political reasons. No, the film did not investigate the two "sides" of the story, but surely a film in favor of Chávez against the tides of propaganda against him should be seen as an attempt to balance the general narrative (especially given the story of A. de the participation of the CIA in Latin America in the fermentation of civil unrest (the National Security Archive of Google and B. the coverage in that country and in any other place of the clearly false scenes of Chávez supporters shooting at nonexistent opponents) The most surprising thing about this film is the fact that the filmmakers stayed in the presidential palace during the whole process, although it was probably the first to document: images of a coup d'état on both sides!
