I have very good memories of this movie, as I saw it with my two younger sisters when it first appeared in 1977 at the theater and was eight years old. Apparently, it was considered a failure, and now it is practically forgotten (the scanning and scanning videocassette) that never did justice to the image or its ambitious Panavision compositions are now without impression. The film is very stylized (shades of SUBMARINE YELLOW) and certainly unequal. Some of the characters and sequences are exquisite, while others are somewhat juvenile and do not distinguish. The sad discarded blue camel (nuances of Eeyore) and its blue song are truly comforting. Joe Raposo's songs are for the most part simply beautiful. Definitely a valuable curiosity that will probably fall (sadly) in total darkness.
