Star Wars: Episode 4. <br /> <br /> the best Star Wars of all time. It's the first movie in which Sean won the bad guys and it's a very good ending. It really made me wait for the next star wars, because in this movie there are coincidences that you only have to discover in the last one. With many of the movies, I always have the feeling that it could be from the bed but not from this one. and I will never forget the part where Wader says he is his father. It is too good. I also love the figure of Bob's feat and the background player. If you never saw a Star Wars movie, go to it, this is the best one. <br /> <br /> thanks Lucas
