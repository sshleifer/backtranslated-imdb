My nanny was a fan, so I saw many of the older episodes growing up. I'm not a fan of Scooby Doo, so I'm not sure why I left the TV on when this show was released. To my surprise I found it pleasant. For me, Shaggy and Scooby were the only interesting characters * dodged the tomatoes of the others' fans *, so I like that they only focus on those two. However, this can make fans of the original programs hate it. I like the voice acting, especially Dr. Phinius Phibes. I liked to listen to him before I even knew he was Jeff Bennett. And Jim Meskimen as Robi sounds to me like he really is enjoying his work as an actor. I also love the technicians with their slightly autistic personalities and their desires to play Dungeons and Dragons or to represent scenes from Star Wars (that are not mentioned with those names in the program, of course).
