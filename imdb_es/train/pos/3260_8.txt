People call this a comedy, but when I saw it, I just laughed <br /> <br /> once. I guess the problem is that I saw it for the first time when I was 14, <br /> <br /> and I was not old enough to understand that I was not meant to be taken seriously. There were quite a few scenes that were made <br /> <br /> to be fun, but I worried too much about the characters to laugh at them <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> I suggest you watch this movie the next time you fall in love, <br /> <br /> and try to take it seriously. I think you'll find that, despite some silly faults, it's one of the most moving love stories you've seen.
