But it's worth seeing Boyer, Lorre and Paxinou. The Greene entertainments that were filmed during the war required the transplant to the American coasts, as in This Gun for Hire, or the use of American actors in roles in which they did not fit. Bacall fits in that part here. I kept waiting for him to whistle and give life to Bogie; her tone of voice is simply wrong for a high class Englishwoman. But listen to the dialogue! No, people do not talk that way, except in books, but Greene was sending a message about an England that needed to wake up to the dangers of the world. Another positive note: Greene's range of characters remained complete. While Mr. Mukerjee looked more like a Brahamin, at least his nationality was maintained, and his final conversation with Paxinou is priceless.
