['This movie is wonderful. What separates it from the science fiction of 50 others is the fact that the alien has no features, no face, no eyes, nothing, but can not be killed. I especially like the idea that this film is not made in a few days, it takes place in one night, which supposedly lasts until midnight. It is also scary that once the stain catches you, you can not take it away. You are trapped in it, since it dissolves your flesh and slowly devours your body. My favorite science fiction movie of the 50s, and what is sometimes considered the quintessence. I can see why this shot Steve McQueen to stardom. All this and a catchy theme! How can you go wrong?']
