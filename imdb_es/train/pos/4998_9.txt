Shannon Lee, the daughter of Bruce Lee, offers action for martial arts in this stimulating film from Hong Kong and shows that, like her late brother Brandon, is a real chip of the old block. There is a high-tech gimmick to die for in this fast-paced movie and the creators of the Bond films should take a look at it if they want to bring the action quotient of the next 007 adventure to life as there are many innovative things here with some novelties. The original work of the second unit to reinforce the high-action content of "AND NOW, YOU ARE DEAD." When you watch a movie with such a fast and entertaining rhythm like this, you begin to wonder how the cinema could survive before the martial arts genre was created. I really believe that movies in general and action movies in particular only marked the time until the first. Kung fu movies made their debut. Bruce Lee was the father of modern action cinema and his legitimate offspring, Shannon, does not leave the family name down here. Although there are several nice performances in this film (Michel Wong, for example), it is Shannon Lee who will remember for a genuine moment. Spectacular performance as Mandy, the great actress. Hell, you can go out whistling their fights!
