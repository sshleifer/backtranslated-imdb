I really dislike the two Shrek movies. (Since both have "PG" and have words in them, I would never tell myself, so I did not like them.) <br /> <br /> But when it comes to "Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron", that barely noticed for the first time last month, I became a fan of animated movies, in addition to Pixar. *** Spoilers ahead *** In "Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron", a horse colt is born and eventually becomes the leader of his ear. One night, he sees a strange light in the distance and heads towards it. This action finally leads to his capture, and several other things. Throughout the film, we hear a narrative. It is through the thoughts of the Spirit, although horses never speak. This is what makes the movie so good. They (the movie makers) collected real horses to make the sounds that the horses made; none of those sounds was made by humans. <br /> <br /> Spirit meets Rain, a beautiful mare, and Little Creek, a Native American, owner of Rain. Little Creek later frees Spirit and Rain, they run home. <br /> <br /> I've never been a big fan of Brian Adams, but I intend to buy the soundtrack for this movie in the near future. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie, and you will not regret it. My score: 10/10
