Since I saw this movie as a girl, more than 30 years ago, I never tire of seeing it. From the first scenes in the speaker factory, to the car engine that runs from the back seat of the car, to the answering machine for Ollie and the phone that Stan accidentally pulled out the window. I think this was maybe his best movie of the last days. After this, they moved to 20th Century Fox, and although those films were not terrible, they lacked the comic moment of this movie. Jimmy Finnlayson, for a long time, in his last appearance with the boys, appears as the Doctor is super! quote: "I said goat's milk", his answer to Stan asked him how do you milk a ghost? Charlie Hall and even Ben Turpin appear! I would say that in one of my favorite comedies of L & H.
