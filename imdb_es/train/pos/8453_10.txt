I could write a big enough comment about any of the Gundam Wing characters, each one could lead the series with their internal conflicts. Instead, we get 8 great tracks that take us through 49 golden episodes of anime bliss. <br /> <br /> Contains a dialogue that you can roll in your head for months ... years, and then come back and derive a new meaning from, a masterpiece in screenwriting (although it has the typical Anime feature of that there is a disparity between subtitles and dubbing in English). It has a lot of concepts and philosophies that make you think of your own points of view. <br /> <br /> Relationships between cold and insensitive men and loving female characters are an independent aspect of this series. The relationship between Heero and Relena, and Milliardo and Noin are joys to see. The apparent rejection of man is backed by internal confusion that makes love (a word never mentioned in the series) of women necessary for them in their harsh environment as a soldier. Women are pursuing aspects of men that rarely, if ever, we see, which makes the leading men even more enigmatic. It takes Heero all 49 episodes to show some affection, but it gets there, and when it does, it's a great reward. <br /> <br /> And then there's the giant robot fighting. It's fun to watch incredible sequences as good as any Hollywood epic fight scene. Anyone with less clues would see the giant robots fighting as a cartoon feature for children, as is clear when I try to recommend this series to my friends, but they are wrong. Many of the giant robot fights in Gundam Wing contain a great deal of pathos, usually related to young rebels who fight for what they believe in an oppressive society that makes their beliefs obsolete. <br /> <br /> The constant changes of tone and emphasis Through each episode, the Gundam Wing is impossible to bore, it is a captivating and stimulating study about the potential of the human mind and body.
