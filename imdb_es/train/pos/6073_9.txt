My university professor says that Othello may be Shakespeare's best drama. I do not know if I agree with him yet. I bought this video version of the movie. First I love Kenneth BRanagh as Iago, it was perfectly complicated and he worked very well in this adaptation. Surprisingly, he did not direct it, but played a role. Lawrence Fishburne shows that American actors can play Shakespeare as well as British actors. Not that there was a British or American problem about it. In fact, if we all work together, then Shakespeare can reach the masses he deserves to do. Apart from other tragedies of Shakespeare, this is treated with the theme of race. Something that has existed since the beginning of time. The relationship between Iago and Emilia could have been better and have demonstrated the complicity of their union. While Othello loves Desdemona with all her heart, she is weak with jealousy and fears losing her to a non-Moor man like Cassio. It's a big scene at the end of the movie, but I will not reveal the ending. It's just worth seeing. I think they edited a lot of the lines at 2 hours, but they always edited Shakespeare.
