I saw it for the first time in 1975 on a German television channel and I was immediately hooked, then I saw this movie about 12 times in cinemas and nowadays I have a video tape that I watch at least once a year; this film is excellent in all aspects (direction, acting, cut, musical score ...). The scenarios are outstanding and very impressive, the idea of ​​a devastating world war from the late thirties seems to be a prophecy for a 1936 film, the dictator of "Everytown" is pure Mussolini and Raymond Massey is simply charming, credible and ideally interpreted as "the hero." The positive tone towards technology and progress is quite refreshing. The standards of today are pessimistic, especially the final scene that always brings a tear or two to my eyes, even after watching the movie so many times. <br /> <br /> This movie is good on television but it was made for the big screen, so if you have the opportunity to see it in a movie theater. please do it, it's overwhelming
