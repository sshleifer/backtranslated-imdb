I'm going to keep this pretty short. I think this is an extraordinary movie. I see other critics who have commented that it is badly written, badly filmed, has a terrible soundtrack and, what is worse, that it is not real in its description of life. Well, it may not be entirely credible, but this film carries a message of hope that others seemed to have been lost. I hope it's not too late to save people from the terrible things that happen in so many lives. Gang violence is real, right? It's good, no! This film carries an important social message that cynics do not like, but that, nevertheless, should be praised, instead of denigrated. I have seen this movie with great pleasure at least eight times, each time with the same enjoyment and each time with the feeling that perhaps the world could improve and is not beyond savings (well, not until 2008). 9 out of 10 of me for this. It's almost perfect in my opinion. VMY
