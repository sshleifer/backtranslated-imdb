The film was very outstanding despite the NC-17 rating and the disturbing scenes. Actually, things like this happen and that's why this movie shows a lot of that. It all starts with Maya (Rosario Dawson in excellent performance), who recently started attending college, everything is going well for her. She meets Jared (Chad Faust in an excellent performance) at a fraternity party that turns out to be a true gentleman and sweet. He invites her to dinner. They look at the stars from a bridge and end up going to their apartment. They talk and take her to the basement where they become flirtatious. She tries to end it, but he violates it. This incident heals her. She goes to a club and meets a bartender / DJ Adrian (played by Marcus Patrick) who sees that he is getting drunk and helps before going away. They make friendship. He also uses drugs and Maya also starts using. In other words, it introduces you to a different world. She begins to return to school and work as a TA (Teaching Assistant) and sees Jared as one of the students. While students take a mid-course exam, she discovers Jared cheating. Jared tries to talk quietly with Maya, but she still has the advantage and decides to invite him to his place. Will the story be repeated? Or will Maya have a surprise for Jared? You see the movie. Excellent A. Rosario Dawson plays the role with focus and resistance. Chad Faust does not like that he can be a rapist, but he does an excellent job like Jared. Marcus Patrick is very bright, the man who saves Maya and trains her in a new world. This movie deserves a prize.
