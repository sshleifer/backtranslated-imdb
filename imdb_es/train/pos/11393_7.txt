Uggh! I was not really impressed with this movie so much, although I must admit that it is technically well done. He gets a 7 for very high production values, but in terms of entertainment values, it is quite poor. In fact, I think this is one of the most overrated movies of the 50s. He won the Oscar for Best Film, but sometimes the movie is boring with so much dancing and dancing and dancing. This is because, unlike some musicals that have a reasonable number of songs, along with a strong story and performance (like MEET ME IN ST LOUIS), this film is almost all song and dance. In fact, this movie has the longest number of songs and dances in history and, if you do not like this, the movie bores you quickly. Give me more history! As a result, with exaggerated production numbers and a weak storyline, this film is like a constant merengue diet: it simply does not satisfy in the long term. <br /> <br /> Think ... this is the movie that beat "A Streetcar Named Desire" and "A Place in the Sun" for Best Picture! And, to make matters worse, "The African Queen" and "Ace in the Hole" were not even nominated in this category. Even more surprising to me is that "Ace in the Hole" was lost for Best Screenplay, Screenplay for this film, even though "An American in Paris" had almost no story to talk about, and was mostly driven for the dance and the song.
