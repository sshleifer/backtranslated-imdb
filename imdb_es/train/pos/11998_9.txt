This movie was beautiful It was full of memorable images, good acting and touching themes. It would be very easy to dismiss it as too sentimental, but that is the feeling that this kind of movie is trying to achieve. He was totally involved in the development and presentation of the story. There were some cheesy shots, but such is to be expected in a religious propaganda film. The only complaint I can evoke is that there were not a lot of details. However, this film was not created to explain every element of life, ministry, triumphs, controversies, failures, etc. of Joseph Smith; was designed to take a quick look at some highlights of one of the most amazing American and historical religious figures of all time.
