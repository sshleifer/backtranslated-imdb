by Dane Youssef <br /> <br /> "Coonskin" is a film, by the only Ralph Bakshi, is a satirical denunciation of blaxploitation films and negative black stereotypes, as well as a look at black life in modern America ( Modern for the day, I mean - 1975). Paramount dropped it like a hot potato that just burst into flames. <br /> <br /> But this is a Bakshi movie, controversial, exciting and almost mandatory to watch only by definition. It is not just another random "blow-jock" of a movie that tries to impact for the sake of shock. It's by Ralph Bakshi. Anyone who knows the name knows that if HE made a movie, he has something important to say ... <br /> <br /> Although its roots are based on cheap blaxploitation, "Coonskin" is not just another hit of the countryside. outside of the conventional white film or any type of disposable film. "Coonskin" wants to be more. Aim for higher views and fry a much larger fish. <br /> <br /> The movie does not just make fun of the genre. Not only does he accuse blacks, but in reality he seems to show love, beauty and heart in the strangest places. <br /> <br /> "Coonskin" tells a story of some convicts awaiting a jailbreak. The fact that it is even possible to escape from a prison in the world "Coonskin" only makes it outdated. <br /> <br /> One of the inmates tells a story about a trio of black brothers in Harlem called Brother Bear, Brother Rabbit, Fox Preacher who want respect and a share of the action and are willing to get it by any means be necessary. The Italian mafia is executing all the real action. <br /> <br /> The famous star of the black musicians: Barry White and Scatman Crothers, as well as Charles Gordone, the first black playwright who takes home the Pulitzer. Obviously, something big is happening here. <br /> <br /> The film develops as a descent into this world, this side of the racial division. Of a black man angry, modern, deep and moving, with a hatred in the heart and a gun in his hand. <br /> <br /> Bakshi's films never know the meaning of the word "subliminal". It seems that you have never heard of the word. But maybe a topic like this needs extremism. Real hammer satire. Some issues can not be addressed lightly. <br /> <br /> Bakshi is a relentless god. Here, no member or minority of the Harlem scene appears unscathed. <br /> <br /> The characters here are "animated" to "real", everything depends on the mood and the situation. Animated characters and humans share the same reality and are thought to be taken in the same way. <br /> <br /> Bakshi never shows ugly caricatures just because of the impact value. He always has something to say. Neither the black face is free. Here, unlike "Bamboozled" by Spike Lee, it seems that he is using it to try to say something. <br /> <br /> Like 99.9% of all Bakshi films, it incorporates animation and live action. Usually, at the same time. Bakshki is not just a trick here. All this technique is intertwined, combining while saying something. <br /> <br /> Somehow, this one feels inevitably outdated. Many of these types of films (including those of Bakshi) are very current, very stimulating at the moment. They reflect the certain tendency of the day, but looking back years later, there is only an unmistakable feeling of nostalgia (and also an eternal truth). <br /> <br /> Even though the music, the clothes, the jargon and the city clearly looks like photos belonging to a time capsule, the attitude, the spirit and the heart remain the same, It does not matter which ear it is. Anyone who has really seen the movies, the state of things and been in the company of people, knows what I am talking about. <br /> <br /> Even some of the black characters are a bunny (junglebunny), a big old bear and a fox. One of the most bitter and unpleasant racist characters is a Harlem dirty cop who is on the trail of these "dirty n" -s after the death of a policeman. But for him, they are not just business. Neither is it for the rest of the brothers who wear the shield. It is pure sadistic racist pleasure to hurt blacks. <br /> <br /> The sequence involving the Godfather and his lady is one of the most moving pieces of the entire film, of which there are many. It develops like an opera or a ballet. <br /> <br /> The promotional line: WARNING: "This movie offends everyone!" This is not just an exaggeration. Proceed with extreme caution. <br /> <br /> You have been warned ... <br /> <br /> by Dane Youssef
