First and foremost, I would like to say that I am a big fan of Sarah Silverman, and that other people say that and then the pilot of the pilot surpasses me. Everything in the pilot was in the typical way of Sarah Silverman, maybe not directly fun, but what counts is the situation and the delivery. <br /> <br /> If you liked it, Jesus is Magical, so I do not see how you would do it. I like this. It has that same flow and that same rhythm. It is true that it is only for true fans, but if you are, you will be satisfied. <br /> <br /> Again, only for true fans, there is no way to avoid it. If you are not used to his style, then you would not understand why this is fun. However, it is, and I hope you think so too.
