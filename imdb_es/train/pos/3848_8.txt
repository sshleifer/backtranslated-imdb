Gerard is a writer with a somewhat hyperactive imagination. He is also homosexual and Catholic prone to Catholic guilt and something like a clairvoyant, or so it seems. On a trip to Flushing, Christine "seduces" him. When he discovers that Christine's new boyfriend is a bit difficult, he has been thinking from afar and decides to stay. After all, forced heterosexuality has its compensations. Then she realizes that Christine's three previous husbands have died violently. Christine murdered them and he or his boyfriend, Herman, are going to be "the fourth man"? The overheated and overloaded Verhoeven melodrama is a delicious combination of Hitchcock and David Lynch, full of OTT eroticism and religious images and a lot of red. Most of the time it looks and feels like a dream and we can never be sure that what we are seeing is real or a product of Gerard's imagination. The fun is in finding out. Also the fact that Christine is a character infinitely more pleasant than the cunning Gerard or the optimistic Herman mean that we can hardly encourage any of the men who are on her. In fact, it's fair to say that Gerard's coming can not come soon enough. Super interpretations, too, by Jeroen Krabbe and Renee Soutendijk and easily the best Verhoeven film until his subversive piece of science fiction "Starship Troopers".
