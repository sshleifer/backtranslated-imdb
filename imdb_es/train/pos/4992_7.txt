Usually, I find Loretta Young difficult to take, too concerned about her appearance and too feminine in all the wrong ways. But in this lyrical romance of Frank Borzage, and although he is playing with a person of low self-esteem that supports the harassment of Spencer Tracy, it is direct, honest and irresistible. It's a strange little movie, played mainly in a one-room hut in Hooverville, unusually sincere about Depression, but romantic and idealized. Tracy, playing a "normal guy" who is difficult to take and who would be a chauvinist and stalker horrible by today's standards, softens the toughness of his character and almost makes him attractive. There is good support work from Marjorie Rambeau and Glenda Farrell (who never got as far as it should be), and Jo Swerling's script is modest and efficient. But the real heroes are Borzage, who always liked to dramatize real love in the lyrical foreground, and Young. Somehow, you want to slap her and tell her character that she is too good for this guy, but she is so seductive and persuasive that with satisfaction you see how her story comes to a satisfactory conclusion.
