['I bought the DVD on an Amazon.com recommendation based on my other interests. They hit the nail in the head with this one. I remember seeing the show when I was on TV, but I always wondered what had happened to it. Ten years later, it&#39;s like seeing everything again for the first time. Lucas Black as Caleb Temple and Gary Cole as Sheriff Lucas Buck are great together, although they are somewhat rival. Almost representing good (Caleb) and evil (Sherriff Lucas Buck). I never really understood exactly what Lucas was supposed to be, but suffice it to say that he has some special powers that I do not think were granted for anything sacred. You can make the phones ring, the writing appears or even change a person&#39;s emotions. However, there are some episodes in which he really becomes the good guy in spite of everything. In short, this is an excellent series that, like many others I can imagine (IE Point Pleasant, Threshold, Nowhere Man and SeaQuest DSV, just to name a few) were canceled long before their time. The dead zone of Steven King (Sunday Network of the USA) seems to be the only thing in this genre that seems to be. There is simply nothing to watch on television. This is because everything that has to do with Christianity and Satan is considered offensive and must be removed immediately from television. So, in the meantime, I&#39;ll keep buying DVD sets and watching shows that should still be on TV but that were ripped off television by religious fanatics so we could watch &quot;quality&quot; shows like Family Guy and American Dad and The Simpsons. a lot of garbage that is).']
