Although I can not say that I am a fan of comics, I have read my part, so I guess I was part of the audience of this film and I was not disappointed. It runs out of steam near the end, it's almost full of ideas, and it seems that Lena Olin, one of my favorite actresses, was left on the floor of the cutting room. Also, a little Blue Raja by Hank Azaria can go a long way. Even so, it is easy to forgive all these faults when you have a movie that is very funny. All actors seem to be having fun with their roles, especially William H. Macy as Straight Arrow Shoveler, and Janeane Garofalo as The Bowler. And unlike some, I found the design of the city to make the joke even funnier. I also liked that the album was the music chosen by the bad guys; Somehow, it seemed appropriate.
