I just saw MURDER AT THE VANITIES in the recently released Universal Pre-Code game, and I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the vehicle from start to finish. Most other commentators have covered the story, a murder mystery within a musical, but I wanted to add some additional notes. Brisson and Carlisle are relatively bland, compared to most minor players, and neither of them seems to have the right voice for what they're singing (Carlisle is a trained opera singer, Brisson a little wobbly at some of his heights and low notes). The great Victor McLaglen and Jack Oakie play well with each other, with an excellent sense of time that keeps the ball rolling between the musical numbers. Yes, Lucille Ball and Ann Sheridan are Vanities girls, but let's not forget the splendid jazz singer Ernestine Anderson in the number of "Ebony Rhapsody". Gail Patrick makes one of her first appearances, sounding a bit like Eve Arden; Patrick would become the executive producer of the television series Perry Mason. Then there's Jessie Ralph as the costume owner, you'll also see her in David COPPERFIELD (as Aunt Peggoty) and THE BANK DICK. The music is very good: Brisson presents the standard "Cocktails for Two" in two different scenes; "Sweet marijuana" with peyote girls barely dressed in the background (the blood dripping on the white skin of a chorine was wonderfully chilling); the "Ebony Rhapsody", with the Duke Ellington Orchestra and a group of beautiful dancers, both white and black, who mix. And I think this is one of the only early musicals to present such a mix, and the costumes leave nothing to the imagination.
