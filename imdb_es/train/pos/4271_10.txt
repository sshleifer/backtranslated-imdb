This is the best movie I've seen. <br /> <br /> I've seen the movie on Dutch television sometime in 1988 (?). <br /> <br /> That month they were showing a Yugoslav movie Every Sunday night. <br /> <br /> Next week there was another great movie (involving a train, instead of a bus) whose name I do not remember. If you know it, please let me know! In any case, how can I see this movie again? A DVD of this movie, where? Please, tell me at vannoord@let.rug.nl <br /> <br /> Next week there was another great movie (involving a train, instead of a bus) whose name I do not remember. If you know it, please let me know!
