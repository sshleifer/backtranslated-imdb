I read that this did not work well, that the story is not solid, that Volckman feels he has failed in some way. <br /> <br /> I do not agree. First, it is well executed. Volckman is doing well not only to try a new technique, but to have a worthwhile focus on thinking: would immortality reduce the value of life? Great question ... <br /> <br /> I can see that he is struggling to create a feeling, and he is not compromising. This must be applauded. I'm sure it was an interesting exercise to build characters that way. I have seen artists reduce a form to a minimum to increase the intensity of a moment. I identify this movie with this. <br /> <br /> Moreover, it's much more interesting than Richard Linklater's spin mode, and Volckman's story has more meaning than Linklater's later stories about a life wasted on drugs. Old news Everyone knows it, but nobody does anything about it. The Renaissance has more to offer, something new to think about. And there are many more stories out there with many holes that make it much better. <br /> <br /> Well done, Volckman. Very good work.
