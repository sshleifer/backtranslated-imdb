['I thought that ROTJ was clearly the best of the three Star Wars movies. I am surprised that many of those who voted consider ROTJ to be the weakest part of the Trilogy. It seemed to me that ROTJ was the best because it had the deepest plot, more suspense, surprises, more emotional (especially the ending) and, definitely, the most episodic film. Personally I also really like the Empire Strikes Back, but I think it&#39;s a little less good than the ROTJ since it was slower, it was not so episodic, and I just did not feel as much suspense or emotion as I did with the third. movie. <br /><br /> I also find that, after reading these amazing reviews, the reasons why people cite that ROTJ is a film inferior to the other two are simply ridiculous and insignificant compared to the excellence of the film as a whole. I&#39;ve heard many strange reasons, such as: a) because Yoda died b) because Bobba Fett died c) because the little Ewoks defeated a band of stormtroopers d) because Darth Vader was revealed <br /><br /> I would like to deny each of these reasons because I think they are completely wrong. First, WHO CARES if Bobba Fett died? If George Lucas wanted him to die, then he wanted him to die. Do not misunderstand. I&#39;m a Bobba Fett fan, but he made some appearances and it was not Luke&#39;s intention to make him a central character in the movies that Star Wars fans made him out to be. His name was not even mentioned anywhere in the movie ... You had to go to the credits to find out Bobba Fett&#39;s name !!! Judging ROTJ because a minor character died is a little too much, I think ... Secondly, many fans did not like Yoda to die. Of course, it was a transcendental period in the movie. I was not happy to see him die either, but it makes the movie more realistic. All the good guys can not stay alive in a realistic movie, you know. Otherwise, if ALL the good ones had lived and ALL the bad ones had died, this movie would have been equivalent to a caricature on Saturday morning. Another aspect to this point that people do not like Yoda&#39;s death ... Well, no one complained when Darth Vader hit Obi Wan Kenobi in A New Hope. (Many consider that A New Hope is the best of the trilogy) Why the death of Obi Wan was fine, but Yoda is not ... hmmmmmmmmmmmm? ... Another reason I just can not believe it was because people discovered that the cute Ewoks outnumbered the stormtroopers. be impossible That is absolutely ridiculous! I can not believe this !! First of all, the Ewoks are on their home planet Endor, so they are aware of their native land since they live there. If you watch the movie carefully, many of the tactics that the Ewoks used to defeat the stormtroopers were through the excellent use of the advantage of their local field. (Since you lived in the forest all your life, I hope you have learned to use it to your advantage). They had vines, ropes, trunks to trip those walkers and other traps. Assault soldiers were highly disadvantaged because they were outnumbered and unaware of the advantages of the forest. All they had were their blasters. To add, it was not as if the Ewoks were fighting the stormtroopers themselves, but that they had the assistance of the rebellious band in that conquest. I thought that if the stormtroopers had defeated a combination of the Star Wars heroes, the rebellious band, as well as the huge Ewoks clan with great familiarity with their home turf, that would have been a great dislike. Finally, if this scene was still amazing for you ... How about Empire Strikes Back or A New Hope, where there were SEVERAL scenes of a group formed only by Han Solo, Chewbacca and the Princess, who were shot like ten assault soldiers? and all its fliers lost while the heroes were in sight! And not only that, the heroes, of course, always hit the Stormtroopers with their blasters. The soldiers must have VERY, VERY bad aim then! At least in Empire Strikes Back, the Battle of Endor was much more credible, since you had two armies facing each other, not 3 heroes against a legion of stormtroopers. Do not Believe Me Take a look at the battle in Cloud City when our heroes escaped from the Lando base. Or when our heroes rescued Princess Leia and received shots (somehow, they were lost) when Han Solo and Luke tried to get out of the Death Star. <br /><br /> The last reason I&#39;m interested in discussing (others are just too ridiculous to spend my time here) is that people did not like it being revealed to Darth Vader. Well, in many ways, that was an important part of the plot of the movie. Luke was trying to find out if Darth Vader was his father or not, Annakin Skywalker. It would have been disappointing if the movie had ended without Luke seeing his father&#39;s face because he completed it. By the revelation of Annakin, it symbolized the transition that Darth Vader suffered to being possessed by the dark side (in his helmet) and the good person that was Annakin Skywalker (when removing the helmet). The point is that Annakin died turned to the light side again and that&#39;s what the meaning of the helmet removal scene is about. In fact, that&#39;s what I would have done in that scene also if it was Luke&#39;s father ... Is not that what you would have done if you wanted to see your son with your own eyes before dying and not in a mechanized way? helmet? <br /><br /> On another note, I think the unconscious or unconscious expectation of most people is that the sequel MUST be worse (even if it&#39;s better) than the previous films is another reason why ROTJ does not get as much praise as it deserves. I never get into a movie with that deception in mind, I always try to get into a movie with the attitude that &quot;Well, it could be better or worse than the original ... But I can not be sure ... Let&#39;s see.&quot; That way I go with an open mind and I do not deceive myself thinking that a clearly superior film is not as good as it really was. <br /><br /> I&#39;m not sure who criticizes these movies, but I&#39;ve asked many college students and adults what their favorite Star Wars movie is and they all tell me (except one person who said A New Hope was their favorite) that it&#39;s ROTJ. I think the results in these surveys are frightening and quite deceptive. <br /><br /> In short, the Return of the Jedi was the best of the Trilogy. This movie was the only one of the three that kept me fascinated in its 135 minutes. There was not a moment of boredom because each scene was suspenseful, exciting, surprising or all of the above. For example, the emotional lightsaber battle between Luke and his father in ROTJ was better than that of the Empire Strikes Back at any time. <br /><br /> Finally, I hope that people will see the Phantom Menace with an open mind because if the fans start looking for insignificant and insignificant details (or they see it as &quot;just another sequel&quot;) to destroy the movie like &quot;This movie sucks because Luke does not is that! &quot; Then, this meritorious film will become another spectacular film that will be mocked as ROTJ suffered, unfortunately. <br /><br />']
