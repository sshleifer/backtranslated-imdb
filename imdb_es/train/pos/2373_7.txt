The new film by Pendragon Pictures, "H G Wells' War of the Worlds", the first faithful adaptation of the original novel, has been in development for approximately 5 years. The theatrical release was scheduled for early this year (March 2005), but this never happened. The DVD was hurriedly launched to coincide with the release of Spielberg's version, which will hit theaters on June 29. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie, with certain reservations. <br /> <br /> How faithful is the adaptation? He is not 100% faithful to Wells's book, but 90 to 95% is good enough for me. At least several scenes were totally new, such as the confrontation of the astronomer Ogilvy with a farmer and the anonymous writer / narrator who drank tea with his cousin. But in general, this film follows the book very closely, certainly much more than the classic version of George Pal in 1953. <br /> <br /> Its biggest flaw is that it was obviously done with a very economical budget. Most seem to have been shot on a blue screen and composed with digitally rendered backgrounds. This is particularly annoying during most indoor shots and scenes of the busy streets of the city. The 1898 London overviews look like something from a video game. Numerous scenes were simulated in horse carriages, I suppose they could not afford to rent a horse. The only scenes taken for "real" seem to be those of open fields or forests. <br /> <br /> But within those budget constraints, they managed to do enough. Artistically, the movie looks good. The Martians and their tripods are pretty well made and are very true to Wells's descriptions. I was particularly impressed by the heat ray. Although the sequence of Thunder Child, which should have been one of the highlights of the film, is very disappointing. It is a pity that they can not afford more real sets or a better quality animation. <br /> <br /> The performance and the direction will not win any Oscars. For the most part, they are competent, not bad, but not outstanding. The music is also quite good, although it is not on par with any of the leading composers in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Actually, I am glad that there is not a theatrical premiere, because the budget limitation would have achieved it. Look much worse on a big screen. As it stands, I would rate this in a similar way to an adaptation of classic BBC-TV literature. <br /> <br /> Some key points: most scenes are presented with several color filters (mostly red). This may have been an artistic choice, but it is used very inconsistently, and it seems more of a sloppy work of mastering the DVD. And, obviously, the writer / narrator's fake mustache mutates from one scene to another. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, is it worth seeing? If you can see beyond the technical and budgetary limitations, and enter the story, I think you will enjoy this, especially if you have really read the original HG Wells novel. However, if low production values ​​discourage you easily, it is better that this happens (unless you are a fan of MST3K). Keep in mind that, however, the movie lasts 3 full hours, so I do not recommend seeing it all in one session. <br /> <br /> BTW: a completely different version of War of the Worlds (also known as "INVASION") was released on DVD the same month that Spielberg hit theaters: http://imdb.com/title / tt0449040 /. This was also done with a budget, but it is updated to this day like the Spielberg movie, but it's much better! And to top it off, Jeff Wayne is making an animated movie from his best-selling album of 1978, but he will not be released until 2007.
