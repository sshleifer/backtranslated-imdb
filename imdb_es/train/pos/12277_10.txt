Perhaps Isabel Allende's best book, Casa de los esp√≠ritus, describes an alternative Chilean history, full of magic, a mystical veil, and a kind of omnipresent sadness. This film gathers a great cast, as well as a great art direction, with a script that can not contain all the quality of this book. It is unusual for an almost unknown country like Chile to represent itself as well as it is in this film, whose maybe the only sin is to aim too high, and because of that it left the illiterate public a bit annoyed, mainly because they understood very little.
