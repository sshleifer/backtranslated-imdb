Diego Armando Maradona was sixteen years old in 1978 when Argentina won the World Cup at home. He was already the biggest star and the best player in a country obsessed with football. Everyone had asked Cesar Luis Menotti to play the genius boy, but the manager thought he was not ready yet. <br /> <br /> History records that Argentina won the 1978 World Cup quite convincingly: they did not really need Maradona. . The same did not happen in 1982. Spain was a disaster catalog for Argentina. Menotti, still smoking chain, played against Diego this time, but the occasion was too much for such a temperamental boy. Maradona signed with Barcelona on June 4, 1982 for approximately $ 7 million. Nine days later, he played his first game at the Camp Nou and Belgium beat Argentina from a single zero. It was not an auspicious debut and, although he scored twice against Hungary in the next game, Maradona will remember the World Cup as the site of his nadir: a serious and petulant foul against Brazil's Batista in the Second Round that abruptly ended his tournament and The reign of Argentina as world champions. <br /> <br /> But now that was behind him. Maradona had meddled in some crazy times at Barça, and left in 1984 to join Naples. It was like he was finally home. The Neapolitan tifosi had done everything possible to attract Maradona to the poor and helpless Naples. The gifts of older women and pocket money of young children uncomfortably nested with the millions of the Camorra as part of the transfer fee, and the city was determined to make you feel at home. So, at least for the moment, Maradona was El Rey; He brought his Argentine side to Mexico as one of the favorites, and with a new manager, Carlos Bilardo replacing Menotti. <br /> <br /> Maradona is the hero of this story, a winning machine of the one-man World Cup. In 1982, hundreds of young people died in a senseless battle for the Falkland Islands; now the British press longed for a rematch (with the same result) in Mexico City. Maradona was still considered with distinction in England, remembered more for his excellent performance in Great Britain during a tour of 1980 than for Spain. But he was still an Argie: the enemy. <br /> <br /> England actually started well, and Lineker could have scored only after twelve minutes. A key event happened in 8 minutes. Fenwick, the great and limited English defender, was signed: now he was terrified of doing any challenge in the penalty area. <br /> <br /> After a tense first minute of 45 minutes, the second half started with a pop. Maradona dances forward after 50 minutes, but could not find an exit. In the same way, Valdano's attempt only reached white shirts. Then the moment of infamy that serves as an epitaph for Diego. Hodge strangely hooked the ball back into his own penalty area, Shilton hurriedly reclaimed, but Maradona, who somehow rose above the English goalkeeper to push the ball into the net. How had he done it? Simple: handball. <br /> <br /> The most famous foul in the history of football happened almost in slow motion. All the spectators waited for Mr. Al-Sharif of Syria to blow for the lack (he did not). Shilton looked and appealed to the line judge; ran to the center circle. Unless he murders the Pope, or becomes the first man to step on Mars, when the great man dies, this moment will be shown first: in slow, prolonged and slow motion, followed by a look of joy on his face. The next image will be his next gift to the world: the best goal in the World Cup. <br /> <br /> Burruchaga stroked the ball to Maradona, who was wandering on the right side of his own half. It spread, and accelerated away from Beardsley and Reid. This was the real Diego: he broke into Butcher and attacked Fenwick. Fenwick now had the opportunity to stop the attack. Normally, he would have pointed his boot somewhere near Maradona's thigh, sure he would have picked up a red card, but who cares? Then Fenwick had a brainwave: he hesitated and decided to run towards Maradona waving his arms. Maybe he was trying to postpone it? Diego shot the box when Fenwick fell. Butcher had been running next to the genie as if he was offering encouragement. Shilton was frightened, and Maradona writhed around him and prepared to score. Now Butcher remembered his role and tried to paralyze the Argentine; instead, it gave an additional boost to the shot, which crashed into the goal. England was coming home. <br /> <br /> During this magical Mexican summer, the world had found a successor to Pele. In fact, the best footballer of all time had been overcome: Pelé had been excellent in 1958 and 1970, but had great players around him. Maradona did not do it. 1986 was his world cup.
