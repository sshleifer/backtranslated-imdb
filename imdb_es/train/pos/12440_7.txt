Summary: It is the usual business in the Louche casino in Tangier. The casino is about to close and prepares for a big transaction the next day. The owner Louche and some employees leave for the night, leaving Modesty in charge. Suddenly, a troop of armed gangsters assault the casino, firing wildly. Unknown to modesty, they already killed Louche, and now they look for the money hidden in the vault. But nobody present, and still alive, in the casino knows the code to open the vault. The vault itself is heavily trapped with explosives, so the assailants can not blow up the door as planned. Suddenly, Modesty comes face to face with the leader of the gang members, Miklos, in a roulette game with their lives in danger. <br /> <br /> Comments: This is a written review without any connection to other published media about Modesty Blaise, as I have not seen or read any of that. The first point I like to make is that this is slightly misclassified. First of all, I thought this was a thriller with a battle of wits between Modesty and Miklos as the main plot. Sure, there are some bursts of action but they are not really an integral or important part of the story. <br /> <br /> As already mentioned, the main plot and the main scene full of suspense, is the game between Modestia and Miklos. It's an innovative and intriguing way of revealing a character's background, and in doing so, much of the story takes place outside the casino much earlier. Someone said that it is almost like a pilot for a television series, and the feeling is that it could be used as such. But I felt it was a much better way to present a character than many others. I was not disappointed at all the lack of action, but I enjoyed this game, the story much more than a simple action movie. <br /> <br /> I think the two main stars, Alexandra Staden and Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau did very well. Staden especially portrays Modestia very well, and really takes this confident and talented character. <br /> <br /> 7/10
