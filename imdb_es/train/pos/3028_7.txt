It could have been a better movie. Drag the points, and the central story changes from Boyer completing his mission to Boyer avenging the death of Wanda Hendrix, but Graham Greene is an author who is very difficult to spoil. Their stories are all stories of morality, due to their own considerations of Catholicism, guilt and innocence (very relative terms in their view of the world) and the human condition. <br /> <br /> Boyer is Luis Denard, a well-known concert pianist, who has allied with the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War. He has been sent to England to try to carry out a weapons purchase agreement that is desperately needed. Unfortunately for Denard, he is literally alone, since each one of his contacts turns out to be a volunteer reseller for the Falagists of Spain. In particular, Katina Paxinou (Mrs. Meléndez), a tenebrous pension, and Peter Lorre (Mr. Contreras), a teacher of an international language of the "Esperanto" type. Wanda Hendrix is ​​the drunkard of a girl (Else) who works for Mrs. Meléndez. The local diplomat, Licata (Victor Francken) is already a volunteer collaborator of the Falangists. <br /> <br /> The British (Holmes Herbert, Miles Mander, and the best, if not the worst, George Coulouris) don Do not give much hope to Boyer's cause (he soon realizes that it may be Great Britain in a short time). Herbert and Mander retire behind the official policy of neutrality ordered by the governments of Ramsay MacDonald and Stanley Baldwin during the Civil War. Coulouris here is a typical type of cocoon blimp: always impeccable in his native English diction, he shows his dislike of foreigners in general. <br /> <br /> The only ray of hope is Lauren Bacall (Rose Cullen) Here, trying to play her role as best she can, but in reality she can not. She is an aristocrat, the daughter of a press gentleman. It was Bacall's second film, and (unfortunately) almost sank his long career. She acts well, but the spark she showed in her first film was due to the double effect of starring with Humphrey Bogart and being directed by Howard Hawks. Boyer is a good actor, but it's not Bogie, and Herman Shumlin is not Hawks. His next movie returned it to Bogie and Hawks again, and his star resumed his ascent. <br /> <br /> It's a grim movie (as was the novel). The mission of Boyer never succeeds, since it has too many enemies hidden everywhere. But villains are also losers, often with their lives. <br /> <br /> With Dan Seymour as a foreign tenant suspected of Katina Paxinou (and the man who destroys her). It's worth seeing how Warner's actors do the best they can, given the weakness in the direction.
