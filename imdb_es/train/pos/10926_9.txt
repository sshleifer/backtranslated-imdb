If you like kung fu movies and you have not seen this movie, you're cheating. This movie is one of the only cheap Kung Fu movies that could be recommended to fans of all kinds of movies. Normally, it takes a fan of the genre to see something in these movies, but it has it all! The story is well told, and complete. The fight scenes are great and tend to end before you are completely bored with them (unlike Crouching Tiger). Introduce a bit of mystery and torture and you will have a great movie. See this at all costs. Hell, my wife even enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> Wu Du it! <br /> <br /> 9 of 10 <br /> <br />
