['I remember this movie from when I was 12 years old, it was incredible ... I remember it until the day, not like most of the things I saw back then, I even tried to buy it, but it&#39;s like a rocking horse. Anyway, the acting is a bit chewy, but the story is amazing, since it was a real B movie with a low budget and, in the event that the fight scenes were amazing to watch, I must have seen about 20 times. It was a very well made movie and I loved the idea of fighting against robots controlled by a giant man, pity that they had to spoil it by doing a horrible roll of &quot;Crash and Burn&quot;, do not watch that movie because of the way the pants are. ! If you are a true fan of science fiction movies, look at this, if it were done again today it would be a winner ... I would really love to see a new version or even release the DVD.']
