The film starts very slowly, with the lifestyle of Wallace Napalm, an assistant at a photo delivery station. His wife has been restrained to her home with a bracelet on her ankle as a result of a sentence of arson. Wallace is a member of the volunteer fire department, and takes firefighting seriously. <br /> <br /> As we watch Wallace's boring life unfold, suddenly something new and discordant emerges: a traveling carnival arrives in the city. One of its stars is Wilder Napalm, Wallace's brother. He is a clown, but he has a special talent. <br /> <br /> The same goes for Wallace. Both are pyrokinetic or "pirotic", people capable of starting fires by mental energy. Wallace keeps his powers secret; Wilder lets his acquaintances know what he can do. <br /> <br /> Spoiler: Some of their differences go back to a childhood incident in which they caused the death of a vagabond without realizing it. Wallace refrains from using his powers; Wilder wants to make it public on national television. <br /> <br /> To complicate matters, Wilder wants Wallace's wife, with whom they both left years earlier. She becomes a bone of contention, and it becomes one of the reasons why the brothers finally have a literal shooting. <br /> <br /> The movie is entertaining, but not fun. I think enough to have a copy in my library. It's a good unconventional movie.
