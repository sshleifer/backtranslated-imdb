In my years of attending film festivals, I have seen many small movies like this one that never receive theatrical distribution, and end up in the $ 3 containers at WalMart. I just found a Yank Tanks DVD there, excellent doc, but how sad it ends up as a rest of the background. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie, I wish I had seen it at the movies, it's everything. I would have preferred that New Yorker Films have translated the title directly. It's good that Americans stretch a little. If the title of the film helps the American audience to explore random chaos, so much the better. Cinema imitates life and vice versa. <br /> <br /> Also, it distracted me that the subtitles put the prices in dollars. Come on! The euro is not difficult to understand, to make the gringo audiences do the accounts. When watching a film, especially a shot in Paris, the viewer should not be affected by the fact of reminding me: I am American watching a movie and are translating the dollars into dollars for me. <br /> <br /> I hope to see more of these actors and more of the writer and director as well.
