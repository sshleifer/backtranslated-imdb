David and Bathsheba is a splendid Hollywood film produced in 20th Century Fox by Darryl F. Zanuck, directed by Henry King and starring Gregory Peck {King David}, Susan Hayward (Bathsheba), Raymond Massey (Nathan), Kieron Moore (Uriah) )) and Jayne Meadows (Michal). <br /> <br /> The film is based on Samuel's second Old Testament book of the Holy Bible. Follow King David, who as a child had killed the giant Goliath, and now we find him in adulthood as the second king of Israel. A strong and secure king, David, however, has heart problems that cause great problems. For once, he spies Bathsheba in a shower, it is the beginning of a journey that encompasses adultery and betrayal; a journey that will end in the judgment of God when he is called. <br /> <br /> Typically for the genre, David & Bathsheba is a great great production. From its excellent set designs to its technicolor photography (Leon Shamroy), which is absolutely beautiful, it has enough quality to ensure that you feel alongside the best that the genre has to offer in terms of production values. Although uncharacteristically, the film has a quiet pace and is based on 99% of its value is based exclusively on dialogue. This is not one for action fans or anyone who needs some money to go with their buckle. This is a very humanistic image, in fact, we are not going to surround the burning bush here, it is a biblical love story full of the sins of the heart. But that is not bad at all, because when we analyze it we find that it is very well acted (Peck has a stoic thing but at the same time very vulnerable and Hayward is taking it to the maximum}, and it is a good story directed with knowledge Skill of the often forgotten Henry King And although some of the dialogues are certainly indifferent, the flow of characters is never interrupted, since the Oscar-nominated script of Phillip Dunne (The Ghost and Mrs. Muir) keeps the attention on everything. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, an image forgotten in terms of the Biblical genres / Swords and sandals (most likely it is a talented piece that has the heart as its main point of sale), but it is really worth Worth the time of anyone interested in the most luxurious of genres. 7/10
