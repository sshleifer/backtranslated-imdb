This is a very light comedy about a wonderful family that has a son named Pecker because he used to use Peck in his food. Pecker loves to take all kinds of photographs of people in a small suburb of Baltimore, Md., And he manages to get the attention of a group of photographic art lovers from New York City. Pecker has a cute sister who goes crazy with SUGAR and is actually an ADICTA, who takes spoonfuls of sugar from a bag. There are scenes of men showing the bundles in their jockeys with movement movements and girls doing almost the same. It's hard enough to keep your mind off the sidelines with this movie, but who cares, it's just a movie to give you a few laughs at a simple photo taken in 1998.
