I'm surprised that nobody has thought about making a movie like this before. Horror is often more effective when you use the displeasure of real life as a subject. And nobody (except Steve Martin in The Little Shop of Horrors) likes to go to the dentist. Dental torture has been done before (see The Marathan Man for example), but this brings terror to the suburbs. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around a dentist, Dr. Alan Feinstone (Corbin Bernsen), who descends to Madness. Now, to begin with, our beloved doctor was not playing with a complete mallet, but, motivated by jealousy and an obsessive-compulsive disorder, begins to wreak havoc on those around him. The mental condition in spiral of the doctors is something similar to what we see in the character of Micheal Douglas in Falling Down, but with a touch of horror. <br /> <br /> Written and directed by stalwarts Stuart Gordon and Brian Yuzna, their ingenuity and a great flow. He also introduces himself as a police officer, the always welcome Ken Foree. <br /> <br /> Now I think this movie would not work without the absolutely fantastic performance of Corbin Bernsen. Having seen him before in Los Angeles before, I was surprised by his performance. <br /> <br /> It's also worth watching the sequel The Dentist 2, but slightly below par. <br /> <br /> TTKK's Bottomline - A funny movie with some scenes that will make you tremble, crowned (with a play on words) by a great performance by Bernsen
