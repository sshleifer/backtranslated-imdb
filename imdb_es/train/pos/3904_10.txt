In my opinion, this is the best standing show I've seen. I became an Eddie fan instantly after watching Dress to Kill, but I must say that I think this is his best work. However, I would say that if you ever have the opportunity to go see it live. Worth it! <br /> <br /> Most of the time, after seeing a couple of routine times, the jokes begin to age. But I must say that I have seen this program so many times that I literally have everything memorized (which I do realize is a bit sad), but every joke still makes me laugh. This is really a good show. <br /> <br /> Dress to Kill will never age for me. I own it and I see it when I need a good laugh.
