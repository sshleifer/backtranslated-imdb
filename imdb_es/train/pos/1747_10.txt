This movie was one of the best movies I've seen this year. I did not see any cameo in the movie, but it's still pretty good. It's similar to Anchorman in the humor department, but I think this is a better-armed movie. Actually it has a point. If you are going to see a lot of T & A, you will be disappointed. Only a well-armed movie !!!! If you have nothing to do for the day or if you need a lot of humor, you will find that this is a really good movie. I definitely think that Ebert and Roeper's review of this movie is correct. I mean, I do not really like Ebert in most movies, but this is the movie I'll agree on. The film contains a story good enough to be credible that these types of people are out there. There is definitely something to be said about how they treat virginity in this movie. Yes, of course, you laugh when you discover it, but it still suggests that you wait. Steve did a wonderful job of portraying the person he made in this movie, and yet it's still fun.
