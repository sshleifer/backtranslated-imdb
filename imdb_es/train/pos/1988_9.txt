First of all, I would like to make a correction in another review of this film that said the last musical that won the Oscar for Best Film was 'Gigi' in 1958. That is misinformation, since 'West Side Story' won in 1962. "My Fair Lady" won in 1965 and "Sound of Music" won the following year. That said, this movie is absolutely fantastic! The story of the novel has been altered a bit, but that is more due to the limitations they had in a scenario that simply did not change for a filmed version. However, I do not care. In fact, I think that all the production flows better than the novel. I like that Nancy takes Oliver to the bridge with her and they kill her there instead of doing it later in the apartment. The subtle things in this movie are the ones that make me laugh. I love the moment when Mr. Bumble and Mrs. Bumble start dating from the governor's office. The underscore for that moment is brilliant. My three favorite actors for this film were Jack Wild, who plays the best Dodger in any film version of the story, Ron Moody, a playful and humorous Fagin (this character is much better than him in the book), and Shani Wallis, who it is Nancy's strongest and most anguished version. The only reason why I give this movie a 9 instead of a 10 is because of the two big production numbers that are: "Consider yourself" and "Who will buy". I always hate when choreography in musicals is meant to resemble people who perform everyday tasks and tasks. It looks horrible and cheesy, especially when they dance at the London Meat Co. They should have done regular choreography for these scenes. However, this movie is a rare treasure that will remain with us, hopefully, forever.
