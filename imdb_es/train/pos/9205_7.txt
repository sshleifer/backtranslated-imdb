This grew on me. I love the music of R.D. Burman and, despite the crudest elements of the story, I found many things that moved me while I was still watching the movie. The sister-sister plot is powerful, I thought; There are also more probably compulsory things, like bar fights, a crazy crime story, etc. that distract. (Although it is not unfortunate from a certain point of view). Also, the English translation is definitely from someone for whom it was a bit exaggerated, and however crazy it is, I thank you for doing it. <br /> <br /> Like so many of the Bollywood movies I've seen, this one is melodramatic and opera-like, which includes here, in particular, a song sung first by a little boy to encourage his abused and unhappy sister, and then the same song sung 12 I wish years later, for the man who traveled to Kathmandu to reconnect with this little girl, grown up and worried (she had been told that her brother and her mother had died), numbing her pain with drugs. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this 1971 movie is that it's about the hippie movement, which brought hordes of seekers to India, from an Indian point of view, that sees them as people driven to India by a spiritual hunger caused by the failures of their own societies, but nevertheless, in India, they live only for the pleasures of the moment. The hippie scenes of dancing, drugging and drugging are really wonderful and precise in their tone (I'm old enough to remember them), and I'm pretty sure the masses of white little children are really extra hippies, I remember. Listening to children in the caravan to the East doing this type of work in Bollywood. <br /> <br /> (It is not about the true Hare Krishna movement, although the hippies of the film sing a song of Krishna / Rama, as does a group of real Indian devotees, not related to the hippies, in the initial scene of the movie. <br /> <br /> ~ Virginia
