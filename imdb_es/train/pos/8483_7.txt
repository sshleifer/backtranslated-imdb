It is difficult to evaluate this or any other comparable movie from the era of the initial sound in terms that one could use for comments from common movies. Sometimes there is almost a desperation, as many silent film personalities try to sound their wings, probably fearing that they will be left on the road (as it happened with some), Rin-Tin-Tin. However, it was perfectly natural. In a vaudeville of unrelated sequences, some of them stressed that the soliloquy of John Barrymore of Richard II is a moment worth keeping. In general, only those with training in the previous stage exuded confidence. However, this is mostly reasonably entertaining, and is a must for "movie lovers" especially interested in the transition from silence to sound.
