Of the films of the young republic, few in number like The Buccaneer (1958) stand out as a finely crafted film. Charleton Heston excels in his portrayal of the Old Hickory defense of New Orleans with a militia force, regulars and pirates promised a respite. <br /> <br /> After the Christmas of 1814, the veterans of the peninsula led by Sir Edward Packenham, the duke of Wellington's brother-in-law sank in the city of New Orleans. Andy Jackson had a day to gather the strength of a scratch to defend the city behind bales of hay. <br /> <br /> Charlton Heston projects the terrifying presence of Jackson and his inspiring command power. However, there is some colorful comic relief. With the power of the English lioness about to jump, a young blonde voluteer from New Orleans asks: I guess the commotion is about to begin. <br /> <br /> The battle was about to explode, but not for long. Faithful to training the British, they marched directly toward the blazing American fire. In less than a few minutes they tried to thwart the lost US territories. <br /> <br /> The scene of the battle in this film lasts a little longer than the battle itself. <br /> <br /> There are colorful secondary stories in this film of the young volunteer at his first dance to celebrate the victory.
