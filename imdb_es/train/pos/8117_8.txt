The first time I saw this movie on New York television was 40 years ago, and I thought it was a depressing look into the future. Wells sees the restriction of private liberties as something good. ("no private planes." The film's over 30-year war was the reason why this film was not shown to British filmmakers who wage war.) The concept of the future and the Korda and Co. concept of The future stars are the true stars of the film The best performance is that of Ralph Richardson as the Boss A combination of Winston Churchill and Edina from the comedy series Absolutely Fabulous It is interesting to note that the Boss's negative personality is Something similar to The Time of War Churchill.
