I had nowhere to go. I was on a flight to Vancouver. I would probably have missed this movie if I had not chosen Air Canada. Looking at a small screen on the back of the seat in front, I found this captivating and fascinating. I moved in a couple of places and had to back off, but I had to watch until the end. Now I look forward to the release of the DVD in Europe, although it has not yet been discovered if I will be so paralyzed when I can go out the door. <br /> <br /> The photographic composition is impressive and the film provides a lot of information and "completes" the story that the photographs tell. <br /> <br /> Recommended (if you have time available).
