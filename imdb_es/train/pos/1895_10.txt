I observed it during the Christmas period, I do not know why, but it reminds me of Christmas, so I saw it, so here we are. <br /> <br /> Arthur is a film that I see until the end with a big silly smile on my face and it's a mixture of special performances, excellent happy music and a script full of wit and charm that causes it. <br /> <br /> Dudley Moore creates a character that could very easily be hated (drunk, rich, lazy drunkard who feels sorry for himself) but makes him someone you love. Liza Minelli is great, since Linda Morolla, a waitress of queens who manages to achieve the hard / soft inside, the lady for whom Arthur almost abandoned his world. John Gielgud gets all the juicy lines and polishes them with pleasure. <br /> <br /> I can see Arthur again and again and it always makes me feel good, check it out if you need an elevator, it's a lovely movie.
