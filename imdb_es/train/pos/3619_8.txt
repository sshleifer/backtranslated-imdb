Despite Disney's best efforts, this is a pretty nice movie about how to follow your dreams. I was surprised that I did not seem too sentimental; This movie played fair. Dennis Quaid was very, very good on paper, which says something for a sports movie. I can not remember how many sports movies have had small whims that bother me; Here, everyone looks at the part. This movie is surprisingly good and I predict it will do amazing business, since it is a G-rated movie that does not require the viewer to stop thinking. Ebert on the contrary, this movie is a success.
