The man on fire was hot. I love a classic tale of good revenge, and what better revenge cause than the kidnapping of an innocent girl. <br /> <br /> The writers did an excellent job in this film of building the relationship between Creasy (Denzel Washington) and Pita (Dakota Fanning) so that the viewer could really understand and feel the impulse that Creasy had to rescue Pita. It was also good that Creasy was not a type of choirboy trying to rescue Pita through the "appropriate" channels, but he used torture tactics and street intelligence. Some may say: "Torture is wrong, it does not matter", and you may be right, but when you see the pain that Creasy is going through due to the loss of Pita and the great passion it has to recover it, you can not leave it aside. With Creasy and pull to make it even more ruthless. There would be no progress if Creasy used diplomacy to deal with different gang members and criminals and he knew that. <br /> <br /> The search for Creasy ended with the return of Pita to his mother and Creasy dying in the vehicle of the bad guys. But the death of Creasy did not diminish the effectiveness of the film, in fact it improved it to show that Creasy was willing to die to recover Pita. His death was noble indeed. <br /> <br /> Denzel does an excellent job just like the writers. This movie deserves good grades because it was definitely a good movie.
