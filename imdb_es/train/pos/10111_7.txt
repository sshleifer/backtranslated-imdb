The enchanted world of Edward D. Wood, Jr. is not a particularly good documentary. Aesthetically, it has a lackluster and cheap aspect, the people who are in it shoot off on tangents that make it very unfocused and cohesive, but this adds to its charm. I say this because it is a documentary about a weirdo who made rare photos and surrounded himself with other strange bugs and, as such, there is no other way to document the life and career of the man and his team of misfits. There are some glimpses of understanding of both the genius and the ineptitude of Wood, and the portrait of both qualities is a credit to the authenticity of the documentary. In general, it's worth a watch for Wood's fans and movie fans in general, but do not expect the glitter here. Wait for a documentary made according to Wood's heart.
