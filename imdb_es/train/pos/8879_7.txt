*** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> This movie always seems very exaggerated, until I remember that my university campus had a former student turned into a Nazi-racist-murderer-who-then-committed suicide, too : His name was Benjamin Nathaniel Smith. <br /> <br /> Look for it in the wikipedia, I added some photos to your article about it. <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe, but this really happens. <br /> <br /> I'm not a big fan of Omar Epps or Ice Cube, but Larry Fishburne, Kristy Swanson, Jennifer Connelly and Mike Rappaport were good.
