I'm afraid it was a movie that you MUST SEE REALLY to get something out of it. It's not a meaningless movie like ... "LEATHAL WEAPON PART 58" Do you know where Riggs is really crazy? It is not a film that is practically the same at the end, since it is a principle. You can run everywhere, talk on the phone, do anything and enjoy it in any way. In the past, I've noticed that the majority of people who do not like this type of movie are the ones who do most anything other than watching a movie and then closing is because ..... duh not what They understand neither they understand it or what happened. <br /> <br /> DO NOT LET YOUR ACCOUNT BE A SHOWER !!!
