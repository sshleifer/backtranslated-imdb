This great Marvel superhero game pays homage by staying true to comics. Of all the Marvel superhero games that have been so boring with weak graphics and gameplay, Spiderman improves in both departments. It also features the voice of Stan Lee, the creator of Spiderman comics. <br /> <br /> As expected, Spiderman does whatever a spider can do. He does more than make cobwebs. In fact, he uses them as weapons and shields. When he does not use the web in combat, he also hits and kicks. Spidey has his hands full as he fights Venom, Rhino, Mysterio, Scorpion and Dr. Octopus, to name a few. Look for Captain America in a cameo. <br /> <br /> Most of the levels are challenging, but some of them require patience to overcome. The only complaint about this game is that it is very short and can be completed in less than three hours. If you are a true fan of Marvel superheroes, this game is for you, but do not expect a long game. Better luck in "Spiderman 2". My evaluation: 9 out of 10.
