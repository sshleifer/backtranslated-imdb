Let me clarify one thing: for the most part, the mindset of those who run the show in Hollywood, frankly, sets me off in a general way and even more specifically in relation to their treatment of the most beloved iconic characters in the world. Pages of comics. Why? Well, let's take a typical scenario of the meeting of the Hollywood executive board to illustrate, will we do it? ... <br /> <br /> Executive n. 째 1 'Hey, there are many dollars that can be obtained from superhero movies these days.' <br /> <br /> Executive no.2 'Good point, let's do one in a hurry then! ?? We will make a lucky dip in a hat and choose a random superhero to base a movie! (The dip takes place and a famous superhero name is taken out) <br /> <br /> Executive n. 째 1 'Great! Now, to whom can we play the role? <br /> <br /> Executive no.2 'Who is a big box office star right now?' <br /> <br /> Executive n. 째 1 * name of the great actor * is what is in this week '. <br /> <br /> Executive no.2 'But does it really fit the role? I mean, it does not look like the character at all. <br /> <br /> Executive n. 째 1 Who cares? He is a great name; We'll make the movie with him anyway. <br /> <br /> Executive no.2 'You're absolutely right! And in addition, we will fill the entire film so full of dazzling special effects to appease the moronic masses that nobody will question it anyway! "<br /> <br /> The above scenario clearly illustrates one of the reasons why they generally detest the most modern superhero films, all style, no substance and just pathetic casting of iconic drivers. , there are exceptions to the previous rule, when Hollywood does it well, it takes the casting of the original Superman (and still easily the best!) Christopher Reeve and, more recently, Patrick Stewart and Sir Ian McKellen in the X-Men movies . <br /> <br /> But going back to the general negative traits that Hollywood shows today, would not it be wonderful if our studio executives ALWAYS chose actors that really fit the roles? Well, in this world less How ideal, a filmmaker simply believes it or not, by choosing actors based on their genuine resemblance to their comic counterparts.Her name is Sandy Collora.Lamentably (but typically) Hollywood has not yet allowed I went to Collora to direct a feature film, but fortunately for us, he gave us a tempting look at what the final result would look like in the form of two (so far) famous ones. super hero short features. One is the magnificent Batman: Dead End and the other is this mock trailer of a completely fictitious movie called Worlds Finest. <br /> <br /> Well, let's not say anything here. This is absolutely incredible! <br /> <br /> The casting of the winner of Mr. Universe and the male model Michael O'Hearn, (who looked just as impressive but who was completely lost in the mediocre Barbarian) is the most perfect option to play at iconic man of steel. In fact, in terms of physical similarity, there has undoubtedly never been a closer approximation to the comic character. <br /> <br /> Added to this, Clark Bartram returns from his splendid performance as The Dark Knight in Batman: Dead End; Again, another piece of extremely judicious casting! <br /> <br /> What can I say? ?? I wish this was really a long movie! Hollywood studio executives ?? take notes! This is how it should be done! <br /> <br /> As a final note, once again I am intrigued by the widely divided reactions that this short film has evoked on the part of the fans. In a revealing way, the most aggressive and vehemently adverse reactions against him appear clearly once again (as with Batman: Dead End) of a younger audience with less cinematic experience; a fact betrayed by its grammatically primitive discourses and its liberal use of basic diction. Such an unfortunate state of closed-mindedness is, in fact, a sad phenomenon, although one of the executives of our study mentioned in Hollywood, which will undoubtedly obtain great satisfaction. After all, these same wrong individuals are, in all likelihood, the same kind of CGI junkies, the popcorn stuffed imbeciles who revel in most of the garbage that Hollywood produces from the flood these days.
