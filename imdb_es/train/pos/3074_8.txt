I recently came across this little gem of a film on cable. Although I was surprised, I should have expected it from the team involved in this movie. <br /> <br /> Henry Bromwell directed this movie with a sure hand, and it shows. One always wonders about the secret life of the death killers. One does not have to go too far to realize that they are probably their own neighbors, social acquaintances, or even friends; They are not different from us, at least on the surface. <br /> <br /> In this story, the grandfather is a despicable character who does not hesitate to eliminate anyone for the right price. He has no scruples in teaching the ropes to his own son, and even to the grandson! <br /> <br /> Alex, is a man who lives in confusion. He knows what he has done in the past and suddenly he is realizing the consequences of his actions. He has to see someone to help him find peace with himself. When you go to Dr. Parks, you are trying to find absolution, although you can not find it there. On the contrary, there is a dramatic turn when Alex finds out who he is supposed to kill next. <br /> <br /> Alex, brilliantly played by William H. Macy, fascinates us. Not only is he a fantastic actor, but he makes us believe that he is that man. One of the best things about the movie is the late John Ritter. He is as convincing as Dr. Parks, the man who unravels the mystery. <br /> <br /> Donald Sutherland, since Grandpa is perfect. He is a natural actor in everything he does. Neve Campbell surprised in her pivotal role of Sarah. She shows a capacity and range that are incredible. Tracey Ullman is Martha, the wife who suffers, and she can not do much. Also Barbara Bain, in a rare appearance, is the grandmother of hell. David Dorfman, is a delight in the movie. It shows a maturity beyond its years. <br /> <br />
