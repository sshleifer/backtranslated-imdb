I saw this movie as a girl and it broke my heart! No other story had such an unfinished ending ... I grew up in many great anime movies and this was one of my favorites, because it was very unusual: a story about injustice and cruelty, and loneliness, and life, and choices that can not be undo, and the need of others. Chirin is only made when the wolf kills his mother, but the wolf is also alone when Chirin follows him to the mountain. The wolf does not kill the lamb, although every night it says "maybe I will eat you tomorrow". The tape that I have is broken and degraded by age and use. I will repair it, I will see the film again someday and I will cry as loud as when I was a child. Stories like this, with this depth and feeling, and this complexity of meaning, are very rare. It's a sad story, but I've never found such a beautifully made catharsis. I'm glad I saw this movie, and I'm glad I saw it when I was a kid.
