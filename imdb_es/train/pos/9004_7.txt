I had my doubts about another love story in which disabled people find meaning and redemption through honest communication. And it's still not at the top of my list. But the performances of Helena Bonham Carter and Kenneth Branagh and copies, almost impressive, and rescue this to be just another shooter of tears. Carter's representation of a victim of ELA is strong, perhaps even exaggerated at times (sometimes his dialogue dissolves into indistinguishable murmurs). But the overall effect is commendable and rewarding. Branagh can be the perfect complement to his performance. <br /> <br />
