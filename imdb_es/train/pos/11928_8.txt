This film, although apparently based on a movie of the same title in 1951 released by MGM and starring Janet Leigh, is still a great movie. Danny Glover, in one of his best performances, gives life to George Knox, a fall of luck in his baseball career with a moderate character. As for this "stacked" movie, what do you think about adding Christopher Lloyd (his theatrical experience works and is seen in his screen performances, a wonderful actor), Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Third rock of the sun), Brenda Fricker ( a lovely and well-seasoned Irish actress), Tony Danza (yes, even he is good in this movie), Matthew McConaughey (he stole the show in Dazed and Confused, and his role may not be so fundamental in this film, but he had exhibition), Adrien Brody (what I said about Matthew McConaughey is the same for Adrien, except for the part Dazed and Confused), some great characters like Taylor Negron (David), Tony Longo (Messmer), Jay O. Sanders (Ranch Wilder ), Neal McDonough (Whitt Bass) and an experienced veteran in one of his final performances, Ben Johnson (Hank Murphy, the owner of the California Angels), and the rest of the cast do a great job, plus a great story that elevates the beauty. Much to anyone, I do not care in what recess of depression you are. I loved this Movie like a child, and it brings back memories when I see it today. I need this on DVD. I recommend it to any parent who is looking for something that their children have not seen, and to all others, for that matter.
