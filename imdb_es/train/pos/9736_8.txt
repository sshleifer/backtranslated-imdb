Pegg has had some successes in recent years, starting with "Shaun Of The Dead" in 2004, movie about "Hot Fuzz 2007", in early 2008 he came out with "Run Fat Boy Run" and now this comes. "How to lose friends and alienating people ", which in many ways is one of my favorite comedies of the year. <br /> <br /> The film is about Sidney Yound, a man who writes a failing magazine that teases mainly celebrities. Because he is not one of them. Anyway, one of the owners of most successful magazines (Played By Jeff Bridges) invites him (Out of nostalgia) to work in his magazine. Sidney, of course, is excited and moves to the United States; There he meets a girl who currently writes a book, and hilarity occurs. <br /> <br /> This movie is great and I hope that in the near future there will be more. Pegg once again has given people everywhere another good movie and I can not wait to see the third part of the trilogy of blood and ice cream "Paul". I rate this movie 81%.
