With Tony severely injured in an induced coma, two things happen: Tony imagines himself leading the life of a salesman who attends a business convention, while his family and friends go through hell trying to cope with the possible loss of the great man. The dream sequences are the result of an old episode of TWILIGHT ZONE, since Tony finds himself transformed into an average Joe who tries to deal with a lost wallet and a mixed identity while on a business trip across the country. . His intonation as a jacket and a khaki suit is more American and less of an Italian thug by Noo Joisey. A good touch. The amazing AJ with long, hippy hair (whom Paulie calls "Van Helsing" at one point) has a good scene with her elderly comatose. The best time is that the big boys try to talk about life without Tony, which immediately becomes a territorial dispute. Vito deviates from the line that Gene, the new dead, could have been a closet case, which is interesting in light of what we are about to learn about Vito.
