Jeremy Brett is simply the best Holmes of all time, of course, beating the great Basil Rathbone, and this is probably the best adaptation of a short story by Conon-Doyle. <br /> <br /> A length adaptation includes some new lines of the plot that fits well with the surrounding drama and increases the hatred one feels for Milverton. <br /> <br /> The excellent performances all over the world, especially Robert Hardy, and both Brett and Hardwick are completely complete and comfortable in their roles, which makes it a magnificent piece of drama.
