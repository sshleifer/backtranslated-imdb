Madhur of CHANDNI BAR started making realistic films, which some people called dry <br /> <br /> He made SATTA, which was another realistic but cinematic movie, but a great movie <br /> <br /> The men of AAN at work they were a film formula of his that failed <br /> <br /> He returns with his superlative PAGE 3 <br /> <br /> A film that lives in the lives of journalists and is a brilliant film <br / > <br /> The film is well told, although you could avoid the romantic portions of Konkana by half, but that is forgiven <br /> <br /> The whole track of Upendra Limaye is also excellent <br /> <br /> while the track of Atul Kulkarni is also great <br /> <br /> The dial between Manoj Joshi and his friends are funny at first, but sometimes they are repetitive <br /> <br /> The secondary argument of Bikram- Tara is brilliant, like the whole hospital scene and also the final child abuse that surprised you e <br /> <br /> The film has an open ending that is well managed <br /> <br /> Madhur does a great job Music is fine <br /> <br /> Konkana stands out like crazy havi, use his expressions to the fullest Tara Sharma is decent, except his voice Sandhya Mridul is good as always Upendra Limaye excels in his part as a policeman, one of the talented actors Unfortunately it is not well used today Atul Kulkarni is also good in His little part , Boman Irani, is restricted and does a great job. The rest is fine.
