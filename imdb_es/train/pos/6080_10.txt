Othello, Shakespearen's classic story of love, betrayal, lies and tragedy. I remember studying this story in high school; I actually thought that Othello was probably my favorite Shakespeare story because of how fascinating it was, the fact that Shakespeare captured the feeling of friendship, love and racism perfectly. I mean, when you really study this story, you could delve into so many philosophies about why Othello went crazy with jealousy in the blink of an eye. But later for my report I also saw this version of Othello and I have to say that it was absolutely brilliant. Lawerance and Kenneth simply capture the story so well and understand that it is darkness. <br /> <br /> Othello is the great soldier of his city, he is loved by everyone, including the king. But when the king discovers that Othello slipped away with his daughter, Desdemona, the king became enraged, but excepted him. Othello is welcome in the city and makes his best friend, Cassio, his partner instead of Iago, who has supported Othello. Because of his crazy jealousy, it's for revenge. Still pretending to be Othello's best friend, he simply insinuates to Othello that Desdemona is cheating on him with Cassio, he never says he is, he just makes Othello think it's happening. Othello goes crazy and has no pleasant plans for Desdemona, or Cassio, and Iago is more than happy to help him. <br /> <br /> Othello is an incredible story, I recommend you read it. It's an amazing story that keeps you thinking after you've read it. Othello, the movie is also great and, once again, I recommend it, captured the story perfectly and has a great feeling of tearing, or you could just be in total shock of what happens between Othello and Desdemona, how quickly believe that it is true. Love would betray him. This is a great movie, a great performance, good scenarios and a good direction. This is what Shakespeare meant when he wrote the story. <br /> <br /> 10/10
