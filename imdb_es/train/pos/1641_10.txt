I saw this 25 years ago on PBS. It was very difficult to see. So real. Seeing this little family fight in the winter was heartbreaking. There is no time to court: fate has united us and we put our shoulders on the wheel and make it work. This was based on the real woman's diary, which I read many years later. She said in her diary that her parents died when she was little and that all her annoying and sisters had to work on the farm to feed themselves. She learned to cut, she was not like a lady. He was afraid that no charming prince would like a woman with calloused, sun-tanned hands, but this husband was so happy that his new wife knew how to mow the lawn, and she was happy to do so. Both were widowed and together they worked to build a new home. It was so, very sad when the baby died. Of course, if they had it today, I'm sure it would have been fine. That alone makes the tragedy sadder. I was crying so hard. But then they went out and successfully got a new calf. Spring is on the way, and life goes on. In her diary, she had two more children and they lived.
