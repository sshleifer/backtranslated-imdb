I saw this documentary at the Cannes Film Festival, in a small 200-seat cinema on top of the main building of the Cannes Film Festival. <br /> <br /> Absolutely interested me. I love the mix of incredible fiction scenes. It is an incredible set set. The scenes seem really filmed in 1920 or 1930. <br /> <br /> And the music is very good. <br /> <br /> I qualify this experience on 9/10. <br /> <br /> * spoilers ahead * <br /> <br /> The documentary talks about the incredible men of Blues, with black and white scenes of the black man playing the guitar and singing. It's really amazing. But this also mixes into new bands and that is perhaps something that I might not like in this documentary. It's too much use of links to modern rock bands that play those Blues songs in a modern way. I really did not appreciate his shattered way of playing such incredible Blues songs. This is the same type of non-perfect musical taste that I found upon seeing the Social Club Buena Vista by Wim Wenders. <br /> <br /> The documentary was a great ovation in this first screening in the small cinema, which next The day this documentary was shown for all and normal tourists on the beach of Croisette in the open-air cinema . Although the sand, the quality of the projection and the poor sound quality probably made the experience difficult for the thousands of people sitting on the sand that night to enjoy.
