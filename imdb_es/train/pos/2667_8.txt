I was never a big fan of horror movies. Usually, they try cheap tricks to scare their audience like loud noises and spooky kids. In general, they lack originality and contain excessive overreactions. The only horror movie I like was Stir of Echoes with Kevin Bacon. He was well acted, and he had a great story. But it has joined and perhaps even surpassed by Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, possibly the most terrifying movie in history. <br /> <br /> The film follows a writer (Jack Nicholson) and his family who agree to guard a hotel while it is closed for the winter. There were rumors that the place had been chased and the last resident went crazy and murdered his family. But Jack is convinced he will be fine and can use silence to overcome his writer's block. However, after months of solitude and silence, Jack becomes grumpy and then violent. Is it cabin fever or is there something in the hotel that is driving you crazy? <br /> <br /> One of the most spooky parts of the film is the sense of isolation that Kubrick creates. The hotel is very quiet and the rooms are huge, but they are always empty. It is also eerily quiet when Jack's son is riding his bicycle through the arid corridors. The performance of Jack Nicholson is also one of his best performances, frightening me and making sure to leave from time to time. My favorite scene is when he is talking to a ghost from inside a refrigerator. <br /> <br /> The Shining is the best for horror movies in my opinion, beating the snot of shit like the Ring and The Blair Project Witch. It may be an oldie, but it's definitely a goodie. 8/10
