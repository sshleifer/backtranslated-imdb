WOOHOO! What - a - movie !!!!!!!!!!! I'm not a fan of contemporary Italian directors. Normally I do not like dramas. I'm not a Will Smith super fan, even thinking he's a very good actor ... but this movie! It's a great movie with such an original script and such good direction and so well acting ... wow ... it's awesome. This movie captured my attention minute by minute and I did not even like "The pursuit of happiness" (maybe also because I did not like the performance of Will's son, who is a very bad actor, while children generally seem all the Naturally born actors, He also last night on "The day the earth stopped" and confirmed my feeling that Jaden can not act, I do not want to write spoilers and, therefore, I do not talk about the story, but what I can To say is that this movie talks about Love, Death and other feelings that I do not like to see in movies ... but THIS MOVIE is a great movie, if you have a minimum of heart you will not regret having seen it.
