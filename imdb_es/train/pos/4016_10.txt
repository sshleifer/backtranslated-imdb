This wonderful little film has all the elements that made the Spaghetti Western so exciting and fun: GREAT music (by one of the few ... if not the only ... female composer who works in the genre, Nora Orlandi) , EXCITING sequences of action (and very vicious for the day!), And BEAUTIFUL landscapes and scenarios (all in Almer√≠a, Spain, of course). It also has a very good story with a beautiful tragic romance. The actors do wonderful works, with really outstanding performances by Lawrence Dobkin and Rosalba Neri (in the most vital role for a woman in a Western Spaghetti ... outside of Cardinale in Leone's "Once Upon a Time in the West"). Without publishing spoilers, let me say that this movie contains one of the best endings of any movie I've seen!
