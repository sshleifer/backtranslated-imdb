This is, in my opinion, a very good movie, especially for lovers of Michael Jackson. It contains a message about drugs, impressive special effects and an impressive music video. <br /> <br /> The main film focuses on the song and the music video 'Smooth Criminal'. Unlike the four minute music video, it is a normal speed and, in my opinion, much easier to see. <br /> <br /> However, the plot is quite rare. Michael Jackson plays a magical 'gangster' who, when he sees a shooting star, becomes a piece of machinery. Throughout the film, it transforms into a race car, a giant robot and a spaceship. <br /> <br /> The robot scene in particular is a bit strange and strange. I found it a bit out of place compared to the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> A child is kidnapped, Michael tries to save it, is tortured and beaten, and suddenly becomes a giant robot that exploits all the bad guys. Bit strange? Yes. <br /> <br /> But besides the strange robot scene, it's a very good movie, and any Michael Jackson fan will enjoy both the Smooth Criminal music video and the movie.
