This is a great movie! I've played all the Nancy Drew games and I've read the books, and I never expected the movie to be so exciting and fun! If you've never heard of Nancy Drew, read the first book (Secret of the Old Clock) so you can get used to Nancy, then you can watch the movie, because in the movie, they do not really present the characters. Quick names;) All my family enjoyed it and the plot was extremely interesting. This is the last comeback of Nancy Drew's previous films, which Nancy Drew's actor did not seem to match. This movie is very similar to Alex Rider: Stormbreaker. It's so good! Nancy Drew lovers, you must see this!
