The American icon Henry Fonda plays the "elegant" John Howard, an elderly truck driver who has recovered his beloved big rig "Eleanor" after a long stay in the hospital that forced him to lose his payments. Deciding that she would like to make a more perfect career, she leaves the hospital, steals Eleanor and hooks up with old friend Penelope Pearson (Eileen Brennan), who needs to relocate her group of prostitutes. <Br /> <br /> The wonderful performance of Fondas is a natural anchor for a movie that pulls on the strings of the heart with the same efficiency that tickles funny bone in the funniest scenes. A magnificent cast that includes Robert Englund, as a young and reluctant partner, Susan Sarandon (who also gets co-producer credit), and Dub Taylor (a delicious ham, as always, in the most brazenly comical part of the picture) immensely. br /> <br /> The nature, in the last instance, affirming the life of the image and the intensity of the trip have an incredible weight; This is an image that, as long as it is incorporated, you can remember it long after it ends. <br /> <br /> Here the promise of the open road is vividly displayed; the field looks beautiful With the wonderful music of Craig Safans, it is an extraordinary image in terms of aesthetics. <br /> <br /> Lose something in its final act (the characters played by John Byner and Austin Pendleton are little more than intrusions), but still maintains its good vibes thanks to the appeal of its central characters. <br /> <br /> It's not at all the lock / drive-in schlock image that one might expect from the title (especially its alternative title, "The Great Smokey Roadblock"), it's a rewarding movie experience that I can recommend unscrupulous. <br /> <br /> 9/10
