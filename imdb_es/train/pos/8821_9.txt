The question is, can such an entertaining film really be considered a "bad" movie? My husband and I picked it up at a 99 cents video store simply for the title and for the fact that the box had the words "Vestron Pictures" (Vestron has been highly regarded as a quality brand since I started. ). Acquired the legendary films "Suburbia" and "Class of 1984"). We did not expect a movie as full of victories as this one. The basic plot is as follows: Grange, this goombaesco thug on planet Earth, steals "the shore of the Moon" and is sentenced to a penal colony on a remote planet (I do not even remember the name of the planet) to mine for bauxite and other minerals. The "governor" of said colony and the owner of the mine are exploiting the prisoners for work. Walker, a bounty hunter (apparently one of only three in the entire planet) reminds the prisoners that there is no escape, because there is only one ferry that leaves the entire planet and they would have to deal with it. Then there is the anonymous "Colonel", a retired bounty hunter who suffers a recurring nightmare. Much of the film focuses on "futuristic" car chases (dunebuggies with plywood stuck to the sides) with explosions in abundance. The planet itself looks suspiciously like Hemet, CA or one of those other dusty Inland Empire. But what really makes the film shine is an amazing soundtrack with several Los Angeles punk bands from the mid-80s. I seriously doubt that this soundtrack has been pressed to vinyl, but it's definitely worth buying the movie just for the soundtrack I can not even remember the names of the bands (they are listed in the credits) apart from Exploding White Mice, because that was the only one I had heard of before watching this movie, but I am definitely investigating Them. <br /> <br /> Basically, the film is definitely not a waste of time and would be best enjoyed with a pack of 12 beers and some of your closest friends.
