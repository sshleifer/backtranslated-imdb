Well: participate in the film shootings, a great presentation, the vehicles are really fun to drive, a very attractive multiplayer, faithful to the movie, and the list goes on. <br /> <br /> Bad: the main missions are a bit short. <Br /> <br /> This game defines what a "good" third person shooter is (not necessarily a spy game). The big shootouts continue the story and make you want to complete ALL the individual missions and unlock all the genuine bonuses offered by the game. The enthusiasm that this game had, was at the height, and personally I think you should buy it, connect with a couple of friends and play this. Too much fun. <br /> <br /> The sound in this game, is a great success of some previous bonus games, and shooting a gun, it really feels like you're firing a gun. It is related to the aspect that you are a deadly and ruthless spy. <br /> <br /> In general, this game makes you excited and satisfied after you achieve it, and some multiple players who can compete with the standards of the James Bond game "Nightfire" for gamecube.
