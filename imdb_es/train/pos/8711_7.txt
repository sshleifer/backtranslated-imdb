I am beyond my comprehension that so much garbage from Norway has been remastered for the DVD release, and even so gems like this do not have the chance to recover their past glory. I give it a 7, not because it is very good, but because it is one of the few SciFi films made for Norwegian television. This film is nothing less than a historical gem of cinema that, in many ways, presages the first Alien film. And, my word, Blindpassasjer was the first! Did Ridley Scott or someone from the crew watch the miniseries? However, unlikely, the fact is that the scenes are extremely similar. Granted, the budget is much lower in the Norwegian film, but because of that, it's a really good job from the desolate era of Norwegian cinematography, which certainly lasted until the 1990s.
