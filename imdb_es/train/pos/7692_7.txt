First, I will give my rating for the series in general; ******* 7 out of ten stars. I've taken three for the downhill descent that suffered this series after John Amos left. Do not get me wrong, there were episodes of hard knocks later, but only after Esther Rolle left for a season and came back. <br /> <br /> In February of 1974, a great sit-com was released (with dramatic overtones). CBS First it was a television program, a program about an African-American family that lives in the Chicago Projects in the 1970s. Created by Norman Lear as a derivative of "Maude", once again he played the right chord with the viewers. <br /> <br /> Not since this show I have seen a situation comedy that speaks directly about the struggles of families in the center of the city. (Well, there was Fox's "South Central" in '94, but it was not renewed.) <br /> <br /> John Amos as James Evans Sr. was the definitive father figure for this family and acted as any father should keep <br /> <br /> Esther Rolle was a wonderful nonsense mother figure who was in the same page as her husband when it came to the education of their children. . <br /> <br /> Ralph Carter as Michael, a young but very bright for his age, but he is stuck in a school system that does not meet his academic needs. The name of his character is the same as the founder of the program, Mike Evans, who was Lionel Jefferson in "The Jeffersons". (Mike Evans died in December 2006). <br /> <br /> Thelma is a young woman of 16 or 17 years old and has to deal with the dangers of being a young woman on the streets of the ghetto. Jimmie Walker as J.J. Evans Jr. is the typical jovial young man who does not take life seriously. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, all my favorite episodes are with John Amos, with the exception of the Penny Arguments of Gordon / Janet Jackson. <br /> <br /> After the disappearance of the character of James Evans, the program lost its stability and the spectators left. Esther Rolle left for a whole year, not wanting to play a supporting role in the "Dyno-mite's" of JJ's smart-aleck! <br /> <br /> He returned next season, after getting a guarantee that the writer could make up for things. Florida's neighbor, Wilona Woods, was a divorced woman who ended up adopting a battered girl, Penny Gordon (played by a 10-year-old Janet Jackson). Penny's abusive mother was played by Totie Fields, the mother of Kim Fields. <br /> <br /> In August of 1979, the show came to an end, and everyone left the projects for a better life. JJ, the artist, had sold an idea to a comic book company, Michael went to live on campus at the university. <br /> <br /> Wilona & Penny, Thelma and her husband, footballer Keith + Florida, moved to the same building in the residential area of ​​Chicago. It is not the most realistic ending, but at that time it did not matter anymore.
