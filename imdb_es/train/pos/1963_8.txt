We begin all our comments with the following information. My wife and I have seen almost 100 movies per year for the past 15 years. Recently, we are honored to receive lifetime movie passes for any movie at any time at no cost! So we can see what we want when we want. The point of this is that the CRITICS count for ZERO. Your local critics or national critics like Ebert are not really different from you or me. The only difference is that they write about the film and are forced to watch hundreds of movies, whether they want to or not. Therefore, we believe that if you get the value of your money for two hours of fun, it's enough for us! We NEVER listen to or read critics. We only care about our friends and those we know as the same things we do. Pretty good about it. <br /> <br /> This movie is very good. Not only good but very good. Critics are a bunch of idiots. Only because there is nudity and language they hated it. It was worth the price of the ticket and that is all you can ask for. Is not that right? Each film can not be nominated for an award from the academy. Sharon Stone is beautiful, she does a great job in the movie and it baffles me about what the critics want.
