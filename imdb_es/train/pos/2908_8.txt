A journey of discovery, this film follows the life of a family that lives in an island city and quiet in British Columbia. Languid and dreamers, the inhabitants are content to allow life to continue around them until a young teacher with a fresh face, with new ideas arrives and brings her with her life from the continent. Little by little, his indolent state wakes up, the father (and the director of the local school) seeks emotion, the mother for stability, the eldest daughter for love and the youngest for power. While it is not an incredible or innovative movie piece, the film is quietly nice and good for a tired night when the wind blows. Unfortunately, I doubt that anyone outside Canada will find it easily accessible.
