First, DO NOT call this a new version of the movie '63. Although this version is more faithful to the play, it is extremely long. The casting was good with some exceptions. Chyna Phillips was not a good casting choice. He was almost 30 when he made this movie, and it was hard to believe that she was a teenager. Jason Alexander was a good choice, but after a while he gave me a headache. Tyne Daly exaggerates her part as Mae Peterson. George Wendt was funny like Harry McAffee, and he showed that he could even keep a melody. Like the movie of '63, they released a stranger to play Conrad Birdie. Marc Kudisch had fun with his role as Birdie and showed himself. I even have the soundtrack and I love listening to her singing. So what made this a failure of TV ratings? It was long for one. They put in new songs and scenes. Even though some of the new songs were good (like "Let's Settle Down"), was it really necessary? Now do not get me wrong, I liked it, but I prefer to watch the movie '63 (see my review). This was only the case of some actors who exaggerate roles, make some changes and, once again, LENGTH. One more thing I forgot to mention is Vanessa Williams. She does a good job with paper and music. Give her any letter and she could sing them. So this is my advice from someone who has done a couple of productions of Bye Bye Birdie: If you want to see an entertaining interpretation of the work, look at the '63 movie. If you want to see a version that is more faithful to the game, see version '95. But take it with moderation. Do not be a hero and try to see it all at once.
