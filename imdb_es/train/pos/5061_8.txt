it is worth seeing, especially with the good touch of a journalist with integrity, you expect a great history story while Gray Owl is unmasked as a fraud, but it is not and adds to the theme and drama generally optimistic and uplifting. Of the story and the movie. <br /> <br /> This has to be Brosnan's best performance to date, he admires it admirably as the English boy who plays the Indians. The outstanding scene is the return to your? Aunts? where Brosnan and the two old actresses create a wonderful scene full of feelings of nostalgia and a lost life with so little dialogue, only with expressions and good direction. Perfect. <br /> <br /> The story is so little known and the message is so universal and so important that it is a real shame that this film has not been better recognized, maybe with time it becomes a classic and a sleeper . Hope so. <br /> <br /> Well done, Dickie Attenborough and the cast.
