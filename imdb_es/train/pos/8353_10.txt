I remember seeing this movie as a child in 1977 or 1978. HBO showed it late at night when they were the only and only movie payment channel that existed. Back then I did not have a rating and it was the only movie of its kind that was shown on pay TV ... especially back then. I would love to see him now as an adult in which he would be more willing to understand his adult theme. It was probably the closest thing I had seen to pornography at the early age of 7 or 8 years. Fortunately, I had stupid babysitters and parents partying on weekends. Most of my memory of this movie was the completely erratic sexual behavior of these two guys. To burst into the houses to smell the underwear, to feed on the breast milk of a stranger in a public bus and to fornicate in a taxi at the request of one of his subjects were just some of the adventures these guys were carrying out. A very hot movie for the early 70s. Until I checked IMDb, I had no idea that this movie had so many followers. Most people I talk to have never heard of that.
