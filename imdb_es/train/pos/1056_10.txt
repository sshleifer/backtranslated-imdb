How someone can say that this is bad is beyond me. I loved this show before I even saw it. For 3 reasons, 1. The story intrigued me, 2. Jessica Alba and 3. James Cameron! Ignore the negative comments and watch the first full season before deciding it is bad because I know that if you see it in the first season, you will LOVE it and buy season 1, as well as season 2 on DVD and then join the Campaign to achieve season 3! <br /> <br /> I hate Fox and I am sure that many of you, the fans of "Dark Angel", also hate them. They have one thing for Canning Good Shows! Are not they all in agreement?
