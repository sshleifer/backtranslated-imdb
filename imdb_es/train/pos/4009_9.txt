Children, of any age, do not want to know about their parents' sex lives. And adult children often feel seriously bewildered and bewildered by any evidence that elderly parents have an active libido. Finally, many viewers feel very uncomfortable seeing a dowdy and disheveled widow who would go unnoticed almost anywhere, discovering her capacity for pain and the need for a raw passion with a handsome man half his age. <br /> <br /> "The mother" is a provocative look at a reality that has been poorly filmed: a woman who is not ready to stay at home, watch "TV" and vegetate after her husband for almost three decades, and a dominant and dominant type that dominates him, packs him up with a huge heart attack. <br /> <br /> May (Anne Reid) and her husband have two children, each dysfunctional in their own way. The son lives with a beautiful wife who could well take him to the Bankruptcy Court with his extravagant commercial enterprise. Paula (Cathryn Bradshaw), is a teacher with aspirations to succeed as a writer. She is attractive, not pretty, and seems to have a close relationship with the mother, at first. <br /> <br /> Back at her house after burying her husband, May decides not to stay there. Rejecting the typical widowhood with his legacy of boring days and without adventure, he will stay with Paula, who has a young son. Paula's boyfriend, Darren (Daniel Craig), is a sturdy and handsome contractor who seems to be taking a long time to complete an addition to the house of May's son. May is completely occupied with Darren, who drinks cocaine and drinks cocaine, whose treatment of Paula should have alerted May that he was undoubtedly a member of the Royal Academy of Cads. <br /> <br /> What follows is a torrid relation between Darren and the widow who is crazy and who now lives with bubbles (dare I say that she is reborn?). The scenes of love are graphic, but they occupy the second place in the ink and pen sketches of May by the amateur artist, who then play a role in the surrounding drama (or debacle, choose). <br /> <br /> The theater in Manhattan was ready for today's afternoon, with more than half of the audience in the May age range. That some were surprised or disturbed to see her undressing with an erotic abandonment in the arms of a much younger man is an underestimate. <br /> <br /> This blinding and sincere look of an older woman's awakening passion after decades of dutifully obeying her husband's desire to stay at home and raise their children (also mentions that he did not like I had friends, what a boy) a series of problems arise. While Darren's alliance with May does not constitute incest, there are real psychological dimensions and problems, with a mother who sleeps with her daughter's lover. And Paula is not made of the strongest things to begin with. The issue, once disclosed, allows the opening of the mother-daughter relationship that, from Paula's point of view, leaves something to be desired. Mrs. Bradshaw is excellent in the role of a daughter who wants the support of her mother and her love; Life has not given her a terrible hand, but neither is it a bed of roses. <br /> <br /> May is strong in her resolution both to recognize her sexuality and to expect, indeed demand, a future of happiness. But she is also inevitably vulnerable. She is fishing in unexplored emotional waters. Who controls their relationship with Darren and why are problems difficult to understand for her, much less to solve them. In its sixty years, it is still a work in progress. <br /> <br /> "Something's Gotta Give" recently showed a mature sexuality but in a funny and antiseptic way ensuring that no viewer feels uncomfortable. After all, it is Jack Nicholson and the always beautiful Diane Keaton who delight in the world of the rich. And to make sure no serious psychosocial problems were explored, Keaton's young girlfriend, Amanda Peet, Keaton's daughter, not only blesses the party but also ensures that the audience knows that she and her old (or potential) lover never jumped to field. Coat. <br /> <br /> It's not easy here. The inspired performance of Anne Reid causes discomfort in some at the same time that she feels respect for others. His naked body is full of sexuality for some and seems absurd as an object of physical attraction for others (the comments of the members of the audience that left today reflected all these opinions). <br /> <br /> Congratulations to director Roger Michell for tackling a fascinating History with enthusiasm and empathy. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
