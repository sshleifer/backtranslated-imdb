Even though this movie came out a year before I was born, it is definitely one of my favorite comedies. It stars Redd Foxx as a father who tries to understand his son's homosexuality. Like most parents, he knows nothing about what it means to be gay and has all these stereotyped notions of what homosexuals are like. His son, Norman, has now grown up and lives alone. When his father, Ben, discovers that his son is gay, he visits his son in the hope of changing him. The title comes from one of the funniest lines in the film: when Ben arrives at Norman's apartments, he meets a prostitute and thinks that it is his son who is dragging ("Norman ... Are you?"). The movie made me laugh from beginning to end. Redd Foxx is great. Although much of the content is stereotyped, I did not find anything offensive in the way the material was handled, and it even has a good ending. Highly recommended
