My parents took me to this movie when I was nine years old. I have never forgotten it. I've never seen anything as beautiful as Elizabeth Taylor before. (He was twenty-two years old when he did Elephant Walk) Remember, I have nine, so the feelings are not sexual, I just could not see anything else on the screen. I just wanted to sit at his feet like a puppy and stare at him. She has begun to show her age (she is almost seventy-four years old), but I still believe she is one of the most beautiful and impressive women in life. <br /> <br /> I've seen the movie several times. Since then, and it's a sappy melodrama. What saves it is, of course, the beauty of Miss Taylor, her magnificent landscapes, the impressive stampede of elephants and a well-made point about human arrogance in the face of nature. <br /> <br /> In short, a well -I've spent a couple of hours watching the movie channel or a rented video.
