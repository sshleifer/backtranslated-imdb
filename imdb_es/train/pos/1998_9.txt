In Cinema Retro # 2, it is revealed that Mark Lester's voice was actually doubled by a 20-year-old female, Kathe Green. Although Leste was considered perfect for the lead role, director Carol Reed was not entirely satisfied with her singing skills. The secret was revealed in a 2004 UK documentary entitled "Oliver! After They Were Famous." Greene was paid 400 pounds for his work and had to agree to keep his participation secret, as did Mark Lester. They kept their word and only revealed this fact as part of the television program decades after the release of the film. For the record, Mark Lester retired from acting and is an osteopath practicing in England.
