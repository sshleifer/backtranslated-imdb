He could not understand why Jeremy Irons felt the need to exhibit a very disconcerting accent, spoken through clenched teeth, and from the back of his throat. In fact, he rather ruined the film for me and distracted me from what was probably a good performance from him (very annoying). No other actor or actress seemed to have such a pronounced accent and although I have always described Jeremy Irons as a good actor, I would not classify this film as one of the best. However, the film has whetted my appetite, as have some of the other comments made in this film, which I find very interesting, and I intend to read the book now.
