Well, before we review, I have to ask: why does not this appear individually? It may have been just a television article in Italy, but for the international fans of Lamberto Bava this is their own FILM. In the United States, this film is distributed on VHS and DVD as "The Ogre" or "Demons 3". Yes, I know it has nothing to do with the "Demons" other than a cast member and crew. But yes, I was personally annoyed that this was so hard to find on this site, that it is otherwise so useful. <br /> <br /> Finally, let's review "The Ogre." I've seen the trailer of this many times on YouTube and I honestly found it quite scary. The film itself (it's the length of the feature, so it's a movie) has many strong parts and manages to scare. I disliked the last act, but in general I do not regret having bought the DVD before seeing it (available on Shriek Show). I guess the television origins of the movie explain the last act. I will not deliver any spoilers. <br /> <br /> The plot is something familiar: an American horror writer who spent her vacation in a ghostly old castle with her husband and son only to discover that it looks exactly like the nightmarish scene of her childhood. There are faint echoes of "The Shining", but this is a different mark of supernatural horror. The woman (Virginia Bryant) finds more and more evidence that this is the real-life place of her nightmares, but her husband will not believe her. They follow great atmosphere and terror. <br /> <br /> The multiple sequences of nightmares were quite strange. The ogre's cocoon effect was good, it reminded me a little of Uncle Frank's resurrection of the first "Hellraiser." There are also some good crashes and a well done underwater scene. I give them elements that the film never bent to imitate American films with similar concepts, namely, "A Nightmare on Elm Street". "The Ogre" is an original. And the monster itself was terrifying, when it presented itself correctly. <br /> <br /> On the Shriek Show DVD there is an interview by Lamberto Bava in which he is careful to mention that this is not part of his classic "Demons" series. It also gives a lot of credit to the royal castle where the movie was filmed. In fact, this adjustment contributes a lot to the movie. The music of Simon Boswell also helps. <br /> <br /> There are many good things here. "The Ogre" is not perfect, but it's worth seeing. Taking it is a minor achievement of Lamberto Bava.
