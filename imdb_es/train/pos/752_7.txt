Four teenagers in a suburb of Los Angeles get into all sorts of problems: parties, drugs, police, confused parents, older boyfriends. Jodie Foster, a sort of mother hen of the pack, tries to keep everyone together as "one family" (like the family unit she has never had), and the heartbreaking movie is that she can not. Slowly, everyone grows and leaves. THIS precise plot point, although underlined in everything, is unfortunately manipulated. Did we really need a long sequence with Scott Baio overtaking a car full of thugs on his skateboard? Or an even longer sequence, also with Baio, where Foster has a strange soliloquy about the "pain of illusion". In fact, part of the dialogue is totally crazy, and I did not much care for an edition at the end of the film that passes awkwardly from a death to a wedding. But these are small mistakes in what is basically a very sensitive story about the loss of a close bond. And Jodie's face at the end says a lot. If the viewers choke at the end, the film has earned it. Does not please tears nor asks for sympathy. It shows us an example of friendship and hopes that we understand. *** since ****
