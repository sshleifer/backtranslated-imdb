Some war movies succeed where others do not, and that can be judged from a variety of angles. The humanistic angle, one in which you can feel the raw emotions (the terror of being under attack, the camaraderie among soldiers, the arduous trials that people face within them when they are in combat, etc.) are always movies that They seem convincing. Movies like Das Boot and A Midnight Clear are just two examples of films in which you feel a connection with the characters in the film. <br /> <br /> This movie is also successful at that level. Talk about "The highest honor" and that honor is doing the right thing. These 23 soldiers did the right thing, were honored and recognized in a way totally incompatible with Western thought, but it is, to the end, a true story of honor. Unforgettable movie Based on a true story.
