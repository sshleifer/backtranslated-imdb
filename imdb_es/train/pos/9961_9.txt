I must give How She Move an almost perfect rating because the content is really excellent. As one previous reviewer commented, I have no idea how this film was found in the list of the last 100 of IMDB! That is absolutely ridiculous! Other films, particularly those that share the theme of dance, can not offer a candle to it in terms of its combination of the best quality, a credible performance and amazing dance routines. <br /> <br /> From the beginning Completing the underlying story (it's not just about winning a competition) is very easy to delve into and is surprisingly realistic. None of the main characters of this is two-dimensional in any way and, at the end of the film, it is very easy to feel emotionally involved in them. (And, even if you're not the type who cries, you might get a little whiny before the credits come out). <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend this movie to lovers of dance and, even more, to those who can appreciate a moving and well-acted story. Of course, How She Move is not perfect (what movie is it?), But it's definitely a cut above movies that use pretty faces to hide a half-baked plot and / or characters that lack substance. The actors and the stages of this film make a very realistic journey that is equally fascinating thanks to the incredible talent of the dancers!
