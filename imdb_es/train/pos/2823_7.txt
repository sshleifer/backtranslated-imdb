['MGM was not sure how to market Garbo when it first came to Hollywood. Mayer had a lot of faith in her and his appearance in &quot;Torrent&quot; justified it. She did not speak a word of English, so it must have cost her to work, and Ricardo Cortez did not make it very easy for her. <br /><br /> The torrent of the title is the river Juscar that meanders through a quiet village in Spain. Leonora (Greta Garbo) hopes someday that her voice will bring great wealth and happiness to her parents with difficulties. Leonora and Don Rafael (Ricardo Cortez) are in love, but he is under the control of his mother and can not make her accept his marriage. Meanwhile, Do√±a Brull (Martha Mattox) has evicted Leonora&#39;s parents from her home and sent Leonora to Paris with the hope of giving her the opportunity to continue her career as a singer. Leonora sends a note to Rafael, urging him to remember his promise and accompany her. His mother is angry and forbids him to go, so, of course, he surrenders at her request. <br /><br /> Years pass Leonora has a new identity: she has become La Brunna, the toast of the Paris Opera. Rafael has become what his mother wanted: he is running for office and courting a &quot;safe&quot; young woman, Remedios (Gertrude Olmstead), who is a &quot;pig&quot; heiress. Mack Swain plays his father. Leonora decides to visit her old home and I agree, why has not she helped her mother? Her mother still lives in the family home, works understory and washes herself. Leonora and Rafael meet, but Leonora is full of ridicule. Garbo is so charming that it&#39;s hard to believe he could be happy with Remedios. <br /><br /> The dam bursts and the torrent is flooding the city. Leonora&#39;s house is in the path of the raging river, but when Rafael tries to rescue her, he finds that she is quite safe. Then they rekindle their romance. There is a &quot;horizontal&quot; love scene in this movie, very similar to &quot;Flesh and the Devil&quot;. <br /><br /> Dona Brull is spreading gossip about how Leonora really got her wealth and Leonora&#39;s mother believes her and tells Leonora to leave. Rafael meets Leonora just before she is touring America. Once again, he tries to go with her, but disappoints her again. He spends so much time listening to other people destroy his reputation: &quot;What will she do for you, but will she drag you down?&quot; The irony is that she has just got him a high position in the government if he comes with her. They meet again, years later, she is as fresh and vibrant as ever, she looks older than him, inclined to mediocrity. <br /><br /> It is definitely a good movie with a positive message to follow your heart. <br /><br /> Lucien Littlefield does a good job as Cupid, the barber and the old and faithful friend of Leonora. <br /><br /> Highly recommended']
