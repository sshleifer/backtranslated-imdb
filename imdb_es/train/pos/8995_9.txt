I could not find anyone to see DiG! with me because nobody that I knew was a fan of any of the bands. Naturally, everyone assumed that you can only enjoy this movie if you like the music of The Dandy Warhols or the Brian Jonestown massacre, but this is far from the truth. The only requirement is that you have an interest in music and / or pop culture in general. The way in which the races of the two groups are parallel is a perfect representation of the ways that a band can take, and seeing the public eat and spit at the Dandy Warhols is fascinating. I agree with other critics who mention that it would be good to receive one last word from Anton himself, as he is clearly represented as his worst enemy and the bulwark of the band's ability to simply remain. <br /> <br /> The most interesting thing for me is the respect of Dandys for BJM (despite his lack or reciprocity) and for Anton (despite his erratic behavior). The Dandy Warhols respect the art produced by the group, even if the group hates everything the Dandy Warhols represent (although that is debatable). The best phrase is when Dandy's drummer says "I'm not going to have them anywhere new for me again" and the guitarist unconsciously lets out "Even so, I'll buy his records". For me, this only shows how powerful good music can be. <br /> <br /> See this movie definitely, even if you do not know anything about any of the bands. It's more about the themes of rock music and how they develop, which makes this movie so interesting. It's weird to follow a group so closely for so long.
