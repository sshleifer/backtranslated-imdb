La Buena Tierra is a great movie! Everyone should see ... It is heartbreaking and very moving. It is aimed at improving the formation of values ​​in the perseverance, humility and love of the family ... History may be related to our current life, especially that poverty is on the threshold. The way we respond to this problem is very important and if a person is not strong enough to face it, it can be helpless and useless. I am very happy with how the characters justified their roles, even the young actors ... Their emotions have captivated the audience. It is possible that the film was made in black and white, but the story is so captivating that it does not want to end. That makes it really great! There should be a new version of this very beautiful movie.
