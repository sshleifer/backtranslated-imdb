I totally disagree with the other comments posted on this movie. For example, the movie is based on the book and if the writer had a gay character, then how could "Hollywood" simply include a gay character in the movie? And there were also two gay characters and I thought they reflected very well. One was normal and the other was more feminine, but it was not exaggerated. And Diane Keaton gave a wonderful performance and if the other reviewer had the decency to watch the whole movie, they would have seen that her character developed throughout the film interacting with the other characters. For example, when she and Adam went to look at the car in which Sara crashed in the junkyard, you could see her maternal side and, later, in the film, you saw that she was also invincible. But I guess if you're too worried about the gay characters and the characters with flaws, this movie is bad. But if you have a more open mind and I do not know if I really have any idea of ​​what is good, then you will enjoy this movie.
