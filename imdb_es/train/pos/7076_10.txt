A very strong movie. Bruce is good and Brad too. <br /> <br /> As I think there are two lost cities on the list of receptionists on the list that Bruce remembered. <br /> <br /> That means that the woman was a real insurance and She did her job. <br /> <br /> Well, Novikov's property seems to me to work in this movie. However, I do believe in Going back to the future theory of the multiplicity of worlds. <br /> <br /> So Bruce could save the world, but not his world. <br /> <br /> In the theory of parallel worlds man can find himself alone. <br /> <br /> And I think there's no problem with that. Here I do not agree with Dr. Brown of Back ... <br /> <br /> But the story of 12 Monkeys has its own beauty. Despite all these theories of a world or of many or continuous, one can believe that he is really crazy and that the doctor, his girlfriend, has just lost. <br /> <br /> A sequence of events that may lead you to believe that it is from the future. The bullet, well, it could be a mistake, some falsification. <br /> <br /> Well, I like this movie, you have to buy a DVD. <br /> <br /> The best.
