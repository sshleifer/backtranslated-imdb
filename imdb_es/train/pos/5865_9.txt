I saw this on cable in the early 90's and I loved it. I never saw him again until he appeared on the cable recently. I still think it's a great movie from Vietnam. I'm not sure why he's not better qualified. I found everything about this compelling movie. As a veterinarian (not from Vietnam) I can relate to the situations raised by Harris and De Niro. I can only imagine that this movie is more moving now with our situation in Iraq. I want this to be offered on cable more often so that people see it. The human cost of our soldiers does not remain on the battlefield. He is brought home for the rest of his life there. And this movie is one of many that brings that house in a very difficult way. Excellent movie
