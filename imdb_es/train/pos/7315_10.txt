Classic, very influential low-budget thriller that gave rise to an icon of horror and launched the careers of both director Carpenter and star Curtis. <br /> <br /> The seemingly unstoppable killer escapes from the mental institution and returns to his hometown where he begins to stalk a local nanny on Halloween. <br /> <br /> Halloween is a movie that never fails to live up to its reputation as a horror masterpiece! The terrifying story and the intelligent direction of Carpenter give this film a life so chilling that it must be seen to really feel it. The direction often consists of such simple elements, shadows, dark streets, screeching doors, that make even the everyday environment of a small-town neighborhood really creepy. Carpenter overcomes his suspense and shakes to make them the most effective and amazing, that in itself is a feat that many horror filmmakers never achieve! Also, he's wise enough to give us some really nice young characters and a very scary villain to keep the tension even stronger. The highest congratulations also go to Carpenter's simple but at the same time alarming music score. In a sense, Halloween is a good example of a perfect horror movie! <br /> <br /> The cast is excellent. The young Jamie Lee Curtis performs very well as the adorable nanny Laurie Strode, she is so good that she could move on to other horror movies before going to bigger movies. The great Donald Pleasants has a perfect performance as Myer's doctor, who is desperate to capture him again. The cast Loomis, Soles, Castle and others are also good. <br /> <br /> So, like your own villain, Halloween is an unstoppable force that never ceases to excite and relax. It is a must for all fans of the genre! <br /> <br /> **** of ****
