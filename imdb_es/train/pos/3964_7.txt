It seemed to me that the history of the FBI was quite entertaining and adequately optimistic for my New Year's Day vacation. His drama and action-packed episodes were exciting. The character of Hardesty was well drawn and admirable. In general, the photography, script and direction were perfectly creditable. Instead of considering the film a disgusting propaganda, as some might have it, I enjoyed it as a well-mounted representation of the need for resourceful minds and brave bodies in the fight against crime. Again, the representation of a family that stays together, even under the pressure of the husband's commitment to his (possibly) important work, did not seem to me a representation of two, but an ideal and exemplary one.
