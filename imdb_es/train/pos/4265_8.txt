If you have not seen this charming little charm, you should look for it. It is the story of a sad wartime sack (Fred MacMurray) that appears on the 4-F list every time he tries to join any branch of the army. Find a magic lamp that, of course, contains a genius (Gene Sheldon), but the genius is even more clumsy than MacMurray, sending him through time to serve in all the wrong places and places that he wants. It's cute, cheerful and pure, and you can not help but like it. The plots are much like a Disney movie, particularly because the two stars (MacMurray and Sheldon) made numerous Disney films in the 50s and 60s, though not together. It goes without saying that everything ends well for everyone, and the viewer is feeling pretty good.
