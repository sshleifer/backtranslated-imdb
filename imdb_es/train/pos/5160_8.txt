Dr. McCoy and Mr. Spock are trapped in the Ice Age of a planet, while Captain Kirk is in the colonial period of the same planet. However, it is the former couple who has the most difficult time. In addition to the freezing temperatures and the sanctuary found only in the caves, there is a third inhabitant, the beautiful and very sexy Zarabeth (Mariette Hartley). As Spock spends more time in this era, he slowly begins to return to the behavior patterns of his ancestors, feeling a natural attraction for Zarabeth and throwing "caution to the wind" about the possibility of leaving this place. With only the constant "reminders" of Dr. McCoy, Spock clings to a bit of reality. <br /> <br /> This is one of the few occasions when the character shows some "emotion" and Nimoy (Spock). plays up to the hilt, approaching to take out the bejesus of Deforest Kelly (McCoy). Surprising of the previous installment, Captain Kirk (William Shatner) could not obtain the girl, another advantage for this one. <br /> <br /> The "old" perennial Ian Wolfe plays the role of "Mr. Atoz," the librarian responsible for sending the trio into the past.
