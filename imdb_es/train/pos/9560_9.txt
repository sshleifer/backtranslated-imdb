['The truth is that I first picked up Ranma 1/2 when he was about twelve years old. I was in the library and desperately looking for something good to read. Then, I went to the Comic / Manga section and saw this book. In my first readings of the chapters, I did not really know what was happening, but I knew that I LOVED. I even took it home to read a little more. Frankly, I was not getting anywhere. And then, about five months ago (now I&#39;m 16 years old) my friend was watching some anime series and I remembered about this manga. I could not remember his name, but I remembered that the author was Rumiko Takahashi, creator of Inu Yasha. I looked it up on Google and then I made a hasty decision to watch the 161 episodes. At first I was surprised by the 1990s graphics, but in the end I did not care. No anime has made me laugh so much and rewind, see again. I once saw 45 consecutive episodes in a day. I do not know how I did it ... but I could not stop. Finally, after about two days, I became obsessed. I even dreamed, as crazy as it sounds, to see Ranma. I have never found a series so funny, so funny and so touching to watch. To this day, 161 episodes are not enough to keep me satisfied. Of course, the end of cliffhanger was enough to make me go crazy, but the series alone was enough to keep me reading. <br /><br /> Ranma 1/2 is about a boy named Ranma Saotome and his father Genma Saotome. Intense martial artists. They are so intense, they went to the old training camps in China and became &quot;cursed.&quot; The grounds were full of different spring pools, and if you land on one, you take the form of what was drowned there when sprayed in cold water. For Genma, that was a PANDA, and for Ranma it was a ... girl! It is a very funny and loving story. On top of that, Genma promises his friend that Ranma will marry one of his daughters to keep the Tendo dojo alive. &quot;Of course, he who compares himself to hates his guts and mutual feelings, obviously, they start to like each other, but they are stubborn to admit it, but ... Genma has a history of doing this.&quot; He promised many girls to Ranma. <br /><br /> Trust me. Worth seeing. It is humorous, moving and all incredible.']
