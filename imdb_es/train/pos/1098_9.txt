Modern viewers know this little movie mainly as the model for the new version, "The Money Pit". The older viewers today see it with knots of nostalgia: Cary Grant, Myrna Loy and Melvyn Douglas were "superstars" in an easier and less complicated era. Or was it? Time, of course, has a way of changing perspectives, and with so many movies nowadays totally fascinating with political and social commentary, there is a natural curiosity to ask about the controversy in the older and apparently less provocative films. In "Mr. Blandings builds the house of his dreams," there may be, therefore, more than what audiences sought in 1948. There are political commentaries, albeit subtle. Finding a house in the late 1940s was a truly exasperating experience, only slightly softened by the arrival of Levittowns and the like. The politics in the movie? The children of Blandings always seem to be talking about progressive ideas that are taught in school (which in real life would cause teachers to be accused of communism). Also in real life, Myrna Loy was a housing activist, a democrat and a feminist. Melvyn Douglas was no less a fanatical Democrat: he was married to Congresswoman Helen Gahagan Douglas, whom young Richard Nixon accused of being soft on communism (and that ruined her). Jason Robards, sr., Has a small role in the film, but his political activism was no less remarkable. More importantly, his son, Jason Robards, jr., Would for many years be a very active liberal democrat. Cary Grant, the curious conservatism, reflected a majority political sentiment in Hollywood that was already slipping. But this was 1948: communism was a real threat and the blacklist was just around the corner. It would be another decade before political activism reappeared in conventional films, and then not so subtly.
