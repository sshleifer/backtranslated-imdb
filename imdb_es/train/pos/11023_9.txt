The selection of Sylvester Stallone to play the protagonist by Renny Harlin is commendable, since Stallone is that kind of tough and rugged person who had previously lent the audacious and versatile aura needed for the characters of Rocky Balbao and Rambo. But comparing the series Die Hard with Cliffhanger is a crazy idea. <br /> <br /> The opening scene, excellently elaborated, introduces the audience to the emotion, suspense and intrigue that will envelop them in the bloody and dangerous consequence. Encounter with the outlaws. The theft and transfer at high altitudes of cash in the cases of sticks from one plane to another is something that has not been filmed before. <br /> <br /> The spicy cold of the snowy Alps and the deceit and betrayal that develop between the antagonists The forces make one tremble with uneasiness. The forces of incredible adventure and ruthless murder make the drama come to an end. <br /> <br /> Good movies are not made every year and people do not get a feast for their eyes to see from time to time. Apart from the dirty language / language that generates a shameless emotion during certain scenes, the film can be considered as one that will not fade its captivating appeal even after seeing it after so many years.
