This excellent drama held me in suspense all the time. I could not take my eyes off the screen for a second because each word continued to connect the pieces to this disconcerting murder. This movie really touched me because it showed how sad and hard life can be. I really cried at the end (which I do not want to give away!) It also allowed me to realize how cruel and unhealthy people can be when it comes to murder. <br /> <br /> The cast was also very good. The only member of the bad cast was the actress who played Anne Marie. The actress did a great job, but the director did not do it. I say this because he found someone who did not look anything like Anne Marie Fahey.
