This is one of the many cartoons with Bugs Bunny and Marvin the Martian, and also includes a space dog named K-9. This episode of Looney Tunes is very funny, has a pretty good cartoon animation (Marvin's animation is very well done) and the plot is well done. The end is pretty weird, so be prepared, it's a bit boring. <br /> <br /> In this episode, Marvin the Martian has been sent to Earth to capture a terrestrial creature and return it to Mars. With his reliable dog K-9, Marvin leaves and soon finds the tracks of no other rabbit other than Bugs Bunny! He greets them with treats, thinking that they are tricks or treaters in their disguises. Little does he realize that they are preparing to take this rabbit to Mars ... <br /> <br /> I recommend this episode to anyone who likes Bugs Bunny, Marvin the Martian and Looney Tunes in general. As far as the beginning and the middle of the episode are concerned, you probably like this. Enjoy "Hasty Hare"! :-)
