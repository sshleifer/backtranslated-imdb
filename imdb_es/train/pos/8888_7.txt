This movie started slowly, then gained momentum towards the middle. However, the fact that the film lasted two nights broke that momentum in its heyday. The second part really got interesting, but then gave way to a simply pathetic ending. Playing soccer in the playground? Really, could I be more sappy and maudlin? Now I listen to plans for a similar movie based on the 70s. I will not make any great effort to tune into that if it's something like "The 60s".
