Creative visual epic inimitable style. <br /> <br /> This film may not have the most alternative dramaturgy or the most artistic performance. But who dares to say that this movie is not art? I am not in favor of the idea, that an important film should be serious, not commercial or that bothers me with questions. There are even many movies, suitable for these attributes, which I like. <br /> <br /> Bogus Journey, of course, is not one of these movies. What you get is pure and excessive creativity with a very positive charge, infantile energy. This movie does not reflect reality. He is friendly, naive and utopian. Imagine the world of the future described by Rufus: for me it would be a good combination of time and place to live! Except for that music; -) <br /> <br /> Technically, Bogus Jorney is very well done. I have always liked the cinematography and landscapes of this film. Especially at this point, Bogus Journey leads its prequel by far. Also the effects are good, and I think most of them are very done without CGI. I usually prefer the good old effects in big budget movies. Surely it's 'just another Hollywood movie' out of sight of some towns. But I think this is in a very charismatic way. <br /> <br /> A short word to the soundtrack: the whole band and the orchestral music fit very well into the film. Also the sound design is not missing. I'm not a big fan of rock music, but I had to get this song from Winger on the scene. The "station" builds the account and ted robots in the van. I love unorthodox camera work in its beginning. <br /> <br /> Let me conclude by saying this: <br /> <br /> This movie is very naive and very imaginative! It is much better than Panzerkreuzer Potemkin, The Godfather, Eraserhead or Aguirre, the wrath of God. It's absolutely superior to kane citizens, apocalypse now or chris sans soleil markers ... ... it's even better than Total Recall ... no way !? Yes Yes! <br /> <br /> Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey is simply the best movie ever made. <br /> <br /> Anyone who dares to disagree becomes guilty of "artistic behavior" or likes Terminator Salvation (What is the biggest self-defamation?) <br /> <br /> PS : Part 1 is not the best movie. So Bogus Jorney is a superior sequel. Not even Terminator 2 is a superior sequel! It is not!
