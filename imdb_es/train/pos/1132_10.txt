It's the best imitation of Hollywood Daytime soap operas! It's the fun we never see. Great characters and great lines. Whoopi is hilarious ... Sally Field is so exaggerated ... The lines of Gary Marshalls are a riot ... this is what I love about good comedies. I was never afraid to make fun of themselves !!! The sets were great ... the costumes were in place and the stabbing "Montana Morehead" was a diabolical delight. Terri Hatcher as "Dr. Monica Demonico" did not have enough lines, but she was still beautiful and funny when she was on the screen. I would love to know how the idea of ​​this film came about. I've never seen a cast of people have so much fun making the comedy work! Soapdish is a must have and I am waiting for the DVD !!!
