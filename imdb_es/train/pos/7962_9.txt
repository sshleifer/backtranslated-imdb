Very few called "remakes" can be as good as the originals. He crosses that border with flying colors. Only a new version, I do not believe it! I watched it theatrically at the age of nine, and I was completely fascinated and captivated by the movie. <br /> <br /> The film certainly invites comparisons to its 1963 counterpart. The previous film is also an entertaining and entertaining film, but it is true that it tends to feel more like a documentary about nature than a movie. This update is more epic and cinematic. Still, I recommend both films. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely a must for animal lovers. We have the wise old Golden Retriever, Shadow; the sharp and sarcastic cat of the Himalayas, Sassy; and the young and fun-loving American Bulldog, Chance. The animals have a brilliant voice from Don Ameche, Sally Field and Michael J. Fox, respectively. <br /> <br /> There is virtually nothing offensive in the movie. There is a bit of eschatological humor, but nothing extreme. Without violence, it saves some tense scenes involving a cascade of blows, an angry porcupine and a dark railroad pit. <br /> <br /> Hilarious, scary, touching and above all real, I was surprised to see that this movie won no awards, not even one. However, I will have to say that this is as good as some of the Best Film nominees today.
