My Tutor Friend is a well-written romantic comedy movie that has something similar to My Sassy Girl ... there are no kissing / sex scenes. Hollywood should learn more from Korean productions. Sex is not always required in a good romantic movie. <br /> <br /> The film is cheerful in tone with occasional CG cartoon scenes mixed in the film. I like the part when Ji-Hoon almost kissed Su-Wan. The funniest moment is when Ji-Hoon punched Su-Wan's first love because he left Su-Wan for another girl and will soon be a father. The way he became a father was revealed in the next scene, which brings smiles to the audience. <br /> <br /> Mao Points: 8/10
