Being an impressionable young man when experiencing the Gundam Wing series for the first time, when I saw the series again, I confirmed again my belief that this series is not only beautifully animated, but also the plot, the gundam design, the design of the Character and the depth of the character are masterful. executed. Although at the beginning it appears as a boy band, the attractiveness with style of the characters can be attributed in part to a great art, with individual personalities that create clear and attractive distinctions between the characters. Consequently, it is extremely easy to become a particular character. Personally, I liked Heero because of his stoic personality. While I may be predisposed with a sentimental attachment to this program to my childhood, I can objectively say that Gundam Wing addresses the deeper issues of war and life in general (how can we get peace?) While providing action-packed battles in great robot costumes. , which, to say the least, is excellent.
