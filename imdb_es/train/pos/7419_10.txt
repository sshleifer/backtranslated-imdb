Based on the preview I had seen, I went to "Shower" expecting a sweet little comedy; What I found was a deeply moving drama of family life told in some of the most exuberant photographic images I have had the privilege of seeing. In addition, the later reflection made me appreciate the abrupt cuts to the scenes of the past (in the arid field of the north of China and in the plain of the Tibet): is not this how the memory works often? In one moment I am here, the next I am in a landscape of the past, so ... <br /> <br /> I would not only recommend this film, but I would place it between the two. or three of the best movies I've seen in my 60s. <br /> <br /> By the way, a couple of years ago, another Asian "comedy" premiered in the United States as "Shall We Dance?" (Japanese). As with "Shower," the preview gave no indication of the depth of the film, which turned out to be a subtle psychological study (albeit full of fun moments). Is there any fear on the part of the distributors of making the films seem too "important" or "deep" to attract the viewers of the US?
