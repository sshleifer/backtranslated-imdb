I immediately noticed that this movie was not really based on the novel by Dodie Smith. In any case, it was a good idea that Pongo and Perdita's son now had his own puppies. The cutest Dalmatian was, of course, the little snowball that was completely impeccable until the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I did not know what to think when Cruella de Vil seemed to have changed completely friendly. In fact, I have often thought about the possibility of her becoming friendly, but now that she quickly became "herself" and announced that she was Cruella once again, I almost began to really worry about Chloe Dalmatians. <Br /> <br /> Actually, the scene in which the puppies looked at Lady and the Tramp while Chloe and Kevin were having dinner, was much better than I expected. I also liked the parrot that played to be a dog, and it was amazing that dogs have learned so many tricks for this movie. <br /> <br /> Of course I was glad that in the end the Dalmatians were saved again, but I would have liked to know what would happen to Cruella after having lost all her property. And what the hell could the dog house do with such a huge sum of money? <br /> <br /> Finally, it was quite moving that Snowball also had spots at the end of the film.
