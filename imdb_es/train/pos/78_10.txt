['Although it has one of the standard &quot;vengeance price plots&quot;, this movie is my favorite of Vincent Price&#39;s work. Gallico has that quality that is missing in so many horror movie characters: sympathy. When you look at him, you feel for him, you feel his frustration, the injustices against him, and you encourage him when he goes for revenge, even if he scares you a bit with his original fury. As the film progresses, your character becomes tragic. He has committed his murder, but now he must kill to cover up that. And again to cover that. And again ... your stomach sinks with your soul as it descends in a spiral, like watching a beloved brother turn into a hood. Even if the story of revenge is old, the devices of the plot are original: Gallico uses his tricks to kill in increasingly inventive ways. A pity that this is not available to see the house.']
