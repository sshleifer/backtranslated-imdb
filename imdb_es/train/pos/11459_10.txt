On one level, this movie can take out the child that is inside us that only wants to build sandcastles and throw things into the air just to see it fall again. However, on a deeper level, it explores a deep desire to reconnect with the earth. I completely sympathized with the artist when he said: "When I'm not out (alone) for a long time, I feel uprooted." <br /> <br /> I considered Andy Goldsworthy as one of the great contemporary artists. . I am familiar with his works mainly through his coffee tables and a couple of installations of art galleries. But seeing his work in motion, captured perfectly through the lens of Riedelsheimer, was a revelation. Defrosted in time, Goldsworthy's creations come alive, spin, fly, dissolve, crumble, crash. <br /> <br /> And that is precisely what it is about: time. The process of creation and destruction. Of the appearance and disappearance. To leave the Void and become the Universe, and come back again. There is a shamanic quality about him, on the verge of madness. He gives you the sensation, observing him at work, that his art is a vital force for him, that if he did not, he would perish and perish. <br /> <br /> Luckily for us, Goldsworthy is able to share his vision through the media of photography. Otherwise, with the exception of a few milestones and walls, they would only exist for one person.
