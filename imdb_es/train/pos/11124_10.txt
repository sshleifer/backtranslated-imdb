THE SOPRANOS (1999-2007) <br /> <br /> Number 1: TV show of all times <br /> <br /> Everyone thought that this would be a stupidity that would not go through a pilot episode. The Sopranos have become a cultural phenomenon and universally accepted as one of the best television programs of all time. <br /> <br /> James Gandolfini plays the enigmatic New Jersey crime boss Tony Soprano, accompanied by a star cast. Edie Falco is excellent as the caring and loving mother of the upper middle class; Tony Sirico is tremendous as a superstitious and grizzled consiglieri who is often very funny. <br /> <br /> While the program has often been criticized for the negative stereotype of Italian-Americans as mobsters, and to some extent this is undeniable, I can see many positive aspects of the program. The representation of strong family values, friendships, love and compassion; Could I be present in a rude TV show about gangsters? Yes. In addition, other burning issues are discussed, such as terrorism, social inequality and injustice, homosexuality, drugs, etc. This is not a superficial and boring show about tough guys and violence. It has much more. Many of the problems we see in the program are very real. <br /> <br /> The writing that has been quite large has infused the current problems with such success and has managed to integrate them into the lives of the characters, which makes everything more interesting. <br /> <br /> Credit You must go to David Chase, who has created an excellent television treasure, and to James Gandolfini, for his vision, the most complex and enigmatic character of television. <br /> <br /> Simply exceptional. <br /> <br /> 10/10
