Outside the house there is a different world and the family struggles to step on the line between the authority of the parents and their hopes and dreams. <br /> <br /> The period is captured; The Bakelite light turns, the Georgian floor, the picture rails, the wall paper, the short skirts, the cheeky boys, the mini van, the bright modern mangroves ... <br /> <br /> The location is captured; A windswept glacier ravaged a rocky landscape, local stone walls, community, freedom. <br /> <br /> But there is much more; Childhood, happiness, sensuality, pride, values, freedom, authority, rebellion, violence (in the deepest sense), love, struggle, puberty, naivet√©, moral, trust, faith, deception, machismo, manners, maturity, loss, poverty . Sacrifice, horror, acceptance, revelation, comedy and fatherhood are there. (And in no particular order!). <br /> <br /> This movie is a very rich expression of the family tensions that are as relevant today as ever. The fact that some of these are not addressed directly is a testimony in itself of the attitudes of the day, but the fact that everyone is here is a testament to the ability to act, history and direction. <br /> <br /> If there is something wrong with this movie, it is that all this deeply rooted and wonderfully represented tension is swept a little too much towards the end. Maybe I do not understand it well: the sadness and sadness that many teenagers feel really disappear if they take care of it (**). Maybe the movie is trying to send even that message, it's worth doing. <br /> <br /> What is the movie trying to say? Children: Parents were also young, parents also fight, everyone makes mistakes, everyone learns, things change, the fight can end happily. Parents: Do not try too hard! Try to remember that your support is the key to your well-being. <br /> <br /> It sounds simplistic, is not it? Sometimes the movie feels that way too, but it is when you realize how much it is challenged and discovered. <br /> <br /> The movie is a classic. <br /> <br /> (**) - No The problems themselves.
