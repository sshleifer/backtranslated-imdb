I suppose I always felt that the Hotel du Nord was linked to a studio, the movement of people, cars and cameras was too simple and elegant to have been filmed in the place. But no problem, it is still a charming underestimated composition of Marcel Carne. The plot seems a bit choppy at times, as if they were being invented as they went, but because it is unpredictable, it keeps the focus on the bitter end. The shots of money when the 2 lovers are alone in their room are charged with a somewhat forced dialogue, but everything is so charming that to fall into any inanity can be accepted. Are these 2 young symbols of a cancerous despair in pre-war France or just idiots? Suicide pacts are quite common; If the suicides are young and healthy with their lives before they are rampant, would you think anything more than simply that they were mistaken fools? <br /> <br /> Arletty played the role of a prostitute well: she kept the zipper of her dress busy anyway! I've only seen some movies with Jouvet. It is the most impressive invention as a pimp in HDN. My problem is superficial: every time I see his face, I think of Sonnie Hale in Evergreen. <br /> <br /> A Notably atmospheric, well-acted and photographed film with so much success that it needs some presentations to have everything in place. Annabella and Aumont made an exceptionally beautiful couple; Francois (Heurtebise) Perier in his second film had a small fun part as a gay man. In general: wonderful.
