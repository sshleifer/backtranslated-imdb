David Duchovney creates a role that he had to replicate a bit in Californication: talent with problems. And it is a role that plays well. <br /> <br /> This thriller starts at a good speed and takes you to the end. Timothy Hutton plays a good villain and Angelina Jolie pouts. The story of a dishonored doctor who finds his way to a criminal world is well written. The addiction to drugs and the desire of the sensual Jolie mix an intoxicating cocktail. Unfortunately, towards the end, the story weakens a little and the relations between the villains and the FBI get confused and rush as if they were created just to develop the final scene. But, apart from that, a movie that is worth seeing.
