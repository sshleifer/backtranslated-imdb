Paulie was cute, cool, nice and quite satisfying. I went to this movie expecting to see a typical "family" movie, one that in a few moments would find me unconscious and drooling on the floor. My mentality changed immediately when I was quickly captivated by the integrity of the film. It is rare that you find a family movie that is complete and can be coined as "healthy". Most are manufactured at low cost, written and produced only to attract young family members, who then drag the unfortunate elders into a mind that numbs the 65 minutes of overused visions and diagrams. plot. It told the story of a young woman (Marie) and her best friend, Paulie, the parrot, who could incredibly talk and chat with her quite often. The foolish father of Marie found this incredible, and thought that Paulie was harming the mental health of his 4-year-old daughter, and quickly destroyed them. We follow the adventures (and misadventures) of Paulie when she tries to meet her beloved owner and meet many memorable characters along the way. Oh, yes, Paulie could really talk (smart) and had a quick New Jersey accent. Cool The plot remained thick and entertaining at all times, keeping me attracted. Paulie is the best family movie that I have found and that I have enjoyed with all my heart. Forever. Seriously. Pick up a copy and sit down and enjoy a real family movie, with the whole family. Not sleeping. I promise.
