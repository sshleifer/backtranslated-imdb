Melvyn Douglas and Joan Blondell co-star in "The Amazing Mr. Williams", a comedy / mystery from 1939 quite good, but forgotten, probably due to the number of incredible films that came out in 1939. <br /> <br /> Douglas plays a talented police detective and married to his work, while his girlfriend waits for a wedding that is constantly postponed. What happens in this movie is no exception: he is called to a murder scene just as he is about to walk down the aisle once again. <br /> <br /> Both stars were excellent at comedy, worked well (and often), and helped make this battle of the sexes fun. Edward Brophy and Donald McBride are available to give you excellent support. <br /> <br /> As you can read in other reviews, Melvyn Douglas does not do much to a woman. <br /> <br /> Entertaining if a little on the long side. <br /> <br /> One of the comments here shattered Melvyn Douglas, one of our best actors. He literally floated effortlessly through dozens of movies like the other man and the best friend before becoming his in movies like an old man. He was not lazy, but rather, a hard-working actor (who made it look easy) who had a career on Broadway simultaneously with his film career. He simply was not chosen as a protagonist in films or was given very challenging roles under the study system. I challenge anyone to watch his devastating performances in "Hud" and "I never sang for my father" and call him lazy or make reference to his smile.
