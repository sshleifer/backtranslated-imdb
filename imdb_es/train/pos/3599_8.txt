This movie is a real gem. The arc of the plot is defined in the first 3 minutes, the characters are nice and clearly drawn, their motives completely believable. The dialogue is fresh, and oh so real. The situations are unique to the characters and are not clich√©s or threshing. Until the climax, that's it. Then it's as if the movie went a little out of the lanes and it got a little silly and incredible. But I do not want to dissuade people from watching this movie. The first 3/4 are really remarkable. I gave him an 8. There are some notable performances here. Take a look at this movie.
