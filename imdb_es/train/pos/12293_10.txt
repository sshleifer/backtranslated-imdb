This is an excellent movie, and it is the kind of treasure that one can only catch through sporadic film screenings, since it is not available on video / DVD. The way the film begins with the arrival of the two lovers, and ends with the departure of them (although many intermediate things happen and do not stay in one place during this time), gives a sense of closure and a feeling That everything is fine with the world. If you have the opportunity to see this movie, then do it. I can not wait to see it again and I want it to be published in a general version.
