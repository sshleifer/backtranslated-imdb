In general it was a good movie with an ideal ending; The performance was spectacular and the characters did not turn away from their people. I especially liked the plot, although you knew what was going to happen, I still gave the element of surprise throughout the entire film. However, it seems to me that reaching the end could have been a little longer (perhaps extended); for me, it seemed that he had hurried a bit; as if the writer was trying to remove the clothes from the lines before the rain fell. For example: What happened to Tristan's brother, Hayden? For all we know, he died in the hospital. Maybe he was the one who prepared everything ?! Who knows! Maybe there will be a sequel? Perhaps? If there is ... I can not wait to see it.
