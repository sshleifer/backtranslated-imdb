Despite the sponsorship of George Lucas, this captivating and totally original fantasy in "Lumage" (a combination of animation through live action cuts) is as far away from children's fare as what Ralph Bakshi did in his heyday . Well-conceived characters, such as the shape-shifting dog, Ralph (one of a duo of awkward and rejected heroes), Synonamess Botch (the hilariously foolish villain) and Rod Rescueman (the pompous novice superhero) bring a unique concept to life. ingenious: Frivoli against Murkwood or, the eternal struggle between dreams and nightmares. In this context, songs with MOR infusion on the soundtrack should not have worked, but somehow they do. It is a real pity, therefore, that I had to see this through a really horrible looking boot (removed from a TV show) of the uncensored version. There is also a softer variant that attenuated the language for its VHS version? since the movie is not available on DVD. Interestingly, both Henry Selick and David Fincher worked on this image in subordinate capacities.
