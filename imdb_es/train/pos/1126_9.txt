My interest increased when I was browsing and I saw the name of Iphigenia. My name is Eugenia, so I thought well, let's see what this is. I'm so glad I stayed in the channel. What a wonderful, wonderful story. Drama, sadness, a bit of the maximum performance, but a wonderful time to have. I see this and I am saddened by all the enthusiasm that the film industry emits and these beautiful little gems are overlooked. Try Iphigenia and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do. I even got my children (27, 25, 20 and 17) to enjoy it. It starts slow, however, the drama builds up and you will be attracted to the story. Watching this beautiful movie made me want to wrap myself in more Greek tragedy and pathos.
