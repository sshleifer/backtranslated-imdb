Moon Child was one of the most symbolic movies I've seen. What I really liked was the illustration about immorality / mortality and the obstacles and guides through life. The film shows a large number of Kei vampires who have the power of immorality and the advantages it has. Whether it is supernatural abilities or eternal life, this is what humans usually want. Moon Child shows the pain and disadvantages of being immortal, since the feelings towards loss affect almost all the characters, especially the main characters Sho and Kei. The meaning of the title 'Child of the Moon' is revealed as the film nears the end, where it is clearly shown that everyone is a moon that shines in the path of other people, providing guidance. I quite like the personality that the movie shows in the movie. The weaknesses of the film are found in some parts of the performance and special effects, since they made it less authentic. The scene in which the character Toshi dies could have been more powerful and realistic if they had put more authentic emotions in the performance. Some scenes with special effects like the shots could also have been more authentic without looking like an action videogame. The sparks that came out of the guns seemed too fake and I think they could have been removed or fixed. However, I think Moon Child should be a movie that everyone should consider seeing. The ideas and symbolic images that the film brings out would be easily accepted by all and may interest many viewers. It is a very thoughtful film and also entertaining to watch.
