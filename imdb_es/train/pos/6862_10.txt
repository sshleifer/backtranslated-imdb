When people ask me why I like movies so much, I usually reply: "Have you seen the sequence of the art gallery in De Palma's Dressed to Kill?" That scene alone, represents practically everything I want to see in a movie. If I were a film director, that would be the kind of thing I would like to do. "Pure cinema" is a way of describing that sequence, and it's really amazing to see how the director's full movie De Palma works at the same high artistic frequency of that scene. It's a dream movie, smart as hell, and with more enthusiasm and intelligence than a dozen movies together. I think the film raises an important point that will always be a hotly debated topic: could a film depend solely on technique and still be considered an artistic success? The film does not have a message to talk about, the performance is excellent, but it is at the service of the style and the script does not have logic. De Palma's film makes a really good case that the style, when handled properly, can sustain a feature film. Sure, Michael Caine, Angie Dickinson, Nancy Allen and Keith Gordon give superlative performances, but this is a director's movie to the end. It is a sensational demonstration of the possibilities of the cinematographic medium. I will not tell you which Hitchcock movie he pays homage to (I do not want to spoil any surprises), but I think De Palma transcends the story's arc, and manages to create a film that sums up his entire career pretty well. . Not for the faint of heart!
