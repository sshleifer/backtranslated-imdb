A terrorist attempts to steal a top secret biological weapon, and in the process of trying to escape, becomes infected when the case containing the deadly agent is compromised. The soldiers can recover the case, but the terrorist goes to a hotel where he tries to hide. Eventually they get where they hide, and "clean" the hotel and its occupants. Unfortunately, they get rid of your body by cremation, and if you've seen The Return of the Living Dead, you know what will happen next. <br /> <br /> Zombie 3 has been widely criticized by critics and zombie fans alike, as a complete mess of a movie. While that is a fair assessment, it is not exempt from high points. On the one hand, it has many bloody deaths to keep the gore-hounds happy. There are a lot of zombies that seem to come out of any possible place. They are in the water, on the beams of the houses, hidden in the trees, and for some reason, they like to hide under a pile of dead bushes, only to jump and attack when the heroes try to escape. There is even a flying zombie head that hides inside a refrigerator. You have to see it to believe it, since that scene makes Zombi 3 require to see IMO. It can have a terrible edition and a very questionable performance, especially from the doctor who has to be one of the worst actors I've seen, but Zombie 3 is still a very entertaining movie. Sometimes it's nice to sit down and watch a movie that does not require more than your time and an open mind. Zombie 3 fits that bill, and then some. It's even nicer if you open a few beers and see them with some kindred friends. I give it an 8/10, just for fun.
