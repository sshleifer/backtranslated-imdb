"SÃ¥ som i himmelen" ... as above, below ... that very special point where the Divine and the Human are found. I love this movie! A gem YES, incredible grace! <br /> <br /> I was deeply moved by your very HUMAN quality. I laughed and cried through a whole record, in fact several octaves of emotions. <br /> <br /> Mikael Nyqvist is BRILLIANT like Daniel, a passionate, first class, charismatic and powerful performance. His inner light and his exceptional talent shine in every scene, every interaction, in every meeting. I was totally fascinated, enchanted and trapped in history, which is our collective history, the history of life itself. <br /> <br /> The film also included many archetypes, messiahs, wounded children, magical children, artist, teacher, priest, abuser, mistreated, victim, stalker, divine fool, ALL characters so real and true to life , all awoke a great love and compassion in me. <br /> <br /> It is a real pleasure to see such an entertaining and entertaining movie, so provocative of thoughts. Oh ... I must not forget the celestial choir of angels and their incredibly beautiful sound. <br /> <br /> THANKS TO ALL - This Swedish film will surely captivate people all over the world. SPARKLY!
