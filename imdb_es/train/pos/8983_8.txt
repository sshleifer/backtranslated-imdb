Shot in the car from the windshield, someone is playing his most recent song, someone did not react, according to the voice-over. I wonder how it was done. There were too many scenes in this movie that I wondered about why there was a camera there. If the scenes in which the Warhols descended in a later party of BJM are true, then that was an inexcusable exploitation to the maximum, if not, then it was a total fabrication, in any way it made me feel uncomfortable, if that was the purpose ? Throughout the whole movie, I was wondering how the recording came about. Taken at a glance, a beautiful portrait of the genius (tortured) we all believe we are.
