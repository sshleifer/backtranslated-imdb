Leaving aside all political views, 'Gandhi, my father' by Feroz Khan and Anil Kapoor is a good film that intelligently explores the confused side towards the family of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, and the struggle of his eldest son, Harilal Gandhi , with society, his Father bigger than life and, most importantly, demons in his head. One draws parallels with Gandhi, the father of the nation, and struggles that any son could have with his father. <br /> <br /> The acting is good. Shefali Shetty, Darshan Zariwala and Akshaye Khanna, strictly in that order, add color and pathos to this moving story of Harilal who cries to be embraced only once and also flees with the slightest touch of the finger. <br /> <br /> The direction of Feroz Khan and the production canvas are splendid and attractive, however, the script could have been stricter. I had seen the play a few years ago on a pirated video-type DVD (it was called Mahatama vs. Gandhi, I think) and it was certainly more exciting. However, the background score of the film and the father-son and mother-child moments are just a brilliant gift. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been great. It is the limit to that. It has so great potential to have been just a difference in history between a father and his son or just Gandhi or even both. Somewhere, the plot is lost and when you wait for an absolute epitome of emotions, nothing comes to you. <br /> <br /> It compares decently with that of other Gandhi. It certainly is not a summary film like Gandhi by Kingsley, nor abstract like Hey Ram by Kamal Hassan. The movie almost manages to find its balance; however, one is left wondering "what would happen if ..." It is worth looking. 7.5 / 10
