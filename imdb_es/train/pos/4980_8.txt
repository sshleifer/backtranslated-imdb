While searching the Internet for previous sale prices, I found these comments. Why are they all so serious? It's just a movie and it's not pornographic. I bought this short film from my parents 30 years ago and I have always loved it. I have shown it to many of my friends and they all loved it too. I feel privileged to own this Shirley black-and-white 1932 black-and-white 1932 silent film before it became popular or known. After reading the other comments, I agree that the movie is "spicy". What a thing! I wish it was longer. It seems that I must be the only person who owns one of these originals, at least for sale, so I wonder how much it is worth.
