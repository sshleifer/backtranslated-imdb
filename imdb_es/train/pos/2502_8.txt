This movie surprised me! Having never heard of Hyde of Gackt, I did not expect much! The reason I wanted to see this movie was because someone mentioned that the movie contained some serious action scenes in the style of John Woo! Normally I am very careful when claiming this! There is only one John Woo and to this day there has not been a single director who approaches his brilliance when it comes to action! The fact that "Moon Child" introduced a vampire convinced me even more! How can you make mistakes with fiery vampires? It sounds promising and interesting! The first thing I noticed in this movie is that the pace was considerably slow! It takes time to set the mood! This movie contains some action scenes in the style of Hong Kong! But "Moon Child" is not an action movie! It's a drama about friendship and loyalty! The focus is on the characters and their relationship between them! Pop singers Hyde and Gackt do a good job in acting and are very believable as friends! The only problem I had was with the plot! A couple of times the movie seems to skip a few years without explaining what happened and why they had to skip! Example: when a member of the gang dies (very dramatic moment), Alexander Wang sees Kei (Hyde) drinking blood from one of the attackers! Without warning or explanation, the film jumps 9 years and most of the friends are no longer together. Also without a proper reason given the Son (Alexander Wang) and Sho (Gackt) have to kill each other! I know this is done to add a serious drama! Due to the actors it is very effective but sometimes feels forced! Aside from the flaws in the plot, this film has an atmosphere and a neatness that makes you not like this movie! It's hard to explain why this movie is wonderful! But it simply is! The general experience you get is comforting and sincere!
