Finally I bought and added to my collection a copy of "Show People". I can not comment more than what the previous viewers and the characters, the plot and the general quality of this film have said without repeating their own words. When viewing the cameo, the out-of-character appearances of so many silent stars M-G-M are worth seeing in themselves. I really like the scene in which Marion Davies plays herself and is found playing the main character of the movie, Patricia Pepoire. Make sure you read your lips, since there is no title card that indicates what you are saying when you see Marion Davies, but it is something like "I do not think I like it!" Pop the corn, get on the tape and get ready to go back more than three quarters of a century in the history of cinema. Enjoy!
