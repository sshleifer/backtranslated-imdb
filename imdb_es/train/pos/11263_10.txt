This is an excellent show! I had a professor of American history in high school who was very much like this. There are many "facts" in history that are not entirely true and Mr. Wuhl points them out very well, in a way that is unforgettable. <br /> <br /> Mr. Wuhl is teaching a class of film students, but history students and even the general public will appreciate the ingenious way in which he discovers some well-known fallacies in the history of the world and He will strive to impress them on the brains of his students. The use of live actors who perform "parodies" is also very entertaining. <br /> <br /> I recommend this series to anyone interested in having the story they learned as a child upside down.
