What a movie jewel, so good they made a sequel. <br /> <br /> The movie starts really well with an unpleasant monster that eats a few people and a party where the 2 main characters look for the first time among themselves. <br /> <br /> Bendan Hughes plays the eccentric Vlad, a kind of hint of who this character is, who moved to the city and uses the services of a real estate agent in particular to find him a house. <br /> <br /> Hell, we've all seen vampire movies, we know the format. <br /> <br /> The movie can be seen, but the actors' performances are very rigid and they look like I do not want to be in this movie, but it may be just part of the decadent environment. <br /> <br /> I did not like the ending, but there is a sequel to be tracked. <br /> <br /> When I saw the movie, I thought that Brendan Hughes really did not fit. Later, I could not stop thinking about him, somehow exudes a spooky sensuality, so maybe it was right for the role. <br /> <br /> BRENDAN HUGHES Last seen in 'Hitler: The Rise of Evil' as Lieutenant Guffman. <br /> <br /> Where is it now?
