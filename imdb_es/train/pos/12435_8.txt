['I was pleased to see that she had black hair! I&#39;ve been a fan for about 30 years and I&#39;ve been disgusted by the two previous attempts to film the stories. <br /><br /> I was pleased that the writers updated the period to include a computer, it did not spoil it at all. In fact, I watched the movie twice in a day, a sure sign that it was up to the task. This is what I do with the books that I also like. <br /><br /> I thought that all the characters were well represented and represented the first days of Modesty Blaise extremely well, as evidenced by both the books and the comics. I would also have to disagree with a comment made by a previous critic about the bad guys having to be ugly. Have you really read the books? <br /><br /> I thought that this was a very good movie and I expect sequels in advance.']
