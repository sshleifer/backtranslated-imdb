This first part of the BRD trilogy has more passion and plot density than Lola, but less of the magic of Veronica Voss. Political reflections point to them: we see the shortages after the war, how the black fishermen were able to control much of their daily life (a delightful moment when Fassbinder, playing a grifter, tries to sell a complete set of Kleist to Schygulla, who comments that burning books does not provide much heat: she really wants firewood). <br /> <br /> There is something awkward in the first hour. The scene in Maria's room with the black soldier, interrupted by Hermann's appearance, should go faster. The train scene, when Maria meets Karl Oswald, deflates when she insults the IG - I cringed in fear, it was so bad. But as the story unfolds and the years pass, I was increasingly attracted to this bright and cold world.
