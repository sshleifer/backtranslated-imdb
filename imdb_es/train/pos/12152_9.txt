I just saw this movie on HBO, and it was really good ... a truly tragic love story! I really appreciated the fact that the boy at the center of the story had lost the use of his legs in an accident. It is rare to see a love story that involves someone who has a physical disability. The love that developed between that character and the woman who comes to his life well portrayed, I would like to think that love can heal someone's heart. Laura Leighton ... all 27 when she made this movie ... it was great as the woman so full of life that is able to revive the heart of this boy. Unfortunately, since your family is rich and hers is not, "problems" develop. <br /> <br /> It's playing on HBO a few more times this month.
