['The rating is only 5 because it is a movie that could have used better acting and direction (or at least music!). However, for the achievements of Walt Whitman, it deserves a 10. A previous poster calls the movie cheesy, however, I think it&#39;s a simple case of not seeing the forest for the trees. The filmmakers were apparently more interested in publishing the story than in having a brilliant Hollywood movie. And for this, I applaud you: the fact that it is not conventional also reflects Whitman&#39;s life. This film is more documentary than acting. Being fascinated with a story like this, when you rarely hear about these types of stories that shape current mental health, is the most important thing. I found the story very pleasant.']
