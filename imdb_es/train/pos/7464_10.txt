It made me think about it for days after seeing it. That for me is the mark of a great movie. Eyes Wide Shut had the same effect on me. I'm tired of these people needing these happy Hollywood endings. I'm planning to go see him again tonight to understand the plot a bit better, but despite that, the emotional messages of the film were totally felt.
