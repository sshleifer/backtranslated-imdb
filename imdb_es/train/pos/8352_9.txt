This film is an impressive piece that will convince even the most skeptical viewer that Gerard Depardieu is one of the best film actors of the last 50 years. His performance surprises him, entertains him, dislikes him and loves him, leaving him breathless. This film was filmed in the early days of his film career and is very crude, but still able to convey the dominance of Depardieu. A must for any fan of Depardieu and, by far, his best initial work.
