['I really liked that movie !!! The characters were people you could feel for. The young man in the service is still in love with the girl he left behind. Tom Drake is always perfect in romantic leadership, as well as Donna Reed as the love of his life. The looks he gives her as if he had felt hungry to see her, as well as his hesitation and confusion, and also his feelings for him, were played very well. The rest of the extravagant characters in the store were perfect, since they tried to reunite them. The most moving scene, however, was the young couple at their great-grandfather&#39;s house. I laughed in some places, I cried in some and I enjoyed watching this movie. In fact I&#39;ve seen it again about 5 times. A definite must see for the total romantics.']
