['&quot;And throughout the house&quot; is a special crypt episode, not only because it is from the first season, but this episode was the first one I saw! I remember when I was a young man who was on vacation with my parents that summer of 1989 in our hotel room in South Carolina on HBO, I saw this episode and I was buried in the Crypt at that time and forever. I&#39;ve always been a fan of the horror thriller series and I liked monster movies, and with this series started by HBO again I had a terrible pleasure. This episode is the first I saw, it is memorable for me and one of my favorites, it is very nice with a good touch. &quot;And throughout the house&quot; has a pleasant and cozy atmosphere on a snowy Christmas Eve, which is a perfect way to relax to enjoy the Christmas holidays! Well, anyway, we have Mary Ellen Trainor (who by the way plays in several Warner brothers, usually small pieces) as a greedy and ambitious woman who cares for her husband while waiting for some money and a new romance. Just like most horror series, things get worse and bad people get what they deserve. The odds are stacked enormously when a maniac disguised as Santa Claus escapes from a crazy house in the area, which makes the end of the year holiday a Christmas weekend! From the old EC comic lessons, you learn that bad people get what they do! Well, this story ends with a perfect holiday scream! In addition, this story appeared in the 1972 film and featured Joan Collins, this is definitely one of my favorites and probably one of the classic crypt episodes of all time!']
