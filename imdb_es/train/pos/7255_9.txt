This is not a movie that you look to entertain you, at least most people I know would not. <br /> <br /> It's a picture of the cruelty to body and mind that happens in a war quite well, the characters seem plausible, especially because you "read their minds", something that is most often found in books and rarely in movies, however, it is done very well in this piece. I would place it next to "All Quiet on the Western Front" and "Die Br√ºcke" in terms of leaving a lasting impression. <br /> <br /> I would like to be able to show it at school, along with the other two movies - However, finding a copy turned out to be quite difficult, which is a shame.
