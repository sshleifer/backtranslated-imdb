There's nothing you do not like about Moonstruck. I'm from an Italian family in New York and it really scares me a little when I look at it. The actors and actresses, the plot, the secondary arguments, the humor ... they were all fantastic. It starts a little slow, but a lot happens in those two days! I fell in love with LaBoheme because of this movie. In my list of favorite movies, Moonstruck is number 3. It's a "feel good" movie in which you leave the theater with a buzzing "that's more" or repeat some of your favorite phrases: "old man, if you give him those dogs another part of my food, I'll kick you until you're dead "; "Chrissy, bring me the big knife", "who is dead", "you love him, Loretta ... well, because when you do it, they drive you crazy because they know they can". I always put Moonstruck when there is nothing good to see because it makes me happy.
