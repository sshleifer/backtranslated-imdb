ANCHORS AWEIGH is an entertaining MGM musical that fans of the genre will enjoy, but I would not rate it with classics like SINGIN IN THE RAIN or THE BAND WAGON. This was the first of the three musicals in which Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra appeared together. Kelly and Sinatra play Joe Brady and Clarence Doolittle, two licensed sailors in Hollywood who become friends with a boy (Dean Stockwell) who introduces them to his attractive young aunt (Kathryn Grayson) a struggling actress who is working as an extra in MGM. Although both are attracted to Grayson, he finally expresses his preference for Joe, but then Clarence hooks up with a waitress (Pamela Britton) who, according to him, is from his hometown, Brooklyn. The paper-thin weave leaves room for several large musical numbers that include "We Hate to Leave," the lament of Joe and Clarence to their fellow navigators when they leave the ship; The torrid interpretation of Grayson of "Jalousie"; Sinatra's dreamy version of "I fall in love very easily" (a number that is sadly removed from some copies of this film), and "The Worry Song", a fantasy dance that Kelly does with the animated Jerry the Mouse of the fame of Tom and Jerry. Kelly also makes a kind of fantasy ballet from Kissing Bandit that competes with her Pirate Ballet in the latest THE PIRATE. Kelly is in top form here, in a robust and energetic performance that earned her her only Oscar nomination for Best Actor, and Sinatra's extremely shy character here is undeniably sexy. An entertaining diversion for fans of the MGM music factory.
