I just came back from a presentation of "My Left Foot" in our public library. What an emotional experience: I feel exhausted and animated. <br /> <br /> It is the story of Christy Brown, Irish writer and painter, and is based on the autobiography of the author "My left foot". Christy was born with a form of cerebral palsy so that the only limb that he had good control of was his left foot. The doctors informed her parents that she had mental retardation beyond repair, but her mother did not give up and, as Annie Sullivan had done with Helen Keller, helped her make a breakthrough in which she learned the alphabet and then read, wrote and painting. <br /> <br /> This film won the Academy Awards for Daniel Day-Lewis (best actor) and as the best supporting actress for the actress who plays her mother; he also received Oscar nominations for best film, best director and best adapted screenplay. <br /> <br /> As a retired clinical psychologist and family therapist, although many films can entertain me, many also let me have to overlook fictions or improbabilities in realistic psychological reactions. <br /> <br /> Not this movie: it was absolutely "right" to portray the roles and behaviors typical of Irish parents (see, for example, check out the typical Irish families in "Ethnicity & McGoldrick's" Family Therapy ") as well as the uneven emotional maturation of Christy Brown - some immature personality reactions that were further amplified by capturing her father's traits. <br /> <br /> The film presents the greatest truth while changing certain sequences in its development (painting and writing) and the condensation of several important people in a single person, for the sake of telling a coherent and credible story, not loaded by small distracting and distracting realities. (Consult Christy Brown in Wikipedia for more precision The version of the DVD that was shown to us had some subtitles in English that were of great help to understand Christy's speech (and some of the Irish speech); Initial film may have lacked this. (If you see this on a DVD, enable that option). <br /> <br /> The performance of Daniel Day-Lewis is one of the best credible acting jobs I've seen. Truly magnificent, outstanding, superlative. <br /> <br /> "My left foot" has more similarity than a more recent film, "The Diving Bell & the Butterfly", in which each portrays the life of a real person Successfully overcoming imprisonment and isolation of an extremely severe physical disability. <br /> <br /> And in doing so, it resonates with William Ernest Henley's "Invictus", which begins: "Out of the night that covers me, // Black as the Pole from pole to pole, // I thank the gods that are // For my unconquerable soul ".
