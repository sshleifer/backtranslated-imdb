While I would say that I enjoy the program, I expected something completely different from the first time I saw 'What I like about you'. I expected to find something similar to 'All that' (I'm not sure if it's happening anymore) but I have to say that I like the show and although I do not classify it as a breakthrough, it's very charming and I like the chemistry between the characters also (including the cast) <br /> <br /> I would definitely say it's great to see Wesley Jonathan again on the screen because I really loved him in City Guy. I had also seen the woman who plays Valerie's friend in Popular and, although I think it was a good show, I do not really like her character in this show because it's not my cup of tea, but it rounds it pretty well.
