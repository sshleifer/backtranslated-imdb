You already know the story, a group of courageous non-hopers participating in a competition that apparently have no chance of winning. It's a story that Hollywood has killed (Bring It On, The Karate Kid, Escape to Victory, Best of the Best etc). Now Korea tries with a Taekwondo team that fights for glory? and guess what ?? the result is predictable but, ultimately, satisfactory. <br /> <br /> The fact that this film does not fall on your face depends on the talented young cast that really makes you care about the characters, and this in turn continues. Are you watching until the end? <br /> <br /> Can the fans of your typical martial arts movie be disappointed? Taekwondo does not deliver the usual flow of movements and acrobatics seen in most Kung Fu movies; the action is limited to kicking (although it is impressive) and the occasional punch. However, this does not matter, since it is the interaction of the characters and their struggle to do something for themselves that makes this film a success.
