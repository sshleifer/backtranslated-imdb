This is one of the best movies made since 2002. It may not be the best movie, but it looks better, has a great performance and is perfectly directed by Sam Mendes, who debuted with 'American Beauty'. <br /> <br /> Tell the story of a gangster named Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) whom his son (Tyler Hoechlin) sees in one of his works. Michael's boss, John Rooney (Paul Newman), thinks things will be fine, but his jealous son, Connor Rooney (Daniel Craig) prepares his father and Michael, leading to the death of Michael's wife (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and the second child. Michael thinks that Rooney is responsible and that Rooney has to choose for himself and sends a hitman Harlen Maguire (Jude Law) to finish the job. Since Michael is a respected man within the organization, he tries to win some friends who can help him, including the mafia boss Frank Nitti (Stanley Tucci). <br /> <br /> Somehow, 'Road to Perdition' is a standard gangster movie. But it's so well done that you can hardly see that. This film is good in its production design, art direction, sound, music and especially in its cinematography. All these elements are able to surprise and create suspense, although the result is quite true. That Hoechlin is not an annoying child and Hanks, Law and Newman know how to act, of course. <br /> <br /> Based on a comic book, this movie is much better than you would expect and, although it has flaws. It belongs to the best films of the genre. Sometimes there are events in which you realize that you have seen it so many times before, but for some reason it also feels cool at the same time. The scenes between the adult Hanks and the child Hoechlin help in that area. See this movie that will look familiar at times but is totally new in many areas.
