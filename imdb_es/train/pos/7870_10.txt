The film is a true spectacle of how awake and selfish the superior society has become. It has many characters and each and every one of the characters represent a different category of person. No character is 100% good and moral, unlike the heroes of all typical Indian films, and no character is 100% bad, but they are all different. The movie is a very perfect mix of emotions, drama and entertainment. For the first time I liked a movie that has raised some social issues. I would recommend everyone to watch the movie. Madhavi Sharma is a journalist who covers Bollywood parties for the hip movement for page 3 of the newspaper, but this is the story of how she becomes a crime reporter for the newspaper. But this is not all, then it shows how she could not survive there and when she helped rescue some innocent children, how brutally her voice is suppressed. Even she is dismissed from work. Then she could not find a job as a crime reporter and she has to do it again. Not only her, but a lot of characters are woven into the film and they all give a different feel as they watch her. I would really congratulate the director for making a great movie. Please, you can not miss it.
