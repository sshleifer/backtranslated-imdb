I find it very interesting that Lee Radziwill, the sister of Jackie Kennedy and the cousin of these women, would encourage the Maysles to make "Big Edie" and "Little Edie" the theme of a movie. Certainly they could be considered the "skeletons" in the family closet. Additional features on the DVD include several contemporary fashion designers who attribute some of their ideas to these strange women. I would say that anyone interested in fashion would find the discussion of these designers fascinating. (ie, "Are you crazy, or do I lack something?"). This movie is hard to get. Netflix does not have it. But the facets do.
