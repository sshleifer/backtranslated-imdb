Who made this movie? I love this movie? Someone has a strange sense of humor ... <br /> <br /> This Zany, surrealist style of making movies is attractive, but it's hard to create, or easy to forget, that substance and the characters that really have soul . , are those that give such a depth of film. Without that, a comedy is just a bunch of ideas. Who cares. You can get laughs, but it passes through you like a hamburger half ... next ... <br /> <br /> Crosseyed may not intend to change anyone's life, but I appreciate the depth and substance . They sneak up on you I started this movie thinking "Oh, I understand it - independent comedy - from the wall - gonzo ... yup". And that's it, but if you pay attention, there are sub text and character moments that complete it. In this sense the film breathes. He makes propositions that pause, if he is available to see them, and then, of course, follows his incredibly cheerful path. <br /> <br /> You will lose the point if you do not sign the Contract to suspend the belief at moments of the movie. A step between reality and surreality is one of the points of this film. <br /> <br /> Crosseyed is not perfect, but smart people did it. I want more. <br /> <br /> The scenes of the dining room are an absolute HOLOR. <br /> <br /> Put on your seatbelt.
