The sudden impact was generally better than The Enforcer in my opinion. It was becoming a great movie, but then I saw the villain (s) and I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> The sudden impact was different from previous deliveries. The plot took a different direction in this film, since Dirty Harry does not take as much focus of the police this time. We also do not see the villains until later, which means less screen time for them, which is better for all of us. <br /> <br /> Clint Eastwood once again steals the show as Dirty Harry, he said a lot. Pat Hingle was nice as Chief Jannings, Harry's new assigned boss. Bradford Dillman seemed to change his name to Captain Briggs here, anyway, it was no different. Michael Currie is decent like Lieutenant Donnelly, the annoying superior of Harry. Personally I enjoyed Kevyn Major Howard as Hawkins, the young punk who has a vendetta against Harry. Albert Popwell was excellent as Horace, Harry's friend. Audrie J. Neenan was good as Ray Parkins, a famous lesbian in the city. Jack Thibeau was chosen as Kruger, a pervert. Now for the really bad part. Sandra Locke, Eastwood's former lover was terribly misunderstood as Jennifer Spencer, Harry's love interest. And Paul Drake was as horrible as Mick. <br /> <br /> The movie would have been much better if it had not been for better writing and acting in some parts. <br /> <br /> 8/10.
