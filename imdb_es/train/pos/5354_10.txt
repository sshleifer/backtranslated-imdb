Why does not Dynamo have any pants? Where did they go?? It was never explained. That's why this movie was so amazing. Starsky also gave his children AIDS! Great performance too. Richard Dawson deserved to win the Best Supporting Actor! A I D S My favorite line of the film was "That place" A I D S. This movie was for the "birds". I tried to give this movie the "stinky", but it kept playing. What am I doing wrong???!!!! I thought the "HATEBOAT" was fun lol;) I would like that for a show. Why did Dynamo not wear pants? I know his arm was crooked but ... What about those future crazy networks? Why did not that kind of family fight Ray Combs get a network? He could have used one. SIDASSSS
