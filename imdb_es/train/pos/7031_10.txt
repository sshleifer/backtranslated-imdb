This is a great movie, I did the play a while ago. He had an extra zing-- to him. I loved Vanessa Williams as Rosey, and also Jason Alexander has a good voice. It was great. The environment was also very good. Except for the fact that they are 2 hours and 50 minutes, it is quite long. In general I give it 8.5 stars. They also added some parts, but it was still fresh.
