This movie was excellent for the following reasons: 1) It contained great backgrounds and scenarios. 2) He showed the disparity of an environment devastated by war with a technological one. 3) John Cusack's performance was great. He portrayed the anguish very well. 4) He showed everyone's vulnerabilities in a situation devastated by the war. 5) He gave us an image of what could happen in the future in many aspects. I was also impressed with the performance for the most part. Hilary's performance was, I found, the most forced. The morals and values ​​of everyone in a situation torn by war are at stake. The liberal journalist and the conservative businessman are capable of doing anything in any situation and are equally unpredictable. Good thing. PSP
