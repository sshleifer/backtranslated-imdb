Astutely interesting Western of a director who had few partners in the genre. Like other images of Anthony Mann, The Far Country combines a powerful pot story with a skillful knowledge of stunning landscapes. Both of which are presented among some Mann peccadilloes as honor, integrity, betrayal and, of course, death! History considers that the partners of the hunt of fortunes Jeff Webster {James Stewart} and Ben Tatum {Walter Brennan} travel to the territory of Oregon with a herd of cattle. Aware of the booming gold boom, they plan to earn an orderly profit by selling the cattle in a city of Klondike. Upon arriving at Skagway, they find Judge Gannon (John McIntire), a self-appointed judge, willing to do justice to Webster for the fact that Webster has broken the law, all with an honest cause, along the way. As a punishment, Gannon snatches the pack from the mates, but steals them back and heads across the Canadian border to Dawson, with Gannon and his men in pursuit. Here, beautiful women and a meek and lawless people will fill the destinies of all those involved. <br /> <br /> Interesting from start to finish, The Far Country greatly benefits from the bubbly {anti} hero of James Stewart in the waiting image and Mann's. Address of the adjusted writing of Borden Chase. The photography of William H. Daniels is superlative, although no favor has been done with current impressions on DVD, and the film has some surprises and a "is not it?" The main theme is affecting viewers. Giving dividends in the re-clocks for fans of the hardened genre, it's still a must-have for rookies venturing into the wonderful, dark western world of Anthony Mann and James Stewart. 8/10
