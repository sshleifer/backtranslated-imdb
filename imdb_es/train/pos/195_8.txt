['&quot;Show People&quot; is an absolutely enchanting silence directed by King Vidor and starring Marion Davies and Billy Haines. What gems are in this charming comedy about a young girl, Peggy Pepper, whose performance is the talk of Savannah trying to succeed on the big screen. Although he is successful in comedy, what he wants to do is make &quot;art&quot;, so he moves to High Arts Studio. She soon becomes Patricia Pepoire and is too good for the likes of her friend Billy. <br /><br /> Many stars of the silent era have appeared in &quot;Show People&quot;, including Davies herself without curly hair and makeup. I am sure that when people saw the film in 1928, they recognized everyone who appeared in the elaborate lunch scene; Unfortunately, today, this is not the case, even for movie lovers. In one part of the film, however, she meets Charlie Chaplin; in another, the author Elinor Glyn is pointed out, and Vidor himself has a cameo at the end of the film. Other stars that appear in &quot;Show People&quot; are John Gilbert, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, Leatrice Joy, Bess Flowers, Renee Adoree, Rod LaRoque, Aileen Pringle and many others. <br /><br /> Davies was adorable and an animated comedian. It is a pity that William Haines has left the cinema: he was cute and energetic, deservedly a huge star in his time. <br /><br /> &quot;Show People&quot; is a simple story told in an ingenious way. It is also a retrospective look at an exciting time in Hollywood history and contains performances by two wonderful stars.']
