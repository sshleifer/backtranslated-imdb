This movie is fine if you like nonsense action, cheesy acting and a very small plot. The special effects are decent, since this film is from the director of "Event Horizon". The costumes are like something from a crazy movie. None of the soldiers speaks, so others tell them what to do. Eventually, they turn into a great shooting movie with explosions all over the place. Personally, I liked Russell more in "tango and cash", "escape from / new york" and "executive decision". You must see this movie leave your mind at the door for an easy-action science fiction movie!
