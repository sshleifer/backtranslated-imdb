['Do you remember Ralph Bakshi? The guy who was an animator in Terrytoons, and then in Paramount Cartoon Studios, after that, he was director in Fritz the Cat 1 &amp; 2 and Heavy Traffic? Well, this is Coonskin. And actually it&#39;s pretty good. Racist, but good. The film takes place in Harlem Nights (No, duh, it was a job title), but with a twist that becomes a star of a Disney movie, Song of the South. <br /><br /> These are Sampson (Barry White) and Preacher (Charles Gordone) rushing to help his friend, Randy (Philip Michael Thomas) to escape from prison, but are stopped by a blockade and end in a shootout with the police. While waiting for them, Randy reluctantly listens to his escaped companion Pappy (Scatman Crothers), as he begins to tell Randy a story about &quot;three guys, he used to know, just like you and your friends.&quot; Pappy&#39;s story is told in a series of animations against live action background photos and footage. <br /><br /> Brother Rabbit (voice of Thomas), Brother Bear (voice of White) and Preacher Fox (voice of Gordone) decide to pack and leave their southern configuration after the bank mortgaged his house and sold it to a man that turns it into a brothel Upon arriving in Harlem, Rabbit, Bear and Fox, they discover that it is not all that it is made to be. They meet a scammer called Simple Savior, a false revolutionary leader who claims to be the &quot;cousin&quot; of Black Jesus, and who gives his followers &quot;the strength to kill the whites&quot;. In a stage performance in his &quot;church&quot;, Savior acts being brutalized by the symbols of black oppression, represented by images of John Wayne, Elvis Presley and Richard Nixon, before asking for &quot;donations&quot; from his parishioners. <br /><br /> Rabbit first confronts Madigan, a white and homophobic, virulent and racist policeman, and the man from the mafia bag, who shows his contempt for African-Americans in various ways, including refusing to bathe before an early encounter with them (He thinks it&#39;s not worth it). When Madigan discovers that Rabbit has been taking his rewards, he and his companions, Ruby and Bobby, are led to a nightclub called &quot;The Cottontail.&quot; <br /><br /> A black stripper distracts him while a sugar cube with LSD falls into his drink. Madigan, while under the influence of his spiny drink, then becomes a sexual liaison with a stereotypically effeminate gay man, and then puts on the clothes that the women were representative of the racist archetype, adorns himself with something racist and finally push in the back. From the club where he discovers that Ruby and Bobby are dead. <br /><br /> Then, while recovering from his delirium of being drugged, he fires his gun at random and the police shoot him after shooting one of them. <br /><br /> Rabbit, Bear, Fox and the opponent boxer run out of the boxing field as it explodes. The live action story ends with Randy and Pappy escaping while several white cops shoot them, but they manage to get out alive. <br /><br /> This film was controversial at the time of the release and was reissued by the director several times with the title Street Fight, which is obvious, since Street Fight is a 2005 documentary about racism in the streets. In fact, this movie has the same theme as the documentary. <br /><br /> That caused that Bryanston Pictures, the distributor of this film and the original classic of Tobe Hopper, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, left the business. Because Paramount wanted to produce and distribute this film, but due to racism, Bryanston took over the production of Bakshi. <br /><br /> Despite the controversy, it was worth the entertainment. The animation was amazing at that time, the plot makes sense and is actually also fun. <br /><br /> Final verdict: 9/10']
