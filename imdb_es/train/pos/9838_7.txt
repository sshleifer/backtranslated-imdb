Born Again is a good episode of season 1. The reincarnation bit, in my opinion, is great. The more I see it, the more I like it and yet, it will never rise above "Very good" to me. Although it is not very memorable, I will always remember it as the episode of reincarnation. Anyway, now I will say what is good and bad about this episode, <br /> <br /> The Good: Oragami. Oh yeah! <br /> <br /> That fish tank was fine. =] <br /> <br /> Shot by a window. Very elegant. x] <br /> <br /> The bad: Marry your best friend's wife !? O_O <br /> <br /> What a random choice to reincarnate. <br /> <br /> Why the guy who died having his scarf tangled, trying to take off his scarf? <Br /> <br /> Conclusion: Good episode, not very memorable. 7/10
