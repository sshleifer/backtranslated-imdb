I am happy to be able to say almost only positive things about the film with Karas and the Tasuiev sisters, RENAISSANCE. <br /> <br /> And, in the first place, it seems that it should be seen; an adventure for children, RENAISSANCE is the story of a police investigation in search of a young missing scientist, Ilona Tasuiev, the geneticist and researcher of the company Avalon. <br /> <br /> The story of Karas, Ilona and Bislane It is, although much less known than SIN CITY, the best film and the most appreciated by connoisseurs. For fans of French comics it will be even more significant (last week I enriched my collection of French comics, although I'm not that updated). The atmosphere, the music, the characters, their lines, the plot are pleasant and endearing. It shows Karas, a top Parisian policeman, to find a young woman who was a rising star of medical genetic research, Ilona Tasuiev, a slightly hot blonde, whose rebellious sister Bislane was erotically preferable, I suppose. <br /> <br /> For me, an old fan of comics and TV series, RENAISSANCE, a wonderfully beautiful caricature, was like a replay of an episode of WILD WILD WEST here, a mythological past replaced with a similar future mythological more backward And blasé but, in a certain sense, so exciting. RENAISSANCE is not suspense; nor does it look especially well accelerated; But it is seductive and hypnotic. In addition, he manages to sketch, albeit briefly, a world, a true world and we will think of Avalon, Nakata, Jonas Mueller, the Tasuiev sisters, and Goran, Farfella and Karas counting their distant childhood in Kasbah. . I liked the feeling of RENAISSANCE, of a certain kindness and affability and adventure, and also the professional and safe appearance; among these new cartoons, this and the adaptation of Dick de Linklater (Dick's only and first adaptation of the story) stood out for their beauty and genuine emotion. <br /> <br /> I thought futuristic devices were appropriate and, when not conventional, vividly mysterious (like invisibility disguises). <br /> <br /> As advisable, the characters have exotic names, such as Bislane and Farfella, mostly collected from the world of arts and entertainment (Goran and Ilona and Naghib ??). <br /> <br /> It seems that none has noticed that the RENAISSANCE poster presents a Rourke look similar to Marv's; what does not make it a SIN CITY scam, but neither is it a paragon of originality, and in fact, it is more like Miller's story, namely, the somber futuristic aspect of a decadent society, the hero's verve. (In fact, a cross of the character of Willis and Rourke in the previous film), on the other hand, this cartoon breathes a more public air, a bit of direct adventure and, in a word, is like SIN CITY for children, Well, more naughty children, because there is a bit of nudity on display. What I have said could be replicated that the aforementioned features are characteristic, even as clichés and commonplaces of the futuristic appearance of the more adult comics; True enough, and it was old Miller to have brought those things on the screen and RENAISSANCE has some similarities here and there. Now it is also fair that each RING has its ERAGORN, so for each city of sin, its rebirth. I admit that I am rather partial to these gloomy futuristic stories, a rather demanding specialty.
