['Spoiler This movie is about such a concept. Williams will go to any low to play again the game of football that torments his life. Russel plays the former athlete who peaked in high school. Finally, the lower dog receives his shot, and Williams can save his face, instead of being the clown. A great reverse tragedy. 7/10']
