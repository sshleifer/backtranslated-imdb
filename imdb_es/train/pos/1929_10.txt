I recently had the pleasure of watching The Big Bad Swim at the Ft. Lauderdale Film Festival and I must say that it is the best movie I've seen all year and the only movie I've felt inspired to write a comment / review. This film was beautifully directed and combined a script with realistic dialogues, excellent acting and an inspiring message. Ordinary lives come together in a swimming class for adults and become something extraordinary in a celebration of the diversity of life. This is illustrated in a moving way with the images in the first minute of this captivating film, in which we see that only the legs and torso of individuals of different shapes and sizes enter a puddle of water. This film is brilliantly directed as the actors are placed and placed in captivating scenes, which attract their attention and imagination.
