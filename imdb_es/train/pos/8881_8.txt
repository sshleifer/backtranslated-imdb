First you have to take into account the period of time in which this film was shot in 1995. The rappers were in it, and that added to their style. <br /> <br /> Remy was a socially awkward teenager trying to find his son. and he could not, until he met and befriended the Nazis. They captured him. The Nazis are not so uncomfortable, but like most gangs, they fill a missing void, be it economic, social, emotional, or whatever. Michael Rappaport played the role perfectly. <br /> <br /> Omar Epps was the star of the hot shot track, with a questionable work ethic and a chip on his shoulder. He kept trying to feel sorry for himself and his difficult situation, and made his girlfriend and his teacher straighten him out. <br /> <br /> Kristen was a white girl who tried to find herself and tried to fit in, until she was raped. Then she found her self-examination with her sexuality and became politically involved. <br /> <br /> This film is about racism and like most things about racism, people's perspectives come into play. <br /> <br /> I read many comments about how there were no "evil" black characters but there was one evil white one (Nazis). And that? Remy was not depicted as a villain at all, he was trying to find his way, and he kept failing until some skinheads accepted him. I was scared, it was sad to see him return as he did. He even says that just before committing suicide, I did not mean that, I wanted to be an engineer. <br /> <br /> Ice Cube and Busta Rhymes were angry black men, Ice Cube was a bit intellectual, and Busta Rhymes was played as a foolish bully. Both did not show any consideration for their roommates and, in general, they do not seem to like whites much. They were angry like the Nazis, but not at the level of the Nazis in terms of general evil. I'm sorry if this makes it seem unfair, but are there really black groups like the Nazis? No. <br /> <br /> People say it shows white = -bad black = good. It is not true, the only bad white characters were the Nazis and the police, which is more or less true in real life. Kristen was a good girl, her boyfriend (omar epps roommate) was a good boy, and even Remy was a good boy, he was wrong. <br /> <br /> Omar Epps, Ice Cube and Busta were very defective characters Angry and inconsiderate. Although his constant harassment by the police seemed to justify some of his anger. Remy's inability to fit seemed to justify his anger as well. <br /> <br /> Good movie, well done. Like all movies dealing with racism, it's a great piece to start a discussion. <br /> <br /> I do not think Cube and Busta could beat those Nazis.
