I find it so surprising that even after all these years, we are still talking about this movie! Obviously, this movie was not SO bad or, otherwise, people would not want to talk to MORE. I personally enjoyed this movie immensely, and I still do! I guess this movie is not for everyone, but it certainly touched the hearts of many. <br /> <br /> As for those who think that this film is "overvalued" or "exaggerated" ... well, we just have to thank the audience that is going to see the movie! lol * You see, it is not the writers of CRITICS / articles who make a "HUGE" movie or a "HIT" with the general public. People make the film a great success. With Titanic, everyone was amazed. Let's face it, a movie like this has never been done before. At least not with the kind of special effects needed to really capture the essence of the ship that is really sinking. This film is so accurate that even James Cameron timed the actual sinking of the ship in the film with the REAL sinking of that fateful day in April 1912. Even the cutlery for the good of God coincide! <br /> <br /> Give this movie a break, guys! The critics thought that this movie would sink in a big way! When this movie really came out and people started listening for WORD OF MOUTH (which is the BEST form of advertising that matters to you) that this was a good / decent / movie worth seeing, then everyone started to flock to theaters en masse to watch this movie. ... not once, not two, but maybe 3 times and more! So, I would not really say that this movie was "overrated" ... at least not as the accumulation of MATRIX recharged or the HULK is being "overrated". Say ah! Critics did not even think that the Titanic would earn enough money to cover the gigantic budget of Cameron's movie that was needed to make this gigantic film. However, the money from the films took over that budget of 200 million and MUCH more! <br /> <br /> Personally, I LOVE this movie. However, this movie may not be for everyone. Do not say that this movie stinks only for romance! It's the sexiest thing I've heard! I do not like a movie just because it has romance! The story was sweet. The dialogue could have been better, but let's face it ... the real star of the movie was not Leo or Kate ... it was that GIGANTIC Ship! I think all the actors, including DiCaprio and Winslet, did a good job. It's not your best work (I've seen much better work from both) but it was not the WORST I've seen on the screen before. Give them a break! <br /> <br />
