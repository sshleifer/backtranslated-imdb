I had the opportunity to see a screening of this movie recently. I think it will be in Canadian theaters sometime around Mother's Day. If you are in a theater near you ... GO! It is not a funny movie to feel good, but it is more like a movie of thinking and thinking. <br /> <br /> The director does an excellent job of character development: it allows you to enter Hagar's heart, mind and wounds little by little. At first, their attitudes and behaviors do not make much sense. As your story unfolds, she becomes someone you can understand. As in life ... understanding brings empathy. I found her nice at the end of the movie, especially when she opens her heart to the young man in the hut by the lake. <br /> <br /> Hagar's relationship with his two children is painful, and reflects so much of our own experiences in this world. His youngest son, John, who is full of life and adventure takes the viewer to the edge of his seat, and the kind of raw emotion that is so authentic and rare. <br /> <br /> It's fun to see him Ellen Page acting in this movie. She is so different from the young woman who plays in Juno. It gives me an even broader appreciation for their ability to act. If you loved her in Juno, you will love her in The Stone Angel. <br /> <br /> Of course, there's Ellen Burnstyn as Agar. There is probably no way to express the power to act as strongly as the actor's ability to make you forget all the other characters they have played. Never in the course of this film did I think of Ellen Burnstyn, always and only I thought of Hagar. She introduced me to her character: hook, line and plumb line. <br /> <br /> Kari Skogland's ability to capture in the film this renowned book by one of Canada's most esteemed authors is impressive. She brilliantly brings to the screen both the stones and the angelic parts of this complex woman, Hagar, the stone angel.
