['I recommend photos that prove something different. Many movies seem like reprints of old ideas, so that&#39;s the big reason why I highly recommend Passport to Pimlico. <br /><br /> The film is set right after the Second World War and the scarcity and rationing of the postwar period seem to be driving the Londoners crazy. The film focuses on a small neighborhood in London called Pimlico. They, too, are fed up with not being able to buy what they want but can not see a way out. That is until they accidentally stumble upon a hidden treasure and a letter that officially named this neighborhood a sovereign nation many hundreds of years ago! With this document, they reason, they can ignore all rationing and coupons and live life as they wish, as it turns out that they really are not British subjects. The place to which the film is directed and how the crisis is ultimately resolved is something that they must see for themselves. Let the brilliant minds of Ealing Studios create this gem!']
