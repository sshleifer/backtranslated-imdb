A sentimental story with a sentimental soundtrack. It is a girl (with a voice impediment) that treasures her green parrot Paulie. The parrot thinks and speaks like a human being and gives help and advice to his constant companion. <br /> <br /> The parrot is definitely the star of the movie. Sometimes naughty and other times in attacks of depression, the bird captures the mood in the most remarkable and expressive way. The synchronized voice is also very well done and in a minute or two you can really believe that this intelligent little bird exists. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, his father gives the bird to a moneylender and the subsequent scenes tell The story of Paulie's constant struggle for many years to reunite with his lover. One of the many memorable scenes is when he falls into bad company and is encouraged to spy on people who use ATMs. It seems that Paulie has a phenomenal memory. <br /> <br /> The ending is predictable, but who would like it to be otherwise. Kids will love this movie and anyone who has a bird as a pet will be delighted with Paulie's antics.
