Those who love Elivra like I did in their stewardship duties of the night of the night, they will love this movie, she is just great, her car is great, and she is a bit like a Dolly Parton from Transylvania, she is so innocent and naive at times and sexy all the time - more, more than a touch of Mae West - <br /> <br /> The sets are also well made, and the comic book cast is excellent, with Edie McClurg in her Best usual moment - besides Sally Kellerman as Patty is hilarious. Every time I have to do something to make a dressing, I'll think about how Elvira crunches the fries - <br /> <br /> This movie is to be seen again and again, just for the fun of it. Now I have to get the sequel, Elvira's Haunted Hills, and see if it is up to this ...
