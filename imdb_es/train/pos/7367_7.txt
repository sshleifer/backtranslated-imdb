I am currently doing film studies at the A.S level and "this is not a love song" is a movie that we saw and, in my opinion, it is a film with a very simple story but with a complex background story. If you scratch the surface, you'll find a thriller movie chasing two men running across the field from the farmers, after committing a murder: "It sounds pretty exciting." <br /> <br /> However, you should go deeper in Discover the true feeling of the true genre. As suggested, it is a love story between two homosexual lovers, full of confidence, deceit and betrayal. They do not talk to us about this "love" directly through the film, but about the events that happen, for example, the way Heaton acts towards Spike almost screams this love story intact in our faces. <br /> <br /> In general, this film is a good example of why British films should not be dismissed as "garbage" simply because they are made on a low budget. <br /> <br /> A good movie with a complex plot, however, is definitely an acquired taste. and possibly not suitable for the average fan of Hollywood blockbusters.
