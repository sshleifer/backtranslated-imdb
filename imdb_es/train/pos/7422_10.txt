As a fan of Barbra for a long time, any publication like this will be partial. Apart from that, this movie is classified as a classic. It has its flaws (emphasized in other publications), but it gives a look at a time (late 70's) that will never be there again, and it's fascinating to see it unfold on the screen. <br /> <br /> Streisand fought hard to make this movie of his. I do not think she was ever satisfied. But he gives his fans a new Barbra (for the moment) with LIVE singing, a young appearance and a bit of heavy acting. <br /> <br /> The story is harsh, but exciting, and interesting. throughout. The extended "end" of a painting is difficult for most fans who are not from Barbra, but he says a lot to those who admire his talent. <br /> <br />
