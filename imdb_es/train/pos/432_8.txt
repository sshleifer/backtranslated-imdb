I only saw it because it was starring Josie Lawrence, whom I knew <br /> <br /> from Whose Line is Allway ?, The extravagant British improvisation <br /> <br />. I was pleasantly surprised by this moving and magical gem. It is uplifting, moving and <br /> <br /> romantic without being shy or sentimental. The characters are <br /> <br /> all real people, with weaknesses, fears and real needs. Look at it.!
