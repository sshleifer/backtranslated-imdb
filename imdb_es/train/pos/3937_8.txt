Abe Lincoln's early career is very well presented by Ford. Not that anyone alive has seen images of the real Lincoln, but Fonda, with a fake nose, is as amazing as Lincoln, with the voice, the delivery, the walking and other manners, exactly as one might imagine it would have been Lincoln. Ford, in the first of three consecutive films he made with Fonda, is at its best, perfectly evoking the America of the early nineteenth century. The story centers on a pair accused of murder that Lincoln defends and the scenes of the court are pretty well done. The cast includes many of Ford's regular customers. This was the last film by Alice Brady, since she died months after its release.
