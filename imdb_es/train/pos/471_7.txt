This film is starring Emily Watson, of the fame of Breaking the Waves. This film about a man's obsession takes place in a tourist center where a chess tournament is held. A chess teacher arrives and shortly afterwards he falls madly in love (at first sight) with a woman, played by Emily Watson. She falls in love with this strange man, obsessed with chess. All this is to the dismay of his mother, who is much more interested in seeing her with another young gentleman; A suitable gentleman. Her mother feels that this is only a passing whim for the young woman, since she has a tendency to accept strange animals and so on. What follows is mainly a journey through the psyche of man. Tell the story of how your past is closely related to your present. Emily Watson is amazing in this, as is the actor who plays the main character. It's definitely slow, but it's worth seeing. The end was even satisfactory. :)
