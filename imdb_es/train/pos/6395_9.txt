For me, this is one of the best movies I've seen. Overcoming racism, fighting for life and showing that it is not just a common "cookie", Carl Brashear is an incredible character to interpret, which puts Cuba in its best point of view. , the best performance in your life. De Niro, who is a living legend, gives THAT something to the movie. He hated his character in the movie, but he gives a lot of good acting to this movie, a great performance. And the appearance of the beautiful Charlize was and as always is a great advantage for each film. So, if you have not seen this movie, I highly recommend it to those who love courage, greatness who seek inspiration. You must see this great drama. My vote 9/10.
