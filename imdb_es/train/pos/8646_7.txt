In 1990, Brad Pitt and Juiliette Lewis made a television show Too Young To Die, where both played the same type of parts they do in Kalifornia. I have no doubt that that is what led them to participate in this big-screen movie. <br /> <br /> Kalifornia meets aspiring writer David Duchovny and his girlfriend, art photographer Michelle Forbes in a difficult relationship due to Duchovny's obsession. with writing a book and getting into the minds and souls of serial killers. In fact, he has a very unusual odyssey planned, he wants to go cross-country and visit the sites of several famous serial killers. But he and Forbes have no problems. <br /> <br /> Destiny intervenes in more ways than financially with the arrival of Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis, a pair of strange southern types who agree to divide the cost of gas in this country. trip. It turns out that Pitt himself is a serial killer and decides to do a little investigation on his own, delving into the mind of someone who is fascinated with amorality. <br /> <br /> Kalifornia is not the kind of movie I normally use. Go, but in fact, the acting ability and the charisma of Brad Pitt make it work to a large extent. Pitt is the itinerant definition of an innate Gothic refugee from Deliverance. But better than him is Juliette Lewis, who is once again playing with these types of low self-esteem that she seems to be doing well. He watches his scene with Forbes while combing his hair and Lewis describes his sad and pathetic life. Lewis's dialogue and Forbes reactions should be shown in acting classes across the country. <br /> <br /> For those who like their slasher movies, they are no better than Kalifornia.
