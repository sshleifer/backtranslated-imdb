I only picked this up on DVD and saw it again. I love bright colors in front of dark images. He's not a big fan of Beatty, but this is an excellent popcorn movie. Pacino is amazing, as always, and well, this movie marked the period when Madonna was her absolute sexiest. I wish I had stayed with the "Breathless" look for a while longer. The first big role of Charlie Korsmo, apart from "What about bob?". The makeup effects were cutting edge then and still remain for the most part. Beautiful landscapes and humor transport you directly to a comic book environment. Cars, costumes, buildings and even lampposts are a great tone, not to mention the perfect lighting, although scenes with a lot of red can be a bit annoying, since they tend to be a little out of focus. I just wish Beatty had the chance to make a sequel. In short, some fun hours.
