I really liked that movie. It was almost the same as the first one (cabin by the lake), only instead of just killing women, he also kills men. And the scenes are much more interesting, 2 of my favorite scenes are, first of all, when Stanley and Allison are in the dance club and he describes Kimberly's last moments before they throw her in the water, and secondly, when Stanley visits Allison in his basement, just before they go down to the set, when she kisses him. Those scenes, for me, were very intense and fascinating. I gave the film a rating of 8/10, not because the movie was bad, but because the filming was bad, I mean, there were times when they noticed that it was not bad, as if it was filmed in the same way as a movie. shot, you would not see the camera shot "live", but then, very little, you would notice the filming errors. What went wrong ??
