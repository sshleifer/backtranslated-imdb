Raising Victor Vargas is a movie that you definitely need to see. He was very sentimental and had a lot of humor that leaves you trapped. It's very similar to real life with what teenagers have to go through. Victor, an arrogant teenager, but with a good heart, in the end deals with love in all the right places to deal with girls and family. In the end, Victor learns the true meaning of love after dealing with an old-fashioned grandmother and a girl he wants to use, in fact he is using it too. I recommend people to watch this movie because it will be as if you are watching a real family. That's how much this movie has. An important moment was when Victor's grandmother threw the victor over something simple. Victor was really the heart and I could not believe that she would do something like that. It made me feel very bad for him as if he were real. In general I give this movie a B +
