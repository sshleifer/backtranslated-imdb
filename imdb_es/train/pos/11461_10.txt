In addition to the fact that, in general, it is incredible that this film has exceeded all my expectations, this masterpiece of the history of cinema portrays the excessive use of crap filters at its best. Paul Johansson and Craig Sheffer show a sibling conflict with everything that needs to be done. As usual a woman concieling her true intentions. The ending came as surprising as improbable as the murder of Keith Scott by his older brother. <br /> <br /> The scenes in 'land of Vikings' are just as I remember it from my first time travels. - To be honest, my strong passion for trash films makes this a necessity in my never-ending collection. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to all the people in love with the most incredible sibling cast of One Tree Hill. <br /> <br /> -Odin-
