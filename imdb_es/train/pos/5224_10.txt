Ayone, who complains that this movie was crap or had no argument, must have been looking for "Jean de Florrette". HELLO! This movie was made to be a random act of comedy and in no way involves a plot in any way or form. I would also like to remind these complainants that if they are going to flay the shit out of this movie, they seem to be missing something. This film is made clearly for people who do not appreciate the so-called "American humor", which I think is a lot of garbage. The point is that everyone has an opinion and you should be a little more grateful that some people's sense of humor is not in line with yours before shooting you. <br /> <br /> Thanks
