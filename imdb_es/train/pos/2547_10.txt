One does not get to enjoy this gem, the Invisible Ray of 1936, often. But you can not forget. The story is elegant. Karloff, austere and bitter in his retreat from the Carpathian mountain, is Janos Rukh, a scientific genius who reads ancient rays of light to determine events in the great geological past, particularly the shock of a powerful radioactive meteor in Africa. Next to him is the always elegant Lugosi (like a rare hero), who studies "astro-chemistry". Frances Drake is the charming and underutilized young wife; Frank Lawton romantic temptation; and the divine Violet Kemble Cooper is Mother Rukh, in a performance worthy of Maria Ospenskya. <br /> <br /> The story moves quickly in bold episodes, with special effects that are still attractive. It also contains some wonderful lines. A Rukh restores his mother's sight and asks: "Mother, can you see, can you see?" "Yes, I can see more clearly than ever, and what I see frightens me." Even better when Mother Rukh says: "He violated the first law of science." I am not alone among my acquaintance for having baffled for many years exactly what this first law of science is. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely material from a desert island.
