I came across this movie when I was 8-10 years old on a cold, dark November afternoon. I was out playing all day, freezing, and when I arrived around 4 pm, I had a cup of hot chocolate and sat in front of the television with a blanket. I was surprised to see a caricature that was not entirely happy and silly, and in fact it was dark and moralistic. It captured my imagination. I'm sure the text is lost, and it's abbreviated in all the wrong places for Tolkien's purist. But it still captures the spirit of history, the option of carrying a burden for the good of others, the consequences of selfish, reckless decisions, etc. The quality of the animation leaves room for the complaint. But the only place where this film rises clearly above the new films are the voice characterizations. John Hurt is great at this. If you do not like how the character is drawn, look the other way and just listen to it. His voice is extraordinary. I've seen it again many, many times and it always brings me back to that time, like a child, thirsty for some magical adventure. It is for this reason that I say 'lucky', the film is nostalgic for me, so I ignore its flaws. But between John Hurt and Tolkien's fantasy, it still came to me, and still does.
