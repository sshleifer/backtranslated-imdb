As the title is in English and IMDb shows the main language of this program as English, I will concentrate on revising the English version of Gundam Wing (2000) as presented in the DVD set released by Bandai. My actual review for the whole series is in the IMDb entry of "" Shin kid√¥ senki Gundam W "(1995). <br /> <br /> Very little has changed regarding the plot, script and characterization, its English adaptation and it really depends on your taste to choose which language to see this show in. Purists can stick to Japanese everything they want, but for a more "realistic" experience, I recommend the track in English since all the characters, except Heero Yuy, they are not Japanese. (Most of them are Caucasian, in fact, with a couple of non-Japanese Asians.) On the one hand, the personalities of the characters appear more "directly" than in the Japanese version. the characters are stronger thanks to some -or take action, but a very well-formed group of actors. <br /> <br /> Wing Gundam pilot, Heero Yuy, is a highly trained soldier who represses his emotions but learns slowly the value of his humanity. Expressed by Mark Hildreth Deadpan delivery can be criticized as "bad acting" but matches Heero's personality very well. <br /> <br /> Deathscythe Duo Maxwell of Gundam, always happy in the face of death, receives an intensive course in caring for the value of life and friends. It is possibly the best character of the entire show, played masterfully by Scott McNeil. It may sound a bit too old for its age, but Duo's English voice easily comes out of his irritating Japanese nasal. <br /> <br /> Trowa, the Heavyarms pilot, is a lonely lost soul that until now has only one purpose. combat state despite his inner desire to form connections with the people around him, he only knows how to kill, not befriend. Kirby Morrow offers a grim but realistic performance like Trowa Barton. <br /> <br /> Quatre Rebarba Winner is the voice of Brad Swaile, who has no trouble revealing the loving nature of the character and the destruction of his innocence while experiencing the horrors. Of war and death at first hand. A big point in favor is that Quatre no longer sounds like a girl (and yes, an actress expresses it in the Japanese version), but a typical man of 15 years of good faith. <br /> <br /> The impulsive but determined The voice of Wufei Chang by Ted Cole may seem a little exaggerated, but it plays in stark contrast to the fainter roles of Heero and Trowa. <br /> <br /> Relena Darlian sounds older in English, voiced by Lisa Ann Bailey. This might not look good with his youth personification at the beginning of the series, but as his character matures later in the story, his voice follows his example and ends up fitting very well with the character's development. <br /> <br /> Zechs Merquise is one of the most drastically changed voices compared to the Japanese version. Both voices draw different sides of the same character. His Japanese voice is haughty, authoritative and demands respect, staying in line with his high status and charismatic nature. His voice in English by Brian Drummond is more tenuous, sounds more twisted and "snake", highlighting the secret nature of Zechs with respect to his hidden agendas and firm beliefs in his ideals. <br /> <br /> OZ members are a really mixed bag. Treize Kushrenada, voiced by David Kaye, is given a more realistic and realistic performance compared to his larger Japanese speaking style. However, Lady Une does not transmit her personality divided with as much contrast as in the Japanese version and Lucrencia Noin only sounds ......... boring most of the time. Cannon fodder pilots and military leaders are nothing to talk about either. <br /> <br /> I would have liked them to take the time to give different accents to different characters to reflect their ethnicity. The voices of Maganac's bodies were generally lacking in inspiration, but they could have been more interesting if they were accented by the Middle East. The members of the Romerfeller Foundation would also have sounded better with an elegant European accent that reflects their nobility status. <br /> <br /> Despite the disappointing performance of the supporting characters, the main cast manages to carry the show and results in a less exaggerated and more realistic general version of the Gundam Wing script. Very true to the original Japanese script, it retains all the underlying ideas and themes that prompt thinking about politics, war and human nature. Unfortunately, it also retains the flaws of the original Japanese script.
