I finally saw these episodes in 2008 and I had to continually go back and check when they actually occurred. They are absolutely terrifying in the sense that they had fun in what would be the future. Either Parker and Stone lived in Texas and witnessed the idiocy of Gov Bush or are those strange and disturbing people who pay attention to things. Boo, fear! The brothers of the Bush fraternity invading the White House dressed as Arabs wielding rifles? Bush 'accidentally' executing someone? (No, wait, he did that as a government) This may seem like a failure like a comedy at that moment, but now it should be considered a bright, if spooky prescience.
