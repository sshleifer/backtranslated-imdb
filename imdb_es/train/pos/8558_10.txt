He always enjoys the great performance of Drew Barrymore and his great performance in this film, where he plays a very complicated girl, (Holly Gooding), "Skipped Parts", 2000, who leaves New York and travels to California and shares an apartment. with a promising writer, George Newbern, (Patrick Highsmith), "Far Harbor", '96. Holly starts to see many strange things and she looks for her brother in a mental institution after he killed his father. If you look closely enough, you'll see Drew Barrymore's mother in real life appear as her mother in this picture. If it were not for the good acting of Drew Barrymore and George Newbern, this movie should be seen only on Halloween Night! However, it sure has its surprises in the FINAL !!!!
