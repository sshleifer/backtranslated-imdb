OK Clara Bow, the 1927 silent film, is a Rain spin-off, with Bow portraying the wild Hawaiian daughter of the king of the local pineapple who falls in love with the ingenious English engineer Clive Brook. Bow competes with the local widow (Arlette Marchal) for his attentions, but both women are surprised when his wife introduces herself (Patricia Dupont). The predatory wife is ready for divorce until she discovers that he could be on the verge of a fortune. Bow solves his quick hash. <br /> <br /> Bow has personality to spare and has some great scenes: his first naked bath, his hula with a grass skirt and the dog rescue scene with Bow and Brook doing their thing. acrobatics <br /> <br /> Note: the list of IMDb credits is wrong. The credits of the film (of the DVD that I have) include Patricia Dupont playing Mrs. Haldane, not Margaret Truax as mentioned in IMDb.
