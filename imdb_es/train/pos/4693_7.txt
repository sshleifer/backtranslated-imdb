Johnny Dangerously falls completely in the category of success or lack with his exaggerated gags and the complete lack of a complete script or a story that has ANY sense. But that's the point, right? <br /> <br /> The cast is nice; Michael Keaton was an excellent comic artist before he took himself too seriously as the years went by. Griffin Dunne, Peter Boyle, Joe Piscopo, Marilu Henner and Danny DeVito present themselves with enthusiasm and at least they laugh a lot at me. But the whole scene thief here is Richard Dimitri (sneaking the word "Ice Holes" in film history) like a mobster who likes to kill the English language the most. <br /> <br /> I associate many childhood memories with this movie, as I saw it very often, so I may be more prone to enjoy it than many others. Johnny Dangerously is, at least, a completely innocent gangster movie that even transmits some well-intentioned messages about the dangers of smoking (and sex). <br /> <br /> I like it, but it's hard to recommend. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10.
