I can not believe they took this from the air. Especially when they only had a few more episodes left. My daughter, my sister and some of my friends loved seeing this show. We were so upset when they stopped showing this because of the so-called classifications. It is not fair to the people who saw this show from the beginning. We had the right to see the end. I would like you to vote for all people with a voting system 3 times a year. They could send documents by mail and we, as spectators, could give a general vote on all the programs we see or have heard. This could also help promote a new show. People would see it and wonder what it is. Not only can you see what viewers see, but you can also use this as a free advertising tool for television and cable channels. We want to see the other episodes. Bring it back !!
