As a horse lover you can only appreciate this movie. There are few movies that show horsemanship like this one does. I would love to know if Brian makes his own career in the film. I would also like to know if you like horses. Brian has been in many movies where he has ridden. Where did you learn to ride? The only part that I find difficult to take is that the driving scenes are always completely tilted, as if a horse could run forever at full speed. The camera work is first class and captures the horses in a way that shows how dangerous things can be on a horse. It would be very interesting to know how they did to see this movie and find all the very good riders.
