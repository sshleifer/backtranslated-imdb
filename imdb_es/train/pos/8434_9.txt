I've always been a fan of the series, so I must admit that I'm partial. When the execution of the program ended, I felt that many questions remained unanswered. This movie for me felt like a close. Seeing all the people I followed in recent years together was finally the most rewarding. I've heard that this is probably the only Homicide movie we can hope for. If so, this is the proper way out. This film is sometimes moving, sometimes annoying, but always satisfying. If you are or have ever been a fan of the series, watch this movie.
