I have seen this movie several times here at the university, and every time I show it, the number of people that come with me increases exponentially ... besides the virgins, anyone who has already shown NEEDS to see it again! It takes a while to enter, but in the end the whole room is screaming, shouting, rewinding scenes repeatedly, repeating the dialogue, and totally absorbed in the cinematic experience that is Pia Zadora in "The Lonely Lady"! Scene after scene after scene of the most ineptly filmed, badly written, horribly misunderstood, TRASH is launched against you in a total assault that is located as the smallest thing I have (no small thing, friends). For me, nothing compares to 2 U, Pia ... and I do not think it's the only one that felt that way!
