['I only saw this show a few times, but I will live in my memory. <br /><br /> It is very frustrating that it is so difficult to find this anywhere to buy, and yet there seem to be endless repetitions of things like Friends! Especially even harder to get to be in England, I guess ...? <br /><br /> Do they say they were low grades or was it a complaint from the Bakersfield police? Maybe he was too smart for certain people? <br /><br /> Anyway, almost the comedy that I&#39;d love to see again, but it&#39;s almost impossible to find. Have I heard that it is being or has been repeated in another network? But unfortunately not here! <br /><br /> Summary: Ingenious.']
