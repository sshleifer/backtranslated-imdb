['I do not understand your objections to this movie. It is a tense and exciting extension of the character created in &quot;Basic Instinct&quot;. The only part of the story that is unrealistic is the fact that the character of Sharon Stone is still alive and is not in jail at this late date. <br /><br /> SPOILER ALERT: As the film progresses, we are presented with three theories of what is happening: 1) The character of Sharon Stone is killing all these people because she is crazy (Risk Addicted); 2) David Thewlis&#39; twisted cop is killing these people to frame the character of Sharon Stone; 3) David Morrissey&#39;s analyst is killing these people for revenge. What most annoys the people in the film seems to be that none of these theories is explained as the &quot;real&quot; story. (Although the analyst is in a psychiatric care center to kill the policeman, the only murder that occurs on the screen). <br /><br /> I think this is a brilliant plot device in the spirit of &quot;2001, A Space Odyssey.&quot; TO WHOM DOES IT MATTER WHAT IS REAL? The blonde is really crazy, the cop really is crooked and the analyst really wants revenge. The important thing is the interaction between these and other characters in the story. As in real life, we are all more complicated than anyone thinks and reality is more complicated than a movie. Get over!']
