I bought "The Feast of All Saints" and it's not really a horrible movie, but many things could have been better. It had a lot of historical value, played by a very talented actress / actors, and it is not an everyday fact that the actors can play that role and that it is something credible. There were some parts that were a little mediocre and confusing, but I would not say that the whole movie was horrible. Once you think about that, to capture the New Orleans of 1800 and do something about it, it's quite difficult and much harder to get actors that those parts can mean. But the only big problem I had with the film was that most of the actors who played free-colored people were mostly light-skinned Africans, not very universal to choose others who were not light-skinned; One of the old criollo stereotypes that still exist. Whoever chose the cast could have chosen a wider variety in terms of tonality, even though many Creoles are color conscious. Rather, choosing actors that seemed almost white in a certain sense could have been more thought out. The actors did a great job, the script could have been written better and, in general, I found the performances very credible.
