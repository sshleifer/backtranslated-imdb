I think this movie is very funny and horror. I love Elvira and I like this movie. It is a pity that the second part of this wonderful movie has not been successful, because it is very funny as the first part. I also regret that, in addition to this movie, I have not seen Cassandra Peterson in other films. I think she's an incredible actress with a great ... potential. I hope you see it in the future in the third part of Elvira's adventures. Cassandra Peterson is one of my favorite comedians. Cassandra, if you read this, she knows that you are the best and my heart will be with you. You can trust me. What else can I add? This is a great and classic movie!
