I bought this cheap from the rest of the rent at our local store. It was almost in perfect condition, and I had never heard of it before. Clearly, nobody else had. <br /> <br /> I can not believe my luck. It covers the whole realm of emotions and tries to overcome a complex message: the very moral and not triumphalist stance of the Mandela Party, no doubt. Despite its enormous length (I had to see it in two sessions), it was like a book that one could not stop reading. Maybe the songs are not so memorable, but the spirit of the thing shines forever. I can not understand the comments that a musical (clearly designed for the stage) is not realistic! I've seen "South Pacific" and read the book too, and I can guarantee that the musical is not realistic compared to the book. I will treasure this little find until it runs out. One day they will do this again with a better budget. <br /> <br />
