['I enjoyed this movie, maybe because I had not seen any criticism, etc. It was a delight and a little &quot;romp&quot;. I do not know why it did not cause more splashing than it did. In regards to the story, I could relate to some aspects of Paul Reiser&#39;s character, and I could &quot;see my father&quot; in Falk&#39;s character. It made me remember many moments when I was a child and also listen to my grandparents. If you enjoyed movies like Grumpy Old Men or On Golden Pond, this is your movie. A &quot;sleeper&quot;, in my opinion, and one of those stories to feel good. Peter Falk and Paul Reiser had many wonderful verbal fights, but nothing was exaggerated. I would say it qualifies at least an 8, maybe higher.']
