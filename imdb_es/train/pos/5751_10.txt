What can I say about this movie? I have seen it several times since the first time I was 6 years old. I have seen the English version and it is very well done. It is a great movie for all ages, but it is aimed more for children. I love children's humor and I appreciate it. If you have not seen it, you should try to rent a copy, you will not be disappointed!
