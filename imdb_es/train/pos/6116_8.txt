['This movie is like the kettle. You love him or hate him. If you enter this film, you expect a suitable movie with decent production values, a good plot and great characters that you will hate. If you enter this movie waiting for a low budget destroyer, you will probably hate it. <br /><br /> If you enter this movie expecting to see one of the most disturbed characters ever filmed in the form of Harry Russo, you will love it. John Giancaspro is absolutely brilliant in his top portrait of the crazy demented and coca killer. <br /><br /> The special effects are abysmal at best, but really, who cares? If you are the kind of person who is ready to see a Schizophreniac movie: The Whore Mangler, you have undoubtedly seen dozens of horror movies full of blood. With the budget for which this movie was made, even if they had tried it, it probably would have been mediocre at best. I would rather laugh at something abysmal than not be affected by the mediocre. <br /><br /> To summarize, you will probably hate this movie, but if you are one of the few who decides to watch it anyway, it will become the best since sliced bread # 2, I hate the kettle.']
