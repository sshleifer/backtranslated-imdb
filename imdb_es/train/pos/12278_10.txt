Well, I said everything in the summary, I just love the film and the cast ... I would give each actor an Oscar ... great, great movie ... I am 25 years old now and I saw it 4 times in different periods and always I think I will not cry and I always do it, about 2 or 3 times ...;) meryl s. It was absolutely brilliant, Jeremy Irons too ... just brilliant ... I wish the movie received more awards ... I really do not know anyone who has seen it and did not like it ... also, Glenn Close was fantastic. .. the story was beautiful and sad at the same time ... I loved the fact that, despite everything, Clara and Esteban loved each other so much and that Blanca was close to her parents ...
