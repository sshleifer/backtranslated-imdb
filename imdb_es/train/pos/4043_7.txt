['Live <br /><br /> Alive is a very entertaining SCI-FI movie from Japan. I have noticed many disappointed movie fans who loved Versus, this director&#39;s debut film or his third film, Azumi. I&#39;ve heard they are blood-filled movies with swords and zombies and all kinds of goodies. Frankly, I went to the video store to get Versus, but I&#39;m fine with Alive. <br /><br /> If you are looking for an action from start to finish from wall to wall, Alive is not your choice. There is a lot of action, however, it is a reward for a full hour of character development. Personally I think it&#39;s well done and worth it. <br /><br /> Of course, part of the plot is silly as with many SCI-Fi action movies and I think the subtitles that use the term strange object could have been replaced by parasites for a greater effect. This film is brutal when it needs to be so weak of heart that it does not have to be applied. <br /><br /> They kept the budget low for the most part, limiting all the action to an underground building (following the example of the cube), but the film does not suffer for it. Another advantage of this film are the intense gothic images that are made with great artistic talent during the many flashbacks and sequences of dreams. <br /><br /> Rent this!']
