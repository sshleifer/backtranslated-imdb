The night listener is probably not one of William's best roles, but he is a very interesting character in a somewhat strange but very different movie. I can guarantee you have never seen this type of movie. Some people may not like the slow pace of this movie, but I think it's the big advantage of the movie. Definitely, it is one of the best movies that have come out in the year 2006. It has an intriguing performance in a movie with great content, a dramatic feel. This is not an Americanized movie. Nor is it a predictable movie. You just feel that it's a movie that has secrets and that you have a hard time determining what the result will be. This is not an excellent movie that has everything, but hell, it's a very good and very original movie.
