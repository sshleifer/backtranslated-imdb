I just saw this movie today at the Seattle International Film Festival and I thoroughly enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> Excellent writing and direction, an excellent and credible interaction between the cast, and a great comic timing too. <br /> <br /> This film touches themes that are the universal family and separation. As a result, I can see that the European, Asian and American public find points of similarity between this film and their own lives. <br /> <br /> If all that was not enough, this has the potential to be the best underground dating movie of the year ... someone distribute this in the United States, please! <br /> <br /> Finally: Thank you Maria Flom! It really is a great movie.
