Oh man, why? "Six Degrees" is a show about this so-called theory that we are all linked by someone. If I focus on the life of a group of people and the consequences of their actions. <br /> <br /> When I first heard this show, it did not catch my attention at all. It seemed too ordinary, really. Then, I saw some episodes ... and I loved it! First, the characters. All are well written and are different from each other. There is an alcohol addict, a woman whose girlfriend cheats on her, a woman who has just lost her husband, a driver who has a brother with problems, etc. Unlike what we are used to, most of the characters interact with each other. In casualties, as in our daily routines. Cool! My favorites are Mae, Carlos and Whitney. <br /> <br /> Then, the cast. They are all great. Jay Hern√°ndez, from "Hostel", shows his acting skills in a character more 3D than his previous work as Paxton. The others also give excellent performances, especially Campbell Scott, who plays Steven and Bridget Moynahan, who plays Whitney. <br /> <br /> Well, when I got to IMDb, after watching some episodes, I could not believe it was like that. It was canceled. Seriously, I can not understand the low grades. <br /> <br /> It's a pity that I have not had more than one season. It would really be a good show to follow!
