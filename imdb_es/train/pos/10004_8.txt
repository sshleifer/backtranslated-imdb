This is not the comedian Robin Williams, nor the peculiar / insane Robin Williams of the recent fame of the thriller. This is a hybrid of the classic drama without excessive dramatization, mixed with the new love of Robin of the thriller. But this is not a thriller, per se. This is more of a mystery / suspense vehicle through which Williams tries to locate a sick child and his caregiver. <br /> <br /> Also starring Sandra Oh and Rory Culkin, this suspense drama looks a lot like a news report, until William's character comes close to achieving his goal. <br /> <br /> I must say that I entertained myself a lot, although this film does not teach, guide, inspect or entertain. He felt more like he was seeing a boy (Williams), since he was actually performing the actions, from the perspective of a third person. In other words, it felt real, and I was able to subscribe to the premise of the story. <br /> <br /> In general, it is worth seeing, although it is definitely not the Friday / Saturday night rate. <Br /> <br /> Rate a 7.7 / 10 of ... <br /> <br /> the Devil :.
