"Footlight Parade" is fascinating on many levels. Of course, there is no way that the "theatrical prologues" supposedly represented have been produced in any theater on earth. Think of the huge pools and the three-story tall fountains for "By A Waterfall", for example. (Berkeley directed John Garfield in "They Made Me a Criminal" six years later and had the Dead End Kids sing "By a Waterfall" while showering.) <br /> <br /> "Shanghai Lil" is the best Production number in the image. It is a catalog of the Warner Bros sensibilities of the 30s. Keep in mind that the African boys mixed on the scene with white and Asian prostitutes. You would never see blacks integrated into a social scene in other films of the time unless they were porters on a train or maids in a big house. Here the blacks are sitting in the bar and singing with the others. It also thrills me when the military dancers make a presentation of the card section of the Roosevelt image. There is also the NRA eagle, the logo of the controversial New Deal National Recovery Administration. FDR was the new president and the hopes were so high that it would lift the nation out of the Depression. Of course, you would never see anything so oriented to the working class coming out of MGM. Warner Bros. unconditionally supported the uprising dictated by the F.D.R. administration. <br /> <br /> The dear little Miss Ruby Keeler was never better than her playing the Chinese prostitute, "Lil". He hardly even looks at his feet while dancing, which was one of his characteristic defects. <br /> <br /> The Pre-Code code is fun. The number "Por una cascada" is wonderful in that sense. The girls put on their swimsuits on the bus full of people passing through Times Square with all the lights on. The extended eagle girls that swim over the camera provide the kind of crotch shots that would not be seen in 35 years. In a few months, the Production Code would eliminate such mischievous pleasures.
