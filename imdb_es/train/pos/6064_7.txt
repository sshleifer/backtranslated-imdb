['I should start by telling you how I came across this movie. It was the winter season in Alaska around 1990. A friend of mine from Australia stayed with me and my girlfriend in the shoebox of an apartment. Winters in Alaska can be a bit brutal and most people stay indoors, drink a lot and watch anything that comes on television. I had found this movie outside a thrift store on a snow bank and, immediately, it was a treasure. the best worst movie in history. We spent the next two weeks watching this movie and drinking like a fish. We saw it so many times, in fact, that sometimes we flipped the television sideways or down for a fuller filling effect. It is a true gem. The laughter will come without stopping and the memories will last forever. If you see this movie for rent in a video store, steal it. You will not regret!']
