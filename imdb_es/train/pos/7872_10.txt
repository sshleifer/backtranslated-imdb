The first review I saw on page 3 read: "What does Bhandarkar ultimately mean?" If he says something so decisive. <br /> <br /> The most beautiful thing on page 3 is that it does not take sides. There is no propaganda. This is the movie that captures so many angles of a problem (I do not know what I call a "problem" here), and yet, like any mediocre movie, it does not offer a solution. I was so intrigued when I realized that the film ended almost on the same stage as if it started. <br /> <br /> The film defines so many characters that are completely with completely different priorities and different ideologies and, nevertheless, they are all a part of the system that is so much more apathetic. I wish I could say more, but there would be more spoilers ahead. So look if you want to see one of the most mature films of recent times.
