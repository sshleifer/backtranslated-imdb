This is one of the most guilty pleasure movies in history! <br /> <br /> I am ashamed to say that my favorite character is TISH, but I still enjoy seeing her doing her space attire "like super cool" with a "like totally Bitchin" belt and stick in rhinestones on her face. <br /> <br /> But anyway, the movie is actually one of the few "family" movies that are of interest to you. I know the beginning is prolonged, especially if you know what is going to happen, but the second half is probably one of the most stressful segments in a family movie. <br /> <br /> I would not get up. In front of millions of people and claim to love this movie, in fact renting it is quite embarrassing, but I admit it here with the Internet to hide behind. <br /> <br />
