The "comedies" of movies today are usually 100 minutes of toilet humor, obscene language and kicks in the groin. Modern comedies appeal to the lowest common denominator, the undemanding and slow of the brain. Sure, a good occasional comedy will appear, but they are getting weirder. <br /> <br /> "Mr. Blandings Buildings, your Dream House" shows what Hollywood was capable of in the 1940s, and is simply funny. Jim and Muriel Blandings (Cary Grant and Myrna Loy) decide to build a house in the suburbs of Connecticut. The film follows its history, beginning with the trips of search of houses, the unbridled construction of the house, until arriving at the finished house, with its "zuzz-zuzz water softener". <br /> <br /> Grant and Loy are perfect for their roles, of course (Grant is particularly funny when he observes that house costs get out of control). However, the film is stolen by the wise lawyer of Blandings, interpreted to perfection by Melvyn Douglas. Trying to steal all the scenes he is in, Douglas is underestimated and funny as he watches the Blandings move from one crisis to another. Reginald Denny as the harassed architect of the Blandings and Harry Shannon as the old water well driller are also wonderful. <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie several times and it always makes me laugh. I think it's a good movie to see when you need an elevator, whether you're building a house or not.
