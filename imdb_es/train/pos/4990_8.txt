As other critics have pointed out, this is a film from the era of unjustly neglected depression. Directed by Frank Borzage (two Oscars) and written by Jo Swerling (Leave Her to Heaven, The Westerner, Lifeboat, etc.), it is a hard, well-structured movement carried out on the inhabitants of a shanty town in New York. . They are grifters, beggars and women forced into prostitution, but they are a community of good and bad people, with loyalties as complex as any group. <br /> <br /> Perhaps among the many admirable qualities of this film. is the contrast between the character of Spencer Tracy, Bill and Trina of Loretta Young. He speaks rudely, is physically aggressive and obviously has no fear, but Bill is not the character that gives this movie its sense of survival. While he teases, Trina actually stays tough (if that term can be applied to such a feminine character). His devotion to him is obvious and complete. When she becomes pregnant, she says she will increase it herself if he wants to leave, or "I'll even give the child if you're just happy." Such is the dignity of Loretta Young's performance (at age 20) as a fairly simple character, who does not seem weak or dependent, but rather a woman who recognizes happiness when she finds it and does not want anything else.
