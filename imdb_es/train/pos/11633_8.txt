Red Eye is not the kind of movie that Palme D'or will win, but anyway, Wes Craven has never been that kind of director, and his brand is a good indication of what a spectator can expect. <Br /> <br /> The fact that Red Eye is a small and undemanding package at 94 minutes is part of its charm and an indication of Craven's ability in the production of light meals, but generally enjoyable, in Box Office. In fact, it is the perfect type of movie to show as entertainment on board, keeping the attention without putting any intellectual or emotional challenge on the viewer. <br /> <br /> In general, there is a cheesy feeling in the plot, terrorist subplot lazy motivation and secondary characters, and the main section has a television movie feel. However, there are definite elements of Hitchcock's suspense and echoes of Schumacher's phone booth, which ultimately is a more sophisticated (and pretentious) game about the very idea that emotional crisis is suppressed in public. <br /> <br /> For a film that focuses primarily on two people sitting in airline seats, lives or dies in the characters and the script. The ingenious but eloquent Jackson Rippner of Cillian and Rachel MacAdams, ingenious Lisa, are the main reasons why the film takes the film. <br /> <br /> In the final part of the film, Craven gives himself a bit, but he also gives Adam's Rib-like dimension to his 'male logic' battle against female 'sensitivity' . Scream style as a man-persecutions-girl-with-knife. The most surprising revelation here is how Brian Cox looks after the treatment 'Just for Men', his omnipresent appearance in films as diverse as Super Troopers, The Ring and this make it the sexegenarian version of Jude Law. <br /> <br /> Short-distance fun.
