Make the world go away. Get him out of my shoulder. Say the things you used to say and make the world go away. <br /> <br /> Well, Dave (David Hewlett) and Andrew (Andrew Miller) were in a mess, one for embezzlement and the other for kissing a child. Neither of them was guilty, but in front of the charges and their house about to be demolished, they finished, well, nothing. Everyone, except his house, left. <br /> <br /> It's a little weird, but also fun. What would you do if you were alone in the world? The two friends simply enjoy each other's company and do what they want. But, that gets old fast, it seems. <br /> <br /> Then they begin to improve their lives by hating the memories. The sound effects during this were great. <br /> <br /> Things really got weird in the end. This film was the product of a great imagination, and written and directed by Vincenzo Natali, with the help of the two stars. You just have to see it.
