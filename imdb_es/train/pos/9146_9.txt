This electrifying musical has more than a breath of selfishness from its star, the musical genius that is Prince. The movie has about 90 minutes of presentation, but it's actually easy to see why it's a cult classic. <br /> <br /> Like other films that center around the young musician who struggles to be great, this has a touch of drama in him to add a dimension to the musical numbers. While this movie is not as good as 8 miles as a recent example, this is entertaining and the soundtrack is much better. On the dramatic side of things, the story centers around Kid (Prince), a young artist and a regular place in a club. The owner of the club is frustrated with the arrogance of the Children and Little knows the Child who could soon be fired and replaced by a rival. On the one hand, Kid's parents are having problems, with his father abusing her violently. During the course of the film, the child learns some lessons from life and learns to appreciate more of his friends. It is all we have seen in the dramas of coming of age, of course, but this is combined as a musical, a very stylized musical. <br /> <br /> The cast is good. Prince is actually quite good on the drama side, when he is not doing a pose. It seems human and relatable. Clarence Williams is very good as the abusive parent too. Appollonia Kotero makes a good debut as Princes sexy love love. <br /> <br /> The main strength of the film, however, is the magnificent soundtrack. The musical numbers are well staged and electrifying. Prince is undoubtedly a musical teacher, although very eccentric. When he is inspired, it is great, but on the other hand, he often makes songs that are only for his own taste, and sometimes his experimentation can fail, but that is the same for many musical geniuses. However, the soundtrack of this film is excellent, since only Sexshooter is a weak point. However, the outstanding performance of Purple Rain is the highlight. It's one of my favorite songs of all time. *** <br /> <br />
