['I just read the original story written by Pu in the eighteenth century. Surprisingly, the film despises the original spirit very well, although the plot was greatly modified. The cinematic language, the rhythm, the special effect are all from Hollywood, but there is still a Chinese core. It&#39;s amazing how Hark Tsui managed to combine them. The result is pure beauty.']
