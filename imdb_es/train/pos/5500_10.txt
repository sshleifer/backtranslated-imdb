This documentary (now freely available on Video.Google.Com) is a fantastic demonstration of the power of ordinary people to overcome injustice. Everyone should see this. <br /> <br /> Chávez was elected in an overwhelming vote in 1998. His platform was to divert the fantastic oil wealth of 20% of the middle class to 80% of the poor. Prohibited fishing with foreign driftnets in Venezuelan waters. He sent 10,000 Cuban doctors to the poor neighborhoods to treat the sick for free. It eliminated illiteracy and created new free universities. <br /> <br /> But it was his 30% tax on the profits of the oil companies that got him into trouble with the Bush administration. In 2002, while Irish filmmakers Kim Bartley and Donnacha O'Briain interviewed Chavez inside the Presidential Palace about their social programs, a coup d'état backed by the CIA was launched. With the cameras moving, Chávez was captured and flown out of the country. It was announced on national television that he had "resigned". <br /> <br /> But Venezuela's poor did not believe in the media. They went to the palace by the millions and demanded that Chavez be returned. Faced with such overwhelming numbers, the military attacked the coup leaders and the conspirators fled to the United States. Chávez was rescued by a military helicopter and returned to jubilation.
