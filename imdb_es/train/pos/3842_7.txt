['An occasionally surreal thriller that will push the buttons of most people. The 4th Man is sure to offend anyone with a taste for the politically correct. The protagonist of the story is a bisexual alcoholic Catholic writer, Gerard (Krabbe), with a very twisted sense of imagination. Verhoeven offers up <br /><br /> Gerard has an example of everything that is wrong with modern man. He does not have shifts, delirious, unable to control his impulses, afraid to commit <br /><br /> Significant relationships, and absolutely apathetic about life in general. As the character himself affirms at one point, he is a professional liar, unable to remember the truth. <br /><br /> The film begins with Gerard dreaming of spiders that consume Christ, and then waking up to begin the long march towards his own destruction. He chases <br /><br /> a man (a boyfriend, probably), then chase another in a train station. Later, at a conference, he meets a woman who seems to want to help him, or <br /><br /> Maybe she has more infamous plans. Quickly capture Gerard in his network, seducing him with sex and money, taking many of the two. She also has <br /><br /> Secrets, like three dead husbands. Feels lonely and genuinely seeks someone to nurture, or is a deadly black widow, who draws Gerard to his <br /><br /> death? Will Garard be the fourth man she killed? The woman is Christine (Soutendijk), and Verhoeven does everything possible to keep you guessing what she is up to. <br /><br /> This is an interesting movie, with a lot of sex and intrigue. It is similar to Verhoeven&#39;s <em>basic instinct</em> , but it is much more profound and certainly more striking. There is a lot of very strong gay content, which can make some viewers squirm. Highly recommended for fans of the smart. <br /><br /> Psychological thrillers, or anyone looking for something totally new.']
