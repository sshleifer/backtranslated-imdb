A wonderful movie, full of great discreet performance and a clear and intelligent dialogue. What really distinguishes the film, however, is that underlying current of sadness at all times. History is underlined by issues, loneliness, suicide, disappointment, fear of losing work in a world where this had disastrous consequences. More than anything, it was set in a world that no longer existed, having been destroyed at the beginning of World War II. In fact, the film is hardly a comedy if you compare the percentage of serious scenes with comic scenes. However, it's funny: listen to Margaret Sullivan's harsh dismissal of Jimmy Stewart and notice her expression of pain as she responded that her comments were a remarkable mix of "poetry and pettiness." It's funny, pointy and sad at the same time. A remarkable achievement and one of the ten best screen comedies ever made.
