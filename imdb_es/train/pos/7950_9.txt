First of all, I loved Bruce Broughton's music, very lyrical, and this only contributed to the charm of the film. The best aspect of the film were the three animals, expressed superlatively by Michael J. Fox, Sally Field and the late Don Ameche. While Fox has the funniest lines, Ameche plays a character who is otherwise captivating (the voice of reason), and Field adds wit to a character who always sees himself saying to Chance. Humans were not that attractive, and sometimes the movie crawled, but that's my only complaint. This is a beautiful looking movie, with beautiful shots from near Canada, I think. Although the film itself is quite long, there is never a really boring moment, and this is favored by the voice work and a well-written script. In short, a lovely movie and perhaps underestimated, with a 9/10 on my part. Bethany Cox.
