2 WORDS: Academy Award. Nuff said. This movie had everything in it. Comedy to make me laugh, Drama to make me cry and one of the best dance scenes to rival Breakin 2: Electric Boogaloo. The performance was the tip of any independent film. Jeremy Earl has been in top form for some time since his time at the Joan Cusack Show. His lines were executed with dynamite precision and sharp wit seen for the last time in a young Jimmy Walker. I thought I saw the next appearance of a young Denzel Washington when the line "My bus! It's ... He left" appeared. That was the true turning point of the film. My grandmother loved it so much that I bought the DVD and recommended it to her friends. It will bring tears to your eyes and warmth to your heart when you see the white ribbon of Tony Donato and African-American Nathan Davis. Through thick (held at knife point) and thin (Nathan gives Tony advice on women) the new dynamic duo has arrived and is about to conquer Hollywood.
