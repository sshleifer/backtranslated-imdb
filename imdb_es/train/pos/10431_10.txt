I'm not even sure what to say about this movie. It's one of the few movies I've done that I would consider romantic. Trying to talk about the plot or the performance or the technical details of this film would be, in the words of Frank Zappa, "how to dance about architecture". It absolutely hits the nail right in the head in the way it captures those fleeting moments in life that move us and then run away from us to never be experienced again. It seems that the film version of the character of Charlie Kaufman in the film adaptation wanted to write. the end is open and ambiguous, there is no happy ending here, only mystery. there are no deep life lessons, just a couple of horny and intelligent children who explore the ability to feel the most irrational and unrealistic feelings ...... romantic love. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 look at it with your special lady and I recommend it to a stranger ................
