['This is a great ending to the show. The fact that Admiral Janeway could make a double change in the Borg was great. The fact that she allowed herself to be infected, thus infecting the Queen with a &quot;poison&quot; that, in essence, killed the Borg was great. The way they finished it also left something, not much, for a reunion movie. However, they brought them to &quot;home&quot; and the way they did it was fantastic! It was sad to say goodbye to a part of my family. Ending with Tom and B&#39;Lanna having their baby right when they enter the alpha playground. It was a great way to show a new beginning. It would be nice to have a reunion movie of some kind, just to see where your characters would be today.']
