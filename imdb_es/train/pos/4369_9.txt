I really liked that movie. The landscape was impressive, the plot had some nice twists and turns, and the characters were well rounded. On two fronts, however, "Rob Roy" scored well above average. First, I have rarely seen a "popular" movie in which the quality of the dialogue was so high. There were many cuts and verbal attacks to accompany the brilliant game of choreographed swords. I could give many examples, but why should I? Just watch the movie. Second, this film understood a principle that was rarely recognized anymore. For a drama to be successful, not only a hero is needed, but a truly credible villain. If you do not have one, there is not much joy in encouraging the good ones. And "Rob Roy" does not have one, but three: the Earl of Montrose, his henchman Kilairn and Archie. They are not one-dimensional villains, either, but they are completely discarnate and very unpleasant. It takes a little more patience than "Braveheart": there is more dialogue and the accents are a bit hard, but it is a much more intelligent and subtle piece. (As I said, I loved this movie!)
