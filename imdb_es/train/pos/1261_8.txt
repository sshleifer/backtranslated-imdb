I really liked this movie The three stars (Connery, Fishburne and Underwood) provide credible performance, and Harris is at the top. The lighting and shooting angles in some of Harris' scenes make his face look truly devilish. The surprising twist of the plot at the end makes it interesting. It is not a great movie, but a fun one. I gave him 7 out of 10.
