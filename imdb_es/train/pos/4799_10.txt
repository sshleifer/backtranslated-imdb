Perhaps more than many films, this is not for everyone. For some people, the idea of ​​slowing down, reflecting and allowing things to happen in their own time is a good description of their personal hell. For others, an approach like this speaks of a deep part of themselves that they know exists, some part they long to contact. <br /> <br /> I guess it's a function of where I am in my own life these days, but I count on the camp of this last group. I found the meditative rhythm of this almost hypnotic film, gently guiding me towards some almost mythological realm. This is really a travel story, a rich portrait of the distance that many of us have to travel if we want to complete the cycle at the end of our days. <br /> <br /> As written in Mr. Farnsworth's presentation of Alvin. Direct, although I'm not sure there are words to express the exquisite balance of bewildered sadness and innocence he knew he conjured for us. Knowing now that he was really accepting his own mortality when he sat on the tractor seat, I wish he had the opportunity to spend time with him before his departure. I hope you have had a small glimpse of the satisfaction and truth that you have given so many people, not only to "act" but to share their absolute humanity with such brutal honesty. <br /> <br /> Given the realities of economic production, I am not sure that Mr. Lynch was given credit for the courage he showed in allowing the story to unfold so slowly. I do not understand film production, however, I understand that there are few areas of modern life in which the expression "time is money" is so descriptive. Deepening in our hearts is not a rushed adventure, and to his credit, Lynch seems to have understood that he was not simply telling a story: he was inviting his viewers to spend time with his own mortality. It is not a simple task. <br /> <br /> If you want to experience the power of cinema to present yourself a precious part of yourself, you could do worse than spend a couple of hours with The Straight Story. . And then give yourself a little time for the next, while you listen to its echoes in the small hours of the night.
