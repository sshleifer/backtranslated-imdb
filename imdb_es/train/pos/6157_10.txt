This is a movie I had never thought of seeing until my 3-year-old son saw it in the video store and took it after he liked the cover photo of the animals on Nabooboo Island. We have it and we have seen it repeatedly since then; In fact we have rented it several times since then. There are very few non-animated movies that my son will see and pay attention to; What a nice change from Dumbo and the Little Mermaid. The performance is outstanding, the songs are convincing, they go into your head and you can not help singing. The story, though specifically about WW2 is timeless in its own way and there is something new to see every time you look. I've heard it compared to Mary Poppins, but I think it's two very different movies, both excellent, but somehow my son has no interest in Mary Poppins. This is one of those movies that children will want to see again and again and one that parents will not mind fulfilling. There are days when we see him before nap time and bedtime, and I do not feel the wail that comes when he wants to repeat any other movie.
