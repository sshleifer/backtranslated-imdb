This movie is pretty good. Half a year ago, I bought it on DVD. But first I thought it was the original movie. I've seen the series and it's a good movie, but here they put "The Living Legend, part1 and 2" and "Fire in space" together. The same thing they did with the first movie, but with other episodes. But still, it's a pretty good movie. Only the end is strange (do not see what happens with the Pegasus). But I still think it's pretty good. The actors and special effects were good. If you have not seen it, go see it. Protagonist: Richard Hatch, Dirk Benedict, Lorne Greene, Herb. Jefferson Jr., Tony Swartz, Terry Carter, Lloyd Bridges, Jack Stauffer.
