After watching all the movies of Jesse James, Quantrill, Jayhawkers, etc. In the 1950s, it's quite exciting to see this movie with a new perspective from director Ang Lee. The attack scene in Lawrence, Kansas is awesome. The romantic relationship between Jewel and Toby Mcguire turns out to be one of the best parts and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers stands out as the bad guy. All the time, this movie makes you feel the horror of the war and the desperate situation of the main characters who do not know if they will survive the next few hours. Definitely worth seeing.
