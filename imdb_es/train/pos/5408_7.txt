Out of these Pokémon movies (which are ordered from best to least for me): Pokémon The first movie, Pokémon 4Ever, Pokémon Heroes, Pokémon 200 and Pokémon: Entei and the unknown, this is probably the one that most concerns the environment, possibly The most beautiful and the most tranquil. Whether these are good points for you or not, "Pokemon 4Ever" has still entertained many. <br /> <br /> In addition to the three points mentioned above, this pokemon movie includes good humor and good CGI (besides anime). The theme of the journey in time of the film is well represented and Team Rocket (comic relief / bad trash) end with pretty good gags and end up being more main characters than partners. <br /> <br /> Failures are, as always, violence and action rather unnecessary, and the bad is quite uninteresting, even more than some bad ones from the Pokémon movie. <br /> <br /> A strange pokemon is being located by a pokemon hunter in a forest. A child tries to save the pokemon and takes it somewhere ... <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Ash, Brock and Misty are entering a large forest ... <br /> <br /> Curious ? See the rest ... <br /> <br /> Good for all Pokemon fans and fans of "American" anime movies, enjoy "Pokemon 4Ever"! :-)
