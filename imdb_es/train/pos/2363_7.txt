This adaptation of the short story of MR James 'A View From A Hill' was shown for the first time on British television in 2005, on the small digital channel BBC 4. I saw it repeated again on BBC 4, and I decided to give it a go , recalling the successful adaptations of the BBC in 1970 from other stories of MR James, such as "Whistle And I'm To You You My Lad" and "The Signalman". Although it does not belong to the same class as these masterpieces, 'A View From A Hill' is a pleasant and sometimes suspenseful drama. <br /> <br /> A historian arrives in a small rural town to see the collection of a collector of ancient objects recently deceased. While in the countryside, he sees an abbey that has been in ruins for hundreds of years. But what does this have to do with an old pair of binoculars and an awful legend about the sinisterly named Gallows Hill? And what do the gruff peasant and his servant know about the situation? Although I was not scared in any way, I enjoyed this little production, and if the execution time had lasted more than 40 minutes, it could have become a great adaptation. As it is, everything feels a bit rushed and a little more exposure to establish the mood would have been welcome. <br /> <br /> I give it 7 out of 10.
