['I have seen this film at the avant-garde premiere at the Imagina Festival in Monaco. <br /><br /> I saw the first trailer four years ago, and from this moment, I was waiting to see the final result. I have not been disappointed. <br /><br /> It is a complete 3D movie with a high contrast in black and white. Clearly inspired by some comics, like those of F. Miller. In this perspective, it goes one step further than the excellent adaptation &quot;Sin City&quot; by R. Rodriguez. This time, (almost) there is no gray or any medium color, but a graphic style never seen in a realistic animated film (I can not wait for the scanner to look dark) <br /><br /> The massive use of Motion Capture gives a lot of life and credibility to the characters and we forget very early the technical aspect to concentrate on more classic elements, such as direction or plot. The direction remains sober and controlled despite the endless possibilities of the medium, and that is really a good surprise. <br /><br /> Futurist history (Paris 2053) turns it into a classic science fiction film and keeps the viewer interested until the end. Despite a classic basic plot (a research that goes beyond initial expectations), the atmosphere and some interesting recurring themes (genetics, absolute power of certain firms ...) give this movie a great interest. <br /><br /> Although it is an animated movie, it is obviously not made for children. You will not find any funny pets or stupid family morale here, only the cold reality. It is much closer to a good black cinema. <br /><br /> I discovered that the stage is one of the best aspects of the film: we still feel the well-known Paris, but it is transformed by a fine touch of futurism. <br /><br /> However, I regret some mistakes. The montage is sometimes a bit flat, one or two slow-motion effects very clich√© and some deficient dialogues. Although the technique is excellent, it shows its limits in some romantic sequences (a bit like the &quot;final fantasy&quot; did). Those little things make it 7/10. <br /><br /> In all, it&#39;s a successful artistic challenge that you have to see if you can. The director, Christian Volckman, knows how not to fall into possible pitfalls (fortunately, they did not ask John Woo to do the job!). <br /><br /> To conclude, it is a film with spectacular images, an intelligent story and a wonderful art direction. Look at it if you can! <br /><br /> Please excuse me for spelling errors.']
