A magnificent and convincing drama about the hunting of the famous Russian serial killer Andrea Chikatilo. The magnificent performance of Stephen Rea as the forensic scientist in charge of the investigation, who finds the greatest obstacle to his progress, is the Russian government, in particular the former members of the Communist Party who wish to maintain a closed society. <br /> <br /> The film has an underlying theme about the decline of communist society, and progress in the search for the killer is reflected in the progress in social and political change in Russia, which is presented subtly. There is a conflict of old and new forms, and these are represented by the two points of view of the superior of Rhea (played by Donald Sutherland) and Rhea himself. These are initially polarized, with Sutherland 'high' in the system looking down and Rea 'low' in the ground, looking up. However, do they have a common cause? to catch the serial killer. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, the relationship between these two develops, and the tension gradually diminishes until at the end of the film Rea and Sutherland and Rea and Sutherland respect each other, the murderer is trapped , and Glasnost comes symbolically. Excellent script <br /> <br /> More credits go to the presentation of Sutherland, who is excellent and understanding, Jeffrey DeMunn as the killer we despise but can not hate, and Max Von Sydow, who is completely convincing as the humble Psychologist who You risk your reputation for helping.
