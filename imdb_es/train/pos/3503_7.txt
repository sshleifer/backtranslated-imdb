If you still remember the summer you had your first kiss, your first boyfriend or the first puppy love affair ... this movie is for you! All right, this movie would win and it will never win an Oscar BUT as a Dominican. I loved it ... there are some things in the film that could be overlooked if you are not part of the culture ... the children are raised by a grandmother who is both mother and father, the youngest son was pampered and bathed with a can of Caf√© Bustelo (so Dominican!), Judy was being harassed by the men in the neighborhood, going to church and lighting a prayer candle ... the brilliance of the movie. She was in those little details. Of course, it was not an extravagant of all the extravagant films, but it was not meant to be NOR, but to be an educational tool for those who want to learn about Latin culture (advice: make new friends instead). More than a fake candy, a false documentation, this movie kept it real without taking it too seriously. As in the tradition of "Y Tu Mama Tambien", this was simply the story of a child's coming of age. I recommend it (especially if you're Dominican!) = O)
