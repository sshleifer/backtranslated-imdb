I'm an admirer of Hal Hartley's films, especially "Henry Fool" from 1997. "Fay Grim" is a sequel to that movie and has a similar style and sense of humor. The plot, however, is completely different. Fay Grim (played brilliantly by the iconic Parker Posey) tries to trace the notebooks of her missing husband, and finds herself in the midst of conspiracies and espionage. The cast of cast (most of the people in the first film, as well as Jeff Goldblum, Saffron Burrows, and a well-received return of the 90s with Indian music by Elina Lowensohn) is excellent and the film has many surprises . The director states that this is part of a trilogy similar to "Star Wars", which acts as the "Empire Strikes Back" series. If this is true, I can not wait to see the third installment! I just hope I do not have to wait 10 more years for it.
