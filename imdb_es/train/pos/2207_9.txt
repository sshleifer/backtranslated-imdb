It's not a bad word to say about this movie really. At first I was not impressed, but it grew quickly in me. I like it a lot and I think it's a pity that many people can not see beyond the fact that it was banned in some territories, mine is one of them. The film delivers in the department of shock, gore and environment. The score is a beautiful piece of suspense delivery device. It only seems fair that Chris Young became one of the best composers in the industry. The performance in this film is of a somewhat high standard, although a bit of wood in some spots, and the effects are very real and gritty. All this is a great compliment to a good Slasher movie in my book. I have noticed in some reviews that the movie has become serious with the shooting of the famous murderer P.O.V. And I ask: What's wrong with that? It is a classic photo that evokes fear in any good fan of the genre and is excellent to keep the identity of the killer secret. The only thing that prevents this film from getting the best grades in my book is that the surprise turn (revealed by the murderer) is not handled with more care, I mean that something happens quickly, although the great performances make it almost credible. Apart from that, PRANKS is a great movie (although I prefer the original title) and it is a pity that so many people consider it a cheap piece of garbage. It is more than that, but only a few know it, since it seems to have been lost in the haze of the early 80s slasher. What a shame ... It's a really good people movie! Believe me!
