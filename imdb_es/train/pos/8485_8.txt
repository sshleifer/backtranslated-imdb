Gung Ho tries to express many ideas and entertain us with a smart shopping comedy at the same time. The result is uneven, but generally entertaining. Keaton balances the three aspects of his main character quite well. Wantabedde is even better. One warning: George Wendt is very poor in his support role. Otherwise, this is a pretty nice time capsule.
