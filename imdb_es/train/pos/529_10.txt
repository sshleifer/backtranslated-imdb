This is one of the most forgotten gems that Hollywood has produced. - A young British fighter of the Second World War, whose plane is about to crash, has radio contact with a young American who comforts the brave pilot, knowing that in a few minutes he will be dead. For some reason, the man who should certainly be dead moves away from the rubble and finally learns that he was destined to inform heaven. When a messenger is sent to ask the pilot to accompany him to heaven, the man refuses and demands to have his "day in court" to discuss his case. The man argues that his situation had changed during the last moments of his earthly life, that he had fallen in love and that, therefore, he had become a different person, a person who deserved the opportunity to live. <br /> <br /> The "heavenly court" is a cinematic delight! The "announcement of the jury of peers" is a definitive highlight. The story, fantastic as it sounds, is captivating and will keep you fascinated during the almost 2 hours of play. The final scene is simply beautiful and will require a "Kleenex treatment" for most viewers. This movie is in my top 10 personal favorite of all time, it has my highest recommendation!
