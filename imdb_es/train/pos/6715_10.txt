I loved seeing "Sabrina, the teenage witch" on Friday nights at the TGIF on ABC. I think this was one of the best shows at TGIF. My friends and I used to meet every Friday just to watch this show and we never missed any episodes. <br /> <br /> My favorite character was Salem. He was adorable and very funny. I also liked Sabrina's boyfriend, Harvey. He was hot I think Melissa Joan Hart also played a good teenage witch. My favorite episodes were "Sabrina through the looking glass" and "Hilda and Zelda: the years of adolescence". Those episodes were great. <br /> <br /> In general, I really miss this show. I hope some day ABC will come back with new episodes. I give this show 10/10 stars.
