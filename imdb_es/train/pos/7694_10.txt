I would like to know why John Amos left the program and how did he die again? I could not relate to everything, but sometimes they came home with the problems they faced. By the way, did you ever get out of the ghetto? I think the episode with the black Jesus was my favorite. We have to see them experience some good times. something they did not have very often. I would like them to bring the show back. During the day so that people can really be awake watching. I do not think a movie or a new show works. Especially without the original cast. They are really what Good Times Good Times did. These are my questions and comments. Thank you!!
