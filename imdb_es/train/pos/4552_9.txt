Daniel Day Lewis in My Left Foot offers one of the best performances of an actor. She is brilliant like Christy Brown, a man who has cerebral palsy, who later learned to write and paint with his left foot. A well-deserved Oscar for him and Brenda Fricker who plays his loving mother. Hugh O'Conner is great, since the young Christy Brown and Ray McAnally are great as the father. It is worth seeing for the outstanding performances.
