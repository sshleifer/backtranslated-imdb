Pleasant, pleasant and fun, but not moving. He does a good job of showing the world "behind the scenes" of the theater groups and the lives of the actors. The three witches are great, both on and off stage. I guess the movie works wonders (many apparent jokes) if one were involved in the theater (which I do not).
