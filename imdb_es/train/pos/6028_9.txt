This is the film in the middle period of Antonioni that most critics dismiss quickly, as a "flawed" look at American culture / youth politics of the 1960s. For what it's worth, I found it more poignant and memorable than its more acclaimed films like L'AVVENTURA, perhaps because it shows more emotion and empathy here than anywhere else. The story is simple, but it is used as a framework for Antonioni's brilliant observations and criticisms of American consumer culture, student life, the counterculture, and all the reaction against establishment and against the war that was so prominent at that time. <br /> <br /> Even from a purely technical point of view, it is an extraordinarily elaborate film; from the sequence of opening credits to the strange 'love' in the desert, to the use of billboards, and to that amazing cathartic ending that used 17 camera configurations (in their own way, as powerful as the climax of The Wild Bunch ). In addition, Antonioni chose a great lady with Daria Halperin, one of the most beautiful in history. There is not much 'acting' involved, since this is more like a docu-drama, and therefore the use of non-professionals as the leading couple works quite effectively within that context. And the soundtrack is not only full of wonderful music, its use is also impressive (I can not forget the beginning of the film, mainly due to the selection of music by Pink Floyd, which prepares the images very well). br /> <br /> Contrary to popular opinion, this is a great achievement in the cinema, and I would recommend it with enthusiasm to anyone who has a taste or tolerance towards the outside rhythm. It is worth looking for, and one of those key movies of the 60s that requires a restoration / DVD release.
