This film is basically a documentary of the series of chronologically arranged events that took place from April 10, 2002 to April 14, 2002 at the Presidential Palace of Venezuela, Caracas, Venezuela. <br /> <br /> The pathos of the film is real and one feels the pain, the sadness and the happiness of the people who lived this failed coup of President Hugo Ch치vez. <br /> <br /> Upon seeing this film, Hugo Ch치vez is truly a great historical figure. . The personality of Hugo Ch치vez led the Venezuelan people to overthrow the 3-day military junta and restore the government of Venezuela of democratic installation. <br /> <br /> It is obvious from the images in the film that George W Bush helped and instigated the Venezuelan coup. The fact that the mainstream media have helped and instigated George W. Bush is not surprising. <br /> <br /> The surprising thing is the few people who have seen this movie and the little awareness of the total corruption of the media in the United States. <br /> <br /> Ronald Reagan took only 20 years to eliminate the Doctrine of Equity in 1986 to turn the United States into a blind and rudderless state. <br /> <br /> May Hugo Ch치vez open the eyes of patriotic Americans to the truth and beauty of the true American vision.
