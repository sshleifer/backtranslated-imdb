This is an ironic film from the beginning with a voiceover that mocks everything French and then produces a rather naive but very brave hero in Fanfan La Tulipe. Interpreted by the splendid Gerard Philippe, the young gallardo believes absolutely in the curvilinear destiny that Lollobrigida predicts, in particular, that he will marry the daughter of King Louis XV! The problem is that La Lollo soon discovers that she is also in love with Fanfan ... <br /> <br /> Propelled by good sword fights, cavalcades and other energetic action sequences, the film advances at a good pace and with many comics moments The direction is perhaps the weakest aspect, but the film is so light and takes so little seriously that I could not think of those flaws again. Beware Noel Roquevert, a traditional heavy in French films, who tries to steal La Lollo, becomes a nuisance, and feeds the script to the fortune-teller who reads La Lollo's hand! And what a jewel is Marcel Herrand as the megalomaniac and lustful King Louis XV! That's not all: so many beautiful women in a movie make me want to be in France and on set in 1952! It is possible that the film was released that year, but his enthusiasm, expression, excellent narration, immaculate photography and the memorable Gerard Philippe ensure that it remains modern and a pleasure to see. I would not hesitate to recommend it to my grandchildren, much less anyone who loves movies in general and fans of fashion in particular. I see!
