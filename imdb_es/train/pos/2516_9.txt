['Based on the idea of Gackt, Moon Child took place in a country hit by poverty called Mallepa. In a futuristic timeline, the story followed the lives of the two main characters, Kei (HYDE) and Sho (Gackt) and their friends who grew up together. <br /><br /> Although some actions may be overly done or perhaps humorous, I firmly believed that this is a film about friendship. Even among all the difficulties between each character, in the end, each of them wanted to have someone on their side, to have friends. <br /><br /> Unlike most vampire characters, Kei portrayed a vampire who hated the idea of having to kill in order to live. A vampire found friendship in the hand of a child, Sho, who is not afraid of Kei. Regardless of what some have thought, I see Kei as a father figure for Sho. Kei was there throughout Sho&#39;s previous life, took care of him and taught him to live in a world where power among gangs controls their lives. On the other hand, Sho, who may be seen as an innocent and enthusiastic young man, grew up to be a man who realized that life is not just fun and games, that death exists and that he is capable of taking your loved ones. . <br /><br /> I love the part where Lee Hom, the actor who played Son, first appeared on the screen. The way they met was pretty good. The son also has a large part in this film, the fact that he is of a different race, a Taiwanese, had a great impact on the theme of friendship within the film. The way in which friendships developed despite the differences in background was excellent in this film. <br /><br /> I thought that each actor did a great job considering that it was the first time they appeared in such a big screen movie. Both HYDE and Gackt managed to act quite well and created quite credible characters. Unlike movies that had musicians who became actors and filled the movie with songs, they have done great acting jobs! Moon Child really impacted me, it has given friendships a new meaning and consideration, that we should appreciate every friendship in our lives. The film shows a lot of hope, despite all the bad things that happen in their lives, that there is always hope. Life can be cruel, it seems that hope no longer exists. He also shows a strong sense of friendship between them, even when Son became the enemy, Sho had some sort of &quot;fun&quot; in his last battle. Each and every one of them wanted peace in the end, no matter how far apart they were. The final scene showed it to us.']
