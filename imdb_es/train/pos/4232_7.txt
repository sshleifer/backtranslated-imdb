In all my 60 years of age, I have learned that when we see a movie there is an identification (whether we want it or not) implicit with a specific character. <br /> <br /> Sometimes because the character executes a certain gesture. , sometimes because the character speaks a certain word, or prayer? What do we use or what we would like to use? in a certain situation. <br /> <br /> The film in question must be seen from this point of view. Who now finds a parking space? in a shopping center, in the center of the city or on the street, taken by a car whose driver can not remember thinking that he is not the only driver in the world? <br /> <br /> Who does not have the need for "What did he say:" Did you identify with DELLA (played by Kim Bassinger)? If your answer is: YES, then try not to find absurd details? Comparatively with the reality of life? in the movie, because you will certainly find the movie ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The abstractions realized will see that the film has moments of surprise, like: 1- In the sequence in which Della grabs the toolbox in the trunk (does that box contain a gun and has the guts? to use it?); 2- In the sequence in which Terry dies while falling; 3- In the sequence in which Della is attracted by the "call of the mermaid" Chuckie. <br /> <br /> If you have already seen the movie, or if you are planning to watch it, keep in mind that there are "realistic" movies. "Fiction" movies, "political" movies and movies in which you can "wash your soul". To exemplify the latter, we can quote: "Tropa de Elite". <br /> <br /> According to the newspapers, there was unanimous applause when BOPE officials adopted certain attitudes. (As I have seen the movie on DVD, I could not determine the reaction of the audience) As for the part of the direction (Susan Monford), the interpretations (Kim Bassinger, Lukas Haas, Craig Scheffer, etc.). Edition (William M. Anderson, 'Dead Poets Society', 'Green Card', exceptional edition, 'Robocop 2', etc. It is well placed in context.On a scale of 1 (Awful) to 10 (Master Piece), I qualify "When she was out" a 7 (Regular).
