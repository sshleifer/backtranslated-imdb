This has some excellent points, but the length of the film can not sustain the thin weft of the wafer. He is another of the sailors in the farewell film, more agile than Astaire's 'Follow the Fleet', but not as good as 'On The Town'. <br /> <br /> Kathryn Grayson is insipid, but Kelly and Sinatra work well together. Their 'If you know Susie' number is hilarious, as they invent the song while they sing it. "I begged" is also fun with Sinatra, which shows how adept he was at the fight. Sinatra's solo songs are boring and seem to be inserted to show their song rather than as part of the story. Fortunately, there are outstanding supporting actors like Grady Sutton, Rags Ragland, Carlos Ramírez and Pamela Britton and an unlikely but unperturbed José Iturbi as himself, to keep one watching. <br /> <br /> Kelly is the star of the film, although Third billed and it's interesting to see him interact with children, what Astaire never did. Dean Stockwell plays a boy who wants to be in the navy and is hooked to the character of Kelly. He also visited a school and told the children a fictional story of his life in the Pomeranian navy (!) Leading to his wonderful dance with a lively Jerry Mouse. In another scene, dance a charming Mexican hat dance with a sublime serious girl, Sharon McManus, who is fascinating and sweet. <br /> <br /> Very nice then but a little too long. A tasting of best musicals to come.
