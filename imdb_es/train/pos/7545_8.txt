I really loved it, although while reading the reviews, it bothered me a lot ... But as a fan of the art of anime I can totally understand this perfect work of art, although some of them were against my cultures and they believe ... But hey, is the world. of art..!! The beginning of the movie is very strong, strange and confusing. It is difficult to understand the contents that make me respect who did it. Only someone who is extremely open can make such a daring movie ... it's not for children ... even though the characters are cute and adorable, but they go through some disturbing adventures that can not be erased (sorry if the spelling is incorrect) the memory of others.
