THE LADY OF SHANGHAI is proof that the great genius Orson Welles could direct a "conventional" movie if he wanted to. Compared to his other more artistic works, this film has only a moderate amount of cunning and almost no esoteric element. <br /> <br /> The exception is, of course, the final scene in the hall of mirrors. widely accepted to be one of the best scenes in the history of cinema. It's only worth the cost of a rental. <br /> <br /> The sweet surprise was the excellent performance of the beautiful Rita Hayworth. His performance during the beginning and half of the film is excellent, he made the other actors appear as cartoons instead of characters. Even the great Mr. Welles.
