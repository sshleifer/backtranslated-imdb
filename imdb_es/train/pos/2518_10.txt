This is, by all categories, the best movie I've seen. Forget about Hollywood, your movies always sucked, this is art! The story of Moon Child begins with Kei, a Japanese vampire who hates what he has become and lives in denial. His desire for final death takes him to Mallepa, where refugees from several Asian countries live. Here, he meets Sho, an orphan who lives on the street. <br /> <br /> From here, the film is an intense experience that is based on the visual and emotional part of the film. Has it all; you laugh, you cry, you get angry, you get emotional, sad, happy ... I've never had a movie like this movie does. And the actors are incredible, I've never heard anyone speak so many languages ​​without sounding strange. A great compliment to the editor for creating this masterpiece ... <br /> <br /> One last comment about this brilliant film is that it is starring Gackt (former Malice Mizer vocalist) and Hyde (lead singer of L'Arc ). ~ en ~ ciel) in excellent roles as Sho and Kei. I'm surprised how Gackt can change the way he talks and acts, depending on the age at which he is acting. <br /> <br /> This is something you should see. If you never see any movies, go to Moon Child, the Crow (Brandon Lee) and the newly released masterpiece Final Fantasy VII - Advent Children. All in their original languages, of course!
