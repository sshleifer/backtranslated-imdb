Four rough males and three sexy girls venture into a remote wooded area to hunt for a bear. The motley mixed group is opposed to the crazed Vietnam veteran Jesse (a really spooky portrait of Alberto Mejia Baron), who is not surprised that he is not nice to strangers who enter his land. The director / co-author Pedro Galindo III tells the exciting story at a constant pace, creates a lot of nervous tension and offers a good amount of graphic blood with the brutal murders (a nasty throat cut and a hand blown with a shotgun rate as the final frightening definite highlights). All the members of the trained cast provide solid performances, with a work especially worthy of praise from Pedro Fernandez as the kind and humane Nacho, Edith Gonz√°lez as the fighter Alejandra, Charly Valentino as the kind Charly and Tono Mauri as the antagonistic idiot Mauricio. Better yet, both the delicious blonde Marisol Santacruz and the lovely brunette Adriana Vega supply some delicious sweets wearing tiny swimsuits. The agile and agile cinematography of Antonio de Anda, the amazing jungle scenery, the robust, shuddering and trembling result of Pedro Plascencia, the well-developed characters and the pleasantly adjusted 76-minute execution time further improve the overall sound quality of this explosion. up horror / action hybrid winner.
