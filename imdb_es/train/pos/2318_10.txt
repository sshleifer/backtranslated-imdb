I saw this movie when I was a teenager and I immediately identified with the representation of Reese Witherspoon by Dani Trant, a 14-year-old tomboy in rural Louisiana in 1957. She feels she will never be as beautiful as her older sister, Maureen seen Emily Warfield) , and feeling out of place in terms of their conservative Baptist education. Then Court Foster (Jason London), 17, the son of his mother's close friend (Gail Strickland), moves into the house next door, Dani experiences his first crush, while Court enjoys his company and his intentional spirit. Dani manages to get his first kiss from him, but as soon as he sees Maureen, he falls madly for her, leaving Dani behind. The intimate bond of the sisters is severely fractured by the rivalry that arises, which only deepens when Court dies in a tragic accident. Then, the girls realize how much they are needed. <br /> <br /> Sam Waterson and Tess Harper are just as perfect as loving parents, who try to balance the individuality of their daughters, while trying to keep the family together The beautiful cinematography and the wonderful soundtrack of Elvis Presley, The Platters and many more contribute wonderfully to the film's environment in a simpler moment. <br /> <br /> A touching movie of coming of age with a timeless message.
