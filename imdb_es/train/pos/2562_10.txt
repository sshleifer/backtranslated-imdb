This is one of the best love story movies I've seen in my life. Yes, I agree that some parts may seem outdated, but this does not distract the attention of the film. One should try to observe, criticize and enjoy any form of art from the perspective of the time. Clearly, by the standards of "Sex in the City," Charlie Chaplin was horribly boring. However, when judged from the perspective of America in 1925, it was fantastic. Similarly, Sayonara is a revolutionary film in its look at a mixed-race love story, arrogance and prejudice of American "manifest destiny" and the complexity of different cultures. It is the next natural step for films like Gentleman's Agreement. However, its purpose was not only the social commentary, but it is entertaining and enjoyable, with innumerable lines that one simply does not forget. <br /> <br /> However, even when taken only as a love story, it is phenomenal. Although, some attack Brando's accent, it is at its best in terms of nuances and characterizations. Buttons and Umeki (who won the Oscars) and the rest of the supporting cast add a lot to the movie. <br /> <br /> Taka, the real star, does a fabulous job to make you feel the passion she feels for Brando. while she is torn by her sense of obligation and loyalty. His speech when he meets and speaks with Brando for the first time is a classic and is something that is rarely compared to movies. The dialogue between Taka and Brando in his dressing room in Tokyo at the end of the film is equally good. Of course, it does not have a sucking mouth, an exchange of saliva and, what is worse, that exemplifies love in today's movies, but that makes everything better. It portrays true love and passion, and not just "heat". If this movie does not touch you, then you're too young, too cynical or dead.
