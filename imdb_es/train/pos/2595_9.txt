Brilliant adaptation of the interior monologues largely by Leopold Bloom, Stephen Dedalus and Molly Bloom by Joseph Strick in the recreation of the endearing portrait of Dublin on June 16, 1904 - Bloomsday, a day to celebrate, with double meaning! The director of Bravo Strick, the screenwriter Haines, as well as the casting director and director of photography in the creation of this masterpiece. Gunter Grass's novel, The Tin Drum, filmed by Volker Schl√∂ndorff (1979) is another excellent film adaptation of the inner monologue that I favorably compare with Strick's film. <br /> <br /> While there are clearly recognized Dublin landmarks in the original novel and in the film, there are also recognizable characters, albeit with different names in the novel. For example, Buck Mulligan with whom Dedalus lives turns out to be a prominent surgeon in Dublin. <br /> <br /> This film for all its excellence is further enriched with additional visits. <br /> <br /> Brian invinoveritas1@AOL.com June 15, 2008
