['The second part continues ... not where the last movie stopped. As part of the quasi-conventionality of Steven Soderbergh&#39;s epic 4+ hour event, Che&#39;s two stories are told as the classic &quot;Rise&quot; and &quot;Fall&quot; scenarios. In Part Two, Che Guevara, leaving his post as a bureaucrat in Cuba and after a failed attempt in the Congo (only in passing mentioned in the film), goes to Bolivia to try to start another jungle-style revolution. . Things are not so well planned, at all, probably due to Che&#39;s notorious stature as a communist and revolutionary, and partly due to the participation of the United States by the Bolivian government and, of course, that Castro was not really like a backup for Che. <br /><br /> As it progresses, the second part of Che is sadder, but somehow wiser than the first part. What makes sense, since Guevara has to endure the low morale of his men, the betrayals of those around him, the constant errors of grunts and nearby peasants and, ultimately, the largest military force that encloses them . But what is even sadder is that Guevara, no matter what happens, will not give up. One can see this as an incredible force or a fatal flaw, perhaps both, but it is also clear how one begins to see Che, if not totally. Rounded, then as something of a more sympathetic character. It is true that he killed, executed and felt justified at all times. And yet, it begins to work in the viewer in the sense of a level of primordial compassion; The sequence in which Guevara&#39;s health worsens without medicine, which leads to the shocking stabbing of a horse, is one of the most memorable and satisfying films of this year. <br /><br /> Once again, the dominance of Soderbergh&#39;s narrative is strong, if at times it is slightly slow (understandable due to the great execution time), and one or two scenes feel totally strange (Matt Damon?), But these are responsibilities minors. This time, because of the focus of the direct color camera, this is almost like a war image of a pure militia style, told with great care by the men of the group, as well as by Guevara as the Lord over this group, and how Things diminish in the final scene. And as always, Del-Toro is at the top of his game, in every scene, every blow knows this guy so well, for better or for worse, that he gets as close as possible to the incarnation. In general, the two parts of Che make up an impressive package: the story as drama in a convincing style, good for an audience, even if they do not know Che or, better, if they do not consider it very well. It is so special. 8.5 / 10']
