['Brave Time is a very funny action comedy. After his first big movie called The Seabed and the spectacular TV show The Simulators, Damian Szifron did another great work. Moments of Brave looks, at times, a movie made in Hollywood. .Diego Peretti and Luis Luque are two great actors and here, they have excellent performances. The movie is very funny and fun and has excellent moments. Tiempo de valientes is a very funny action comedy that I totally recommend if you want to have a great one. And I have to congratulate Szifron for all the talent he has. <br /><br /> Score: 9']
