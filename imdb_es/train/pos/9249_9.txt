This film is ingenious, observable and absolutely moving. And now, often, can you see Jean Harlow (or any other actress of this era, in that case) give another woman a quick jab on the jaw? (Twice!) <br /> <br /> After Harlow's Ruby is sent to a reformatory after mixing with Gable's Edward Hall (the one with that cheesy but endearing twisted smile), his situation gets even more complicated when she discovers that she is pregnant and is convinced that this rake has left her, but, in fact, her love has reformed him and he comes to see her, even though he will be arrested, and thanks to the help of a minister, they are married . <br /> <br /> The wonderful relationship Harlow shares with his inmates is second only to his electrical chemistry with Gable, who was his most frequent protagonist. Its cynical character is a perfect combination for the Gable swindler. What do I not like? <br /> <br /> "You know, you would not be a bad looking lady, if it was not for your face!" Ruby makes sharp comments to Gypsy, her rival. "If you're going to get so close to me, I'll have to open the other window!" <br /> <br /> It's priceless!
