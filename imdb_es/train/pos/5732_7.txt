['Since September of last year, I have borrowed four to six movies each week from the Harold Washington Library, which has an impressive DVD collection. (The HWL really is a library in circulation: three quarters of its films are available at any given moment!) Recently, I was excited to find The Short Films of David Lynch. Yesterday, knowing little about the animated series, I picked up Dumbland. I&#39;m here to inform you that, for David Lynch fans, watching the eight episodes is a well-spent half hour. <br /><br /> The most notable feature of these short pieces are their soundtracks. Each episode has its own rhythm. The respiratory and digestive systems provide percussion. Outrageous voices accentuate the ends of breaks. Physical violence feeds the heartbeat. Singing and buzzing birds buzz along the edges. Many other elements fill the orchestra. The rhythm of the raw animation is often synchronized with the sound, but the soundtrack itself seemed to me the main interest of Lynch in creating and disseminating this work. In a way, these eight shorts are unique Lynch rhythms. <br /><br /> That said, situations are strange, ugly, profound, silly, and fun as hell. And there is enough space within them to reflect on how absurd humans can be. I can not say that I will see the collection again, but for anyone who has been delighted with the movements of the Inland Empire suite, Dumbland is worth half an hour of its time.']
