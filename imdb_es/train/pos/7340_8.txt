This animation has a good plot against evil very simple and direct, and it is about the action. What sets it apart from other animations is how well human movements are animated. It was really beautiful to see the woman running away from the screen from left to right and looking around her, her movements were very well done. Why do not you use this rotoscopic technique more these days? It is quite effective. <br /> <br /> Fire and Ice, in its prehistoric setting and barely dressed women, was clearly dedicated to showing the beautiful damsel in distress in various sensual ways, and her voluptuous body served as a pure eye. Some may hate this and consider it another more absurd male sexual fantasy, others (even many women) will adore its aesthetic quality. I sure did not care! Bakshi loves to cheer up lush and voluptuous girls, as you can also see in Cool World, and I do not think you have to apologize since it's pretty adult animation. But I also enjoyed this animation as a child and I never forgot it. <br /> <br /> This was simply special, very different from the standard Disney or Anime fare, and only for that reason is it worth seeing it since then. It is possibly the best of Bakshi. For those who like animations with exuberant women: try Space Adventure Cobra as well. <br /> <br /> I give Fire and Ice 8 out of 10.
