['It&#39;s been a while since I saw this LOTR. I am currently looking for a copy to buy. Bakshi&#39;s work is fairly faithful to the original work. The images are swollen and, at times, disturbing. <br /><br /> Disadvantages? From time to time, the movie is confusing or confusing. There are once or twice when the story slows down to a crawl. But, in general, buy this movie. It is ideal for children, adults and collectors.']
