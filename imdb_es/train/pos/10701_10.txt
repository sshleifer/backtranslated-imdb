The critics did not like this movie. He bombed in the United States and, as a result, received only a limited sample in Britain. Which was a great shame, since it represents British humor instead of American, and should have shown up first in Britain. <br /> <br /> Nicole Kidman looks impressive and is a totally convincing Russian. Ben Chaplin is Dustin Hoffman's character from 'The Graduate', and 'Birthday Girl' has at least 4 scenes that remind the viewer of that classic from the 1960s (despite being a totally different story!). <br /> <br /> Sure change tactics several times, from comedy to black comedy, from thriller to adventure, but it's memorable, touching and a breath of fresh air compared to the average box office hit. <br /> <br /> See it with an open mind!
