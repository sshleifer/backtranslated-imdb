If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones or the action in general, this is a must. Directed by the Republic team of William Witney and John English, and starring Reed Hadley as Don Diego / Zorro, this series offers! I will not bore you with the plot (who cares less to talk, more to fight); what really matters here is Hadley's excellent interpretation of the characters and the work of Dale van Sickel and Yakima Canutt. <br /> <br /> *** STUNT SPOILERS FOLLOW *** <br /> <br /> You can see the influence that this movie had on Lucas and Spielberg - Zorro is caught in the original version of Star Wars on trash compactor in one chapter, stuck in a rope bridge and the Temple of Death in another, makes a horse transfer to Raiders trainer and even flees through a tunnel while the bad guys hit a huge water tank and they flood the tunnel behind him, exactly as Mola Ram does to Indy in Temple of Doom. Besides all this, the action of the whip is excellent, since the Zorro disarms the villains, it is safe, etc. with his faithful whip. Most of the work with swords is fair, with the exception of chapter one, which features a fabulous sword fight in a canteen choreographed by the sword / double legend Ralph Faulkner, who makes a rare appearance on screen as the evil Rodriguez. This was the first series I saw in Matin√©e in Bijou when I was a child and I've been hooked on them ever since. <br /> <br /> The Fox Combat Legion delivers "Z" goods!
