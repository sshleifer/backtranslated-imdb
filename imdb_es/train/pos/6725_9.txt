Noll's comfortable way of displaying forceful comments, often with insults, to describe things that he has more knowledge than most, is quite refreshing. There is another character in the movie who constantly tries to verbalize complicated problems, using more language than necessary. This guy should never have been given a Thesaurus. Cut to Noll and you'll know what's hot! <br /> <br /> The way in which the pioneers of surfing big waves are portrayed is very reminiscent of a "lost era". It does not matter that nobody knows how these guys made their living, let alone dealt with issues like medical care. The use of old movie clips was done with mastery.
