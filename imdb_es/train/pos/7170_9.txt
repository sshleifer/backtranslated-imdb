HOLES is not what you like at Disney, it's very, very funny, even for adults who normally shudder at the "family animation" designed by a focus group that the Uncle Walt studio takes to be live action. Perhaps the secret of the success of this film is in its fidelity to the original book, which is a bit darker than the material of an average child. The action begins when Stanley Yelnats is sent to a prison camp for children, where all inmates are forced to dig holes under the desert sun as a form of inhibition. But as the story progresses, Stanley's tale weaves into that of a legendary treasure, and this adventure becomes ten times more fun than any Disney movie about a prison camp for children. Jon Voight is especially nasty and colorful, and Sigourney Weaver is beautiful, as always.
