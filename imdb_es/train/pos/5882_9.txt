In Mexico this movie was aired only on PayTV. The life of Dietrich Bonhoeffer is a true example of a good German and, especially, of a good man. The conversations between the character of Tukur and the Nazi prosecutor are especially interesting. A war of true ideas: two different Germans, both with faith in that, believe. Bonhoeffer was a very complex person: man, fighter for freedom, boyfriend, ecclesiastic and a great intellectual; Ulrich Tukur stands out as Bonhoeffer. I recommended this movie a lot, especially in these difficult times for the planet. In Mexico we do not know much about the life and legacy of Pastor Bonhoeffer, this is a great job to rescue a forgotten hero.
