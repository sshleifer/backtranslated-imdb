This is a great movie that I do not think I get enough credit like Saturday Night Fever or Grease in John Travolta's career. He plays a man who is in love with a girl but is too angry to admit his feelings towards her. Instead, he wants to participate in mechanical bull riding because he believes he will show his manhood. Although it was made in 1980, it is still timely today. The great country music soundtrack is great. 10/10
