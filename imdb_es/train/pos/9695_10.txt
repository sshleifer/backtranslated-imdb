Some people may call "Paulie" a children's movie, but I want to say that it is more than that. Probably, more than anything, this film strives to successfully show the plight of immigrants in the United States, theme given by recent debates. When portraying a parrot telling a Russian immigrant concierge (Tony Shalhoub) about how he looked in America for its original owners, the film tells several stories. There is the old woman (Gena Rowlands) who befriends, then a Mexican immigrant (Cheech Marin) and others. <br /> <br /> In general, it is a very well made movie. Normally I do not expect much from this kind of movies, but this is a delight. I certainly recommend it. Also starring Jay Mohr, Buddy Hackett, Bruce Davison, Hallie Eisenberg and Trini Alvarado.
