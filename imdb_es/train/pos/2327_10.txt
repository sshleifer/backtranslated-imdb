['A 14-year-old girl develops her first serious infatuation with the 17-year-old boy who lives nearby, while at the same time trying to overcome her feelings of inadequacy compared to her older sister. That is the simple premise of this beautiful and poetic film directed by director Robert Mulligan. Mulligan is famous for having previously directed Summer of &#39;42 in 1971 and To Kill A Mockingbird in 1962, two giants of the coming of age genre. Here she directs the newcomers in the lead roles: Reese Witherspoon, in her film debut, as the 14-year-old girl; Emily Warfield, as the older sister; Jason London, as a cut, the 17-year-old boy. Reese Witherspoon is surprisingly good at her film debut, showing all the emotions that a 14-year-old girl feels when experiencing the love and grief of young people, never hitting a false note. Warfield and London are equally good too. The film accurately describes the thoughts or feelings of each teenager regarding love with a sincere sensitivity, and never intersects excessive excess at one time. Congratulations to Jenny Wingfield&#39;s autobiographical script; This is one of the few films about young love that has an honest and consistent tone without being emotionally dishonest or sensationalist. The music is wonderfully simple, it accentuates the tone and mood of one scene to another, but it never becomes intrusive. The beautiful photograph is of the famous horror director Freddie Francis, who was about 70 when it was shot. Tess Harper and Sam Waterston interpret the parents of the girls with dead-accurate accuracy in 1957, careful, strict and emotionally simple. Gail Strickland is also good as the child&#39;s mother. There are feelings to be solved, lessons to be learned and truths to face in this sweet character film that offers great emotion. To date, this is Robert Mulligan&#39;s latest film. This is one of the best movies of 1991. **** of 4 stars.']
