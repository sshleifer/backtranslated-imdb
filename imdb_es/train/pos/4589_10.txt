['Well, I would consider Police Story as one of Jackie Chan&#39;s best movies. The plot, the fight scenes and the tricks are excellent. In this film, Jackie himself acted as a police officer named Chan Ka Kui (Kevin Chan in some versions) who successfully arrested a crime lord. After the crime lord was released due to lack of evidence, he locked up Chan for the murder of a police officer. Because of this, he was wanted by the police. Later, Salina (Brigitte Lin), who was the secretary of the crime lord, went to a shopping center and began stealing evidence of the crime lords of her computer and prepared to hand them over to Chan. However, the crime lord knew that Salina had downloaded his incriminating data and hired his henchmen to capture it. Later, Chan appeared in the scenes and began to fight against all the henchmen, defeating them one by one. In the last scene, Chan was seen hitting the crime lord. Finally, this is the best comedy and action movie. Everyone should see it. Highly recommended']
