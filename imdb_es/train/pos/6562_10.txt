Simply the best reality show made. The first two seasons (the only ones that matter) are on Hulu. I challenge anyone to watch the first three episodes of season 1 and I do not like it. I guarantee you'll finish watching the season. Then I guarantee you'll see season 2. <br /> <br /> Other quick reasons to see it: 1. Anderson Cooper is hilarious 2. Locations in Europe are amazing 3. Games are mentally challenging 4. It's very interactive 5 In one episode, one player responds to the desperation of another player: "I'm trying as hard as I can!" with an equally desperate, "Not necessarily". <br /> <br /> You can find out ... Who is the mole?
