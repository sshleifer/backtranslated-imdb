The Maxx is a deep psychological introspective slightly camouflaged as a strange superhero story. Julie Winters is an "independent social worker" in a disgusting, nameless city, surrounded by crimes, and she and everyone she meets has many problems to solve. Maxx is your friend and client, a vagabond who thinks he is a superhero in disguise, or is it the other way around? <br /> <br /> The Maxx can not be missed by the artwork, the story itself, or the excellent voice work, especially the wicked and evil voice of the late Barry Stigler of the main villain, Mr. Gone . <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity to see this, do not miss it.
