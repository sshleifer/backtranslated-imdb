There have been many film and television productions by Jane Eyre, each with aspects that recommend them, but I suspect that this is what people will continue to discover and fall in love with decades from now. It's just a classic (and offers much more of the story than others). Timothy Dalton is completely in his element as Rochester, and rarely loses the mark; His performance is surprisingly agile and many colors, but never far away from the dark complexities of the character. Jane, by Zelah Clarke, is more cerebral than from another world, but she plays a perfect role for Dalton (who, appropriately, bends over her). The nuances of his performance are best seen in a second visualization (once you have absorbed the impact of Dalton's charisma). There are some technical flaws and a couple of moments where the production values ​​could have been better; although this was a first line production by the standards of the BBC of that time. But, it is the performances that are the real pleasure. Do not miss it!
