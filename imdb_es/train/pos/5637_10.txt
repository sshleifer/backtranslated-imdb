I would just like to say that I've seen this movie twice and I love it. The acting is excellent and, although it is a plot similar to "Raise Your Voice", I think the plot never gets boring for people who like that kind of thing. He has some great lessons and shows us that we can do anything if we try. An incredible movie I am sure that this is one that I will be watching for a long time. Although Britney Spears writes the book, it is a fairly realistic plot, maybe it is not about the part about falling in love, but about being different and struggling but getting out better in the end is very true to real life. The only minor criticism is why the main girl in these movies is always beautiful. Do you really think Holly would have met the perfect man of her dreams if she were ugly or average? I doubt it..
