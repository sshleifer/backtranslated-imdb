I had few problems with this movie, and I have heard many criticisms that say it is too extensive and overvalued. It is true that lasts more than three hours, but I was surprised that it happened so fast. I do not think I'm overrated at all, I think the IMDb rating is perfectly decent. The movie looks sumptuous, with beautiful costumes and excellent effects, and James Cameron's direction rarely slips out of focus. Leonardo DiCaprio offers one of his best performances as Jack, and Kate Winslet is charming as Rose. David Warner, a great actor, steals all the scenes in which he is. The story is very rich in details, and is very interested in the development of the character, evident with the love story, which is very moving when necessary, although in the first part of the story. Movie is a little slow. The last hour is extremely fascinating, and I'll confess I was on the edge of my seat, when the Titanic sank. I will also say that the last five minutes were very moving. The music of James Horner was lovely, although I was never a big fan of the song My Heart will Go On. The 1996 miniseries was good, but suffered from undeveloped scenarios and some historical inaccuracies. In general, I give Titanic an 8.5 / 10. Bethany Cox.
