'Stanley and Iris' show the triumph of the human spirit. For Stanley, it is the struggle to learn to read and realize his potential. For Iris, it is finding the courage to love again after being a widow. The beauty of the film is the dance that Robert DeNiro and Jane Fonda do together, starting and stopping, before everyone has the skills and courage to completely trust each other and move on. In that sense, it gives us a good insight into how life is often, so it is credible. Unlike other reviewers, I found that the characters represented were consistent for the entire image. The cast of support is also chosen carefully and adds a depth of character that the main characters gain additional meaning from the supporting performances. In short, an excellent movie. The best I get out of it is hope.
