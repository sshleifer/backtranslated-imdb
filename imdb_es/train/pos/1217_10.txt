I was worried that my daughter might have the wrong idea. I think the character of the "Dark Heart" is a little rough and I do not like the way he changes shape in a "bad" frog, fox, boy? I was wrong, this movie was made for my son, not for me. She "understands" it when it passed under my head. Of course I do not "understand". This is not one of the NEW movies for children that adults will also enjoy. This is straightforward for the youth, and the team knew what they were doing. There is no political garbage ether. There is no magic key that will save the world from ourselves, no one has the right to access excess, and everyone is not happy all the time. And as an added benefit, nobody dies! Russwill.
