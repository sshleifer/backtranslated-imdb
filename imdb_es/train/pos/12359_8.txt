Remarkable for its notorious explicit scene, when the beautiful Maruschka Detmers takes his young lover's penis from his pants and takes it to his mouth. Even without this moment, the film is a splendid ride, although a bit disturbing, exciting and blindingly sexy. Detmers presents a great performance as the delight, insatiable delight, wandering his naked plane. Dressed, partially dressed and naked, she steals most of the film about love, sexual passion, philosophy and politics. For me, the last two are lost a bit and the end is more confusing when her fianc√© is released, while other terrorists are released, she is not sure who she wants and the young lover seems more interested in her exams than in any other another thing while crying. , very good of course!
