['Japan 1918. The story of Ryu, 16, begins with the death of his father. As will be revealed later, his parents died of tuberculosis. In this desperate situation, Ryus&#39; aunt has arranged a marriage with a Japanese in Hawaii, whom they only know because of her image. Arriving in Hawaii, Ryu discovers that her new husband is much older than in photography, and that she lives in very humble circumstances next to a sugarcane plantation where she works. Ryu is not used to hard work on the plantation and, desperate for her situation in her new home, she thinks about running away. Soon he discovers that he has nowhere to go. The friendship with Kana, one of her coworkers, gives her new hopes and strength. This image is based on real events between 1907 and the 1920s, when thousands of Asian women married men in the United States, whom they only knew by their image. This not very well-known image is well written and acted. The location is impressive. This film also features Mifune Toshiro in his last screen appearance as Benshi (silent storyteller). This film gives an idea of the Japanese culture here and on the other side of the ocean. You must see it!']
