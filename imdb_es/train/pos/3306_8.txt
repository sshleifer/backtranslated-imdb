['Finally, I finally did it and managed to see a &quot;clean&quot; copy of Pakeezah! So far I&#39;ve only had a shuddering and spoiled version recorded on Dubai TV sometime in the &#39;90s, with extravagant English subtitles, dizzying widescreen coverage and a fluid color with a mind of its own. After having thought that the world of a copy so poor (and short) I think it was worth waiting for the decent, and 140 minutes more pleasure than what I thought possible. <br /><br /> This was Meena Kumari&#39;s lovely film from beginning to end, and I think it was planned by her from 1958, and she finally realized it in 1971. What a pity it was that chronic alcoholism finally killed her shortly after, and done, she was too. Evil to be done in some of the scenes in Pakeezah, which require a double body. In some scenes the tension is definitely displayed on his face. <br /><br /> The story of Purity versus Adversity can only be treated as a fiction that has no experience of anything close, but they lead me to understand that it faithfully represents a world that has already disappeared and that must have been common at some time in India. It&#39;s a bright and colorful movie with a simple relentless epic message, an intense romantic tragedy that somehow also feels good at the same time. But for me it is the incomparable golden music of Ghulam Mohammed, sung by the incomparable Mangeshkar Lata, especially Thare Rahiyo, and his part in the development of the story that makes this film so outstanding. Seldom have I heard songs so serious, beautiful, poetic, wonderfully sung and played on any movie soundtrack. Singin &#39;In The Rain may be my favorite musical movie, but Pakeezah has my favorite music, but Lata said that the songs themselves did not mean anything special to her. The only regret is that the only one Mohammed Rafi only had one song here, although a classic duo with Lata. <br /><br /> Because of all this, but not blind to its failures, Pakeezah is my favorite Indian film, filmed at a time when the Westernization of India was accelerating and was now watching when Western values seem to be sponsored by the state and de rigueur. At least, look to Pakeezah to learn what Indian &quot;pop&quot; music had to offer the world before it was cast by the drum machines, the Bollywood Beat and the bhangra.']
