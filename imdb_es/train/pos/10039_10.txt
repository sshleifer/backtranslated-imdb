The Titanic is a classic. I was very surprised that this movie did not have a solid score of ten in general in the ratings of IMDb users. Maybe, it's great not to give credit to the Titanic today, but when it was done for the first time it was really something. When the movie came out, people went to the theaters. When it came out on video, my sister and I saw it twice a day for a month. It was safe to say that we were obsessed and for a good reason. Some of the scenes of the disaster were hard to forget, like the frozen baby or the guy who committed suicide after killing someone in the ungovernable crowd. Many people died on that ship, and to convey that in the film with the immediacy and emotion that it needed is a difficult challenge that James Cameron faced. And let's not forget the incredible romance between Jack and Rose. Whether or not their relationship was a figment of someone's imagination was adorable. They barely knew each other, but they would die for each other. They trusted each other. Surely they are giving Romeo and Juliet a race for their money. "I'll never let you go, Jack." Titanic is a great movie until the end. It is a powerful story told through brilliant acting, excellent photography, beautiful music and a team full of dedicated and dedicated workers. It really surprises me when someone says that he hates this movie.
