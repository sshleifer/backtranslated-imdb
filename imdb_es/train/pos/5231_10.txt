To communicate in the cinema essential things of life, like what life is, does it have any meaning? - It's absolutely impossible. Of course, the possible answers to these questions are shown in each film (story), but communication needs a direct call to consciousness. This happens if the input of the senses cancels the "entrance" of our mind, that is, our thoughts. Few directors know how to communicate essential things. Tarkovsky, it's one. His "Stalker" shows images of existence, communicates life as he shows himself and yet escapes his mind. I think De Zee and De Graaff do the same.
