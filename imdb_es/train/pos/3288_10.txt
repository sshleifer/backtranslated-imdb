This is a great fantasy movie. One of my favorites, it's really great. The director is Bernard Rose, who directed Candyman. He had a great start with this movie. <br /> <br /> The movie about a girl named Anna who falls ill with glandular fever on her eleventh birthday. She draws a house on a piece of paper from her exercise book and falls into a dream in which the house is real. Each subsequent dream that she has is altered by the presence of what she adds to the image. In his third dream, he meets a boy he thinks he has created named Mark. She becomes friends with him and their relationship becomes stronger as the dreams become darker and more frightening. <br /> <br /> Charlotte Burke, who plays Anna, is a great actress and it is very strange that, after a single movie, she disappears and never appears again. be in anything ever again She really gives a great performance in this movie. <br /> <br /> Hans Zimmer's score is also excellent. Like Broken Arrow, the music is ghostly and mysterious. It is a real pity that the soundtrack is no longer available on CD. The DVD is available only in R2.
