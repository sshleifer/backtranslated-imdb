Abhay Deol meets the attractive Soha Ali Khan and greets her "Hello sister!" This sets the tone for a remarkable debut film by Shivam Nair. Soha, a middle class girl has run away from her home in Nainital and has come to Delhi to marry her lover, Shayan Munshi. But Shyan does not appear leaving Soha with a broken heart and alone in the big bad world. . Abhay, the boy from the lower class next door becomes protective of vulnerable Soha and helps her get a job and shelter in a nursing home. Slowly romance blossoms and Soha agrees to marry Abhay. Then Shyan re-enters Soha's life. <br /> <br /> A sensibly made movie with a very unusual story, shot with love in Delhi, revolves around the delicate Soha. Does this well-designed film have moments that will always be recorded in the memory? the clumsy first kiss and the quick apology of Abhay; Abhay describing Soha as "wali ladki class" and adding hastily "he does not love her"; he gave Soha a churidar and asked her to go out with her. <br /> <br /> The music is good and the background music is excellent. In a scene in which Soha rushes and hugs Abhay, the sound track disappears. Stillness conveys both the discomfort and the tenderness of the relationship. <br /> <br /> The touching ending creates a bittersweet movie, whose memories will last for a long time. <br /> <br /> You have to see it I'll rate it 8.5 / 10
