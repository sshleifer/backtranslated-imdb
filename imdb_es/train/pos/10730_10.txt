Unfortunately, SpaceCamp came out almost at the same time as the Challenger Explosion. What really hinders when to carry it out, or even if necessary, carry it out. I'm glad they did it. The first time I saw SpaceCamp in a drive-in movie. What really improved the visualization. <br /> <br /> Although I had heard about Lea Thompson and Tom Skerritt. I had never heard of the others in the movie. So, it was a big shock for me to find all those young people acting and acting really well. Of course, Kate Capshaw was excellent too. <br /> <br /> I especially liked the scenes, where the children were shown how to act, as a team. The scenes of the children that were being prepared for a trip that could only wait. The actual launch of a spaceship is, of course, an old news for us. However, this was different. <br /> <br /> In general, this is one of my most prized movies. Maybe an escapist, but it was fantastic for a space nut like me. After renting it probably for 30 - 40 times. I finally found it available in a certain store and I bought it. Now, if it only comes out on DVD. I will probably have it forever. This movie gets 9 out of 10 of me.
