While Hollywood stagnated during the few years after the Second World War, England developed a very prolific film industry. In "The Man in the White Suit", the inventor Sidney Stratton (Alec Guinness) creates a suit that never gets dirty. Unfortunately, this means that other companies are likely to go out of business. How can Sidney deal with this and maintain her dignity? This is an example of one of the great films in which Alec Guinness starred before becoming Obi Wan Kenobi. It's a good look at the general absurdity of the business world. If you plan to start any kind of business, you may consider watching this movie.
