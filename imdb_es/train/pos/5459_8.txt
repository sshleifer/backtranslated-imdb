['BABY FACE is a wise cracking and fast-paced, who knows the smile of a movie that <br /><br /> it lasts only one hour and 15 minutes, but oh, how smart 75 minutes <br /><br /> are! That a story covering so much land could be told in such a <br /><br /> the short time embarrasses most of the filmmakers of today Writers of <br /><br /> Today we should study the economy of BABY FACE and reduce the swelling that <br /><br /> it overflows so many of his films. <br /><br /> The story does not make sense. An amoral woman rises first to wealth, <br /><br /> and then about the bodies of men who fall madly in love with her. <br /><br /> Surely the production code used it with a happy and redeeming ending, <br /><br /> But it is not difficult to see in which direction the writers wanted. <br /><br /> Go, so enjoy what&#39;s there and use your imagination for the rest. Stanwyck is great, like George Brent and Douglass Dumbvrille like <br /><br /> defenseless suitor. It&#39;s not a great movie, but certainly a nice one. Yes <br /><br /> you&#39;ve never seen BABY FACE catch him the next time he appears on the wire <br /><br /> Or rent the cassette. Worth the effort ..']
