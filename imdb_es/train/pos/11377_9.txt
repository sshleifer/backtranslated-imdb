Citizen X tells the story of Andrei Chikatilo, The Ripper of Rostov, who killed 52 people in 8 years, mainly women and children. It shows how the investigation was obstructed by the Soviet bureaucracy, how difficult it was to investigate the crimes. He does the work so brilliantly that he will not leave anyone untouched. At first it may be a bit slow, but it really catches you as the story unfolds. I can only say that, along with "The Silence of the Lambs," this is by far the best film about a serial killer I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It is very difficult to say what actor's performance stands out from the rest in this movie. Stephen Rea is really brilliant as the inexperienced forensic expert who is in charge of the investigation. The performance of Donald Sutherland as his superior cynic, and the only person in the Russian government who is willing to help him, is as outstanding as Rhea's. And what about Jeffrey DuMann, playing the serial killer? DuMann brilliantly created a character that inspires empathy instead of hatred. Yes, he is a monster, but he is also a sad figure, oppressed and ridiculed by his wife, his boss, his co-workers ... He is tortured, ashamed and extremely cruel. <br /> <br /> I can only recommend this film to all those who are interested in a well-done docu drama, where actors are even more important than special effects. It deserves at least 9/10, maybe even more if you ask me.
