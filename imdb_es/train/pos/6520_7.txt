DeMille's original film was made in 1938 with Frederic March. A very good movie, by the way. The love of Hollywood for the remakes brings us a very interesting movie starring Yul Brynner. Of course, he was brilliant, since he almost always seemed to be in all his films. Charlton Heston as Andrew Jackson was a stroke of genius. However, the movie tended to be a bit long in some places. It does not move to the rhythm of the 1938 version. Still, it's a fun movie that should be seen at least once.
