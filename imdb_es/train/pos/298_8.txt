New York has never looked so good! And neither does anyone in this movie. While the script is a bit light, you can not help it, but you like this movie or any of the characters it contains. You almost wish that people like this really existed. The attractiveness of the actors is what really put him (John Ritter, Colleen Camp and the late Dorothy Stratten are particularly good). Go ahead, rent or buy this movie, you'll be glad you did it.
