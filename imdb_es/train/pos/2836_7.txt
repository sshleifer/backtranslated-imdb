Summary: Zandalee is a young woman who feels increasingly trapped in her marriage to Thierry. Thierry himself is struggling with his father's death the previous year and has been lost. He has immersed himself in the work, written of his writings, and Zandalee desperately loses the attraction between them. In this enters Johnny and Thierry's old friend who were once artists in exile together. But Johnny has continued painting, and he only has one day of work for the rent. He takes the day as he comes and leaves tomorrow to his destination. There is an instant raw attraction between Zandalee and Johnny, and they enter into a romance. But Zandalee struggles with her lust to be desired and her conscience and love for her husband. But none of them, neither Zandalee, nor Johnny nor Thierry can stop the relations between them so that they go totally out of control. <br /> <br /> Comments: It is established as a thriller. But maybe more a heart thriller than a normal thriller where it's about life and death, and the threat of violence. It's not that a heart thriller can not take on fatal proportions, but the threat comes from a different angle. And it's not really until the second half in Zandalee that the thriller emerges, and although the basis for it is in the first half, I really can not describe the genre as a thriller. Much more of a romantic drama than anything else, but with the underlying currents of other genres. The developing thriller is there, but it also has more than a little sensual erotic tinge. Because that's what it's about, what drives the characters and, therefore, the whole story. Wish. The need to have and the need to be. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, it's pretty good, definitely much better than your current rating (4.1) anyway. Take your time, but a good feeling of suspense grows and handles the erotic part very well, with pleasure. It is always an integral part of the story, I had to be there to give weight to the story that is needed, and I never felt it was an excuse to show a bare chest or something like that. But, unfortunately, the climax of the story comes long before the end, and the ending itself feels flat, even in its own dramatic form. <br /> <br /> The cast is impressive, led by actors known as Nicholas Cage and Judge Reinhold. But the show is almost completely stolen by Erika Anderson. Beautiful and very adept when it comes to representing the sometimes subtle feelings of desire, it stands out that both Cage and Reinhold sometimes go crazy and become a little rough. His career after is too thin for the talent he shows in Zandalee, I can only hope that it is by his own decisions. Also two personal favorites appear in small roles that give a little more advantage to the film, it is Steve Buscemi and Joe Pantoliano. <br /> <br /> When you're in a good mood, this is a very good movie, you could have used another extreme to get the credit you really deserve. <br /> <br /> 7/10
