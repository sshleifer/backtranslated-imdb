I have to totally disagree with the other comment about this movie. The visual effects complement the supernatural themes of the film and do not detract from the plot. Also, I loved that this movement was different from the crouching Tiger because this time the sword action had no ties and most of the time you can see the action up close. <br /> <br /> I think the Western audiences will be very confused with 2 scenes, one of which involves a monk trying to burn himself alive and the other the villagers who say it's the end of the world. The scenes mentioned derive from certain interpretations of the Mahayana Buddhist text (Mahayana Buddhism can be found in China, Korea and Japan) and the other scene is about a peculiarity in the Japanese calendar ... people at that time thought that the world would come until the end ... Gojoe has the action, the history and the visual elements to captivate any spectator. I firmly believe that with a skilful edition it can be sold in the USA. UU My only complaint is in the last scene of the fight (I can not reveal anything, I'm sorry).
