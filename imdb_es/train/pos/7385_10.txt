To all who think that 1. This was a boring TV show 2.Halle Berry and Denzel Washington did not deserve their Oscars <br /> <br /> CLOSE THE F ** k UP !! This was one of the Academy's best prizes because it was a moment in history when a black "black actress" won an Academy Award for best actress, which is why many of our black sisters have been ignored by the academy for many years. To be honest, I stopped seeing the academy awards because of the lack of diversity between the winners or the nominees. For me it was just a bunch of white people who patted themselves on the back. The academy had many opportunities to vote for black actresses. that was brilliant in the movies, for example, Alfre Woodard, Whoopi Goldberg, Diana Ross, Mary Jean Babtise, but it was not like that. 2.Halle Berry deserved Oscar was not competition, the academy was under pressure to vote for so long. academia, the majority of which is composed of white voters, yes, yes. Nicole Kidman sang very well at Muling Rouge! But it was time for black people to settle into these awards programs. As for Mr. Washington, the academy owed him much after that unfair loss. for MalcomX. For all of you who think that race is not a problem "probably white people" in the film industry, well, is that many of the most talented black actresses have been reduced to the typical stereo made by whites, roles of which Are you think that she is a black woman or does not exist the existence of "Angela Basset". I do not expect many of the whites to understand any of this because they never had to deal with any of that. Now that I think about it, they are the ones who have been inflicting it.
