I've seen Maslin Beach a couple of times, both on Free TV by air in Brisbane. I will not enter if it is good, bad or otherwise, since others have covered it well and really. <br /> <br /> I'll say it's very Australian. Only in Australia can we have a film about the relationships between people who spend the day as naked as the day they were born, and to watch them on free commercial television. <br /> <br /> I have a friend from the USA. UU He is constantly surprised by what we put on our free television compared to his home country. Sex and the City and Huff are just examples. <br /> <br /> Even though our government is trying to make us the 51st state in the US UU., It's good to know that at least some things are still truly Australian.
