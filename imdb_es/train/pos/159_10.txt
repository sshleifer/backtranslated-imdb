This was just another wonderful movie from the Berlin Festival. But unlike the "Yes", by Sally Potter, who had seen some days before, when after leaving the cinema I felt a strong desire to embrace everyone and was happy to be alive, this time the opposite happened. : there was something that dragged me down, and the air suddenly felt cold and hard to breathe. It was as if, suddenly, there was nothing left, all hope, all the future would have been taken to a dead place. <br /> <br /> Nina's life seemed to be dark and closed, but then, one. beautiful day, that kind of luminosity appears that opens the horizon and makes you believe in the fulfillment of your dreams. There was no one at his side, but suddenly he finds a companion, out of nowhere, someone who could share the most hidden feelings of his life. That person was Toni, a vagabond girl who does not seem to have roots, like herself. <br /> <br /> But the title of the film is "Ghosts", and the ghosts appear and disappear as they wish, there is no How to retain them? Ghosts also represent the hidden fantasies of people, strange ideas that occupy your mind and you only perceive them yourself, hiding from all other people. Françoise, a French woman, is a victim of such ghosts. Once he lost his daughter in Berlin, who apparently had been robbed in a supermarket, in a moment of lack of attention. Now time has passed, and Françoise is back in Berlin, still looking for the missing girl. <br /> <br /> Nina could be that girl, after all she has the same scar on her ankle and the heart-shaped birthmark between her shoulder blades, which seems to prove her true identity. <br /> <br /> And Nina adopts that idea, after all she not only desperately needs a partner, she also craves a mother. But in the end she has empty hands, Toni has disappeared with a man and her supposed mother turns out to be a sick woman. "Marie is dead," concludes Françoise's husband, and the statement could not be more disappointing. Nina is just a "girl", a girl without a name, there is no hope for any divine realization. There is no Marie in this world to accompany our lonely lives. Therefore, in the end, we see Nina completely alone, about to walk the path that opened before her, towards a future that seems sad and uncertain.
