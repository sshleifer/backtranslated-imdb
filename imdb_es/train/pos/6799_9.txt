This episode is a bit confusing. Some people say that you should start from the beginning, but I must say that I was a bit confused from the beginning! <br /> <br /> Clark receives a blow to the head and wakes up in the floor of Fairview Mental He makes fun of the institution and thinks he is a superhero. Clark is told that the life he knew was in his head. Delirious You also find some things that are unusual: Martha is married to Lionel; Lex is tied to a wheelchair with his limbs cut off after his accident on the bridge; And Lana is dedicated to Clark. But find a familiarity; Someone else who is dedicated to Clark: Chloe. He also finds that a mental patient is also from the known world of Smallville. And the doctor is a fugitive from the Phantom Zone. <br /> <br /> This episode reminds me again of an episode of Buffy called "Normal Again", where Buffy begins to have vivid dreams about an asylum. The doctor tried to convince her that everything she knew was a product of her imagination and that, in fact, she was crazy. Her parents were still married, still living in Los Angeles, her friends did not exist, Angel was never her boyfriend and she did not have a sister named Dawn. Demons and vampires did not exist either. Both episodes are a bit sad because doctors are not only telling the characters that everything is a product of their imagination, but it tells us what it really is: fiction, and it brings us back to reality. It is good, however, to have a sense of reality from time to time, but we see these programs to escape from reality. Again it is good because the characters have to overcome new challenges.
