If you loved Long Way Round, you will enjoy this almost as much. It's educational, fun, interesting and tense. Charley shares the screen with two interesting teammates, two tired mechanics, two excellent cameramen and too Russ. Ewan makes some appearances, but Charley really does it alone. He is fun, attractive and still a puddle of stress and doubt. Cool! <br /> <br /> The series concludes in 7 episodes. Like LWR, the preparation is almost as interesting as the race. Although they cover the intricacies of the race well, there could be a little more explanation about trucks and cars, which are simply mentioned and rarely seen. However, it is a motorcycle movie and anyone with two wheels will love this. <br /> <br /> The series presents an impressive photograph, as well as some interviews with people. Yikes There's another catchy song like LWR, but this one is not as good as Stereophonics. <br /> <br /> If you live in the US UU. God knows when it will be released, so buy it on Amazon.uk and watch it on your computer like I did. Oh, and get ready to buy another bike.
