Out of play is the story of the teenagers who tried to sneak into the stadium to watch the final soccer match qualifying for the World Cup in Tehran that could lead Iran to the 2006 World Cup in Germany. The females are prohibited from going to the stadium by law in Iran, although many of them dress up as children and slip away. The stadium guards register everyone at the entrance to make sure no one carries fireworks and, of course; no girl enters. <br /> <br /> Like most of Panahi's work, the performance of his armor cast was excellent. You really think you're watching a documentary. The dialogues between the girls and the private ones were executed with delicacy and amazingly credible. The film shows the interactions between the captives and the enlisted guards who are serving them, sending them away from their family and friends in a fun way. In the end, the audience realizes that there is no such difference between the girls and the guards who only followed the orders.
