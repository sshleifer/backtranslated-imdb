Of all British imperialist films such as Four Feathers, Charge of the Light Brigade, for example, this film stands out as the cream of the crop. It reflects a moment when "the sun never set in the British Empire." Get over. I will not go into why, because many others have expressed the many reasons that make this film great. I have visited Alabama Hills and I have photographed the passage through which the British marched and it is still that way, unchanged by time and the invasion of man and vandals. And although I know it's coming, see Din lying on a stretcher and when these lines are read <br /> <br /> "Yes, Din! Din! Din! <br /> <br /> You, leather Lazarushian Gunga Din! <br /> <br /> Although I have girded you and skinned you, <br /> <br /> For the life that Gawd made you, <br /> <br /> you are a better Man than me, Gunga Din "<br /> <br /> Still, at 54 years of age, I have foggy eyes and anyone who says he does not is a liar. The range of emotions within him is the mark of a great movie. Like the end of another great movie, Of mice and men.
