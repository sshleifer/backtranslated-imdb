Of course, the plot, the script and, especially, the casting are strong in the film. So many good things to see. One aspect that I especially liked is the idea of ​​the antagonist, Luzhini (Turturro), a former mentor who works with his evil on the sidelines. His chess opponent, an Italian dandy in three pieces and cane, turns out to be a true gentleman and an excellent chess player. To his credit, the "opponent" nobly agrees with the plan at the end to complete the final game for the championship posthumously (Luzhin has pulled a flyer out the window: sad, but freeing him) by means of an unstable genius. 'widow (Emily Watson). In death, then, due to the gallantry of an honorable chess master, Luzhin's defense (which he resolved in a moment of late lucidity) can be played. The Italian gentleman praises the game and calls it brilliant. Talk about a dramatic "final game"!
