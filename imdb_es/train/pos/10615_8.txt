The Unseen is done in a style more like the old Hollywood mysteries than a horror show. The film is somewhat slow but many strange images keep it alive and visible. The basic idea of ​​young girls lurking for something in the basement is old, but good acting and production make it worth watching the movie. The film is notable for its emotional impact and certainly not for any explicit action or special effects. I rated it with an 8 out of 10.
