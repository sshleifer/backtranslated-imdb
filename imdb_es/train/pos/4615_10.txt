I think people are underestimating this incredible movie. People see it as a typical horror movie that is meant to scare us and keep us from falling asleep a bit. What if I tried to do it would be deservedly a 1/10, but I saw this movie with some friends and found it very entertaining and, despite being a good movie, has Stephanie Beaton. This is the reason why I think it deserves 10/10 for the pure entertainment of the movie. <br /> <br /> The general opinion about this movie is that it has a bad performance, a simple script that it did 10 years ago. Old people can produce and they can not be taken seriously and people rate it low because of this. But I see this as a completely entertaining masterpiece ... that has a hilariously fun script that the actors make even more entertaining and, although not very serious, it's very entertaining.
