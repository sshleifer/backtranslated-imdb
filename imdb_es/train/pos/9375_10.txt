Before Nicholas Cage was a great action star, he was a great actor. This lesser known film is where Cage offers one of his best performances. "Red Rock West" was a low budget movie, almost unknown, but it is one of my favorite movies of all time. I discovered it by walking down the aisle of the video store, and I wanted to see Cage and Hopper (who is also great in the movie) appear together. Go through this, and I'm sure you will not be disappointed.
