John Waters has given us a really nice movie. This certainly is not without its surprising moments in the style of Waters, but it is softer than its older cult material, such as "Pink Flamingoes". "Pecker" goes back to the first stage of John's mainstream in the sense that he reminds the viewer of the same kind of humor that was evident in "Polyester." In general, a very funny comedy with some great moments!
