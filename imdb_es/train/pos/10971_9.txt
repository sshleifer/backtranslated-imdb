Gray Gardens is shocking, fun, sad and fascinating. I watched in amazement as Ediths Jr. and Sister argued and acted as they remembered their past. Their existence in a dilapidated mansion (which they had not left in more than fifteen years) is both a comedy and a tragedy. This is a movie that you will not soon forget.
