Meryl Streep was amazing in this movie. She has incredible ability for accents, and shows incredible ability in this film in general. I really felt for her when Lindy was being chased. She was played realistically, too. He became grumpy, annoyed and unpleasant when the media and the government continued their relentless witch-hunt. At first I did not expect much from the movie, but I was really interested, and the film is based on a real person and real events. It turned out to be better than I had anticipated. Sam Neill was also outstanding; This is the best work I've seen of him, and I've really liked him in other films (The Piano, for example). I gave the movie a 7, but if I could just rate the performance, I would give it a 9.5 and a perfect 10 for Streep.
