What can I say about the first movie? <br /> <br /> You can not qualify this, because it is not supposed to be entertaining. But if you HAVE to qualify it, you should give it a 10. It is impressive to see moving images from the year 1895. This was one of the most important films in history. I wonder what it was like to be one of the people who saw the first movie! <br /> <br />
