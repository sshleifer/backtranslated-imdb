Far from my second favorite cartoon, Spielberg did it, after Animaniacs. Even if the grades were low, then, still, I enjoyed it and loved it, it was really fun and I loved the cast, wow Jess Harnell and Tress Macneille were there and they were fantastic, the whole cast was brilliant, especially the legendary Frank Welker. <br /> <br /> I would love to see this caricature again, it was amazing and the jokes were great. I can also remember the hilarious moment in which Brain appears in him, you listen to his voice and the PATB instrumental theme sounds, which was just fantastic, I love those cartoons in which the cameos appear. I want this cartoon and Animaniacs to come back. I loved them
