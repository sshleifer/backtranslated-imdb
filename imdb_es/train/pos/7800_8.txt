The first time I saw this movie was when I was 13 years old. It surprised me a lot and in many ways it still does. But now I am less inclined to see it as a precise historical piece. Little effort is made to examine and interact with racism, and therefore, it is not recognized that the most potent weapon against racism is to understand it in its essence in those who commit it. What we get instead is a dichotomy (on the one hand, beko and woods in the panoramic view of the rainbow in 3D), on the other, the two-dimensional characters are presented as an unthought-wrong and without apology. <br /> <br /> All this makes it a great Story of the film, but I am concerned that people see representation as "accurate".
