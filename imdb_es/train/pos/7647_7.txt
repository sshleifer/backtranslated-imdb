Ok, so borrow a little "It's a Wonderful Life", but that was 44 years before this movie, so why not a new attempt? Belushi is having a rotten 35th birthday. He did not get his Wheaties, his coffee, and he lost his job. The stopper is when your car described as "big blue piece of sh **" breaks down at the end of the day. He goes to an empty bar to ask for a trailer. While waiting, the bartender (Caine) recognizes him as the boy who lost the baseball game of the city championship 20 years earlier. This leads him to think what life would have been like if he had won the game. He finds out when, without his knowing it, Caine serves a potion of movement in a glass that gives him a mansion, the dance queen (Russo) as his wife, and makes him president of the sporting goods company of which he has been canned Caine later reveals himself as responsible for this change, but Belushi is not entirely on board. He never adapts completely, and in a plot development that does not kill the movie but is still strange, he tries to woo his wife (Hamilton) out of his real life, who is now married to someone else. The good move is that they do not spend much time on that, since they basically steal "Ghost", and Belushi constantly tells Hamilton things that only she could know. He also brings a dramatic hokey element, since two of his lovers kevetch in the shadows, the new wife Russo and her unbalanced lover Cox. But the keys to the film are the long start and the happy ending. It is also a good job of the big and recognizable cast, since Belushi is very nice, VERY attractive are the chosen ladies, and Caine is perfectly easy as the title boy. It's strange that this was Belushi's second film in 1990 that tries to get him an alternative lifestyle of wealth, found in "Caring for Business." Although similar, both films are at the same level of laughter provided. So look at this for a fun exploration of "what if?"
