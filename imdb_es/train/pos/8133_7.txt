Well, I personally do not like rap, but I still find the Fear of a Black Hat hilarious. I'm sure I did not get some inside jokes, but some I knew, and it was funny enough to make me laugh right after I stopped laughing. I'm a big Spinal tap fan, so naturally I had to check this. It was derived from This Is Spinal Tap, sometimes blatantly, but this movie still remained as an original, intelligent and funny satire. My personal favorite: "In the slave era, they did not have hats to protect themselves from the sun, so at the end of the day they were too tired to rebel, now we have hats."
