The star of this film is the script. The attention to detail during the period in dress, language, social customs (we do not hurt women) and politics are remarkable. It is a reminder of Kosovo today. The subtle pieces in the action scenes are there for an attentive spectator and the choreography of these action sequences is excellent. Maybe this movie is close to the bone of reality to win the support it should have received. It is like a ladder of increasing violence with pauses of peace and serenity in each step. A great movie ....
