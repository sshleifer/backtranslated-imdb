['This is one of the best movies (action) in Hong Kong and has a tense and exciting story, as well as excellent fighting scenes. This Sammo movie has it all, romance, drama, emotion and also a great hero. It&#39;s the only martial arts movie that interested me in the plot instead of just waiting for the fights. Sammo fans: this is a must see (see also Eastern Condors, Shanghai Express (Yuen Biao is Ace!), Dragons Forever and Enter the Fat Dragon.']
