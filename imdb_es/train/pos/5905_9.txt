This is a very well made movie. Sumitra Bhave has always made a sensible cinema and this is my favorite movie of her. This film should have won the National Award and it would have been my choice to represent India at the Oscars. It is at least a thousand times better than 'Shaaws', which will attend the Oscars, from India, this year. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that the information on this (and all the other Indian movies). ) in IMDb is deficient and sometimes even wrong. Sadashiv Amrapurkar played a very important character in this film and is not even credited in these pages. The rest of the cast and crew are also not mentioned at all. Awards and nominations for this film are not granted even when Sonali Kulkarni won the Indian National Award for this film. There was not a single vote cast for 'Doghi'. <br /> <br /> 'Doghi' is not a Hindi movie. It is Marathi, and fortunately it escapes from the sequence of song and dance, it does not get tangled with the dazzling glamor and the half-witty design tableware. It is a real, moving story that is made with exceptional understanding and respect. <br /> <br /> 'Doghi' which can be roughly translated as 'two women' is a story of two sisters, Gauri and Krishna. It's actually a very simple story, Sumitra Bhave does not venture into many secondary plots, and that makes it a very difficult film to direct. The entire film is set in a remote village without description in Maharashtra and the screen rarely ventures far from the house of the two female protagonists. There are no aesthetic sunsets in this one. <br /> <br /> The movie starts and we are introduced to the whole house, which is preparing for Gauri's wedding. Gauri and Krishna's father, being a hardworking farmer, the house is full and happy; There is nothing missing in their simple lives. However, on the eve of the wedding, Gauri's future husband encounters a fatal accident. Gauri's father can not stand the tragic news and suffers a great blow. Without a strong and hardworking member, the house could have collapsed, but Gauri's mother takes responsibility. He works as and when he can, but he can not survive. But his life is still easier than Gauri's. Superstitions, which people try to forget half-heartedly, make Gauri a villain of luck. She is marginalized from society. <br /> <br /> Gauri's mother writes to her brother. Desperate for help, she accepts his suggestion. He takes Gauri to Mumbai, where he is forced to work in brothels. Gauri sends home the money he earns and his conditions improve. Gauri gives his life for his family. <br /> <br /> However, when Gauri returns home for Krishna's wedding, her mother does not go out to meet her. She does not allow Krishna to approach her and does not allow Gauri in front of the guests. She loves Gauri but fears for Krishna's life. This breaks Gauri completely and she decides to return to her unfortunate life. But Krishna runs out and holds Gauri. She begs her beloved sister to return. Krishna promises to be with her. Do you promise that you would face the world? together. <br /> <br /> There is nothing that is not required in this movie. Everything is necessary and sufficient. Gauri goes to Mumbai, but what she does there is never told? The subtle dialogues tell us what to know. It's just the story, which is profound in its simplicity. <br /> <br /> 'Doghi' is responsible cinema. He is respectful with the subject that he handles. Are you respectful with your audience? he does not believe that they have the mental capacity of a four-year-old child. <br /> <br /> The performance is first class. The address is wonderful? The silences carry the story forward in a way that no word could have. The script is well researched. <br /> <br /> Anyone who appreciates good cinema has to like "Doghi".
