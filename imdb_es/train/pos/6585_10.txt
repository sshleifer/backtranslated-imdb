After seeing Jeremy Brett as Sherlock Holmes, no actor should show such presumption as to imagine that he could approach Mr. Brett's performance of "one of the most interesting characters in literature." Jeremy Brett is Sherlock Holmes and in my opinion there can be no other. The great actor Basil Rathbone is, I must admit, a close second, but he is still the second. One could argue that Mr. Rathbone's scripts were inferior to the absolutely top-notch productions offered by Mr. Brett and with this he would agree. However, when all is said and done, Jeremy Brett will always and always be the only actor who will truly "become" Sherlock Holmes. The book should close on this topic and we, the audience, left to enjoy Mr.Brett's unique performances. <br /> <br /> Bill Rogers <br /> <br /> (sonarman65@yahoo.com)
