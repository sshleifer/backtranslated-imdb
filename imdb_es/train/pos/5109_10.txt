I grew up in Houston and I was nine years old when this movie came out. As a result I do not remember anything about the movie. But I do remember the feeling that caused Gilley's and the mechanical bull in the hit song "Lookin 'for Love" by Johnny Lee, which still brings back memories of childhood every time I listen to it. <br /> <br /> However, some years ago I saw this movie for the first time as an adult and all I can say is that I was impressed. Few films have hit me harder. This movie is as raw and real as you can get. From Uncle Bob's ranch house, the chemical plant in Texas City, the ballroom of Gilley and Bud and Sissy. And maybe that's why it does not have a broader appeal. But no matter how you feel about country music (for my part, I can not stand it despite my roots in Houston) Urban Cowboy is a unique slice of American pie. That's why I love it!
