The excellent star quality of Gerard Philipe, who died too young, jumps off the screen in this witty, funny and cunning comedy with many sword swings and incredible antics. Delightfully preposterous in his narration, impossible to resist. A sweet romantic comedy with a very young Gina Lollobrigida as the love interest. A movie that you will remember with great affection.
