Despite the other comments that are listed here, this is probably Dirty Harry's best movie; a film that reflects, for better or for worse, the country's socio-political sentiments during the Reagan glory years of the early 1980s. It is also a kickass action film. <br /> <br /> It opens with a liberal judge who annuls a murder case due to the lack of tangible evidence and then goes directly to meet the cafeteria with several unfortunate thugs (the scene that prompts him). The famous line "Go ahead, make my day", "Sudden impact" is a non-stop rollercoaster of an action movie. The first time you catch your breath is when Inspector Callahan is sent to a nearby city to investigate the background of a murdered hood. From there, it only gets better with an exaggerated group of grotesque thugs with whom Callahan can face along with a sheriff with a mysterious past. The excellent direction, photography and a sometimes hilarious script help make this film one of the best of the 80s.
