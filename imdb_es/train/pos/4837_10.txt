I was a young film student in 1979 when the Union of Soviet Filmmakers came to Sofia Bulgaria and premiered Konchalovsky's "Siberia"; "Stalker" by Tarkosvky and "autumn marathon" by Danelia. I was surprised by the cosmopolitan dimension of the art form. Then, and only then, I saw "Epic Siberia" 4 hours and a half and I was speechless. Much better than "1900" by Bertolucci. For long! <br /> <br /> Hope Andron will somehow hit the downside and make the "restored director's version complete" someday! On DVD of course! I also fought fiercely in defense of this cinema against the majority of my colleagues who equated Soviet cinema with bad taste! Time is on my side.
