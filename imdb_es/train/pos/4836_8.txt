A few days ago I saw the film on a videotape and, although it was difficult for me to swallow it in one shot (due to its duration and history), I liked it a lot. First I was impressed with the script and then the realization of this script. The movie takes you for a walk, but it's not an easy and happy trip; It goes through time and different political regimes and shows their influence in the lives of ordinary people. What I loved was the internal logic that followed the movie; The logic, which like logic in life, was quite illogical and confusing at times, but in the end, when I thought about it, all the events and turns made sense. However, there is no point in trying to retell the story as it extends over more than 50 years. I also really liked the character of Nikita Mikhalkov, Aleksei, and the way he played it, as some critics would see it, with restless abandon. What I did not like was that I think he later played characters that remind me of Aleksei in films like "Cruel Romance" (the Romans of Zhestokij, who actually love him) and to a certain extent in "The Insulted and the Injured" (" Unizhennye i oskorblyonnye "). "Sibiriada" shows, I think, that it was a great filmmaker Andrei Konchalovski before going to Hollywood and made forgettable films like "Tango y Cash" and less forgettable like "Runaway train". I would prefer "Kurochka Ryaba" to them ...
