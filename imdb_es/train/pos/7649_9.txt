The entertaining vehicle of Jim Belushi, a modern cockeyed version of It's A Wonderful Life. Michael Caine plays a kind of angel that allows Belush to see what life would have been like if he had "grown big". Jim is at his best with a good story and a cast of support; It seems a real chemistry between him and Hamilton. It is not an Oscar candidate, but it is good fun.
