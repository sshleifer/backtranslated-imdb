I also saw it at its launch in '56, and since then I've been hit with its final scene. If this is a response to 'High Noon', then it is an appropriate and appropriate response. The notion that, as this chain is directed, "The city joins" is a message much stronger than the solitary personal heroism of "High Noon". In this theme, 'Concho' is a phenomenal precursor to one of my other favorites of all time, 'Los siete magn√≠ficos'. Both Sinatra and Conrad provide impressive and compelling performances, especially Sinatra's transformation from harassing the younger brother to the savior of the city. I can only hope that at some point all the friends and family to whom over the years I have inflicted my affection for this film have the opportunity to experience it for themselves.
