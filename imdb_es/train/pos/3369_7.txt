['In spite of what the title may imply, &quot;Pigs Is Pigs&quot; is not played by Porky Pig. Rather, it presents a young pig with a more insatiable appetite than the character of John Belushi in &quot;Animal House.&quot; His mother scolds him repeatedly, but it does not help him. So much so that he goes to another house where a deranged scientist feeds him by force more than any simple mortal can handle (but in the end there is a surprise). <br /><br /> Most of the time I would say that this caricature seemed to be a place among the big cartoons (Daffy Duck debuted three months after it was published). But make no mistake about it, they do some good things here. The whole sequence of forced feeding seems more relevant nowadays, given the epidemic of obesity that affects our country. <br /><br /> Anyway, it&#39;s not the best caricature, but it&#39;s worth seeing.']
