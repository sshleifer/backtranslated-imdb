Red Skelton was another important star that made the transition from movies to television with ease. <br /> <br /> His programs certainly made American families laugh years ago. <br /> <br /> I would. The show begins with an opening monologue. Then we would have a variety of characters. Remember Gertrude and Heathcliff in the monologue? How can we forget San Fernando Rojo? I remember an episode in which, as king, Red introduced her queen by referring to her as her fatness. <br /> <br /> Go and know that Red would use his comic talent to hide from his tragic life. He lost a son by leukemia at about 11 years of age. His wife, Georgia, died by suicide.
