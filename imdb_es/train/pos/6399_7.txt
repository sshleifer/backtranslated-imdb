While it certainly was not the best movie I've seen in my life, it was worth the $ 8 (which can not be said of many movies these days). <br /> <br /> This was a nice story from a true story, although many of the details of the real story were distorted for the movie (ie the character of Billy Sunday had three or four people in the real story combined). Robert DeNiro was good, of course, and Cuba Gooding, Jr., was also impressive.
