I finally saw this movie tonight after renting it at Blockbuster (VHS). I have to agree that it is tremendously original. Yes, maybe the characters did not realize it at all, but it's not one of those movies. Rather, they treat us in the eyes of the director, their vision of what history is about. And it does not stop. And to be honest, I did not want him to do it. I think Sabu had to have influenced the directors of 'Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels' and 'Run, Lola, Run'. But I loved the way the three of them have SEE the beautiful woman on the street to momentarily distract them. I really need to see this director's other work because this movie really intrigued me. If you want insight, culture, strength and behavior, go somewhere else. If you want to laugh, camera movement and criminal hilarity, look here.
