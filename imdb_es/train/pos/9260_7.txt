There are enough sad stories about women and their oppression by religious, political and social means. Not to diminish the films and stories about genital mutilation and reproductive rights, as well as wage inequality and marginalization in society, all in the name of Allah or God or some other ridiculous justification, but sometimes it is useful to simply take another approach and throw Some light on the subject. <br /> <br /> The scenario is the 2006 match between Iran and Bahrain to qualify for the World Cup. The passions are high and several women try to disguise themselves as men to enter the game. <br /> <br /> The women who were captured (played by Sima Mobarak-Shahi, Shayesteh Irani, Ayda Sadeqi, Golnaz Farmani and Mahnaz Zabihi) and detained for trial provided a fun and enlightening view of the customs of this country and, most likely, of all Muslim countries. Their interaction with the Iranian soldiers who guarded and transported them, both from the city and from the villagers, and the father who was looking for his daughter gave us funny moments while we thought about why they have those unwritten rules. <br /> <br /> It is mainly a paternalistic society that feels that it has to save women from the raw behavior of their men. Instead of educating the male population, they deny the privileges and rights of women. <br /> <br /> Seeing the changes in responsible soldiers and the reflection of Iranian society, it is not surprising that this film is not affected. I ran. But Jafar Panahi has a winner in his hands for those who can see him.
