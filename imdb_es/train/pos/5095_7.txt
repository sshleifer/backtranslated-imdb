King's Solomon's Mines brings us Patrick Swayze (playing Allan Quatermain) who has spent a lot of time in Africa, but decides it's time to return to England and be a father to his son. He finds that his wife's parents have taken custody of his son and that he has very little chance of getting custody of him with much money for a legal claim. Alison Deedy (playing Elizabeth), whose father is in Africa and held by an African tribe for the rescue of the map that Elizabeth's father had sent her. Elizabeth looks for Quatermain to take her back to Africa to find her father. <br /> <br /> There is a good cast of support characters that agree with Quatermain and Elizabeth and, of course, there are some enemies (Russians) who want the map as well. <br /> <br /> The movie keeps your attention until the end. Patrick, once again, plays an honest and beautifully handsome man who comes to the rescue of the damsel in distress. Patrick is a great dramatic actor who can easily portray passion, loss and despair, strong and silent man, anger and strength; In the Minds of King Solomon, his character actually smiles a few times. I would really like to see Patrick Swayze in a relaxed history of life-loving ones, one in which he does not have to clench his jaw and be so strong. Maybe a little dance would help. But this is a good movie for the whole family and it's worth seeing.
