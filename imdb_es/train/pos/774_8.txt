I think it's a good movie; I think it's a very Romanian movie through the landscape and the atmosphere; I think it was not meant to be sensual (sensuality is a result, not a purpose); I think it's very natural. I think it's human I think it was interesting; I think the actors never made me think ... waw licks performance (they are not Sean Connory & co) nor is the movie a block destroyer, they are like the movie ... normal people who can act ...; I think the movie reached its intention; I think he made me feel things (or feel them again :)); I think I'm not objective; <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed it ... I know it.
