The American film debut of Greta Garbo is an analogy of how our lives can be diverted by fate and our actions, as in a torrent, which makes us lose a part of us on the way. <br /> <br /> Greta plays Leonora, a poor peasant in love with the character of Ricardo Cortez, Don Rafael, a landowner. Ricardo is also in love with her, but his dominant mother influences him too easily. Leonora ends up homeless and travels to Paris, where she becomes a famous opera singer and develops a reputation as a loose woman. Actually, part of his attitude is bitterness for the abandonment of Rafael. <br /> <br /> He returns home to visit his family and eventually confronts Rafael. Surprisingly, no one knows that she is the famous La Brunna, and Garbo fulfills her role as a diva that was really and appreciated with such sympathy in his later portraits. <br /> <br /> Ricardo Cortez reminds us a lot of one of Valentino's looks in this part, and he was prepared to be a clone of Valentino by MGM, though he never thought it could be in reality and he was right. He is credible in an unfriendly part like a weak-willed mom boy, and he lets himself grow old realistically but comically at the end of the movie. He can not win Leonora when she returns home, and then, when he follows her, his courage is undermined. <br /> <br /> This movie is beautifully recorded, with brilliant sequences of storms and the scenarios that represent Spain at that time are authentic. looking. There are also some good secondary performances by veterans Lucien Littlefield, Tully Marshall and Mack Swain. <br /> <br /> Although this is a story of lost love and lost opportunities, I do not believe that Leonora and Rafael have done it. happy together, since he needed a more traditional wife and she was a career woman, and I do not think he would have been happy in a small town. The ending is true to life and does not throw punches. <br /> <br /> Look at this as Garbo's American film debut and a forerunner of things to come
