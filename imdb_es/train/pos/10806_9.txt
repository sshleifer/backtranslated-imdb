I felt this movie - along. I was impressed by Russell Crowe's talent in developing his relationship with Lillie, an Australian mix so typical of a soft approach, a bit self-deprecating and very persistent. I really loved the cinematography and the direction. Pace was right and the representations of almost all the characters were impressive. <br /> <br /> Wow, Russell's talent did not shine even in 1993! .. and I still have to see Gladiator.
