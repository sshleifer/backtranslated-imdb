This was a very daring movie for his day. It could even be described as a soft pornography for the silent era. It was a talkie, but the dialogue was extremely limited, and in German. One did not need it anyway. <br /> <br /> The young man (19) Hedy Lamarr is trapped in a loveless marriage with an obsessive (stereotype?) German and after a short time in a marriage that apparently was never consummated, he returns home with his father. <br /> <br /> In a famous and funny scene, she decides to go for a skinny swim one morning when her horse gets distracted by another. Then she is forced to run through a field that chases him, while leaving his clothes on the horse. An engineer retrieves his horse and returns his clothes, after watching carefully. <br /> <br /> They sit for a while and, in a Zen moment, presents a flower with a bee sitting on it. This is where she remembers her honeymoon and the actions of her husband and an insect. She knows that this man is different. <br /> <br /> She returns home and eventually seeks our young man and finds the ecstasy that was denied. You can use your image here, but her head disappears from view and we see her writhing with pleasure. As you never undressed, you can imagine ... Certainly, a tribute to director Gustav Machat√Ω's women and a surprise for the public of 1933. <br /> <br /> The only thing that spoils this beautifully filmed movie is Excessive guilt , and a strange ending.
