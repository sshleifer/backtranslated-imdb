The first time I saw this movie, I thought it was typical of "love your neighbor" ... The more the film developed, the more I became involved. The acting is magnificent of both actors, the direction was great, the story unusual. I cried my eyes, the first time in my life for a movie. A true must have in any serious videoteque. 11 out of 10
