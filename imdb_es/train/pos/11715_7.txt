This is a cute little comedy of horror with Cassandra Peterson, also known as Elvira: Mistress of the Dark, the most infamous horror hostess of all time. It was supposed to be Elvira's pilot vehicle and it was so successful that it was picked up by the NBC Network. They filmed a pilot of a television series to present the busty black, but unfortunately, the comedies never got over the pilot stage due to their sexual references. This movie, however, is very funny. Elvira is the modern Chesty Morgan and the queen of the one line. This movie was followed a few years later by the abysmal "Elvira's Haunted Hills", which was meant to be the takeoff of the old Roger Corman films, but it falls flat on its face. Watch this movie instead of a much more entertaining experience!
