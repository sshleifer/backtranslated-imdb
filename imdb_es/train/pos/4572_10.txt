As someone who has lived with cerebral palce for more than forty years, it seems to me that this movie is inspiring. If someone with such a serious PC case as Christie Brown can do so much, then there is no reason why I could not achieve my own dreams. Daniel Day-Lewis and Brenda Fricker give impressive performances. <br /> <br />
