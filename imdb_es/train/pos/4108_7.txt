['Kurosawa, fresh in color, loses sight of his usual themes of truth and perception of reality and opts for a depressing vision of the slums of Tokyo. Kurosawa is in a style that was, in my opinion, its antithesis, that is, I feel that Kurosawa wanted to make an image of Ozu. Poor rhythm, poorly conceived, this film is a rare rare in this author&#39;s body of excellent work. While Ikiru, though it was mundane and depressing, was still interesting and well-paced, and while Stray Dog showed the slums and social poverty of Japan without being too heavy or boring, desu ka den has all the gloom one might expect with its content, without any of the redeeming qualities of Kurosawa&#39;s earlier images. <br /><br /> Be careful, this is not a film for which Kurosawa should be judged.']
