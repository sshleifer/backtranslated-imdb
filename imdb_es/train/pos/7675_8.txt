After seeing the movie last night, I was left with the sense of hopelessness that organizations face trying to address the problem that the film portrays. The scale of prostitution seems so great that it is difficult to see how it can be defeated without major government changes in Cambodia. <br /> <br /> Anyway, with the review. <br /> <br /> Although it is a grim film with an uncomfortable central relationship. This is a very convincing movie, and I would even say it was nice. The film was well edited for the execution time and Thuy Nguyen's performance was excellent. I also felt that Ron Livingston played a very difficult role. <br /> <br /> It would have been nice to have a little more idea of ​​why Patrick feels he has to help Holly, but maybe the reason is as simple as him. Explain the character of Chris Penn. I will not explain it here: go see the movie. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie that invites reflection and obviously has good intentions. I hope you get a launch wide enough to reach a decent sized audience and get more support for Project K-11.
