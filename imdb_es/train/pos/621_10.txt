As a fan of fantasy in general, and the works of Neil Gaiman * in particular *, I've been waiting for this film with such avidity, with such avidity and with such a bitter mixture of anticipation and fear of disappointment that I can. I just think I'm finally here. And you know what? I should not have feared, the movie version is bl ** d and awesome. Unlike the book, but in a good way: less capricious, more comical, still very sweet and charming. <br /> <br /> The special effects are absolutely perfect, and make magic feel a natural and appropriate part of The World of Wall without being overtly spectacular and intrusive. <br /> <br /> Due attention has been given to the narration and the rhythm, and the cast is for the most part a triumph, with the ghost princes (whose roll reads almost like "Who's Who" from the great British comedy: Rupert Everett, David Walliams of Little Britain, two of the types of Green Wing, etc.) that steal most of the best lines and almost all the funniest moments of the film, which exist in abundance. <br /> <br /> In fact, the only minor criticism I have in the whole movie is that sometimes the elements of comedy become a bit OTT, the subtlety goes out the window to the detriment of the main story .. The Ricky Gervais cameo, for example, was too "Ricky Gervais doing his usual David Brent of Comedy personality Office" for my taste, and in my opinion, he created an untimely and unexpected break from the magical spell of progressive history ( although to be fair, from memory I think that the character of Ferdy in the original book WAS beautiful "Ricky Gervais", ask when I think about that) ... <br /> <br /> But this is a small dispute in a story fairy immaculate and written in another way with a good mix of action and romance. Charlie Cox, like the protagonist Tristan, captures the right mix of ingenuity, subtle comedy and self-fulfillment necessary for a story like this one in which a "humble child embarks on a life-changing quest"; Claire Danes as Yvaine is beautiful, fighter and, simply, slightly strange or ethereal, a perfect interpretation of her stellar role; Robert De Niro, in the cameo that all critics talk about, deserves to be praised, fun and funny (it seems he's also having a ball) ... and Michelle Pfeiffer is triumphant and nasty like the evil witch Lamia, my favorite act of the movie in general. If you enjoyed his delicious presentation in the recent "Hairspray", you will also enjoy it in this. <br /> <br /> So to round off this review: you will laugh, sure, you will smile, and I may even cry. Stardust is a beautiful fairy tale that moves the heart of the whole family, with a heart of gold and more intelligence than it seems. One of my favorite movies of all time is the absolutely fantastic Princess Bride, and Stardust is easily compared with good reasons, since it is a very similar type of movie that explores similar themes and territories ... and like The Princess Bride remains fresh, intelligent and fun twenty years after its initial release, I think that the delicious ironic sweetness of Stardust will appear as a family favorite on our televisions (or a device of future equivalent!) For many years to come.
