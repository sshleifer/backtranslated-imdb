I just came back from the first presentation of Basic Instinct 2. I was thinking that it would be bullshit based on previous reviews and I was pleasantly surprised! If you liked the original Basic Instinct, I think you will enjoy # 2 as much as no more. Great story that always keeps you thinking and thinking. The music is excellent, taking up the original theme. Do not wait for the Academy Award material, go see it to enjoy and have fun. For that the films are designed: escapism. I can not think of a better way to escape than to escape with Sharon Stone, who is as sexy as she always was. I'm thinking of seeing him again this weekend. Go see it!
