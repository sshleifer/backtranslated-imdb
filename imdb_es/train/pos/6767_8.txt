As a young teenager at that time, Airwolf was required to see him for a generation that wanted his "Cowboys and Indians" to have incredible contraptions and explosions of whiz-bang. <br /> <br /> In many ways, the show was essentially Knight Rider in the skies: a similar technology of comics, a central character who was essentially a loner, and echoing the concept of a man making a difference. <br /> <br /> But in other important ways, it was very thematic. different from Knight Rider, Street Hawk, The A-Team and other action programs of the time. On the one hand, the premise of the series is not based on the desire to help those in need, but on the possession of Airwolf by Stringfellow Hawke for essentially selfish reasons (as a lever to try to find his brother of MIA, San Juan). And then there is the dark edge provided by basing the series firmly in a context of the Cold War of the 1980s, complete with Soviet espionage and Central American dictators, not to mention the internal enemy. Of course, Team A constantly referred to Vietnam and the state of the team as fugitives, but in general it was done with a light touch and was rarely fundamental to the plot itself. With Airwolf, the intrigue was key to the tone and direction of the show, although this was diluted (unwise) as the series progressed. <br /> <br /> In retrospect, the Cold War scenario clearly dates from the series. Many of the stories are squeaky and artificial, and much of what Airwolf does is clearly unlikely even with today's technology. But that is not really the point. Airwolf was an incredible fun, he tried to tell interesting stories without relying solely on the great action sequences, and he did not cover everything with sugar, miraculously ensuring that no one died. Sometimes it failed, but often it was admirably successful, and with a TV budget to boot. <br /> <br /> For UK readers, DMAX (Sky 155 channel) has just started Airwolf's daily replays (January 2008). Establish your Sky + box for this explosion of the past: we can even re-equip, re-launch (and unfortunately, very inferior) the fourth season, which, to my knowledge, has never been shown previously in the UK.
