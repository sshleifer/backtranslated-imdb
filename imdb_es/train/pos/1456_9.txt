Documentaries of this type are often criticized. This movie seems to eliminate all opinions and let the viewer decide what to do with the information provided. It's sad the conditions in which these poor people have to work, this movie does a great job of showing the ugly side of the sweatshop stores. The film Mardi Gras: Made in China was a good way to show the world how something as insignificant as accounts for a celebration can affect the lives of many people in another country. <br /> <br /> I had to watch this film for an English class in which we spent our time talking about sweat shops and how some people try to eliminate them, and this movie helped set the theme in motion. It was a very informative great movie and I would recommend to anyone who sees it, open your eyes a little.
