I saw this movie about twenty years ago in the last show. I still vividly remember the film, especially the performance of Robert Taylor. I always thought that Taylor was underestimated as an actor, since most critics saw him as a solid and almost boring type of main man, and women simply loved watching their films because of their appearance. This movie, however, showed how interesting an actor could be. He did not get enough roles like this during his long career. This is his best performance. He is totally credible in a truly villainous role. From what I have read, he was a very hard-working and easy-going man in real life and never fought enough for this kind of role. Basically he would only do what MGM gave him. This film shows that he could have handled more diverse and difficult roles. The other thing I remember about this movie is how annoying Lloyd Nolan's character was. Nolan was a great actor, but this character really aggravated me. The last scene of the movie has stayed with me all these years. This movie is definitely worth seeing.
