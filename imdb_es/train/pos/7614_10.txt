['I&#39;m obsessed! The story is amazing and the program is highly addictive, but I love it. I am in season 2, album 5, and I tell you that I am now too attached to the characters. That something bad happens to them would seriously affect my vote for the show. And, Michael is on my list now. I joke ... I am very happy to see that there is a season 3, because I was very afraid of going to disk 6 thinking that it would end. I can not wait to see the rest now. Thanks to the directors / producers / and actors of Lost ... I enjoy watching TV again. Before Lost I surfed all the channels and went to bed sad because of my disappointment on TV, but I must say that Lost is my type of entertainment!']
