['Making a book in a movie by following the story page by page is NEVER a good idea. When people read the book, they automatically begin to create their own &quot;mental movie&quot; of what the characters look like, where they exist and how situations progress. And everyone&#39;s mental work is different, that&#39;s why when the &quot;REAL&quot; movie finally comes out, you&#39;re always going to have a segment of the audience that is disappointed that it&#39;s just not measured. above. <br /><br /> Everything a screenwriter and a director can hope to achieve is what their own vision of the film is and the hope that it will come as close as possible to what their audience expects to see. <br /><br /> There is no better case for this situation than movies based on Stephen King&#39;s novels. When filmmakers capture at least the essence of their stories, the results can be impressive and truly frightening (CARRIE, &#39;SALEM&#39;S LOT, THE DEAD ZONE), or they can be what fans consider a frightening disaster (Kubrick&#39;s version of THE SHINING, the miniseries for IT and THE TOMMYKNOCKERS). <br /><br /> Although it is not even close to being King&#39;s perfect adaptation, PET SEMATARY has so many moments of deep uneasiness that they seem to have bled on the screen directly from the book, that you can almost forgive their shortcomings. For that, we have to thank Mary Lambert, director of converted music video (she also directed SIESTA, which is not exactly a horror movie, but another that you should see on your list), working from a &quot;Man-Man&quot; script, and probably one of his best. <br /><br /> As most of you know the story, I will not put you to sleep with too many details. Dr. Louis Creed (Dale Midkiff) has moved his family to the perfect home in the country. Well, almost perfect, except for two unpleasant little details: the dangerously busy stretch of the interstate highway in the front, and the large pet cemetery in the woods in the back. Since Louis is a veterinarian and has a small child for a child ... well, even if you have not read the book, do the math. It&#39;s a King story, after all, so there&#39;s no mystery where it&#39;s going. <br /><br /> It is not so much destiny that counts here, but rather the creepy stops on the road. Certain scenes that are so familiar from the book are shrouded in a shivering, shrieking life: the horrifying memory of Rachel Creed (Denise Crosby of STAR TREK) of her sick and terminally ill sister; Louis&#39; encounters with death row runner Victor Pascow (Brad Greenquist), before and after his death; The trip to the &quot;other&quot; cemetery beyond the pet cemetery. And that third act ... if it does not give you some nightmares, maybe you should check your pulse. <br /><br /> The good performances of everyone here, especially the late Fred Gwynne as the well-meaning neighbor, Jud Crandall, who gets the best line in history that sums it up: &quot;Sometimes, dying is better.&quot; <br /><br /> The only problem with the film version is the casting of Louis&#39;s son, Gage (Miko Hughes). Knowing that it would be almost impossible to get the kind of performance needed from a child that age to seal the deal, Lambert and the crew still did the best they could, and unfortunately, Hughes at that time was too damn. &quot;sells&quot; his intended role as an evil zombie and possessed by demons. This takes you out of the movie every time it appears, although the scenes in which it appears are still masterfully organized (especially the scene of Gwynne&#39;s death). <br /><br /> Apart from that, everything else is still as good as possible. CARRIE still has the title of King&#39;s best adaptation as far as I&#39;m concerned; But SEMATARIO is up to the top five. <br /><br /> However, is anything frightening like reading the story anything adapted to the screen based on a King&#39;s book? It&#39;s not BLOODY likely ... for now.']
