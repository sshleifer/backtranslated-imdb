I must confess that I have not read the original story of M R James, although I have read many of his other supernatural tales. I have also seen most of the previous Christmas Ghost Stories of the BBC and this, in my opinion, outperforms most of them, only equating The Signalman. <br /> <br /> I can not really blame A View From a Hill - The direction and the "mood" are perfect, as is acting, lighting and, of course, history and writing. I really enjoyed this and I can only expect more from this quality from the same director and production team. I understand that the BBC plans to do more (not necessarily based on the stories of Mrs. James), so it is promising. <br /> <br /> 10/10
