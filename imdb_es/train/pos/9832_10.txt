Wow, this was a great Italian movie "ZOMBIE" by Luci Fulci ("ZOMBIE") and Bruno Mattie ("HELL OF THE LIVING LADING") Lucio started this movie and was sick, so the great Bruno took over and turned out Surprisingly better than I expected, so if you've seen "HELL OF THE LIVING LADING" (a hell) directed by Bruno Mattie and if you saw "ZOMBIE" directed by Lucio Fulci and you liked both or one of the themes, this is a movie that you should Look that has a great makeup of "ZOMBIE" that looks like a "ZOMBIES" has a funny flying head "ZOMBIE"! And "ZOMBIE" birds that spit acid and turn you into a "ZOMBIE" People) but they are mainly just the big toxic "ZOMBIES" as in Bruno Matties "HELL OF THE LIVING LADING". Therefore, if you like the Italian films "ZOMBIE" or the "ZOMBIE" movies in general, see this is a great Italian movie "zombie"!
