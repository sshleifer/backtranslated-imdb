He saw this movie on the last night of ENCW for the third or fourth time. I enjoyed it so much that I ordered the DVD. This really is a highlight and, of course, the first of the Mann-Stewart pairings. More here than the usual oater, although not as powerful as The Searchers. Much obvious symbolism about the achievement of manhood, but mainly it is the performance of Stewart, his partner Millard Mitchell, Shelly Winters and Waco Johnny Dean-Dan Duryea. Steve Miller (not the Joker) is interesting, since a handsome man would be a hero who is interested in Lola but also in yellow. Like Stewart in The Man Who Killed Liberty Valance, he is practically reduced to putting on an apron and serving coffee to his enemies. Decaffeinated without a doubt. Tony Curtis of the Bronx Cavalry and Rock Hudson behave like no Indian I've seen on the screen and have interesting cameos. Very low-grade western version of Rick's American Cafe. Nobody wants to spend the night there. Jay C. Flippens received a kiss from Lola (Winters) and has some nice scenes with Stewart before he gets to Bend of the River and Far Country. Will Geer as Wyatt Earp and the Indian boss who takes the teeth off Walter Brennan in Red River are nice sightings. This is the kind of western that only Stewart, not Wayne or Scott could have achieved. It's worth the shot, I repeat. :-)
