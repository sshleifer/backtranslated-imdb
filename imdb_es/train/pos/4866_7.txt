In the first place, in defense of JOAN FONTAINE, it must be said that Ginger Rogers would have been terribly evil like Alyce, the British girl who has the main role. Fontaine makes a striking image as the heroine here, but her inexperience in acting is bad and it is better that her dance is not mentioned. Fortunately, it happened to better things. <br /> <br /> But here are FRED ASTAIRE, GEORGE BURNS and GRACIE ALLEN who get the best turnover, and they are excellent. Burns & Allen fans will be amazed at how easily they fit into Astaire's dance routines. Especially interesting is the great routine of the house of fun that won the choreographer Hermes Pans and an Oscar. They join Astaire in what has to be the most creative highlight of the movie. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, you can not say much about the slow pace of the story, nor some of the obsolete situations that demand a lot of patience from the viewer. It must be said that part of the humor falls and the usual romantic misunderstandings that occur in any Fred Astaire film of this period receive a conventional treatment. Only musical interludes give the story the momentum it needs. <br /> <br /> Some nice melodies from Gershwin appear from time to time, but not all get the treatment they deserve. The sympathetic cast includes Reginald Gardiner, at his best in a brilliant comedic performance as a deceptive servant, Constance Collier and Montagu Love (as Joan's father was mistaken for a gardener for Astaire). <br /> <br /> He's a happy springer every time Burns and Allen are around to remind us how funny they were in their radio and television days. Both are surprisingly adept at keeping up with Astaire's leg work. <br /> <br /> Director George Stevens makes sure that Joan Fontaine's hillside dancing number with Fred is shot at a discreet distance, but the ingenious camera work can not disguise the fact that it's outside of her element as Astaire's dance partner, something that seems painfully conscious.
