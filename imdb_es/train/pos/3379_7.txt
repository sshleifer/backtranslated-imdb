In the 70s, Charlton Heston starred in science fiction films of variable quality. "Soylent Green" is one of the best. He plays Robert Thorn, a detective in 2022 New York. In this future, most foods are so expensive that everyone needs a product called Soylent Green. But when Thorn discovers the unpleasant truth about this product, he finds himself fleeing. <br /> <br /> I guess it's only natural that this movie seems dated to us today. But still, it still raises interesting questions about what will happen to our agriculture. Also starring Leigh Taylor-Young, Chuck Connors, Brock Peters, Joseph Cotten and Edward G. Robinson (in their final paper).
