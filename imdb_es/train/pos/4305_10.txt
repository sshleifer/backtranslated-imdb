The big canyon is a very strange bird. It is a completely unique urban piece, in which to relate the complete plot could not convey much. <br /> <br /> Its central theme seems to be the uncertainty inherent in the lives of the people of each race, background and season. But proclaim that THE theme of the film would be horribly underestimate its scope. In the same way, pigeon-holing it in a particular genre is useless. <br /> <br /> The movie has volumes to say, although it is likely to be different volumes for each viewer, and it says it all in such a non-predicative way from so many angles, that in the end, I can not even define its message central by myself. <br /> <br /> However, he does his business with such laser precision; All the accessories, the dialogue line and the background music bar contribute to your general mood and your powerful message, they surprise me pleasantly and I get very thoughtful after each viewing. Still nothing suffocating feels. A sparkling movie with a great cast and everything working.
