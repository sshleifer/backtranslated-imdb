This film is a bit unusual because it has a very thin plot and the film itself is done at a very slow and leisurely pace. While this makes it quite different from the average of Grant's film, it is still highly visible and entertaining. It is as if someone said "just follow Cary and see how he is disturbed by all the little problems that arise when you are rehabilitating a house". Considering how much fun your actor is in the movie and the great support you get from Myrna Loy and Melvin Douglas, the movie works really well. Although the film has quite modest pretensions, it makes the most of the material. It's a great movie for Cary Grant fans or for the whole family.
