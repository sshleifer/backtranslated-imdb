The title caught my attention and then I wondered what will happen in the plot, since we have seen many movies of "super people" in these years ... and in fact, I liked it a lot, since there were a series of unusual funny scenes I did not expect Uma Thurman served as an average in the role of G-Girl. Surprisingly, I was able to see his toes on the screen again (as at the beginning of Kill Bill). Luke Wilson, however, played very well with the everyday idiot who knows the big woman, could really get into his situation. If you want a light touch of fun, you should definitely see the adventures of G-Girl and Matt as average, especially to encourage your partner. 7/10 in my collection.
