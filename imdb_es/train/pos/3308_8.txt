The power of Kangwon Province is the second effort of director Hong Sang-Soo and clearly much of what began in his previous film returns in this film, including the multiple narrations connected (in this case, two) and the stories of problems or concerns. Relationships, as well as a potent dose of irony. <br /> <br /> One thing that is clearly reduced from his previous work is fantasy flights that include elements of surrealism. However, this film also contains a single moment of surrealism that contrasts with the otherwise quite realistic representation found in it. The two stories follow a young woman who travels to Kangwon province with her friends, only to meet a stranger, the second about a man who also travels to Kangwon province with his friend and struggles with their relationship . problems. <br /> <br /> Again, Hong shows a great understanding of irony and defects in human nature and, however, I do not think he is entirely insensitive when it comes to his characters, attracting enough compassion to compensate Critics draw them with their irony. I think what I like about Hong's films is that they feel so real, especially complex and conflicting characters. It does not mean that each person is a hypocrite or that he suffers from confused feelings, but that these characters, he and the actors present, feel fully developed and credible. <br /> <br /> This is not a film that advances at a great speed. There is a lot of persistence and, like in the previous movie, things do not always connect immediately, so patience is worth it and surprisingly. There does not seem to be any element of the movie that is not intentionally placed in the film and it has made me a little hyperconscious of several seemingly extra characters as they creep into the mix as the movie progresses. <Br /> <br /> Power is an excellent film that manages to inject a level of personal emotion, repentance, longing for a story that highlights the irony and fallibility of human decision making. It's a pretty difficult balance to maintain and it's amazing how Hong manages to achieve it twice in a row. The values ​​of technical production have improved greatly since the first film and the direction have become stable and clear. This film does not have the same emotional touch as the first one, but it gains a lot in its assured exploration and refinement really helps to harden the overall vision. Great vision for lovers of art cinema. 8/10.
