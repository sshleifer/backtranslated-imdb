Just the kind of movie that I love. Some very good British actors, as well as the only Sharon Stone. Catherine Tramell (Stone) masterfully manipulates the life of a well-educated group of people, playing with her weaknesses to gather experiences and write a murder mystery book. She plays the female psychopath pretty well while using her broad sexual appeal to convincingly portray what could be considered one of the most important black widows. Tramell is accustomed to dark places in society and participates freely in sadomasochistic adventures on the side of 'never visit after dark' of the city. From the beginning, there is nothing less than an R rating here only from the dialogue. Stone could also be described as a kind of Hannibal Lecter woman, a woman without emotions and without the meal plan.
