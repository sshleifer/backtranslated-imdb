Having seen The Deer Hunter, which is a masterpiece, the Jacknife movie had great shoes to fill. It has the same themes as The Deer Hunter, the devastating effects on a person after the Vietnam War. In this film, Robert De Niro, as in The Deer Hunter and is very good here, as is Kathy Baker. But this movie belongs to Ed Harris, who provides a powerful, emotional and powerful performance. The movie is based on a play, and there are one or two scenes. where it seemed obvious to me. By that I mean that for those one or two scenes I felt like I was watching a play. That was not so serious, and it does not really diminish the movie. I really liked it. This movie is not an epic like The Deer Hunter. It is a similar era and they have similar themes, but they are two very different films. I think The Deer Hunter was great, and I also think that this movie was great. It's the acting. in this one that makes it so cool. For me, Jacknife is a 10/10
