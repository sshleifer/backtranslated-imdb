The first time I saw this video was 15 years ago. I thought it was excellent then and I still do it. I am a former English teacher (high school and university) and a lover of English romantic poetry, so Coleridge has a high qualification for me. Anything that could detract from the beauty of the poem or the power of history would not get my vote of excellence. In this case, everything works well to attract the viewer, especially the high school students. The story is well illustrated for a generation that grew up on television. In addition, the voice of Michael Redgrave adds a sense of authenticity and authority. Well, then there was not a big budget for the project. So it was not Star Wars and there is no CGI in it. But who can discard Gustave Dor√©'s illustrations as part of the presentation? The previous comment, which in only four lines discards the video as a piece of garbage, is extremely unfair and is not perceptive. I am a friend of the producer, but that is not my reason for this comment. Rather, I am defending a work of art that I believe has value at all levels. It is well suited to bring Coleridge's poem to students in a way that awakens their appreciation for him and awakens his compassion for the lesson taught by the ancient sailor.
