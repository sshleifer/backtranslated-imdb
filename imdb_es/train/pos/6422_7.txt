Military training films are becoming so common that they are becoming a genre in and of themselves. Among the most prominent we have, `Officer and a Gentleman ',` Top Gun', `GI Jane 'and now` Men of Honor'. The fact that this is true does not change the fact that the formula is the same. This movie is probably more like `GI Jane ', since it focuses on the angle of disaggregation. <br /> <br /> Actually, the story is quite inspiring and is probably the best human interest story among those mentioned above. Carl Brashear (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) is undoubtedly a man of great courage and principles, and his strength of character shines brightly in this film. Unfortunately, director George Tillman has a tunnel vision when presenting the characters and avoids the development of the character of several different Brashear characters in favor of showing Brashear in a constant state of adversity. Billy Sunday (Robert De Niro) is a central figure and, except for the opening scene, the fist fight and a couple of scenes with his wife, we do not know much about him. For example, Brashear sees the scars on the palms of Sunday and we must assume that he worked on a plow, but there is no follow-up on that point. Mr. Pappy (Hal Holbrook) has only one short scene by which we can judge him. The rest of the time on the screen shows him walking and ranting. If a director is going to make a story of human interest, he needs to humanize the characters. <br /> <br /> Cuba Gooding Jr. offers an excellent performance as Brashear. This is probably the best I've seen. This is a role and a character that is much more complete than any other role I have played before, and rises to the occasion. In `Jerry Maguire ', Rod Tidwell was a fascinating character, but one-dimensional, with the depth of a puddle of rain. Brashear is much more complex and well-founded, and the problems it faces are the crises of life, which makes the part much more difficult. This is an excellent recovery of Gooding's last role in 'Chill Factor', a film so frightening that it was almost an act of professional suicide to participate. <br /> <br /> After a season trying his hand as a comedian. ("Analyze This," "The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle," "Meet The Parents"), Robert DeNiro returns to his dramatic roots with outstanding performance. DeNiro is not a bad comedian, he is such a great dramatic actor that it seems that he should not waste his time doing comedy. DeNiro gives Billy Sunday a rock-hard personality about a tortured soul. It's a pleasure to see him work. <br /> <br /> It seems that every movie I see lately has Charlize Theron in it. I saw 'The Legend of Bagger Vance', 'Men of Honor' and 'The Yards' in a row and I was beginning to wonder if she had a role in each movie in 2000 (actually, she only made five). This was a minor role for Theron, but he got along well and managed to stay with DeNiro step by step. David Keith, who co-starred with Richard Gere in "Officer and a Gentleman," has a cameo here. <br /> <br /> The DVD has some interesting special features, including reflections of the real Carl Brashear and some deleted scenes. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this movie despite the trite plot and the one-dimensional presentation. I rated it with a 7/10. I do not like the stories of losers and I like stories in which the strength of character is the central theme. This film is particularly strong in both areas and brings us two memorable acting performances that make up for some of the director's shortcomings.
