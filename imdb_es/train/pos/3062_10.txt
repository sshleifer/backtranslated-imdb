I saw this movie a few months ago on cable, and it was fantastic. William H Macy is one of my favorite actors, and his performance was amazing. It makes you worry about your character, even when he is clearly doing the wrong thing, and Neve Campbell offers a performance that is undoubtedly the best performance an actress has seen this year. She is fantastic as a wild young woman who is wise beyond her years. <br /> <br /> Donald Sutherland is simply creepy like Macy's father, and John Ritter is fine as a shrink caught in the middle of everything that is happening. . <br /> <br /> I would like this to be in the theater because I feel it is a movie that should be seen by a wider audience. It's a shame, because it's much better than most of the new movies that enter the theater now. <br /> <br />
