The most anticipated film of the year 2002. After three and a half years of hibernation, Rajini acted in this film. The enthusiasm for this movie was too high. <br /> <br /> This is not a typical Rajini movie, in this movie he also gives some spiritual messages. But it also includes typical Rajini actions, style, songs, etc. It's a good entertaining movie and it also gives good messages. <br /> <br /> I will qualify this movie as Good instead of Excellent because of the script. It is a must see the movie. Do not miss it!
