['Rock n &#39;roll is a messy business and DiG! Show this masterfully. A project of serious ambition, and perhaps reckless, the filmmaker is able to repair seven tumultuous years of following two difficult rock groups to manage. That said, the abundance of quality material guarantees the ability of the film to captivate the audience. If you have ever been interested in any area of the music industry, this film will undoubtedly be a fascinating projection. The music in the film, although it suffers minimally from the cut and paste requirements, is worth the ticket price alone. The next morning I saw DiG! I went straight to the record store to pick up a Massacre album by Brian Jonestown (I was already started with the sounds of Dandy Warhols). Defined mainly by his exploration of rock music, the film succeeds in other deep levels. Dig! it is a sincere and sufficiently objective look at the destructive and unstable nature of the creative process and the people who try to refute these forces.']
