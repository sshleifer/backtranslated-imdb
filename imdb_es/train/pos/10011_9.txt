I really enjoyed The Night Listener. It is one of the best movies of the summer. <br /> <br /> Robin Williams offers one of his best performances. In fact, the whole cast was very good. Everyone played the right notes for their characters, neither too much nor too little. Sandra Oh adds a wonderful comic touch. Toni Collette is as good as mom, and never overlooks. They are all very credible. <br /> <br /> It's a short film, of just under an hour and a half. I noticed that the general release version is nine minutes shorter than the Sundance version. I wonder if some of the most disturbing images were removed from the movie. <br /> <br /> The director told a story and did it directly, which is a refreshing change for many directors these days who seem to think they are the job is to impress the audience instead of telling a story and tell it well. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by previews and announcements. It's not a Hitchcock thriller. See The Night Listener because you want to see a good story well told. If you expect Hitchcock to feel disappointed. <br /> <br /> My only complaint with the movie was the ending. The director could have left a little more to the imagination of the audience, but this is a minor issue.
