Easily the best low budget horror movie of all time. The first time I saw this movie was when I was about nine years old, and I have to say it scared me so much. However, now that I've grown up, I see this movie for what it really is ... a work of genius. Everyone, or at least everyone who has a taste, has dreamed of seeing a snowman spinning around killing people, even if they do not admit it. I have always found something genuinely frightening in snowmen, so, of course, for a horror addict like me, this cinema was a dream come true. Some people say that this movie is silly or, otherwise, lacks intelligence ... it's a movie about a serial killer snowman, what the hell did you expect? Anyone who has given this film a low score is obviously too tense to sit down and laugh at the great phrases and cheap gore. I love this movie for what it is, a comedy, and until the film industry shows up and makes a great horror movie about a killer snowman (which seems impossible, unfortunately), I will always hold this great piece of indie horror by from my heart. .
