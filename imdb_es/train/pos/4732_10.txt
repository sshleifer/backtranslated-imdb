I'm not a big fan of martial arts movies, but the video store was almost empty and Jet Li was in Lethal Weapon 4 and I got it for free when the other movies I had rented, anyway, I rented them. I loved it, my roommate and I (22-year-old students of Biochemistry and Accounting) spent half an hour after the movie making weird Kung Fu noises and throwing beermat shurikens. I can not explain it (well maybe a little tequila). I never enjoyed Bruce Lee, the skinny guy kicking the big guy, hitting him, kicking the biggest guy, etc., at the end of the movie. Think of Jackie Chan with a little less comedy and more action.
