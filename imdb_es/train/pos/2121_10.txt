This is a beautiful movie that is performed wonderfully by all players. It will make you laugh and it will make you cry. The end of the film confuses me every time. If you want to see a great movie, here it is. Jimmy Stewert offers a wonderfully witty performance and Frank Morgan as Mr. Matuschek is fascinating. Morgan's character diversity is amazing. William Tracy as Pepi is a great comic relief and offers some of the most important lines and performances of cinema. Felix Bressart offers a fantastic performance as Perovitch, a clumsy shop worker whose ambition of life is to please those with whom he works. It's a simple story of how close co-workers can become and how two people who have great animosity fall in love through unusual circumstances.
