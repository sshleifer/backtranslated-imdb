Greetings again from the darkness. This will be compared to "The Princess Bride" and, although it is not up to that classic, it is extremely entertaining and well done in its own right. The story is a little strange and the whole issue of the wall is never really explained, but the execution is fine, even accumulating a strong suspense. <br /> <br /> Charlie Cox plays Tristan, who falls in love with the wrong girl (Sienna Miller), and promises to find him a fallen star ... played by the impressive Claire Danes. There is not much suspense about what happens with these two, but the suspense part comes with the wicked witch played by Michelle Pfeiffer and the son prince of King Peter O'Toole that seeks to recover the ruby ​​necklace worn by our "star". A lot of bad guys chasing the good guys. <br /> <br /> On the way, an encounter with the strangest pirate you'll see (including any from the Caribbean). Robert Deniro plays Captain Shakespeare: hard on the inside, and we must say in touch with his feminine side. Another encounter involves the brilliant Ricky Gervais as a merchant who speaks fast and that's good for a couple of laughs. <br /> <br /> It's not your typical pursuit, coming of age or the fantasy movie, but director Matthew Vaughn ("Layer Pastel") effort deserves an audience. Unfortunately, the bad marketing campaign will probably prevent you from making money. I suppose you will find great success in the video.
