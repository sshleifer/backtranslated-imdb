An unconventional and quite entertaining sleeper with respect to two very different brothers who are not only the so-called "fire initiators" (think of the Stephen King snoring festival from a book with the same name), but also forever disagree each other on a woman who has a rather unpleasant habit of being an arsonist! The good special effects (especially towards the end), the extravagant performances of a trio of quite talented actors and topped by a really interesting and strangely appropriate soundtrack make "Wilder Napalm" a unique gift from a movie to see ... if you can find, that's it! On a personal note, I was lucky to snatch it (so to speak) from the two-dollar container at my local video rental store. (*** outside *****)
