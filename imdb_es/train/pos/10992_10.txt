Damn, I've seen this movie at least 4 times and I'm still not bored to see it. <br /> <br /> The images are very good and, together with the music, it is totally incredible and perfect. This movie is amazing for me. <br /> <br /> The CGI are pretty bad, in my humble opinion, but all the visual elements with the feeling in black and white about it and the completely sterile interiors were simply ... simply a perfect genius Combination for such movie. All the feeling about the feeling is indescribable, the plot is very good. <br /> <br /> However, although the film had small flaws, like for example I sometimes thought that the film was a little "slow", but I do not mean the scenic parts, that's why I loved those. <br /> <br /> I also got very distracted with the totally complex story, like when he is in the underground bunker of Digicorps, where all his data is stored, and he has this conversation with the guy who is down there ... but it can also be me: D And the end could have been shown in some way more emphasized, should have made the recovery part of the true memory a little longer and "stronger", but again, without all these defects, the The movie would have been so good that I would never have stopped watching it again and again ...
