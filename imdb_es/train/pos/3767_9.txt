Return to page ten of this review section and go back to work. Ahead; I'll wait. <br /> <br /> Done? Well, then you probably noticed the same tendency as me. You could argue all day about the jokes, the past tense and obviously points derived from the plot and the tricks in 'Bogus', but this movie seems to be one of those 'hate now, love me later' movies. <br /> < Bill and Ted's biggest problem was that the original attracted children of the 80s who followed the trends and considered themselves at the forefront of fashion, which worked well for the original, but obviously was bombed in 1991, when there is no one He would be caught dead using anything that was not flannel or admit that he liked something from the 80's. As Ted would say: "Friend, this is a totally deep hole. Do you want to play 20 questions? "<br /> <br /> They say that nostalgia goes in cycles of 20 years, and certainly that seems to be the case here, here in 2010, those of use that grew with Cindi Lauper and Megadeth are beginning to look back and appreciate some of those fundamental movies that (like it or not) made us who we are, if you are one of those who see 'Bogus' as if it were an obsolete scam ("Fa gs!"), then you are losing the point and you probably passed six years growing facial hair, wearing flannel and looking like you've just gotten out of bed. <br /> <br /> By referring to yourself to your own origins (the Star Trek episode) and and traveling back in time with A telephone booth, B & T makes no attempt to hide the love of its creators for the tribute Quentin Tarantino, someone? I'm not saying that 'Bogus' is 'True Love', but I do believe that it should be appreciated for what it is: a funny snapshot of our society at a time before the psycholo child, Ritalin, anti-smoking ads, terrorist paranoia and the proliferation of fear of the media. <br /> <br /> So, for all of you who hate B & T ... turn off your Screaming Trees CD, remove that hair from your face, go to the beach and clear up. Narcissistic depression and intellectual tedium are so corporate.
