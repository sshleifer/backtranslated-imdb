['Although the film is clearly dated, the public can still easily identify with the plight of the hapless Buster in this timeless and very funny story. Buster fights against unkind odds in three different ages: the Stone Age, the Roman Age and the Modern Age, playing almost the same character with only a change of scenery to help us identify the different &quot;ages&quot;. In this film we see one of the first comic representations of the &quot;caveman&quot; stereotype, who wins his love not for romance but for brute force, as well as a funny turn in the Roman gladiatorial combat, two comic sketches that precede such simulations as &quot;The History of the World: Part I&quot; by Mel Brooks. The underlying theme of the film is simple but compelling: although times may have changed, we still face the same struggles even in modern times we fought in prehistoric times in order to &quot;win the girl&quot; (keep in mind this is the theme of the America of 1923, a time when chauvinism was still in vogue). It&#39;s interesting to watch this movie more than eighty years later, and consider how dramatically things have changed since the &quot;modern times&quot; of this movie so far.']
