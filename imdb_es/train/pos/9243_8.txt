Do not listen to the many scathing and mocking comments that accumulate in this movie ... simply, in regards to ninja movies, this is the best thing for my friends! <br /> <br /> Yes, it's silly, yes, the acting and the script are absolutely atrocious, but, in general, it's a lot of fun! In fact, as is often the case with B-Movies, the horrific "performance" (which in the case of the film in question, is truly one of the worst I've had the joy of contemplating!) And the ridiculous "argument" in reality it only serves to raise the level of enjoyment ten times. <br /> <br /> Obviously, the fight scenes are the main attraction in this, and in general I am pleased to say that they are very well choreographed, especially the final showdown (during which we witness that the ninjas are apparently not limited by the normal laws of gravity ...) <br /> <br /> Trust me, if you are a fan of ninja movies and you have not done it yet. seen Sakura Killers, then you really are missing what, in my opinion, is one of the true gems of the crown of the genre.
