This is a very memorable western spaghetti. It has a great history, interesting characters and some very good performances, especially of Rosalba Neri. Her role as the evil villain in this movie is truly classic. He steals all the scenes he is in and expresses a lot with his face and eyes, even when he is not talking. His performance is very credible. He manages to be quite fascinating without exaggerating (not that there is anything wrong with being up). Mark Damon is also surprisingly good at this movie. <br /> <br /> The music is excellent, and the theme is the type that will play in your head constantly for days after watching the movie, whether you want it. for or not There are a couple of parts that are very fun. I especially like the part where Rosalba Neri is naked in front of the parrot. There are also many sets of pistols that are very well made. <br /> <br /> I would probably have given this movie 8 or 9 stars if it were not for two things. The first is a silly fight in the bar room that occurs approximately 25 minutes in the movie. This is one of the most ridiculous looking fights I've seen in a movie. It has a very poor choreography and is more like a dance number of a musical evil than any kind of real fight. One could overlook it if it was a Terence Hill / Bud Spencer comedy, but this is a more serious western, and the fight really needed to be more realistic. The other thing that bothered me about this movie was Yuma's cowardly Mexican partner. I guess it was supposed to be comic relief or something, but the character was just stupid and unnecessary in a movie like this, and it was not funny at all. All I can say is where is Tuco when you need it? <br /> <br /> Having said all of this, let me assure everyone to read this that Johnny Yuma is a spaghetti western classic despite the flaws I mentioned, and that all fans of the genre need to watch this movie.
