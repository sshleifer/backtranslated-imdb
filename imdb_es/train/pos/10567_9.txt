A marvel. One of the best musicals of all time. The three numbers of Busby Berkely that end the film are spectacular, but what makes this film so wonderful is the incredible pounding and natural acting of Cagney and Blondell. (Keeler is also charming, although she may not have been a great actress). There is a freshness in the film that is not seen in the movies of today, much less in the films of the 30s, usually underdeveloped, although the plot, which involves the creation of film prologues, It is quite dated.
