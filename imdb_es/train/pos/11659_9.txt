This animated feature film (a co-production between Ireland, Belgium and France) deals with what is surely one of the strangest themes for a film: the creation in the ninth century of a famous illuminated manuscript, the book of Kells. In this fantastic account of that story, a prepubert named Brendan, who lives in a monastery ruled by his uncle, a stern abbot who is preoccupied with preparing the abbey's defenses for the imminent attack of the feared Vikings, must enter the forbidden environment. Forest to find the materials that a master illuminator named Aidan needs to finish the book. To do that task, in the forest, unexpectedly, he finds the help of a friendly fairy named Aisling. Drawn by hand in a magnificent and delicate way (there is computer animation in some key passages) in a way that wants to resemble both medieval and traditional Celtic. Art, and with a very creative use of color and all kinds of geometric shapes, this film is implacably strange, but it is a good stranger, not of the unpleasant variety but of the type of eye opening. If one were nitpick, beyond some anachronisms, like an African monk in the 9th century Ireland? One should say that the mixture of Catholic mysticism with Celtic paganism in this film never really fuses. And the comic relief is sometimes a bit too broad. That's why I can not give you the highest rating. But these are minor problems with an otherwise charming and magnificently imaginative film.
