I've seen the trailer for this movie several times, and I must say that it seems that Ned Kelly is going to be a wonderful movie. When I saw the trailer for the first time, I could not look away from it (it caught my attention). Heath Ledger adheres to what he knows and what works for him, period pieces. Not to mention Orlando Bloom, who is seen for a fraction of a second, looks fantastic. I think this movie will be a success, and it will be seen again and again by many of my people.
