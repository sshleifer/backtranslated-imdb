['Although I am not a big fan of musicals, I have loved the films of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers because they are so much fun. Sure, they can be a bit formulated, but even though you KNOW what&#39;s going to happen, they&#39;re still very nice to watch. However, despite this, I was a little disappointed with this outing. Part of this was because this movie does not have the wonderful cast of support as you saw in TOP HAT or SHALL WE DANCE. Without Edward Everett Horton or Eric Blore, the film seems to be missing, especially in the &quot;fun&quot; department. The silly antics of these secondary actors gave charm to the other films that you simply do not get with FOLLOW THE FLEET. Also, unlike the usual character played by Astaire, this is more stupid, since his fat head gets Rogers into trouble again and again. And, as a result, it&#39;s much harder to like or want to see them meet at the end of the movie. Also, although the music is by Irving Berlin, the songs do not seem so memorable. In fact, none of the songs was so special and I can not remember any of them even though I just watched the movie. While this is still a cute and worthwhile movie, it just lacks the brightness and magic of some of his other movies. Good but far from great.']
