Much richer in texture and character than even the classics of the 30s and 50s. George C. Scott was born to be Scrooge, just as he was born to be Patton. Mr. Scott will be known as one of the best actors of the 20th century. The character of Scrooge played by Mr. Scott seemed to jump off the screen. Scott as Scrooge brought to the screen a Scrooge richer, more robust and more deeply moving than any of his predecessors in the role of the meanest man in eighteenth-century London. Mr. Scott seemed to take Scrooge to a more personal, understandable but highly conflictive level; his role played with the great authority that Scott always brought to the screen: however, his usual warlike voice sometimes became a whisper, almost like a soliloquy, as he scolded the Christmas holidays in a sigh, but revealed his own human frailty in its next line I could portray Scrooge as sour and crunchy, and a Scrooge misunderstood and understanding in the same scene. <br /> <br /> Truly a remarkable performance by a giant of his generation.
