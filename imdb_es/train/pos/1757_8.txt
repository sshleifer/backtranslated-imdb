The key to the 40-year-old Virgin is not simply that Andy Stitzer is a 40-year-old virgin, but the way Steve Carell presents him as such. In a sort of coarse "comedy" that has been characterized by its lack of humor and captivating characters, The 40-Old Old Virgin offers a colorful cast and an intelligent and sincere script that does not use its protagonist as the butt end. Of cruel jokes. That Andy is still a virgin at forty is not so much a joke, in fact, as a curiosity. <br /> <br /> Carell, a Ferrell Team veteran at Anchorman and a former member of the Daily Show. Do you use the concept of the film to expand your character? We understand why Andy is the way he is. It's the little things that make this movie work. When Andy's co-worker at an electronics store asks him what he did over the weekend, Andy describes his failed efforts in the kitchen. When Andy rides his bicycle to work, he points out his turns. Does not he just decorate his house with action figures? he paints them, talks to them and reveals that some of the really old ones have belonged to him since childhood. A minor comedy would not even begin to focus on all of these things. <br /> <br /> Is the plot quite simplistic? Andy's co-workers discover that he has never had sex and they make a personal search for him to sleep with a woman. It is a childish idea and the film does not try to hide its youth. <br /> <br /> Andy's friends are a complement to his neurotic nature: David (Paul Rudd) has broken up with his girlfriend more than two years ago, but is still obsessed with her, Jay (Romany Malco) is a very feminine man and Cal (Seth Rogen) is a tattooed sex addict. His attempts to put Andy in the counterproductive sack several times, and each time leaves Andy feeling less and less optimistic. <br /> <br /> Finally, Andy meets single mother Trish (played by Catherine Keener) and, much to the chagrin of his worried friends who claim that mothers are not worth it, he falls in love with her. Do they start a relationship and agree to postpone having sex for twenty days? Trish did not know that Andy was still a virgin. <br /> <br /> The 40-year-old Virgin was directed by Judd Apatow, the man who produced Anchorman and The Cable Guy, and started the short cult television show. Rare and nerds. Apatow is famous for his unique sense of humor, and the script? co-written by Carell ?? offers a lot <br /> <br /> However, in the end, the most interesting and (admittedly surprising) aspect of the 40-year-old Virgin is her maturity. By now, you probably already know that the film received enthusiastic reviews from critics, and I was even surprised by your warm welcome. But after watching the movie, it's easy to understand why. We like Andy. We care about him. Is not it just a clich√© of sexual comedy of cardboard cut? He is a real person, alive, who breathes. His neurotic traits combine the best of Woody Allen with childish ingenuity. His friends are not nasty assholes and their romance is tumultuous and bittersweet. It is a chord with the audience. <br /> <br /> Although this is far from being a perfect movie and definitely contains a fairly crude insinuation and sexual humor, it does not offend insofar as other gender entries may have Because we have affection for the people on the screen. The best sex comedies work in this way? From Risky Business to American Pie? and that is the main difference between something like the Virgin of 40 years and 40 days and 40 nights.
