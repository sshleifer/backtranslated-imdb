BORN TO BOOGIE is a true 'find': although he was a rock fan for almost thirty years, I only saw the film for the first time a few days ago, and placed it among the best rock films of all time; the fantastic music (the T. Rex cream) and the visual elements are always exciting and unusual, which leaves this viewer looking forward to more efforts from previous directors of Ringo Starr, who did an excellent job here. If you like music, you will be at T. Rextasy at all times, since Marc Bolan really is the star of the piece, front and center. Even the fact that some songs are repeated does not matter a bit: different scenarios, costumes, musical arrangements and strange visual concepts are used to lend different textures and a lot of happy humor to what could have ended as 'solo' A concert movie in other hands As rich and full as BORN TO BOOGIE is, the film only lasts an hour, but what is there is totally satisfying. That's my only criticism: the video package says something like 71 minutes, and at least one online source claims that the movie lasts 67 minutes, but apparently it's more like 61 minutes of rock fun.
